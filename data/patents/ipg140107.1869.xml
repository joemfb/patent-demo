<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A spinal facet fusion implant includes an elongated main body having a distal end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis extending between the distal end and the proximal end. The main body has a cross-sectional profile characterized by a primary axis and a secondary axis. At least one stabilizer extends radially outwardly from the main body in the secondary axis. The main body has a length along the primary axis that is less than the combined width of the spinal facets making up a facet joint. The stabilizer has a width that is sized to make a press fit into the gap between the spinal facets making up a facet joint.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to surgical methods and apparatus in general, and more particularly to surgical methods and apparatus for fusing spinal facets.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disc herniation is a condition where a spinal disc bulges from between two vertebral bodies and impinges on adjacent nerves, thereby causing pain. The current standard of care for surgically treating disc herniation in patients who have chronic pain and who have (or are likely to develop) associated spinal instability is spinal fixation. Spinal fixation procedures are intended to relieve the impingement on the nerves by removing the portion of the disc and/or bone responsible for compressing the neural structures and destabilizing the spine. The excised disc or bone is replaced with one or more intervertebral implants, or spacers, placed between the adjacent vertebral bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some cases, the spinal fixation leaves the affected spinal segment unstable. In this case, the spinal facets (i.e., the bony fins extending upwardly and downwardly from the rear of each vertebral body) can disengage with one another. The disengagement of the spinal facets can cause substantial pain to the patient. Furthermore, when left untreated, such disengagement of the spinal facets can result in the degeneration of the cartilage located between opposing facet surfaces, ultimately resulting in osteoarthritis, which can in turn lead to worsening pain for the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, where the patient suffers from spinal instability, it can be helpful to stabilize the facet joints as well as the vertebral bodies. The facet joints are frequently stabilized by fusing the spinal facets in position relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to providing stability, fusing the spinal facets can also be beneficial in other situations as well. By way of example but not limitation, osteoarthritis (a condition involving the degeneration, or wearing away, of the cartilage at the end of bones) frequently occurs in the facet joints. The prescribed treatment for osteoarthritis disorders depends on the location, severity and duration of the disorder. In some cases, non-operative procedures (including bed rest, medication, lifestyle modifications, exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic care and steroid injections) may be satisfactory treatment. However, in other cases, surgical intervention may be necessary. In cases where surgical intervention is prescribed, spinal facet fusion may be desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A minimally-invasive, percutaneous approach for fusing spinal facets was proposed by Stein et al. (&#x201c;Stein&#x201d;) in 1993. The Stein approach involved using a conical plug, made from cortical bone and disposed in a hole formed intermediate the spinal facet joint, to facilitate the fusing of opposing facet surfaces. However, the clinical success of this approach was limited. This is believed to be because the Stein approach did not adequately restrict facet motion. In particular, it is believed that movement of Stein's conical plug within its hole permitted unwanted facet movement to occur, thereby undermining facet fusion. Furthermore, the Stein approach also suffered from plug failure and plug migration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus there is a need for a new and improved approach for effecting spinal facet fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in view of the art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made, it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in the field of this invention how the shortcomings of the prior art could be overcome.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The long-standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for improved devices and methods for effecting spinal facet fusion is now met by a new, useful, and nonobvious invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The novel method and apparatus for effecting spinal facet fusion includes a novel spinal facet fusion implant for disposition between opposing articular surfaces of a facet joint to immobilize the facet joint and facilitate fusion between the opposing facets.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">More particularly, in one form of the present invention, there is provided a spinal facet fusion implant that includes an elongated body having a distal end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis extending between the distal end and the proximal end. The elongated body has a cross-sectional profile characterized by a primary axis and a secondary axis; and at least one stabilizer extends radially outwardly from the elongated body in the secondary axis.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The elongated body has a length along the primary axis that is less than the combined width of the spinal facets making up a facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The at least one stabilizer has a width which is sized to make a press fit into the gap between the spinal facets making up a facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A method for fusing a spinal facet joint includes the steps of providing a spinal facet fusion implant having an elongated body having a distal end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis extending between the distal end and the proximal end. The method further includes the steps of providing the elongated body with a cross-sectional profile characterized by a primary axis and a secondary axis and providing at least one stabilizer that extends radially outwardly from the elongated body in the secondary axis.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method steps further include the steps of forming the elongated body so that it has a length along the primary axis which is less than the combined width of the spinal facets making up a facet joint and forming the at least one stabilizer so that it has a width which is sized to make a press fit into the gap between the spinal facets making up a facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further method steps include the steps of deploying the spinal facet fusion implant in the facet joint so that the elongated body is simultaneously positioned within both of the facets of the facet joint and so that the at least one stabilizer is positioned within the gap between the spinal facets and maintaining the spinal facet fusion implant in such position while fusion occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment, a spinal facet fusion implant includes an elongated body having a distal end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis extending between the distal end and the proximal end, the elongated body having a cross-sectional profile which is characterized by a primary axis and a secondary axis.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The elongated body has a length along the primary axis which is less than the combined width of the spinal facets making up a facet joint and the cross-sectional profile is non-circular.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In yet another embodiment, a method for fusing a spinal facet joint includes the steps of providing a spinal facet fusion implant having an elongated body having a distal end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis extending between the distal end and the proximal end, the elongated body having a cross-sectional profile which is characterized by a primary axis and a secondary axis and forming the elongated body so that it has a length along the primary axis which is less than the combined width of the spinal facets making up a facet joint and further providing a non-circular cross-sectional profile.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further steps include deploying the spinal facet fusion implant in the facet joint so that the elongated body is simultaneously positioned within both of the facets of the facet joint and maintaining the spinal facet fusion implant in such position while fusion occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In still another embodiment, a joint fusion implant includes an elongated body having a distal end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis extending between the distal end and the proximal end, the elongated body having a cross-sectional profile characterized by a primary axis and a secondary axis and at least one stabilizer extending radially outwardly from the elongated body in the secondary axis.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The elongated body has a length along the primary axis which is less than the combined width of the bones making up the joint and the at least one stabilizer has a width which is sized to make a press fit into the gap between the bones making up the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another embodiment, a method for fusing a joint includes the steps of providing a fusion implant that includes an elongated body having a distal end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis extending between the distal end and the proximal end, the elongated body having a cross-sectional profile characterized by a primary axis and a secondary axis and at least one stabilizer extending radially outwardly from the elongated body in the secondary axis.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further steps include forming the elongated body so that it has a length along the primary axis which is less than the combined width of the bones making up the joint and forming the at least one stabilizer so that it has a width which is sized to make a press fit into the gap between the bones making up the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Still further steps include deploying the fusion implant in the joint so that the elongated body is simultaneously positioned within both of the bones of the joint and the at least one stabilizer is positioned within the gap between the bones and maintaining the fusion implant in such position while fusion occurs.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-C</figref>, the novel spinal facet fusion implant is denoted <b>10</b> as a whole. Fusion implant <b>10</b> includes main body <b>12</b> and at least one stabilizer fin <b>14</b>. The illustrated embodiment includes first stabilizer fin <b>14</b><i>a </i>and second stabilizer fin <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Body <b>10</b> is an elongated element having structural integrity. The distal end of main body <b>12</b> and the distal end of stabilizers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>are chamfered as at <b>16</b> to facilitate insertion of fusion implant <b>10</b> into the facet joint as disclosed hereinafter. Body <b>12</b> preferably has a rounded rectangular cross-section, an ovoid cross-section, a laterally-extended cross-section, or some other non-round cross-section to inhibit rotation of main body <b>12</b> about a longitudinal center axis.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Fusion implant <b>10</b> is intended to be inserted into a facet joint using a posterior approach. The posterior approach is familiar to spine surgeons, thereby providing an increased level of comfort for the surgeon, and also minimizing the possibility of damage to the spinal cord during fusion implant insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Stabilizer fins <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>are received in a gap located between opposing facet surfaces to prevent rotation of fusion implant <b>10</b> within the facet joint. Stabilizers <b>14</b><i>a </i>is formed in and extends along the upper surface of main body <b>12</b> and stabilizer <b>14</b><i>b </i>is formed in and extends along the lower surface of main body <b>12</b>. Stabilizers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>preferably have a width just slightly larger than the gap between the opposing articular surfaces of a facet joint so that the stabilizers fit snugly therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The distal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of main body <b>12</b><i>a </i>has a greater thickness than proximal end <b>12</b><i>b </i>of said main body, there being transversely disposed step <b>12</b><i>c </i>therebetween. The greater thickness of said distal end supports the load for a long period of time. If said distal end <b>12</b><i>a </i>of main body <b>12</b> is eventually crushed, it becomes flush with proximal end <b>12</b><i>b </i>and fusion implant <b>10</b> continues to perform its function.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref> has an inverse taper formed in main body <b>12</b> and in stabilizer fins <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>to prevent migration of implant <b>10</b>. As perhaps best understood in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, fin <b>14</b><i>a </i>is wider at its distal end than at its proximal end; fin <b>14</b><i>b </i>has the same structure. This wedge shape prevents distal-to-proximal travel of implant <b>10</b>. This eliminates the need for teeth that perform the same function.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> differs from the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref> in that main body <b>12</b> is bulbous on its left and right sides as depicted. It is sometimes referred to as a figure eight main body in view of said bulbosities. The bulbosities are denoted <b>12</b><i>c </i>and <b>12</b><i>d</i>. They serve the same function as raised area <b>12</b><i>a </i>in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-C</figref> in that if they are crushed over time until they are flush with the non-bulbous central region of main body <b>12</b>, said main body will still remain firmly and functionally positioned in the facet joint. Without the raised area or the bulbosities, crushing of main body <b>12</b> over time would loosen it relative to its facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-D</figref> depict an embodiment characterized by main body <b>12</b> that is hexagonal in transverse section as depicted. Stabilizer fins <b>14</b>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>may also be shorter in radial extent in this embodiment. This shape helps prevent rotation of implant <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-C</figref> differs from the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-D</figref> in that the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-C</figref> is not provided with stabilizer fins <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-D</figref> depict an embodiment of implant <b>10</b> having a polygonal main body <b>12</b> and stabilizer fins <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>of truncate radial extent.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-B</figref> has main body <b>12</b> of polygonal configuration and no stabilizer fins.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-D</figref>, an instrument is first used to determine the vertical plane <b>18</b> of the facet joint. Identifying the vertical plane of the facet joint is important because said plane is used to identify the proper position for cavity <b>20</b> which is to be formed in the facet joint to receive fusion implant <b>10</b>. The superior facet is denoted <b>22</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-D</figref> and the inferior facet is denoted <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The inverted tapered cavity depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-D</figref> is intended for use with the inverted tapered implant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A disclosure of the novel tools used with implant <b>10</b> follows.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Implant holder <b>26</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Leading end <b>28</b> includes a plurality of flexible arms <b>28</b> that engage an implant <b>10</b> to lift it from bore <b>24</b><i>a </i>or <b>24</b><i>b </i>of implant loading block <b>24</b>. Implant holder <b>26</b> does not have alignment pins. It has flats that align inside directional cannula <b>30</b>. Drill guide <b>36</b>, disclosed hereinafter, also has such flats.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Directional cannula <b>30</b> having diametrically opposed arms <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>at its leading or distal end is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.

Distal bore <b>38</b><i>a </i>of tapping cap <b>38</b> is used to tap directional cannula <b>30</b> into its functional position and proximal bore <b>38</b><i>c </i>is used to tap facet distractor <b>32</b> into its functional positional. The diameter of distal bore <b>38</b><i>a </i>reduces down to medial bore <b>38</b><i>b </i>and proximal bore <b>38</b><i>c </i>has the same diameter as distal bore <b>38</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> depict one step facet distractor <b>32</b> when it is received within the lumen of implant holder <b>40</b> which is a second embodiment of implant holder <b>26</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> depicts the tip of facet distractor <b>32</b> and implant holder <b>40</b> in enlarged detail. Implant Holder <b>40</b> does not need alignment pins <b>40</b><i>a </i>because the orientation is fixed relative to facet distractor <b>32</b>.</p>

The alignment pins allow insertion into directional cannula <b>30</b> at zero degrees (0&#xb0;) or one hundred eighty degrees) (180&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> depicts a second embodiment, denoted <b>52</b>, of implant tamp <b>44</b>. The shaft of implant tamp <b>52</b> shaft conforms to main body <b>12</b> and said shaft is cannulated as at <b>52</b><i>a </i>to enable injection of growth stimulation product.

<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref> provides an end view of the structure depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">A second embodiment of directional cannula <b>30</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> and is denoted <b>54</b>. Transversely opposed distraction blades <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b </i>are formed in its distal end and handle <b>56</b> is mounted thereto at its proximal end. The transverse cross-sectional shape of directional cannula <b>30</b> matches the transverse cross-sectional shape of implant <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A second embodiment of facet distractor <b>32</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> and is denoted <b>56</b>. It includes blade <b>56</b><i>a </i>and positive stop <b>56</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Drill bit <b>58</b> having positive stop <b>58</b><i>a </i>is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">At least one of the instruments includes a directional feature that is used to maintain the alignment of the instrumentation with vertical plane <b>18</b> of the facet joint. By way of example but not limitation, directional cannula <b>30</b> may include a flat portion and the remaining instruments may include a flat portion on an opposite portion of the instrument so that the instruments may only be inserted through said directional cannula at zero degrees (0&#xb0;) or one hundred eighty degrees)(180&#xb0;).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">After the proper position for cavity <b>20</b> has been identified, a drill (or reamer, punch, dremel, router, burr, etc.) is used to form cavity <b>20</b> in the facet joint. Cavity <b>20</b> is formed across vertical plane <b>18</b> so that substantially one-half of cavity <b>20</b> is formed in a first facet <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and substantially one-half is formed in opposing facet <b>22</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">After cavity <b>20</b> has been formed in (or, perhaps more literally, across) the facet joint, fusion implant <b>10</b> is inserted into cavity <b>20</b> as perhaps best understood in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>. More particularly, fusion implant <b>10</b> is inserted into cavity <b>20</b> so that main body <b>12</b> spans the gap between opposing facets <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, and so that stabilizers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>extend between the opposing facet surfaces. Preferably, fusion implant <b>10</b> is slightly oversized relative to cavity <b>20</b> to create a press fit.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Fusion implant <b>10</b> provides the stability and strength needed to immobilize the facet joint while fusion occurs. Due to the positioning of stabilizers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>between the opposing facet surfaces, and due to the non-circular cross-section of main body <b>12</b>, fusion implant <b>10</b> will be held against rotation within cavity <b>20</b>, which will in turn hold facets <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>stable relative to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">When a hollow fusion implant is used, and where the implant is formed of a sufficiently strong and rigid material, cavity <b>20</b> need not be pre-formed in the opposing facets. The hollow fusion implant can be simply tapped into place, in much the same manner that a punch is used.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The novel structure provides a new and improved fusion implant for facilitating facet fusion. This novel fusion implant withstands greater forces, prohibits motion in all directions and substantially reduces the risk of implant failure. The new fusion implant also eliminates the possibility of slippage during spinal motion, greatly improves facet stability and promotes better facet fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It should be appreciated that the new fusion implant combines two unique &#x201c;shapes&#x201d; in one implant (i.e., the shape of main body <b>12</b> and the shape of stabilizers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>) in order to limit motion in a multidirectional joint. More particularly, the shape of main body <b>12</b> limits motion (e.g., in flexion/extension for the lumbar facets and in axial rotation for the cervical facets), while the shape of stabilizers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>(i.e., the &#x201c;keel&#x201d;) rests between two bony structures (i.e., in the gap of the facet joint) and limits lateral bending. This novel construction eliminates the possibility of eccentric forces inducing motion in the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Moreover, although the novel structure effectively stabilizes the joint, it still allows the &#x201c;micro motion&#x201d; which is required for the fusion process to begin.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">It should be appreciated that the novel fusion implant may be manufactured in a wide range of different sizes in order to accommodate any size of facet joint. Furthermore, the scale and aspect ratio of main body <b>12</b>, stabilizers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, may be varied without departing from the scope of the present invention. Additionally, the novel fusion implant may be constructed out of any substantially biocompatible material which has properties consistent with the present invention including, but not limited to, allograft, autograft, synthetic bone, simulated bone material, biocomposites, ceramics, PEEK, stainless steel and titanium. Thus, the novel structure permits a surgeon to select a fusion implant having the appropriate size and composition for a given facet fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Detailed Surgical Technique (Solid Fusion Implant)</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">A preferred surgical technique for using a solid fusion implant <b>10</b> will now be disclosed. The preferred surgical technique preferably uses guide pin <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) facet distractor <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), directional cannula <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), drill guide <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-D</figref>), implant loading block <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), implant holder <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) implant tamp <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), and tapping cap <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">First, the facet joint is localized indirectly by fluoroscopy, or directly by visualization during an open procedure. Next, guide pin <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) is inserted into the gap between the opposing facet surfaces. The position of guide pin <b>34</b> is verified by viewing the coronal and sagittal planes. Then guide pin <b>34</b> is lightly tapped to insert the guide pin approximately five millimeters (5 mm) into the facet joint, along vertical plane <b>18</b>. The inferior facet is curved medially and helps prevent guide pin <b>34</b> from damaging nerve structures.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Cannulated facet distractor <b>32</b> is then slid over guide pin <b>34</b> so that it is aligned with the vertical plane of the facet joint. Then facet distractor <b>32</b> is lightly tapped into the facet joint, along vertical plane <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Next, directional cannula <b>30</b> is placed over facet distractor <b>32</b> (FIG. ?) and the tip of directional cannula <b>30</b> is pushed into the facet joint (FIG. ?). Once the tip of directional cannula <b>30</b> has entered the facet joint, the directional cannula is lightly tapped so as to seat the cannula in the facet joint. This aligns directional cannula <b>30</b> with the vertical plane of the facet joint. After verifying that directional cannula <b>30</b> has been inserted all the way into the facet joint and is stabilized in the joint, facet distractor <b>32</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Drill guide <b>36</b> is then inserted into directional cannula <b>30</b>. Drill guide <b>36</b> is advanced within directional cannula <b>30</b> until a drill guide stop is resting on directional cannula <b>30</b>. Then, with drill guide <b>36</b> in place, irrigation (e.g., a few drops of saline) is placed into drill guide. Next, drill bit <b>58</b> is used to drill a cavity <b>20</b>. This is done by drilling until drill bit <b>58</b> reaches the mechanical stop on drill guide <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21A-B</figref>). Drill guide <b>36</b> and drill bit <b>58</b> are then pulled out of directional cannula <b>30</b>, drill guide <b>36</b> is rotated 180 degrees, and drill guide <b>36</b> is reinserted into directional cannula <b>30</b> in order to drill the superior facet. With drill guide <b>36</b> in place, irrigation (e.g., a few drops of saline) is placed into said drill guide, and drill bit <b>58</b> is used to drill cavity <b>20</b> in the superior facet. Again, drilling occurs until drill bit <b>58</b> reaches the mechanical stop on drill guide <b>36</b>. Drill bit <b>58</b> is then removed.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Using implant loading block <b>24</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, fusion implant <b>10</b> is then inserted into implant holder <b>26</b>. Implant holder <b>26</b>, with fusion implant <b>10</b> in place, is then placed into directional cannula <b>30</b>. Next, implant holder <b>26</b> is lightly tapped so as to insert fusion implant <b>10</b> into cavity <b>20</b> created in the facet joint. Once the implant has been positioned in cavity <b>20</b>, implant tamp <b>44</b> is inserted into implant holder <b>26</b>. Next, implant tamp <b>44</b> is lightly tapped so as to drive the implant into cavity <b>20</b>. The implant is preferably countersunk 1-2 mm into the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Implant tamp <b>44</b>, implant holder <b>26</b> and directional cannula <b>30</b> are removed from the surgical site and the incision is closed to conclude the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Detailed Surgical Technique (Hollow Fusion Implant)</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">A preferred surgical technique for using a hollow fusion implant <b>10</b> will now be disclosed. The preferred surgical technique preferably uses guide pin <b>34</b> (optional) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), one step facet distractor and implant holder <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>), implant tamp <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), and handle <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">First, the facet joint is localized indirectly by fluoroscopy or directly by visualization during an open procedure. The following step involving use of guide pin <b>34</b> is entirely optional. If used, guide pin <b>34</b> is inserted in the gap between the opposing facet surfaces. The position of guide pin <b>34</b> is verified by viewing the coronal and sagittal planes. Guide pin <b>34</b> is then lightly tapped so as to insert said guide pin approximately five millimeters (5 mm) into the facet joint, along the vertical plane of the facet joint. The inferior facet curves medially and helps prevent the guide pin from damaging nerve structures.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">One step facet distractor with implant holder <b>40</b>, which may be cannulated or not cannulated, is then slid over guide pin <b>34</b>, if used, so that it is aligned with the vertical plane of the facet joint. Facet distractor <b>32</b> is lightly tapped into the facet joint, along the vertical plane of the facet joint. This step may be accomplished without use of guide pin <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Next, facet distractor with implant holder <b>40</b>, implant tamp <b>44</b>, handle <b>46</b> assembly, with hollow fusion implant <b>10</b> mounted thereto (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>) is pushed, hammered, or otherwise advanced downwards to drive hollow fusion implant <b>10</b> into the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Finally, the facet distractor/implant tamp assembly is removed, leaving hollow fusion implant <b>10</b> in the facet joint, and the incision is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The following procedure applies to both solid or hollow implants.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Performing posterior facet fusion with the novel tools is a nine step procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the first step, the facet joint is localized either indirectly using fluoroscopy or directly by visualization during an open procedure. Facet distractor <b>56</b> is then inserted into the plane of the facet joint. Placement is verified by viewing in the coronal and sagittal plane. The inferior facet curves medially and should prevent guide pin <b>34</b> from being advanced into nerve structures. Tapping cap <b>38</b> is then tapped lightly so that blade <b>56</b><i>a </i>of facet distractor <b>56</b><i>a </i>enters into the plane of the facet joint. If necessary, the shallow end <b>38</b><i>c </i>of the tapping cap can be used to seat the facet distractor. Positive stop <b>56</b><i>b </i>is formed in facet distractor <b>56</b> to prevent it from being advanced into the nerve structures.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In step three, directional cannula <b>54</b> is placed over facet distractor <b>56</b>. Tip <b>56</b><i>a </i>of facet distractor <b>56</b> is aligned with tips <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b </i>of directional cannula <b>54</b> and is lightly pushed into the facet joint. After tips <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b </i>have entered into the facet joint, directional cannula <b>54</b> is lightly tapped to fully seat it. If necessary, the deep end <b>38</b><i>a </i>of tapping cap <b>38</b><i>a </i>can be used to seat the directional cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The insertion of directional cannula <b>54</b> all the way into the facet joint is then verified. Facet distractor <b>56</b> is removed after such positioning is verified.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In step four, drill guide <b>36</b> is inserted into the lumen of directional cannula <b>54</b>, aligning pins <b>50</b><i>a</i>, <b>50</b><i>b </i>into slots <b>54</b><i>a</i>, <b>54</b><i>b </i>formed in directional cannula <b>54</b>. The insertion continues until drill guide positive stop <b>36</b><i>b </i>abuts directional cannula <b>54</b> and blade <b>48</b><i>a </i>is in the facet joint.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Step five is the drilling of the inferior facet. With drill guide <b>36</b> in place upon the completion of step four. Cavity <b>20</b> is then drilled by drill bit <b>58</b> into the inferior facet. Drilling continues until drill bit <b>58</b> abuts positive stop <b>58</b><i>a</i>. Drill guide <b>36</b> is held down when drill bit <b>58</b> is removed and said drill bit is not removed until it has stopped rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Drill guide <b>36</b> and drill bit <b>58</b> are pulled from directional cannula <b>54</b> in step six and it is cleaned to remove tissue. It is then rotated one hundred eighty degrees (180&#xb0;) and re-inserted into directional cannula <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Cavity <b>20</b> is drilled into the superior facet in step seven. A few drops of irrigation (saline) are placed into the drill guide. Said cavity is then drilled by drill bit <b>58</b> into the superior facet. Drilling continues until drill bit <b>58</b> abuts positive stop <b>58</b><i>a</i>. Drill guide <b>36</b> is held down when drill bit <b>58</b> is removed and said drill bit is not removed until it has stopped rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In step eight, an implant is loaded into directional cannula <b>54</b> with the chamfer <b>16</b> pointed downward. Implant tamp <b>52</b> is inserted into the lumen of directional cannula <b>54</b>. Implant tamp <b>52</b> is lightly tapped until it reaches positive stop <b>52</b><i>b </i>to fully seat implant <b>10</b> in cavity <b>20</b>. Implant tamp <b>52</b> and directional cannula <b>54</b> are then removed.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Numerous advantages are achieved by the present invention. Among other things, the present invention provides a fast, simple, minimally-invasive and easily reproduced approach for effecting facet fusion.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">While fusion implant <b>10</b> has been disclosed in the context of fusing a facet joint, it should also be appreciated that fusion implant <b>10</b> may be used to stabilize and fuse any joint having anatomy similar to the facet joint, i.e., a pair of opposing bony surfaces defining a gap therebetween, with the stabilizer of the fusion implant being sized to be positioned within the gap. By way of example but not limitation, the fusion implant may be used in small joints such as the fingers, toes, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangements of parts, which have been herein disclosed in order to explain the nature of the present invention, may be made by those skilled in the art while still remaining within the principles and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">It will be seen that the advantages set forth above, and those made apparent from the foregoing description, are efficiently attained. Since certain changes may be made in the above construction without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matters contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.</p>

<claim-text>forming said elongated main body so that it has a distal end, a proximal end and a longitudinal axis extending between the distal end and the proximal end, the elongated main body having a cross-sectional profile characterized by a primary axis and a secondary axis;</claim-text>
<claim-text>providing at least one stabilizer extending radially outwardly from the elongated main body in the secondary axis;</claim-text>
<claim-text>forming said main body so that it has a length along the primary axis that is less than the combined width of the bones making up said joint;</claim-text>
<claim-text>forming said at least one stabilizer so that it has a width that is sized to make a press fit into a gap between bones that form said joint;</claim-text>
<claim-text>forming a semi-circular cavity in opposing bones that collectively form said joint;</claim-text>
<claim-text>deploying the fusion implant in said joint so that said opposite sides of said main body are simultaneously positioned within said semi-circular cavities and the at least one stabilizer is positioned within a gap between the bones; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>maintaining the fusion implant in said joint while fusion occurs. </claim-text>
