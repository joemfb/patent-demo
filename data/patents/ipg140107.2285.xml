<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application generally relates to brewed drinks, and more particularly, to methods of preparing coffee using a multi-sized water channeling and distribution device that preferably includes three-layers of material for flavor extraction.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Coffee is brewed by placing water into contact with ground, roasted coffee. Optimal flavor is a result of the water, temperature, time and pressure used. Coffee beans typically contain approximately 600 chemical compounds, a high percentage of which result in bitter and poor tasting coffee. These undesirable compounds are normally released into brewed coffee when the water remains in contact with the ground coffee beans for relatively long durations.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Numerous methods of brewing coffee exist to generate optimal flavors. The simplest form of preparing coffee is to boil coffee grounds using hot water. Generally, the brewed coffee rises to the top while the coffee grounds sink to the bottom of the cup. In a process known as &#x201c;steeping&#x201d;, coffee grounds are placed in pre-heated water and left there for a few minutes. It is important to add coffee grounds quickly after grinding. For small amounts of coffee, two or three minute steep times would be appropriate. For larger quantities, four minutes is typically sufficient. A plunger is pushed down allowing the steeped coffee to enter the serving chamber while a filter retains the grounds.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In espressos or other similarly related drinks, pressure is used to brew the coffee grounds. Drip brewing produces coffee by allowing hot water to drip over coffee grounds held in by a coffee filter surrounded by a brew basket. Strength of the coffee varies according to the ratio of water to coffee grounds used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When brewing coffee, water is poured into a filter basket/container and travels through the coffee grounds as fast as gravity will allow. There is no universal tool or device that collects, manages and distributes the water flow in an efficient manner. Some of the causes and impacts include coffee maker design, the flow of water into the coffee filter basket is inconsistent due to various, types of water distribution nozzles, inconsistent distribution of water jeopardizes the &#x2018;equal saturation&#x2019; of all, coffee grounds, and the percolating process is impacted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A flaw in the coffee brewing process prevents &#x201c;the best possible&#x201d; coffee from being consistently made as neither the proper water, temperature, time and pressure is used. This flaw impacts all the flavor and aroma profiles of brewed coffee, and wastes money. A need therefore exists for a coffee brewing method that helps to eliminate the rapid gravity flow of water through the coffee grounds and distributes the water evenly and consistently over the coffee grounds.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with one aspect of the present application, a method for preparing coffee is provided. The method can include setting a permeable disk over coffee grounds, placing water on the permeable disk, and collecting and uniformly distributing the water on the permeable disk.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of presently preferred embodiments of the application and is not intended to represent the only forms in which the present application can be constructed and/or utilized. The description sets forth the functions and the sequence of steps for constructing and operating the application in connection with the illustrated embodiments. It is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent functions and sequences can be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the spirit and scope of this application.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Generally described, the present application relates to brewed drinks, and more particularly, to coffee brewing methods using a permeable disk. In one illustrative embodiment, the method can include setting the permeable disk over coffee grounds in the filter of a conventional drip coffee maker, placing water on the permeable disk, and compressing the coffee grounds with a weight of the water on the permeable disk. The method can include percolating the coffee grounds with the water distributed uniformly with the permeable disk for brewing a coffee beverage. The method can also include passing the coffee beverage to an outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">By providing the correct application of water, temperature, time and pressure, optimal flavor from the coffee grounds can be realized. Furthermore, undesirable compounds normally found within the ground coffee remain and are not released into the brewed coffee. While primarily described with a percolating process, those skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the methods described herein can be extended to other types of brewing processes such as steeping. Numerous advantages will become apparent from the description provided below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows how coffee is brewed in conventional drip coffee machines. A coffee filter <b>18</b> is typically placed in the filter basket <b>20</b> and ground coffee <b>12</b> is placed into the filter <b>18</b>. Hot water <b>16</b> is poured directly onto the ground coffee <b>12</b>, typically in the center of the filter <b>18</b>, and the hot water <b>16</b> flows through the ground coffee <b>12</b>, picking up their flavor and oil on the way down to the coffee pot.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As depicted, the prior art brewing method is not optimal. When the hot water <b>16</b> is placed into the center of the ground coffee <b>12</b>, the ground coffee <b>12</b> can splatter to the sides of the filter basket <b>20</b>, potentially causing spills into the collection pot below. Moreover, the hot water <b>16</b> typically leaves a hole within the center of the grounds <b>12</b> such that only a certain portion of the grounds <b>12</b> are actually percolated causing the flavor to be bitter. In an uneven distribution, some grounds <b>12</b> are never properly soaked.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A conventional French coffee press is a popular device used for brewing coffee. Because the coffee grounds remain in direct contact with the brewing water and the grounds are filtered from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter, coffee brewed with a French press captures more of the coffee's flavor and essential oils, which would become trapped in a traditional drip brew machine's paper filters. As demonstrated with a French press, brewing coffee optimally occurs with the right settings of water, temperature, time, and pressure. The methods described herein help to accomplish a similar result with the use of a permeable disk <b>10</b> with almost any conventional drip coffee maker.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One type of permeable disk <b>10</b> that can be used in the method of the present application is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exemplary permeable disk <b>10</b> angled at 45 degrees. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the permeable disk <b>10</b> has multiple layers, preferably three, which can include, but are not limited to, paper towels or some other suitable material. In a preferred embodiment, the paper towels are provided in two ply, which can be made by Bounty&#xae;, Brawny&#xae; or the like. The outer diameter of the permeable disk <b>10</b> can be sealed and further designed to direct incoming water away from the sides of the filter basket <b>20</b>. A number of different layers can be used and be made up of different compositions. Known to those skilled in the art, the amount of water that permeates the disk <b>10</b> is dependent on the number of layers as well as their thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The permeable disk <b>10</b> can be constructed of a variety of materials. For example, disposable paper can be used. The disposable paper can be biodegradable. Often, the disk <b>10</b> can be made of unbleached paper removing any unwanted chemicals. Metal disks <b>10</b>, in one embodiment, can be implemented. The metal can be molded into mesh. Plastic or other type of polymer disks <b>10</b> can be used as well. In one embodiment, cloth can be used to construct the permeable disk <b>10</b>. Known to those skilled in the relevant art, the disk <b>10</b> can be made of a combination of those materials described above. The material is constructed such that it can collect water on a top surface and distribute it uniformly on a bottom surface.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The permeable disk <b>10</b> can be referred to, within the present application, as a porous covering, water permeable filter, etc. The covering <b>10</b> can take on numerous shapes and sizes to conform to the filter basket <b>20</b> and is not limited to a disk shape. For example, in one embodiment, the covering <b>10</b> can take the shape of a square, which can be adapted for use within filter baskets <b>20</b> known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the covering <b>10</b> is placed directly over the coffee grounds <b>12</b> such that it touches the grounds <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a diagram showing an illustrative coffee brewing method using the exemplary permeable disk <b>10</b> in accordance with one aspect of the present application is provided. The method can include setting the permeable disk <b>10</b> over coffee grounds <b>12</b>. Water <b>16</b> can then be placed on the permeable disk <b>10</b>. When brewed, the water <b>16</b> is typically poured onto a single location on the permeable disk <b>10</b>, which is often at its center. A closed-wall vessel can be used to brew the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method can include heating the water <b>16</b> before placement on the permeable disk <b>10</b>. Known to those skilled in the relevant art, the water <b>16</b> can be heated in a number of different ways. The permeable disk <b>10</b> can collect the water <b>16</b> above the coffee grounds <b>12</b> and can prevent rapid gravity flow of the water <b>16</b> through the coffee grounds <b>12</b>. Generally, the water <b>16</b> above the permeable disk <b>10</b> collects evenly or uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The weight of the water <b>16</b> on top of the permeable disk <b>10</b> can compress the coffee grounds. By compressing the coffee grounds <b>12</b>, pressure is applied making for better brewed coffee. The compression can take place uniformly throughout the coffee grounds <b>12</b> through the water collected on the top of the permeable disk <b>10</b> and distributed uniformly from the top.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As the water <b>16</b> begins to seep through the permeable disk <b>10</b>, the water <b>16</b> can begin percolating the coffee grounds <b>12</b>. The water <b>16</b> from the permeable disk <b>10</b> is typically distributed uniformly for brewing a coffee beverage. Generally, water <b>16</b> is poured into the filter basket <b>20</b>, while concurrently, water <b>16</b> is percolating the coffee grounds when passing through the permeable disk <b>10</b>. As a result, the coffee grounds <b>12</b> are not only compressed but brewed at the same time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing a completion of the illustrative brewing method using the permeable disk <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After the coffee grounds <b>12</b> are brewed, the coffee grounds <b>12</b> are removed using known methods such as the filter <b>18</b> described above. The coffee beverage can be passed to an outlet. In one embodiment, a receptacle is placed below the outlet to capture the coffee.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Numerous trials were done to determine optimal performance. When one layer of material was used, the disk <b>10</b> weighed 0.39 grams when dry and 5.90 grams when wet. A two-layer disk <b>10</b> weighed 0.80 grams when dry and 12.19 grams when wet. A three-layer disk <b>10</b> weighed 1.20 grams when dry and 18.27 grams when wet. A four-layer disk <b>10</b> weighed 1.60 grams when dry and 24.25 grains when wet and a five-layer disk <b>10</b> weighed 1.99 grams when dry and 30.42 grams when wet.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Measurements of the compression to the ground coffee <b>12</b> were taken using the different layered disks <b>10</b>. To detect the compression for each disk <b>10</b>, the filter basket <b>20</b> was filled with 0.85 inches of coffee. When a one-layer disk <b>10</b> was used, the ground coffee <b>12</b> was compressed to about 0.75 inches. A two-layer disk <b>10</b> compressed the ground coffee <b>12</b> to 0.70 inches and the three-layer disk <b>10</b> compressed the ground coffee <b>12</b> to 0.50 inches. A four-layer disk <b>10</b> compressed the ground coffee <b>12</b> to 0.49 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With a one-layer disk <b>10</b> the steeping and compression of the coffee grounds <b>12</b> was at 14%. The two-layer disk <b>10</b> was at 21% and the three-layer disk <b>10</b> was at 39%. Interestingly, the tests showed 39% steeping and compression with the four-layer disk <b>10</b>. As a result, the trials predicted that the three-layer disk <b>10</b> would optimally compress the ground coffee <b>12</b>.</p>
