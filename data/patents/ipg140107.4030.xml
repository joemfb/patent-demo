<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a particle concentration measuring device, more particularly, to a particle concentration measuring device capable of measuring particle concentration with high accuracy at a place in a clean room where a uniform unidirectional flow is ensured, or at other places.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a clean room and the like, measuring or managing concentration of particles such as dust floating in the air (the number of particles in a unit volume) is an important issue.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As this kind of conventional device measuring concentration of particles (particle concentration), the most popularly known one is a device of a sampling suction type that sucks the air through a sampling tube by the operation of a suction pump and finds the number of particles in the air by a light-scattering method. However, the need to install the sampling tube at a measurement target position makes this device unable to measure in a space where the flow changes due to the suction and thus a degree of freedom in its measurement place is low.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, in the measurement by this device, an airflow velocity and a suction speed are desirably equal to each other, but it is practically difficult to adjust the operation of the suction pump so as to make them equal to each other, and in addition, increasing the suction time in order to obtain a sufficient volume of the sampled air results in the detection of not only particle concentration at the target point but also particle concentration in a space far more upwind than this point, which has been a cause of deteriorating detection accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another proposed device is a device measuring particle concentration from a remote place by a laser radar method. This device synchronizes a laser pulse and a shutter timing of a camera and measures the particle concentration by counting scattered lights of particles in a volume defined by a laser pulse width and a shutter speed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The aforesaid device measuring the concentration from a remote place by the laser radar method is suitable for measuring the concentration of a large volume of particles in the atmosphere or the like from a remote place, but in an indoor space or the like, the laser pulse width and the shutter time become extremely short as a sampling volume becomes small, which makes it difficult to obtain light intensity large enough for the measurement, and thus the device is not practically capable of measuring small particles of 1 &#x3bc;m or less.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There have been also known an air impurity monitor which is capable of measuring impurity concentration in an atmosphere in a clean room automatically, speedily, and continuously and which is easy to handle and costs low (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 9-145616) and a dust measuring device used in a clean room and structured to receive dust by a dust collection sheet (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003-42934).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The device of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. Hei 9-145616 sucks impurities to a hermetically closable impurity capturing vessel to supply the impurities into ultrapure water, and it not only has the same drawback as that of the aforesaid device sucking the air through the sampling tube but also has a complicated device structure. Further, the device of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2003-42934 is structured to receive the dust by the dust collection sheet, and is not suitable for measuring particle concentration (the number of particles in a unit volume).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention seeks to provide a particle concentration measuring device capable of measuring particle concentration with high accuracy at a place in a clean room where a uniform unidirectional flow is ensured, or at other places.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A particle concentration measuring device according to claim <b>1</b> includes:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">a measurement region formation part which has a wall of substantially ring-form defining an inner opening through which gas flows relatively orthogonally;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">a light curtain forming unit forming a planar light curtain in the inner opening;</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">a particle detecting unit receiving scattered light from particles passing through the light curtain to detect the particles; and</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">a calculating unit calculating particle concentration based on a total number of the particles detected by the particle detecting unit in a volume of an airflow passing through the light curtain in a unit time.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The particle concentration measuring device according to the present invention is installed, for example, in a clean room of a unidirectional flow type (or a straight flow type) in which an airflow flows uniformly in one direction, or at a place of a flow supplying a laminar flow. In this case, in order to physically demarcate a measurement region, the wall of substantially ring-form demarcates the measurement region, and through the opening thereof, gas relatively flows orthogonally.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The light curtain forming unit forms the planar light curtain in the whole or part of the opening, and the particle detecting unit receives the scattered light from the particles passing through the light curtain to be capable of detecting the particles. As a result, by calculating a volume of the airflow passing through the light curtain in a unit time by an appropriate method (for example, the volume of the airflow can be calculated based on the velocity of the airflow, the area of a measurement region, and the light-receiving time), it is possible for the calculating unit to calculate the particle concentration based on the total number of the particles detected by the particle detecting unit in the calculated volume.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the present invention, demarcating the space by the wall of substantially ring-form makes it possible to easily find the volume of the airflow passing through the light curtain in a unit time, and further forming the planar light curtain in the whole or part of the demarcated region and receiving the scattered light from the particles passing through the light curtain to detect the particles makes it possible to calculate the particle concentration based on the total number of the particles in the volume of the airflow passing through the light curtain in a unit time.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, in detecting particles at a place in a clean room where a uniform unidirectional flow is ensured or at a place of a flow supplying a laminar flow, the airflow is not disturbed as it has been in the conventional example and the light-receiving time can be increased, which makes it possible to measure particle concentration with high accuracy and to detect fine particles of 1 &#x3bc;m or less as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A particle concentration measuring device according to claim <b>2</b> is provided at a place where an airflow flows uniformly through the inner opening, wherein positions of the measurement region formation part, the light curtain forming unit, and the particle detecting unit are fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">At a place where the airflow uniformly flows through the inner opening, the positions of the measurement region formation part, the light curtain forming unit, and the particle detecting unit may be fixed. This is because the volume of the airflow can be calculated based on, for example, the velocity of the airflow, the area of the inner opening, and the light-receiving time.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A particle concentration measuring device according to claim <b>3</b> is structured such that the measurement region formation part, the light curtain forming unit, and the particle detecting unit linearly move as a unit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, in a clean room of a non-straight flow type which is not a unidirectional flow type (or a straight flow type) where the airflow flows uniformly in one direction or in a case where particles are simply floating without an airflow being generated, the volume of gas cannot be accurately found or is not known.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Here, linearly moving the measurement region formation part results in that the gas &#x201c;relatively&#x201d; flows orthogonally through the inner opening demarcated by the wall even if the airflow is not generated, which makes it possible to find the volume of the airflow passing through the light curtain in a unit time.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A particle concentration measuring device according to claim <b>4</b> is structured such that, in the form of claim <b>3</b>, the particle detecting unit is disposed at a position deviated from and not intersecting with an orthogonal line passing through the inner opening, and a light-receiving axis of the particle detecting unit is inclined with respect to the light curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">If the particle detecting unit is on the orthogonal line passing through the inner opening, the airflow is disturbed due to the presence of the particle detecting unit. This leads to a measurement error. Therefore, by adopting the form in which the particle detecting unit is disposed at a position deviated from and not intersecting with the orthogonal line passing through the inner opening and the light-receiving axis of the particle detecting unit is inclined with respect to the light curtain, it is possible to detect the particles without disturbing the airflow.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A particle concentration measuring device according to claim <b>5</b> is structured such that:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">the particle detecting unit is disposed at a position deviated from and not intersecting with an orthogonal line passing through the inner opening t and a light-receiving axis of the particle detecting unit is inclined with respect to the light curtain; and</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">the light curtain forming unit forms the light curtain on an upstream side of a flow of the gas, a plurality of movable vanes the inclination angles of which with respect to the flow of the gas are variable are provided on a downstream side of the flow of the gas, and the movable vanes have poor or no light transmitting property.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the particle detecting unit detects particles by receiving scattered light from the particles, it is difficult to distinguish the scattered light from the background of the measurement (light-receiving) region unless the background is in dark color. A possible solution to this is to provide a nonreflective background at the rear of the measurement region formation part, but this will be a cause of obstructing the flow of the airflow through the opening inner part.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">On the other hand, especially in the form where the light-receiving axis of the particle detecting unit is inclined with respect to the light curtain, by providing the plural movable vanes having poor or no light transmitting property as the background on the downstream side of the flow of the gas and inclining the movable vanes with respect to the flow of the gas, the airflow is not obstructed, and in addition, it is possible for the movable vanes to have the same function as that of the nonreflective background.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A particle concentration measuring device according to claim <b>6</b> is structured such that the light curtain forming unit forms the light curtain on an upstream side of the flow of the gas, and movable vanes the inclination angles of which with respect to the flow of the gas are variable are provided on a downstream side of the flow of the gas.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some case, the area as a measurement region in the inner opening may be small with respect to an area of the whole inner opening In this case, it is possible to adjust the flow of the airflow by adjusting the angle of a movable vane corresponding to a region where the flow is not needed or a region where the flow need not be uniform, such as making this movable vane inclined or orthogonal with respect to the flow of the gas.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described above, in embodiments of the particle concentration measuring device according to the present invention, there is produced an excellent effect of enabling the highly accurate measurement of particle concentration at a place in a clean room where a uniform unidirectional flow is ensured, or at other places.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hereinafter, a first embodiment of a particle concentration measuring device according to the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The particle concentration measuring device according to this embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is disposed horizontally in, for example, a region right under ceiling filters (HEPA filters) <b>1</b> of a clean room of a unidirectional flow type (or a straight flow type) in which an airflow flows uniformly in one direction, and is used to measure the concentration of particles such as dust.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The particle concentration measuring device has a wall or partition <b>10</b> which is formed in a substantially ring form for example, in a rectangular frame shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and through an inner opening part demarcated by the partition <b>10</b>, clean air flows orthogonally, that is, flows down vertically, and a measurement region formation part is formed by this partition <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A casing <b>11</b> is provided adjacently to the partition <b>10</b>, and in the casing <b>11</b>, there are provided a light curtain (which may also be referred to as a film) forming unit including a laser light scanning unit <b>12</b>A which generates a scanning laser light and a collimating unit <b>12</b>B converting the scanning laser light into a planar light curtain FL to form the planar light curtain which is to be supplied to the opening inner part of the partition <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An imaging unit <b>15</b> is disposed on a support <b>13</b> integrally formed with a portion of the partition <b>10</b> opposite the casing <b>11</b> while being supported by a support bracket <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The imaging unit <b>15</b> constitutes a particle detecting unit receiving scattered light from particles passing through the light curtain FL to detect the particles.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A detection signal of particle scattered light from the imaging unit <b>15</b> is received by an image signal processor <b>20</b>, where it is determined whether a light-receiving signal at a certain place represents a particle, and the particle signal is given to a particle concentration calculating unit <b>22</b>. The particle concentration calculating unit <b>22</b> is supplied with an airflow velocity from an airflow velocity detector <b>21</b> provided at an appropriate position, and calculates particle concentration based on the total number of the particles detected by the particle detecting unit in a volume of the airflow passing through the light curtain FL in a unit time. The data of calculated particle concentration is displayed on a display device <b>23</b> such as a CRT and is also given to an airflow controller (not shown) of the clean room to be used for airflow control.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The particle concentration c is calculated by the expression c=n/(r&#xd7;v&#xd7;T). Here, definitions of the respective variables in the expression are as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">c: particle concentration</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">n: number of particles</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">r: area of a measurement region</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">v: airflow velocity</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">T: measurement time</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Incidentally, in a third embodiment (an embodiment in which the whole device linearly moves as a unit: an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the particle concentration measuring device according to the present invention, it is possible to find the particle concentration c, with &#x201c;v&#x201d; being defined not as &#x201c;airflow velocity&#x201d; but as &#x201c;movement speed&#x201d; of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, it is possible for the display device <b>23</b> to display a three-dimensional tomographic distribution of the particles per volume, with each unit area in the measurement region area r being correlated with the number of the particles in this unit area.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Though the partition <b>10</b> is formed as a ring, it need not be a completely closed ring but may be partially opened outward. Further, the partition <b>10</b> only needs to be in a substantially ring form and its shape may be a quadrangle such as a square other than the rectangle, any other polygon, a circle, or the like. The partition <b>10</b> is desirably formed to have a streamlined cross section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in order to prevent the disturbance of the airflow.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A simple example of the light curtain forming unit is an example where a galvano-mirror (laser light scanning unit) <b>12</b>A receiving laser light L to scan a predetermined angle range and a semi-convex lens (collimating unit) <b>12</b>B are used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Another possible example is one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The light curtain forming unit of this example includes a laser light generator <b>2</b>, a scanning unit <b>12</b>A such as a galvano-mirror, a first mirror <b>4</b>, a second mirror <b>5</b>, and a Fresnel lens <b>6</b>. In this example, the first mirror <b>4</b>, the second mirror <b>5</b>, and the Fresnel lens <b>6</b> constitute the collimating unit <b>12</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Laser light L<b>0</b> emitted forward from the laser light generator <b>2</b>, after being changed in angle by angle changing mirrors <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> a detailed illustration of which is omitted, enters the scanning unit <b>12</b>A, and the scanning unit <b>12</b>A receives the linear laser light to perform the scanning so as to spread the laser light in a fan shape.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The laser light from the scanning unit <b>12</b>A is reflected between the first mirror <b>4</b> and the second mirror <b>5</b> which face each other in parallel in a front and rear direction to become scanning light in a more widely spread fan shape. That is, the light reflected by the first mirror <b>4</b> enters the second mirror <b>5</b> and radiates forward at the second mirror <b>5</b>. The radiant light passes through the Fresnel lens <b>6</b> to radiate into the air as collimated scanner beam light. Using a plastic lens as the Fresnel lens <b>6</b> is cost-advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Consequently, even if a swing angle &#x3b8; is formed by the scanning unit <b>12</b>A, it is possible to emit the light curtain FL as wide collimated scanner beam light as in a case where a scanning unit <b>12</b>A is virtually installed at a rear position P shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As the scanning unit, a galvano-mirror, a resonant mirror, a polygon mirror, or the like is usable. The swing angle &#x3b8; by the scanning unit <b>12</b>A is appropriately selectable or adjustable. As a result, the width of the collimated scanner beam light can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The imaging unit <b>15</b> constituting the particle detecting unit is disposed at a position deviated from and not intersecting with an orthogonal line (in the shown example, a vertical line) passing through the opening inner part. This makes it possible to detect the particles while preventing the airflow from being disturbed by the presence of the imaging unit <b>15</b>. Further, a light-receiving axis OX of a light-receiving part <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the imaging unit <b>15</b> is inclined with respect to the light curtain FL.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The light curtain FL not only can be formed in the whole opening inner part of the partition <b>10</b> but also can be formed to have a narrow width as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Further, a light-receiving (imaging) region in the front and rear direction may be part of the opening inner part of the partition <b>10</b> in terms of the front and rear direction instead of the whole thereof as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Even if a processing range of a captured image of the imaging unit <b>15</b> is not the whole opening inner part of the partition <b>10</b>, no problem occurs in deciding &#x201c;the area r of the measurement region&#x201d; because a positional relation between the partition <b>10</b> and the light curtain FL is known in advance as advance information.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the above example, the imaging unit <b>15</b> is provided on an upstream side of the clean air flow in terms of the partition <b>10</b> or the light curtain FL, but may be provided on a downstream side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the foregoing embodiment, when the particles are detected at a place in a clean room where a uniform unidirectional flow is ensured, at a place of a flow supplying a laminar flow, or the like, the airflow is not disturbed as it has been in the conventional example and the light-receiving time can be increased, which makes it possible to measure particle concentration with high accuracy and to detect fine particles of 1 &#x3bc;m or less as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For reference's sake, an airflow containing PSL standard particles (particle size 0.5 &#x3bc;m) used for the calibration of a particle counter were blown out from the ceiling filters <b>1</b> of the clean room by the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. At this time, a probe of the particle counter was installed under the partition <b>10</b> and all the PSL standard particles were trapped.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The result of the comparison between values of the number of fine particles counted from a captured image of the camera imaging unit <b>15</b> and values of the total number of particles in a 0.5 &#x3bc;m range or larger counted by the particle counter is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Plot points are measured values, y=1.4601x is an approximate expression of the measured values according to the present invention, and y=x is a line in a case where the values of the total number of the particles in the 0.5 &#x3bc;m range or larger counted by the particle counter are equal to the values of the camera-based number. Since the points of the approximate expression y=1.4601x of the present invention are above the points of y=x, it can be confirmed that the particles of 0.5 &#x3bc;m or larger can be surely counted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic front view, partly in section, showing a second embodiment of the particle concentration measuring device according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A plurality of movable vanes <b>30</b>, <b>30</b> . . . which are movable around a support center <b>30</b><i>a </i>so that their inclination angles with respect to the flow of the gas are variable are provided on a downstream side of the flow of the gas in terms of the light curtain FL, and the movable vanes <b>30</b>, <b>30</b> . . . have poor or no light transmitting property. That is, those made of a material in dark color similar to that of a nonreflective background or those surface-treated are used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the imaging unit <b>15</b> (particle detecting unit) receives scattered light from particles to detect the particles, it is difficult to distinguish the scattered lights from the background of a measurement (light-receiving) region unless the background is in dark color. A possible solution to this is to provide a nonreflective background at the rear of the measurement region formation part, but this will be a cause of obstructing the flow of the airflow through the opening inner part.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">On the other hand, by providing the plural movable vanes <b>30</b>, <b>30</b> . . . having poor or no light transmitting property as the background on the downstream side of the flow of the gas in terms of the light curtain FL and inclining them with respect to the flow of the gas as in this embodiment, the airflow is not obstructed, and in addition, it is possible for the movable vanes <b>30</b>, <b>30</b> . . . to have the same function as that of the nonreflective background.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this case, intervals between the movable vanes <b>30</b>, <b>30</b> . . . each can be appropriately decided. For example, by narrowing the interval between some of the movable vanes <b>30</b>, <b>30</b> or by increasing the inclination angle of some of the movable vanes <b>30</b>, <b>30</b> with respect to the airflow, it is possible to prevent the airflow from flowing into this region.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Incidentally, the group of the movable vanes <b>30</b>, <b>30</b>, . . . not only can be provided in the partition <b>10</b> but also can be disposed on the downstream side of the flow of the gas in terms of the partition <b>10</b>, being supported by another support member.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, the third embodiment of the particle concentration measuring device according to the present invention will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, in a clean room of a non-straight flow type not of a unidirectional flow type (or a straight flow type) where an airflow flows uniformly in one direction or in a case where an airflow is not generated and particles are simply floating, a volume of gas cannot be accurately found or is not known.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Therefore, linearly moving the measurement region formation part as in the third embodiment of the particle concentration measuring device according to the present invention results in that the gas &#x201c;relatively&#x201d; flows orthogonally through the inner opening demarcated by the partition <b>10</b> even if the airflow is not generated, which makes it possible to find the volume of the airflow passing through the light curtain FL in a unit time.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The particle concentration measuring device according to the third embodiment is structured such that the measurement region formation part, the light curtain forming unit, and the particle detecting unit linearly move as a unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Concretely, posts <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> are provided upright on a base <b>40</b>, and a slide part <b>41</b><i>a </i>is fitted in a guide groove (not shown) of the post <b>41</b>. A ball screw shaft <b>42</b> rotated by a driving motor <b>43</b> is screwed to the slide part <b>41</b><i>a</i>, and the ball screw shaft <b>42</b> is rotated by the driving motor <b>43</b> so that the slide part <b>41</b><i>a </i>moves up and down along the guide groove of the post <b>41</b>. The slide part <b>41</b><i>a </i>is integrated with the casing <b>11</b>, and as a result, a main part of the device including the partition <b>10</b> and the imaging unit <b>15</b> moves up and down. In this case, a guide shaft <b>44</b> fixed to the post <b>41</b> is loosely fitted to a support <b>13</b>, and this structure stabilizes the up/down movement.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As the imaging unit <b>15</b> (particle detecting unit) of the present invention, it is preferable that a pickup tube camera is a pickup tube camera using especially an avalanche pickup tube. Further, it is also preferable to provide an analog differentiator applying analog differentiation processing to a pickup image signal sent from the pickup tube camera, and detect aerosol based on the image having subjected to the differentiation processing of the analog differentiator. Further, it is also preferable that a lens hood shading a region except the detection target region so that this region is not photographed is attached to a lens of the pickup tube camera. This structure can improve detection ability. Further, a CCD camera, a camera, and the like the resolution of which has become higher in recent years are also usable.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The light curtain forming unit of the present invention may be one using LED light instead of the laser light.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Also adoptable is a structure in which, if necessary, a light trap (not shown) is provided in the partition <b>10</b> at a part receiving the light curtain FL so as to prevent the reflection of the light received by the light curtain FL.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The present invention is usable for measuring particles such as dust not only in a clean room but also in a factory facility where a laminar flow is ensured, and is applicable to all the fields requiring clean space, such as fields of semiconductor, liquid crystal, drugs and medicine, food, and medical treatment.</p>
