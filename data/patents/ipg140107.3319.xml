<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to methods and systems related to radio frequency (RF) communication devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In millimeter wave radar systems (e.g. as for automotive safety and comfort applications) antenna structures are placed on high frequency substrates or high frequency printed circuit boards (HF PCBs), increasing the overall cost of design due to the extra high expense of such high frequency substrates. Antennas such as microstrip antennas (e.g. patch antennas) are often built on these special high frequency substrates. HF PCBs are often constructively based on Rogers, Taconic or other PTFE materials.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Millimeter wave output power can be generated on a semiconductor monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), which may be located also on the HF PCB. MMIC devices typically perform functions such as microwave mixing, power amplification, low noise amplification, and high frequency switching. The inputs and outputs on MMIC devices are frequently matched to a characteristic impedance (e.g. 50 ohms) and interconnect to an antenna. These interconnections between MMIC devices and antenna generally involve a lossy chip/board interface (e.g. bond wires).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Whenever a source of power, such as MMIC devices, delivers power to a load, the power is delivered most efficiently when the impedance of the load is equal to or matches the complex conjugate of the impedance of the source (impedance matching). For two impedances to be complex conjugates, their resistances are equal, and their reactance are equal in magnitude but of opposite signs. Such impedance matching between antennas and chip output can suffer from large manufacturing tolerances of the bonding process and on printed circuit board (PCB) wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Because of a large demand for efficient, less expensive, and cost-effective radar sensing, suppliers face the challenge of delivering antenna packages with maximum potential range, data rate and power integrated in the same radar system.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One or more implementations of the present invention will now be described with reference to the attached drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Integrated wafer packages can be integrated with antenna structures that are coupled to an integrated circuit (IC) chip through a feed structure that is directly connected to the chip and without a bonding interface structure that is external to bond pad connections of the IC device. For example, at least one antenna can be integrated with the chip through an interface layer comprising a metallization layer (e.g. redistribution layer) coupled to a package molding compound with the chip embedded therein. The interface layer integrates the antenna components directly within the same package and can further comprise three dimensional interconnect structures (e.g. solder balls) configured to connect the chip externally. Expensive high frequency substrates and lossy interfaces can thereby be eliminated for integrating antennas into a package in high frequency applications (e.g. millimeter waver radar sensing).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>illustrates a top view of a semiconductor module <b>100</b> with integrated antenna structures, according to an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure, and integrally packaged with an integrated circuit (IC) chip <b>102</b> for wireless communication. For example, the module <b>100</b> can comprise integrated antenna structures <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> embedded therein and integrated to the IC chip <b>102</b>. Although two antenna structures <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are illustrated herein, the disclosure is not limited to any specific number of antenna structures. The module <b>100</b> therefore comprises at least one integrated antenna structure for transmitting/receiving communication signals (e.g., millimeter wave output signals).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The semiconductor module <b>100</b> can comprise a wafer package <b>104</b>, for example, an embedded wafer level ball grid array (eWLB) package <b>104</b> comprising the IC chip <b>102</b>. The IC chip <b>102</b> can be any kind of integrated circuit chip such as any silicon chip that is embedded within the package <b>104</b>. For example, the IC chip <b>102</b> may be a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) chip for microwave engineering processes. MMIC devices typically perform functions such as microwave mixing, power amplification, low noise amplification, and high frequency switching. MMICs are dimensionally small (from around 1 mm<sup>2 </sup>to 10 mm<sup>2</sup>) and can be mass produced, which has allowed the proliferation of high frequency devices such as cellular phones. MMICs have fundamental advantages, namely transistor device speed and a semi-insulating substrate. Both factors can help with the design of high frequency circuit functions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The wafer package <b>104</b> can comprise three dimensional (3D) bonding interconnect/interface structures <b>110</b>, such as solder balls that may be surface-mountable in nature. The 3D bonding interconnect structures <b>110</b> can provide external contacts, mechanical support and/or spacing between the wafer package <b>104</b> and external contacts (e.g., package leads on a printed circuit board). For example, the 3D interconnect structures <b>110</b> can provide electrical connections between active components of the IC chip <b>102</b> or external components. The interconnect structures can comprise various bonding materials, such as bonding metals (e.g. Sn, Ag, and/or Cu).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The wafer package <b>104</b> can comprise a package mold compound <b>112</b> in which the IC chip <b>102</b> and solder balls <b>110</b> can be integrated within and/or encapsulated on at least one side by the mold compound. The IC chip <b>102</b> comprises bond pads or contact pads <b>116</b> on a surface of the chip for making electrical connections from the chip <b>102</b> to contacts (e.g., via bond wires <b>114</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The distance of contact pads <b>116</b> and the silicon there between can be about 0.1 mm, and thus, connecting to a printed circuit board is effectively done with bond wires <b>114</b> rather than through direct contact. The bond wires <b>114</b> may interconnect the contact pads <b>116</b> of the IC chip <b>102</b> to the 3D bonding interface structures <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The integrated antenna structure <b>106</b> and integrated antenna structure <b>108</b> may be used to transmit and/or receive wireless communication signals thereat to form a transceiver device. While the integrated antenna structure <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are illustrated as two separate antenna structures, they may also be one antenna structure acting as a transceiver for transmission and/or reception thereat. Additionally, more than two antenna structures may be integrated into the package <b>104</b> and positioned in various angels for an optimized performance and minimizing mutual coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The integrated antenna structure(s) can also comprise any one of a various types of planar antennas. For example, the antenna structures <b>106</b> and/or <b>108</b> may comprise a dipole antenna (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>), a folded dipole antenna (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>), a ring antenna (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c</i>) a rectangular loop antenna (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>d</i>), a patch antenna (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>e</i>), a coplanar patch antenna (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>f</i>), monopole antennas, etc., in addition to one or more of various types of antenna feed and/or impedance matching networks, such as balanced differential lines, coplanar lines, etc. in which one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the integrated antenna structure <b>106</b> and/or <b>108</b> can be integrated into the package <b>104</b> with the chip <b>102</b> and package mold compound <b>112</b>. For example, the integrated antenna <b>106</b> and/or <b>108</b> can be integrated into the same layer as the 3D interconnect structures <b>110</b> (e.g. solder balls) through an interface layer comprising redistribution or metallization layer (discussed infra). This can enable the antennas to be contacted to the silicon chip <b>102</b> within package <b>104</b> without a bonding interface structure that is external to bond pad connections <b>116</b> of the IC device. Because the package <b>104</b> comprises one common surface where the packaged mold compound <b>112</b> and chip <b>102</b> are combined in one wafer package <b>104</b>, the interconnection between the antenna structures <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and silicon chip <b>102</b> can be done in one wafer fabrication process flow. Thus, the cost of expensive high frequency substrates, often utilized for wave radar systems (e.g. millimeter waver radar systems, as for automotive safety and comfort applications) can be avoided. Additionally, impedance matching between antennas and chip output does not have to suffer from large tolerances of the bonding process and on printed circuit board wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, illustrates one embodiment of a cross-section of the semiconductor module <b>100</b> along the line <b>1</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b><i>b</i>. In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, a printed circuit board substrate) <b>16</b> is coupled to the package <b>104</b> via solder balls <b>110</b> and interconnects <b>120</b>. The package <b>104</b> (as discussed above) can comprise a package molding compound layer <b>126</b> that comprises the package molding compound <b>112</b> and the IC chip <b>102</b>, and an interface layer <b>117</b> comprising a redistribution layer <b>121</b> with integrated structures coupled thereto and a dielectric coat <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The package molding compound <b>112</b> can have very low losses and is a very good substrate for applications requiring small packages, such as in RF or wireless communication chips (e.g. for microwave radar sensing). The package molding compound <b>112</b> can comprise an organic polymer, such as an epoxy material that has an inorganic filling material (e.g. silicon dioxide). The package molding compound layer <b>126</b> can have the IC chip <b>102</b> embedded within the package molding compound <b>112</b>, wherein a substantially planar surface <b>124</b> can be formed thereat and during wafer package processing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The package <b>104</b> further comprises the interface layer <b>114</b> on a surface of the package molding compound layer <b>126</b> that comprises a metal layer/plane or the redistribution layer <b>121</b> in the dielectric coating <b>121</b> where the contents from the chip <b>102</b> to the package <b>104</b> are connected and integrated. The package <b>104</b> comprising the redistribution layer <b>114</b> and the package molding compound layer <b>126</b> can have a width w of about 450 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The package <b>104</b> also comprises the 3D interconnect structures <b>110</b> (e.g. solder balls) that add further dimension to the package <b>104</b>. The balls <b>110</b> are the interface from the IC chip <b>102</b> to the external world (e.g. outside the package molding compound layer <b>104</b>), and can have a diameter of about 300 microns. The distance between the balls can be about 0.5 mm, which is represented by a pitch p. This is a distance p in which the balls <b>110</b> are capable of connecting to a circuit board <b>116</b> and be compactly integrated into the package <b>104</b>. The 3D bonding interconnect structures <b>110</b> can provide external contacts, mechanical support and/or spacing between the package <b>104</b> and external contacts <b>120</b> (e.g., package leads on a printed circuit board).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Between the package <b>104</b> and the printed circuit board <b>116</b> can be an air cavity <b>128</b>. In one embodiment, the air cavity <b>128</b> can be filled with only air and/or a filler <b>132</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>), such as an under-fill comprising an epoxy compound (not shown). The printed circuit board (PCB) <b>116</b> can comprise a ground plane and/or reflector <b>112</b> positioned on the PCB <b>116</b> and within the air cavity <b>128</b>. The reflector <b>122</b> can be opposite to and spaced from the integrated antenna structure <b>106</b> and/or <b>108</b> for providing a directive radiation <b>118</b> in a direction <b>118</b> from the package <b>104</b> and/or from the PCB <b>116</b>. Without the ground place/reflector <b>122</b>, the radiation of energy from antenna structures could be in both directions, to the top and through the package mold compound as well as through the back of the package. With the reflector <b>122</b>, a directive radiation <b>118</b> is directed substantially perpendicular to the PCB or the package to the outside world. In one embodiment, further reflector structures (not shown) or additional metal layers within the interface layer <b>117</b>, such as metal bars (not shown) may be placed on one side of the antenna structure <b>108</b> for further directing a directive radiation <b>118</b> to a specific direction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the antenna structure <b>108</b> is integrated with the package molding compound layer <b>126</b> and to the IC chip <b>102</b> within the interface layer <b>117</b> through the redistribution layer <b>114</b> therein. For example, the antenna structure <b>108</b> can be formed to the same redistribution layer <b>114</b> as the bonding interface structure comprising the solder balls or 3D interconnect structures <b>110</b>. The integrated antenna structure <b>108</b> can thus be coupled to the IC chip <b>102</b> from the redistribution layer <b>121</b> via a metallization layer <b>130</b> within. Because the antenna structure <b>108</b> is integrated directly into the package <b>104</b>, no additional substrate specific to the antenna structure <b>108</b> is needed. The metallization layer <b>130</b> can also comprise metal interconnects (e.g. copper) for connecting the 3D bonding interconnect structures <b>110</b> and/or the integrated antenna structure <b>108</b> to bond pad connections <b>116</b> of the IC chip <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">By integrating the antenna structures directly to IC chip <b>102</b> in the package molding compound layer <b>104</b>, no additional high frequency substrates or lossy interfaces are incorporated for integrating antennas. Thus, cost structures for design can be reduced. Additionally, low loss interconnects between antennas and a semiconductor device can be achieved by means of such high precision wafer level processed modules as discussed above. Consequently, applications (e.g. automotive safety, blind spot detection and/or park aiding) can be finally implemented without high frequency connections on the circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, illustrates one embodiment of a cross-section of the semiconductor module <b>100</b> along lines <b>1</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b><i>b </i>that is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. The air cavity/gap <b>128</b> is located between interface layer <b>117</b> and the ground plane/reflector <b>122</b>. In one embodiment, an additional material is introduced that is a fill or an underfill <b>132</b>, such that there is substantially less air or no air in the air cavity <b>128</b>. By doing this, the radiation properties of the antenna can be changed. For example, the fill can be used to reduce the thermal stress between the PCB board <b>116</b> and the IC chip <b>102</b> (e.g. a flip chip device). With the fill <b>132</b>, reliability can be improved with respect to temperature cycling. The fill <b>132</b> can be a type of epoxy or organic material. The fill <b>132</b> comprises a different dielectric constant than air (about 1). As a consequence, the effective electrical distance between the integrated antenna structure <b>108</b> and reflector <b>122</b> can be improved. For example, the effective electrical distance can be about a quarter of a wavelength of the antenna radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>, illustrates another embodiment of a cross-section of the semiconductor module <b>100</b> along lines <b>1</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b><i>b </i>that is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d </i>illustrates an embodiment of the module <b>100</b> further comprising at least one parasitic element <b>136</b> (e.g. a parasitic antenna structure) located on the surface <b>124</b> of the package molding compound layer <b>126</b> for modulating the field directivity of the directive radiation <b>118</b> of the integrated antenna structure <b>108</b>. The surface <b>124</b> can be substantially planar and opposing another surface of the package molding compound layer <b>126</b> coupled to the interface layer. The parasitic element <b>138</b> can be further located opposite to the integrated antenna structure <b>108</b> and in a parallel configuration thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The parasitic element <b>136</b> can be a radio antenna element, which does not have any wired input, but instead absorbs radio waves radiated from another active antenna element (e.g. integrated antenna <b>108</b>) in proximity. Then, the element <b>136</b> can re-radiate radio waves in phase with the active element so that it adds to the total transmitted signal. This can change the antenna pattern and beam width. The parasitic element <b>136</b> can also be used to alter the radiation parameters of a nearby active antenna. For example, the parasitic element <b>136</b> can be a parasitic microstrip patch antenna located above the integrated antenna structure <b>108</b>, which may can also be a patch antenna in one embodiment. This antenna combination resonates at a slightly lower frequency than the original element, and thus, can increase the impedance bandwidth of the integrated antenna structures embedded within the interface layer <b>117</b>.</p>
