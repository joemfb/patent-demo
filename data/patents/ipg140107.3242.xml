<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A first patterned contact layer, for example a gate electrode, is formed over an insulative substrate. Insulating and functional layers are formed at least over the first patterned contact layer. A second patterned contact layer, for example source/drain electrodes, is formed over the functional layer. Insulative material is then selectively deposited over at least a portion of the second patterned contact layer to form first and second wall structures such that at least a portion of the second patterned contact layer is exposed, the first and second wall structures defining a well therebetween. Electrically conductive or semiconductive material is deposited within the well, for example by jet-printing, such that the first and second wall structures confine the conductive or semiconductive material and prevent spreading and electrical shorting to adjacent devices. The conductive or semiconductive material is in electrical contact with the exposed portion of the second patterned contact layer to form, e.g., an operative transistor.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates generally to electronic device fabrication, and more particularly to a method employing a printed mask to form active device elements by a printing process such that the printed mask controls dimensions of the active device elements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Digital lithography is a maturing technology designed to reduce the costs associated with photolithographic processes, used often in the fabrication of micro-electronic devices, integrated circuits, and related structures. Digital lithography directly deposits patterned material onto a substrate in place of the delicate and time-consuming photolithography processes used in conventional manufacturing processes. The printed pattern produced by digital lithography can either comprise actual device features (i.e., elements that will be incorporated into the final device or circuitry, such as the source, drain, and gate regions of thin film transistors, signal lines, opto-electronic device components, etc.) or it can be a mask for subsequent semiconductor processing (e.g., etch, implant, etc.) Importantly, unlike traditional lithographic systems, digital lithography systems avoid the cost and challenges associates with the use of reticles or masks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, digital lithography involves depositing a print material by moving a printhead and a substrate relative to one another along a single axis (the print travel axis). Print heads, and in particular, the arrangements of the ejectors incorporated in those print heads, are optimized for printing along this print travel axis. Printing takes place in a raster fashion, with the print head making printing passes across the substrate as the ejector(s) in the print head dispense individual droplets of print material onto the substrate. At the end of each printing pass, the print head (or substrate) makes a perpendicular shift relative to the print travel axis before beginning a new printing pass. Printing passes continue in this manner until the desired pattern has been fully printed onto the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Materials typically printed by digital lithographic systems include phase change material and solutions of polymers, colloidal suspensions, such suspensions of materials with desired electronic properties in a solvent or carrier. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,742,884 and 6,872,320 (each incorporated herein by reference) teach a system and process, respectively, for printing a phase change material onto a substrate for masking. According to these references, a suitable material, such as a stearyl erucamide wax, is maintained in liquid phase over an ink-jet style piezoelectric printhead, and selectively ejected on a droplet-by-droplet basis such that droplets of the wax are deposited in desired locations in a desired pattern on a layer formed over a substrate. The droplets exit the printhead in liquid form, then solidify after impacting the layer, hence the material is referred to as phase-change.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Once dispensed from an ejector, a print material droplet attaches itself to the substrate through a wetting action, then proceeds to solidify in place. In the case of printing phase-change materials, solidification occurs when the heated and liquefied printed droplet loses its thermal energy to the substrate and/or environment and reverts to a solid form. In the case of suspensions or solutions, after wetting to the substrate, the carrier most often either evaporates leaving the suspended or dissolved material on the substrate surface or the carrier hardens or cures. The print material may also simply consist of a low-molecular weight monomer which cross-links and therefore solidifies upon irradiation with actinic radiation such as UV light. The thermal conditions and physical properties of the print material and substrate, along with the ambient conditions and nature of the print material, determine the specific rate at which the deposited print material transforms from a liquid to a solid, and hence the height and profile of the solidified deposited material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">If two adjacent droplets are applied to the substrate within a time prior to the solidification of either or both droplets, the droplets may wet and coalesce together to form a single, continuous printed feature. Surface tension of the droplet material, temperature of the droplet at ejection, ambient temperature, and substrate temperature are key attributes for controlling the extent of droplet coalescence and lateral spreading of the coalesced material on the substrate surface. These attributes may be selected such that a desired feature size may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, one disadvantage of digital lithography is that since the printed material is deposited in liquid form, it tends to spread after deposition and prior to solidification. When printing devices close together, for example less that 20-40 &#x3bc;m (micrometers) edge-to-edge, the droplet spreading can result in device-to-device short circuit (e.g., when forming electronic devices such as transistors), or device-to-device cross contamination (e.g., when forming an array of biological test units). While digital lithography has been used to isolate adjacent structures, such as wells for color filter material in a color filter for a flat panel display and the like, heretofore no device designs have successfully included printed well structures in forming active electronic devices, forming structures over active device layers, nor forming structures to confine the deposition of active device material.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the present disclosure provides methods for manufacturing micro-electronic, opto-electronic, bio-electronic, or similar devices employing digital lithography, and the devices so manufactured, which have improved device-to-device isolation as compared to methods and devices previously produced by digital lithography.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one aspect of the disclosure, a method is provided for forming an active device, the method comprising selectively depositing insulating material over at least a portion of a substrate to form first and second wall structures, and selectively depositing an electrically active material between said first and second wall structures such that said first and second wall structures confine said active material to thereby form an active structure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another aspect of the disclosure, a first patterned contact layer is formed over an insulative substrate. Insulative material is then selectively deposited over at least a portion of the first patterned contact layer to form first and second wall structures such that at least a portion of the patterned contact layer is exposed, the first and second wall structures defining a well region therebetween. An electrically active (or semiconductive) material is then selectively deposited within the well region such that the first and second wall structures confine the electrically active material therein, and the electrically active material is in physical and electrical contact with the exposed portion of the patterned contact layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a variation of these aspects, the electrically active material may be a semiconductor, and the device formed is a print patterned transistor. According to another variation of this aspect, the first and second wall structures define a sample-receiving well over a test circuit, and the device formed is a biological assaying array.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to still further variations, a functional layer may be deposited over the substrate, either before or after forming the patterned contact layer, or a portion thereof. The functional layer may be a hydrophobic (or low-surface energy) coating such as silane, silazane, polysilsesquioxane, and fluorocarbon, or may be a hydrophilic (or high surface-energy) coating such as polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, and proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The wall structures are preferably formed by a digital lithographic process. Likewise, the electrically active material deposited within the well structures is deposited by a digital lithographic (or digital printing) process. Indeed, other or even all of the elements of the device being formed, such as the patterned contact layer, functional layer, etc. may also be deposited by a digital lithographic (or digital printing) process according to certain aspects and applications of the present disclosure. Some layers, such as the contact layers may also be formed by other processes such as offset-, gravure-, flexo- or screen printing, by conventional lithography and patterning or by deposition through a shadow mask.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The above is a summary of a number of the unique aspects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure. However, this summary is not exhaustive. Thus, these and other aspects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from the following detailed description and the appended drawings, when considered in light of the claims provided herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">We initially point out that descriptions of well known starting materials, processing techniques, components, equipment and other well known details are merely summarized or are omitted so as not to unnecessarily obscure the details of the present invention. Thus, where details are otherwise well known, we leave it to the application of the present invention to suggest or dictate choices relating to those details.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a first embodiment of this disclosure, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a bottom-gate transistor device is fabricated. The embodiment makes extensive use of digital lithography, digital printing or laser transfer processes. Spreading of materials deposited, for example by a digital lithography process, is reduced so that more compact devices are possible, smaller pitch arrays are possible, and device-to-device shorting is eliminated. The embodiments described herein related to the formation of active electronic devices, such as electronic switching elements, as opposed to passive elements, such as electrical filters and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the formation of a device <b>10</b> begins with preparation of a suitable substrate <b>12</b>. Many different types of substrates may be employed, since growth is not epitaxial from the substrate. Examples of substrate materials include ceramics, polymers, crystalline materials, metals, etc., and may be rigid or flexible. In the case of conductive substrates, an insulting layer (not shown) is first deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the case of a bottom-gate transistor device, a gate electrode <b>14</b> is formed by depositing one or more droplets of conductive material. In the present embodiment, gate electrode <b>14</b> will preferably be formed by jet-printing of conductive ink, such as a solution of silver nanoparticles or silver precursor ink (these inks form an electrically conductive layer after a thermal annealing step). Although the main focus of this disclosure is on printing methods, gate electrode <b>14</b> may be deposited and patterned by more conventional methods such as sputtering or evaporation followed by photolithography and etching techniques such as wet chemical etching. Gate electrode <b>14</b> may also be patterned using laser ablation or laser deposition. Moreover, gate electrode <b>14</b> may be patterned by shadow mask evaporation or other method known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An insulating layer <b>16</b> forming a gate dielectric layer may be deposited by jet-printing, doctor-blading, spin-coating, slot-coating, Langmuir-Blodgett, spray coating or other common deposition method. Insulating layer <b>16</b> is typically thin in order to obtain a high specific capacitance. The layer may be as thin as a few nanometers (nm) up to several micrometers (&#x3bc;m) and typically several hundred nm. Insulating layer <b>16</b> may comprise materials such as self assembled monolayers, polymer dielectrics or composite or multilayer dielectrics. Examples of materials are polyvinylphenol (PVP), polyvinylcinnamate, polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), fluorinated polymers such as CYTOP (from Asahi Glass), epoxy-based polymers such as SU-8 (MicroChem, Corp.), polysilsesquioxanes, polyimide, composites of polymer with titania nanoparticles, etc. Insulating layer <b>16</b> may also be deposited by non-solution processes, such as thermal evaporation, atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), lamination, etc. In one example, the gate dielectric comprises ALD deposited aluminum oxide or hafnium oxide. In another example it comprises evaporated Parylene. Insulating layer <b>16</b> may also be grown directly on gate electrode <b>14</b> by oxidation or by anodization methods.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A functional layer <b>18</b> is next deposited over insulating layer <b>16</b>. Functional layer <b>18</b> may be a hydrophobic (or low-surface-energy) material such as a nonpolar polymer, a hydrophobic silane, silazane, polysilsesquioxane, fluorocarbon, etc. Materials such as Methyl-silanes, linear or branched alkyl-silanes, aromatic silanes, fluorinated alkyl silanes or dialkyl silanes are also examples. Alternatively, functional layer <b>18</b> may be a hydrophilic (or high surface-energy) layer such as polar polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene oxide, a protein such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), etc. Aminoalkyl silsesquioxanes, aminosilanes, epoxy functional silanes, polar hydrophilic silanes, hydroxylic hydrophilic or ionic hydrophilic silanes are also examples of hydrophilic functional layers. Use of a phase change material for printing the features of device <b>10</b> disclosed herein has the advantage that the deposition process is generally insensitive to the surface energy of the substrate. It is therefore possible to print features over a very hydrophobic or very hydrophilic functional layer <b>18</b>. Moreover, a phase-change ink does not contain substantial amounts of solvents which otherwise could negatively affect the functional layer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Functional layers are often required in the gate region of thin-film transistors such as organic thin-film transistors. It has been shown that certain hydrophobic coatings on the gate dielectric improve the molecular ordering of polymeric semiconductors such as polythiophenes. For example, a self-assembled monolayer of OTS (Octadecyltrichlorosilane), a silane which has a long hydrophobic tail, on a silicon dioxide gate dielectric significantly improves the device mobility in transistors with PQT-12 or P3HT (poly3-hexylthiophene) organic semiconductor. Similar improvements of the transistor device performance have been observed with other alkyl substituted silanes, phenylsilanes or HMDS (hexamethyldisilazane). The functional layer may also be a coating of a polysilsesquioxane such as a methylated polysilsesquioxane or other functional layer that interacts with the semiconductor in a way that improves the device performance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The functional layer may also serve to modify the interface between the gate dielectric and the semiconductor. For example, a gate dielectric such as a layer of high-k tantalum oxide or aluminum oxide can exhibit charge traps at the interface with the semiconductor. This is undesirable since it reduces the transistor mobility and causes degraded device stability. A thin functional layer such as a polysilsesquioxane or a thin low-k coating (such as Cytop, an amorphous fluorocarbon polymer, Asahi Glass Co.) can improve the device performance by providing an interface with a lower charge-trap density.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one specific example, a printed transistor is fabricated by solution depositing a 300-600 nm thick PVP (polyvinylphenol) gate dielectric over a silver gate electrode (printed from silver nanoparticle solution). A thin (&#x2dc;10-50 nm) layer of polymethylsilsesquioxane is then deposited onto the PVP gate dielectric. Silver source drain electrodes are then jet-printed. This process may require treatment of the hydrophobic silsesquioxane layer with an oxygen plasma before printing. The polythiophene semiconductor PQT-12 is then deposited from a solution onto the gate dielectric, forming a connection between source and drain electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In summary, the functional layer in a printed transistor can have a range of purposes, including modification of interface states of the gate dielectric, influence of the molecular ordering of the deposited organic semiconductor or control of the film formation of the drying semiconductor. In some cases, the surface has to be turned more hydrophilic (the surface energy has to be increased). For example, if the surface is very hydrophobic, film formation of the semiconductor may not take place because excessive dewetting occurs. In this case, a functional layer such as an aminosilane may be applied to increase the surface energy. Other materials to increase the surface energy include PVA (polyvinylalcohol), polyethylene oxide, polyethyleneglycol, etc. A more hydrophilic surface may improve the film formation of the semiconductor, but it may also lead to excessive spreading of the printed drops. Therefore a well structure is particularly essential.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Source electrode <b>20</b> and drain electrode <b>22</b> are next formed over functional layer <b>18</b>. As with gate electrode <b>14</b>, source and drain electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> will preferably be formed by jet-printing for example a conductive ink. Source and drain electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> may also be deposited and patterned by more conventional methods such as sputtering or evaporation followed by photolithography and etching techniques such as wet chemical etching. Source and drain electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> may also be patterned using laser ablation or laser deposition, by shadow mask evaporation, or by another method known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">First wall structure <b>24</b> and second wall structure <b>26</b> are then deposited such that they do substantially but do not completely cover source electrode <b>20</b> and drain electrode <b>22</b>, respectively. First and second wall structures <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are substantially taller than source and drain electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and may be, for example, on the order of height h=0.5-5.0 microns above the surface of functional layer <b>18</b>. First and second wall structures <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> define a well or channel substantially over gate electrode <b>14</b>. The width, W<sub>C</sub>, of the well or channel may be, for example, on the order of 10-500 microns. First and second well structures <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be formed of a phase change material, which advantageously allows both obtaining the desired height and the ability to print directly upon a hydrophobic or hydrophilic functional layer <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As mentioned, first wall structure <b>24</b> is deposited such that a region <b>20</b><i>a </i>of source electrode <b>20</b> is left uncovered thereby. This exposed region <b>20</b><i>a </i>may have a width, W<sub>SG </sub>on the order of 5-50 microns, but can be as small as 0.5 microns or less, as long as sufficient surface protrudes to allow the formation of an electrical contact to the semiconductor material. Likewise, second wall structure <b>26</b> is deposited such that a region <b>22</b><i>a </i>of drain electrode <b>22</b> is left uncovered thereby. This exposed region <b>22</b><i>a </i>may have a similar width, W<sub>DG </sub>as discussed with regard to W<sub>SG</sub>. These exposed regions <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>a </i>become the ohmic contact for subsequently deposited semiconducting channel material.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">First and second wall structures <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> can take a variety of forms. In a preferred embodiment, first and second wall structures <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may be an insulating phase-change material that is deposited in a melted state and which then solidifies after being deposited. A wax such as a stearyl stearamide (Kemamade) is an example. Another example is a radiation curable gel ink such as disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0120924, which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference in its entirety. Some radiation curable materials such as UV curable polymers that do not substantially rely on solvent evaporation are also included in the class of phase-change polymer since they are transferred from a liquid state into a solid state upon UV exposure. In at least one form, the positioning of the printed polymer is very accurate and depends on the printhead.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A semiconductor layer <b>28</b> is next deposited in the well region between first and second wall structures <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. In one embodiment, the material comprising semiconductor layer <b>28</b> is a jet-printed polymer semiconductor solution. In another embodiment, semiconductor layer <b>28</b> is a precursor (including pentacene, zinc oxide or silicon precursors, as well as carbon nanotubes, silicon nanowires or nano-belts, graphene, silicon nano particles or other semiconducting nanoparticles, nano-rods, nano-ribbons, etc.) For example, the semiconductor may consist of a layer of jet-printed P3HT or PQT-12 polythiophene semiconductor. The semiconductor may also be jet-printed small-molecule precursors such as TIPS (bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl))-pentacene or N-sulfinylcarbamate-pentacene. Importantly, with wall structures <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> formed sufficiently high, they serve to limit any spreading of the material forming semiconductor layer <b>28</b>, and prevent device-to-device short circuiting. Furthermore, with regions <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>a </i>of source and drain electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> exposed, semiconductor layer <b>28</b> may make electrical contact with those portions, and thereby form a channel region for a transistor device.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Following deposition of semiconductor layer <b>28</b>, a passivation layer <b>30</b> is formed thereover. Passivation layer <b>30</b> may comprise materials such as polymer dielectrics deposited by jet printing. Alternatively, passivation layer <b>30</b> may be deposited by other methods such as slot-coating, spray coating, dip-coating and not only confined to the well region. Examples of materials are PMMA, polystyrene, polyvinylalcohol (PVA), fluorinated polymers such as CYTOP (from Asahi Glass), If wall structures <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> have a sufficient height, h, they may confine passivation layer <b>30</b> to the well region. A discrete semiconductor device is thereby formed. The passivation may also be formed by a phase separation process in which the semiconductor and insulator are deposited as a blend into the well and the phase separation occurs during the drying process with the insulating layer remaining at the top and forming the passivation. However, the passivation layer may also be uniformly coated over the surface, such as by evaporation of a layer of Parylene.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the method disclosed above, wall structures effectively limit spreading of jet printed semiconducting or conducting material, eliminating device-to-device short circuiting. Thus, closely packed arrays of devices may be fabricated. Indeed, it is possible to form devices which share wall structures, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> (cut-away side view) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> B (plan view) which shows a two-device structure <b>50</b>. It will be appreciated that arrays comprising many more than two devices may similarly be formed. Device <b>50</b> comprises a substrate <b>56</b> having gate electrodes <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> formed thereon. As previously described, gate electrodes <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> will preferably be formed by jet-printing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Insulating layer <b>62</b> is next deposited by an appropriate method. Examples of materials are polyvinylphenol (PVP), polyvinylcinnamate, polystyrene, polyvinylalcohol (PVA), fluorinated polymers such as CYTOP (from Asahi Glass), epoxy-based polymers such as SU-8 (MicroChem, Corp.), polysilsesquioxanes, polyimide, PMMA, composites of polymer with titania nanoparticles, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A functional layer <b>66</b> is next deposited over insulating layer <b>62</b>. As previously described, functional layer <b>66</b> may be a hydrophobic material such as silane, silazane, polysilsesquioxane, fluorocarbon, etc. Alternatively, functional layer <b>66</b> may be a hydrophilic layer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene oxide, or an aminosilane, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A plurality of source electrodes <b>68</b>, <b>72</b> and drain electrodes <b>70</b>, <b>74</b> are next formed over functional layer <b>66</b>. Electrodes <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>74</b> are preferably formed by jet-printing of a conducting material, e.g., from a silver nanoparticle solution.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Wall structures <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> are then deposited as previously described such that they substantially but do not completely cover electrodes <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>. Two well regions are thereby formed, one for each of transistors <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, with wall structure <b>78</b> shared between the two. This arrangement of a shared wall structure provides reduced-device-to-device spacing, resulting in high device-count arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A semiconductor layer <b>82</b> is next printed or deposited in the well region between wall structures <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, and similarly a semiconductor layer <b>84</b> is next printed or deposited in the well region between wall structures <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>. Typically, semiconductor layers <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> are the same material composition. However, semiconductor layer <b>82</b> may be comprised of a material which differs from the material comprising semiconductor layer <b>84</b>, depending on the intended application of the device so formed. Particularly, semiconductor <b>82</b> may be an n-type semiconductor and semiconductor <b>84</b> may be a p-type semiconductor and the adjacent TFTs may be connected to form a simple inverter circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Finally, a passivation layer <b>86</b> is formed over semiconductor layer <b>82</b>, and a passivation layer <b>88</b> is formed over semiconductor layer <b>84</b>. Typically, passivation layers <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> are comprised of the same material. However, passivation layer <b>86</b> may be comprised of a different material than passivation layer <b>88</b> depending on the intended application of the device so formed. Furthermore, passivation layers <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> may in fact be a single continuous layer deposited over the structure including the upper extents of wall structures <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> in appropriate embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, two adjacent, electrically isolated transistor devices <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> are thereby formed. Given proper array interconnections, these devices may thus operate in an array such as a display control, sensor control, logic array, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a top-gate transistor device <b>100</b> is formed. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the formation of a device <b>100</b> begins much as with the prior embodiments, with preparation of a suitable substrate <b>102</b>. Examples of substrate materials include ceramics, polymers, crystalline materials, metals, etc., and may be rigid or flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A functional layer <b>104</b> is next deposited over substrate <b>102</b>. Functional layer <b>104</b> may be a hydrophobic (or low-surface-energy) material such as a nonpolar polymer, a hydrophobic silane, silazane, polysilsesquioxane, fluorocarbon, etc. Materials such as Methyl-silanes, linear or branched alkyl-silanes, aromatic silanes, fluorinated alkyl silanes or dialkyl silanes are also examples. Alternatively, functional layer <b>104</b> may be a hydrophilic (or high surface-energy) layer such as polar polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene oxide, a protein such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), etc. Aminoalkyl silsesquioxanes, aminosilanes, epoxy functional silanes, polar hydrophilic silanes, hydroxylic hydrophilic or ionic hydrophilic silanes are also examples of hydrophilic functional layers.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Source electrode <b>106</b> and drain electrode <b>108</b> are next formed over functional layer <b>104</b>. Each of electrodes <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> are formed by depositing one or more droplets of conductive material, preferably by jet-printing. Although the main focus of this disclosure is on printing methods, electrodes <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may be deposited and patterned by more conventional methods such as sputtering or evaporation followed by photolithography and etching techniques such as wet chemical etching. Electrodes <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may also be patterned using laser ablation or laser deposition, by shadow mask evaporation or other method known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">First wall structure <b>110</b> and second wall structure <b>112</b> are then deposited such that they substantially but do not completely cover source electrode <b>106</b> and drain electrode <b>108</b>, respectively. In a preferred embodiment, first and second wall structures <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may be an insulating phase-change material that is deposited in a melted state and which then solidifies after being deposited. A wax such as a stearyl stearamide (Kemamade) is an example. The height of first and second wall structures <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are again on the order of h=0.5-10 microns above the surface of functional layer <b>104</b>. First and second wall structures <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> define a well which will receive a semiconductor material, and over which a gate electrode will be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">First wall structure <b>110</b> is deposited such that a region <b>106</b><i>a </i>of source electrode <b>106</b> is left uncovered thereby. Likewise, second wall structure <b>112</b> is deposited such that a region <b>108</b><i>a </i>of drain electrode <b>108</b> is left uncovered thereby. These exposed regions <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>a </i>become the electrical contacts for the subsequently deposited semiconducting channel material.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A semiconductor layer <b>114</b> is next printed or deposited in the well region between first and second wall structures <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, semiconductor layer <b>114</b> is a jet-printed polymer semiconductor solution. In another embodiment, semiconductor layer <b>28</b> is a precursor (including pentacene, zinc oxide or silicon precursors, as well as carbon nanotubes, silicon nanowires or nano-belts, grapheme, silicon nano-particles or other semiconducting nano-particles, nano-rods, nano-ribbons, etc.) Wall structures <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> serve to limit any spreading of semiconductor layer <b>114</b>, and thereby prevent device-to-device short circuiting. Semiconductor layer <b>114</b> makes ohmic contact with exposed regions <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>a </i>to thereby provide a channel region for a transistor device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Following deposition of semiconductor layer <b>114</b>, a first passivation layer <b>116</b> is formed thereover. This passivation layer serves as the gate dielectric layer. A gate electrode <b>118</b> may then be formed over passivation layer <b>116</b>, aligned so as to be above the well formed between wall structures <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. Gate electrode <b>118</b> is formed by depositing one or more droplets of conductive material, preferably by jet-printing. Gate electrode <b>118</b> may be entirely within the lateral width of the well formed between wall structures <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> or it may extend further (as long as it does not cause any unintended shorting to neighboring devices). As an optional final step, a second passivation layer <b>120</b> is formed over the device including gate electrode <b>118</b> and possibly over the entire device including wall structures <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, particularly if the gate dielectric is very thin. A functional top-gate semiconductor device is thereby provided.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The physics of modern electrical devices and the methods of their production are not absolutes, but rather statistical efforts to produce a desired device and/or result. Even with the utmost of attention being paid to repeatability of processes, the cleanliness of manufacturing facilities, the purity of starting and processing materials, and so forth, variations and imperfections result. Accordingly, no limitation in the description of the present disclosure or its claims can or should be read as absolute. The limitations of the claims are intended to define the boundaries of the present disclosure, up to and including those limitations. To further highlight this, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; may occasionally be used herein in association with a claim limitation (although consideration for variations and imperfections is not restricted to only those limitations used with that term). While as difficult to precisely define as the limitations of the present disclosure themselves, we intend that this term be interpreted as &#x201c;to a large extent&#x201d;, &#x201c;as nearly as practicable&#x201d;, &#x201c;within technical limitations&#x201d;, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore, while a plurality of preferred exemplary embodiments have been presented in the foregoing detailed description, it should be understood that a vast number of variations exist, and these preferred exemplary embodiments are merely representative examples, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the disclosure in any way. Various of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternative thereof, may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications. For example, separate top-gate and bottom-gate embodiments have been described above. However, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that a dual-gate (top and bottom) device can readily be obtained from the disclosure above. Such a device is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, with the top gate <b>32</b> and top-gate passivation <b>34</b> essentially being added to the device described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, the above disclosure has been based on forming a functional layer below source and drain electrodes. However, it is possible to first form the source and drain electrodes, then form the functional layer thereover. In this case, the functional layer has to be very thin to allow electron tunneling through the layer and/or to exhibit a sufficient population of pinholes for an electrical contact to form between source/drain electrodes and a semiconductor layer formed between the walls thereover. An embodiment <b>150</b> having the functional layer <b>18</b> formed over electrodes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Again, an overlap <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>a </i>is provided between a gate electrode <b>14</b> and a portion of source electrode <b>20</b><i>a </i>and drain electrode <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The method for forming such a device is substantially as described above, with the order of forming the source and drain electrodes and the functional layer simply reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations, or improvements to or on the embodiments described above may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the claims, below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Therefore, the foregoing description provides those of ordinary skill in the art with a convenient guide for implementation of the disclosure, and contemplates that various changes in the functions and arrangements of the described embodiments may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure defined by the claims thereto.</p>
