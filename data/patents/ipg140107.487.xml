<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A garment such as a shirt or pants has a front layer with portions which define a central opening defined by an inner periphery and positionable to overlie a portion of the joint to be protected such as a knee or an elbow. A removable protective insert is larger than the central opening and has a unitary cap sewn thereto. The cap has an upper segment separated from a lower segment by a bending joint defined by at least one groove which extends substantially across the cap. The upper segment and the lower segment are separately fixed to the protective insert by stitching.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT AS TO RIGHTS TO INVENTIONS MADE UNDER FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not applicable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to protective clothing in general, and more particularly to garments which incorporate pads for protection of the wearer's joints such as elbows and knees.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are many activities which require practitioners to take on cramped or reduced postures, such as crouching, crawling or lying prone, either momentarily or for extended periods. Moreover, it is sometimes necessary to assume these positions rapidly or unexpectedly. Kneeling and crawling, or collapsing to the knees, can be particularly injurious to the knees, either as a result of abrasion in the form of scraping, cutting, or puncturing, or as a result of impact or trauma. Flooring installers, carpenters, plumbers, and electricians are examples of tradesman who must occasionally or regularly spend time on their knees. Police officers, customs officials, and soldiers also are frequently required to kneel, crouch, or crawl, and often instantaneously in response to a sudden threat. Certain sporting and leisure activities can also lead to joint injuries if precautions are not taken.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional knee and elbow pads provide some measure of protection against impact by supplying a cushion over the joint. In addition, the force of a point impact can be distributed over a greater surface area by stiff shells which are fastened to the cushion. The stiff shells also provide protection against minor cuts and abrasions, while at the same time protecting the cushion itself from degradation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Elbow and knee pads are commonly of one of two types. Independent pads are mounted directly to the wearer's limbs by straps or belts. These devices offer the advantage of being securely attached in the vicinity of the joint to be protected, and being readily replaced for cleaning or repair. This type of pad is often employed where the wearer is otherwise lightly clad, such as in certain sporting activities. However, the tight elastic straps can be uncomfortable or can limit mobility. Moreover, the close-fitting pads can be especially hot during extended wear. In addition, the independent pads can be difficult to combine with other necessary garments, such as coveralls, fatigues, or jumpsuits, as the padding may, when used in combination with such clothing, restrict movement and ventilation and interfere with the garment. Furthermore, the hard shell of an independent pad, if worn interior to the garment, can result in the shredding or abrasion of the garment itself, which is caught between the hard shell of the pad and the hard exterior objects. If worn exterior to the garment, the pad can be excessively restrictive of the movement of the garment, and impair the mobility of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Garment-mounted pads are often more comfortable, and the hard shell of the pad worn on the exterior of the garment fabric serves to extend the life of the garment itself. Garment and pad wear may, however, progress at different rates, and it may be desirable to replace one and not the other. Or, it may be necessary to remove any foam padding in order to adequately wash the garment, or to safely subject the garment to drying heat. Some garments have pockets into which the foam pad is inserted, but if the hard shell is also inserted into this type of pocket, it would no longer provide protection for the garment fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 7,237,270, entitled Removable Garment Protective Assembly, discloses a joint protective pad assembly in which a protective element comprised of a foam pad and a cap is received within a frontwardly opening pocket in a garment. The protective plastic cap is stitched to the pad around a center region, such that a projecting flange is defined which overlies the pad. The margin of the pocket opening is received between the cap flange and the pad, and thereby retains the protective element in place while in use, yet allows the protective element to be readily removed for washing of the garment, or for replacement. In one embodiment two stiff caps are sewn to the foam pad and are received within two pockets. Yet even greater levels of comfort and protective efficacy are desirable, without sacrificing the convenience features of such a protective assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A garment protective assembly of this invention works to protect a wearer's joint, such as a knee or elbow, and is incorporated in a garment such as a shirt or pants. The garment has a front layer with portions which define a central opening defined by an inner periphery and positionable to overlie a portion of the joint to be protected. A removable protective insert is larger than the central opening and may be formed of resilient foam. A stiffer unitary cap is sewn to the insert. The molded cap has an upper segment separated from a lower segment by a bending joint defined by at least one groove which extends substantially across the cap. The upper segment and the lower segment are separately fixed to the protective insert by stitching. The upper segment and the lower segment have an outwardly projecting flange which overlies the protective insert, the flange having portions which engage the front layer of the garment between the cap flange and the protective insert.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The foam insert is die cut to form two sided diverging notches, one on either side of the cap, and aligned with the bending joint, which facilitate the bending of the protective insert. The wearer's comfort and freedom of movement is further aided by two notches positioned downwardly from the cap.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foam insert has two elongated slots which pierce the protective insert to permit air flow therethrough. A relief is associated with each slot which extends from a protective insert front surface to the slot, such that an air cavity is defined between the garment front layer and the slot. The garment front layer overlies each air cavity to permit ventilation therethrough to the protected joint.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of the present invention to provide a garment protective assembly which is less restrictive of the wearer's movements.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another object of the present invention to provide a garment protective assembly which facilitates air flow to the protected joint.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a garment protective assembly configured for wearer comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, wherein like numbers refer to similar parts, a protective pad assembly <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The protective pad assembly <b>20</b> is comprised of a protective element <b>22</b>, and a pocket <b>24</b> formed on a pants leg <b>26</b> of a garment <b>28</b>, for example a soldier's fatigues. The protective element <b>22</b> is symmetrical about a vertical axis, and has a cap <b>42</b> attached to an insert <b>44</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cap <b>42</b> is shown broken away generally about the vertical axis. The pocket <b>24</b> is accessible through a central opening <b>36</b>, and is not open at the top or sides as in a common pocket. Other pocket configurations may be employed, such as the ones shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,237,270, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pocket <b>24</b> is defined between a fabric front layer <b>30</b> and a frontwardly facing fabric substrate <b>32</b> of the garment <b>28</b>. The protective pad assembly illustrated is a knee pad assembly, but a similar arrangement for an elbow or other body area may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the front layer <b>30</b> is connected to the garment substrate <b>32</b> at an outer peripheral seam <b>34</b>, formed, for example, by stitching. The seam <b>34</b> may be broken at an access region <b>35</b> at the base of the pocket, to aid in removal of the insert by insertion of a finger to press up on the insert. The central opening <b>36</b> is defined in the front layer <b>30</b> and has an inner periphery <b>38</b> which may be finished by a sewn seam. It will be noted that the front layer <b>30</b> does not lie flat against the garment substrate <b>32</b>, but is spaced from the substrate to define a pocket interior cavity <b>40</b> which is dimensioned to snugly receive portions of the protective element <b>22</b>. The pocket <b>24</b> permits the insertion of portions of the protective element <b>22</b> through the frontwardly facing central opening <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The protective element <b>22</b> has a stiff but bendable cap <b>42</b> which is connected to a protective cushioning insert <b>44</b>. The insert is a tapered molded and cut sheet of cushioning material. The insert <b>44</b> is generally resilient and may be dual density polyethylene/EVA foam. If the initial foam sheet is &#xbd; inch thick, the molded and cut sheet may range in thickness from &#xbd; inch to 1/16 inch. To facilitate attachment of the cap <b>42</b> to the foam insert sheet <b>44</b> by stitching, the foam sheet is preferably produced as a fabric/foam/fabric laminate. Although the front surface need not be fabric covered, the fabric may be provided to provide a more finished appearance. The shape is given to the foam insert sheet <b>44</b> by placing it in a compression mold, and forming it with heat and pressure into the desired three-dimensional shape. The molded shape is then placed in a die cutting apparatus to trim and perforate the part. To facilitate the die cutting, the molded sheet is preferably first flattened out to aid in cutting. The foam has a low density, preferably about two pounds per cubic foot or less.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The stiff cap <b>42</b> may be fabricated of a thermoplastic elastomer such as SANTOPRENE&#xae; plastic material manufactured by Advanced Elastomer Systems of Exxon Mobil Corporation. This plastic material, although stiffer than most rubbers, nonetheless is generally softer than a plastic such as polyethylene. The stiff cap <b>42</b> may be a molded material, which preferably has a slightly convex shape to give strength and stiffness and selected to protect the joint for which it is intended. It will be noted that the stiff cap <b>42</b> has some resilience, permitting bending of portions of the cap.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cap <b>42</b> is formed as a unitary molded part, and has an upper segment <b>43</b> separated from a lower segment <b>45</b> by a bending joint <b>47</b> defined by at least one, and preferably three grooves <b>49</b> which extend substantially across the cap. Each groove <b>49</b> may be about &#x215b; inch across, and about &#x215b; inch deep at the midpoint of the cap, and may taper to a reduced or minimal depth at the edges of the cap. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the middle of the three grooves <b>49</b> may extend substantially horizontally across the cap <b>42</b>, while the upper groove may curve downwardly, and the lower groove may curve upwardly. The total distance between the upper segment center <b>48</b> and the lower segment center <b>53</b> may be approximately one inch.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each segment <b>43</b>, <b>45</b> of the cap <b>42</b> has formed therein shallow peripheral grooves <b>46</b>, <b>51</b> which encircle the segment centers <b>48</b>, <b>53</b>. The peripheral grooves <b>46</b>, <b>51</b> permit a thread <b>54</b> to be stitched through the cap and the cushioning insert <b>44</b>, thereby connecting the cap <b>42</b> to the protective cushioning insert <b>44</b> without the thread protruding outwardly from the cap. Both segments <b>43</b>, <b>45</b>, are thus independently fixed to the protective insert <b>44</b> on either side of the bending joint, to allow the flexing of the cap along the bending joint. In the illustrated knee pad, the upper segment may be smaller than the lower segment, for example a little less than one half the height of the lower segment. The cushioning insert <b>44</b> may be molded to have protruding regions <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, corresponding in shape to the segment centers <b>48</b>, <b>53</b>, to aid in the positioning and attachment of the cap <b>42</b> to the insert <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A flange <b>50</b>, about one-half inch wide, extends outwardly exterior to the grooves <b>46</b>, <b>51</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the back side of the flange <b>50</b> is preferably formed with a narrow peripheral ridge <b>52</b> which is approximately a semicylindrical bead which faces toward the pocket front layer <b>30</b> from the outside. Other effective connection mechanisms between the cap and the insert <b>44</b> may be employed, so long as the outward protrusion of the flange <b>50</b> remains. The flange <b>50</b> is thus not fixed to the insert <b>44</b> outwardly of the grooves <b>46</b>, <b>51</b>, with the result that a gap <b>56</b> is defined between the cap and the insert <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In use, the insert <b>44</b> is inserted into the interior cavity <b>40</b> of the pocket <b>24</b> such that the inner periphery <b>38</b> of the pocket front layer <b>30</b> is received within the gap <b>56</b> between the cap <b>42</b> flange <b>50</b> and the insert <b>44</b>. The cap <b>42</b> engages the material of the front layer <b>30</b>, and thereby holds the protective element <b>22</b> in place. The insert <b>44</b> may be substantially larger than the cap <b>42</b>. For example, a cap <b>42</b> which is about four inches wide and six inches high, may be connected to an insert which is about 6&#xbd; inches wide and ten inches high. The cap <b>42</b> may be positioned closer to the top of the insert <b>44</b> than to the bottom. To attach the protective element <b>22</b> to the garment <b>28</b>, the protective element is held so that the downwardly tapered insert <b>44</b> is compressed to pass through the central opening <b>36</b>. The insert <b>44</b> is advanced until the fabric of the pocket front layer <b>30</b> is received in the gap <b>56</b> beneath the beadlike ridge <b>52</b> on the rear of the cap flange <b>50</b>. The insert <b>44</b>, which is readily compressed and distorted, is then worked around the perimeter of the cap <b>42</b> so the edge of the pocket front layer goes under the cap flange.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Any tendency for the upper portion of the insert <b>44</b> to move downward in the pocket as the wearer's joint is flexed may be resisted by a two-part fastener extending between the insert <b>44</b> and the pocket front layer <b>30</b>. The two-part fastener may be a hook-and-loop fastener <b>58</b> such as VELCRO&#xae; fastener from Velcro Industries B.V., or another conventional fastener such as a snap fastener having a socket as one part, and a stud as the other part. The fastener <b>58</b> has an insert portion <b>60</b> facing frontwardly and affixed to the insert <b>44</b> above the cap, and a pocket portion <b>62</b> affixed to the pocket front layer <b>30</b> inside the pocket and facing the garment substrate <b>32</b>. When the insert <b>44</b> is in position within the pocket <b>24</b>, the two strips of hook-and-loop fastener <b>58</b> are engaged with one another to retain the protective element <b>22</b> in place. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the insert fastener portions <b>60</b> may be formed as &#x215e; inch circular units which are adhesively fastened within shallow depressions <b>61</b> molded into the insert <b>44</b>. The recessed depressions <b>61</b> help to hold the fastener portions in place over time.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when a wearer of the garment <b>28</b> kneels or bends a knee, the pants leg <b>26</b> embodying the protective pad assembly <b>20</b> will be distorted, and the protective element <b>22</b> will tend to restrict the distortion of the garment. To the extent this restriction in minimized, the wearer will experience a minimum of discomfort or interference as a result of using the protective pad assembly. Hence the protective pad assembly <b>20</b> is configured with features which facilitate the conformance of the assembly to the wearer's limb as its position changes. Two sets of notches with diverging walls are die-cut into the perimeter of the protective insert, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Upper notches <b>74</b> are positioned one on either side of the cap <b>42</b>, and aligned with the bending joint <b>47</b> of the cap, to thereby facilitate bending of the protective insert <b>44</b> as the cap is bent about the bending joint. Each notch has a narrowest point which is preferably aligned with the centermost of the grooves <b>49</b> of the bending joint <b>47</b>. Lower notches <b>76</b> are located on the protective insert one on either side of and spaced downwardly from the cap <b>42</b>, to thereby facilitate bending of the protective insert along a bend line spaced downwardly from the cap. Both sets of notches <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, are thus positioned behind the garment front layer, and thereby protected from contact with the exterior environment.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be expected that wearers of the garment protective joint assembly <b>20</b> of this invention will be involved in active endeavors such as running, kneeling, carrying out manual chores, etc. As a result, the wearer will generate body heat which it is desirable to bring into contact with cooling external air. Hence the assembly <b>20</b> is fabricated to allow air to flow through the insert <b>44</b> and carry away heat from the protected joint. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two elongated slots <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> are spaced downwardly of the cap, and pierce the protective insert <b>44</b> and permit air to flow therethrough. The slots <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> are spaced from each other on either side of a vertical centerline of the insert <b>44</b>. The slots may be about &#xbc; inch wide, and about 2&#x215b; inches long, with rounded ends. Although more slots provide more air flow, greater space devoted to slots reduces the cushioning material available to protect the wearer's joint. Therefore it is desirable to not have too much of the surface area devoted to slots. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fabric front layer <b>30</b> will tend to be stretched across the front surface <b>82</b> of the insert <b>44</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fabric front layer <b>30</b>, which is pervious to air, thus overlies the slots <b>78</b>, <b>80</b>. Yet to provide a wider air channel into each slot, the protective insert is molded to define a relief <b>84</b> which extends from the front surface <b>82</b> to the slot to thus define an air cavity between the garment front layer <b>30</b> and the slot, permitting ventilation through the insert to the protected joint. Each relief <b>84</b> has inclined or ramped side walls <b>86</b>. The relief may be from one-half to one-and-one-quarter inches across.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the protective foam insert is preferably molded and cut to have an upper edge <b>88</b> which is concave towards the wearer, so that the upper edge conforms better to the wearer, and thus tends less to interfere with the wearer's movements, and thus adds to comfortable wear of the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is understood that the invention is not limited to the particular construction and arrangement of parts herein illustrated and described, but embraces all such modified forms thereof as come within the scope of the following claims.</p>
