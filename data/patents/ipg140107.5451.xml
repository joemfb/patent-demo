<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally pertains to electronic calendaring systems, and more particularly to scheduling collaborative events in electronic calendaring systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Increasingly, various communications systems are being used to allow collaboration between geographically separate individuals. Such collaboration may be achieved through the use of teleconferences, web conferences, and the like. As such, individuals located all around the world may conveniently work together on common projects, and the like. Calendaring systems may provide a valuable tool for managing such collaborative events. However, the time and location (e.g., which may include the meeting medium, such as a teleconference) are generally up to the discretion of the individual who actually schedules the collaborative event. It may often be the case that the individual scheduling the collaborative event may schedule the collaborative event according to the scheduler's preferences and convenience. The preferences and convenience of other parties to the collaborative event, who may, for example, be separated from the scheduler by many time zones, may not always be fully considered.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a first implementation, a computer program product includes a computer readable medium having a plurality of instructions stored on it. When executed by a processor, the instructions cause the processor to perform operations including receiving an event scheduling request. A disruption factor is associated with each of a plurality of invitees. The disruption factor is based upon, at least in part, an event parameter and at least one invitee attribute. An event is scheduled based upon, at least in part, the disruption factors associated with each of the plurality of invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One or more of the following features may be included. The at least one event parameter may include one or more of an event time and an event location. The at least one invitee attribute may include a time zone location of an invitee. The instructions for associating the disruption factor with each of the plurality of invitees may include instructions for associating a weighting factor with each of the plurality of event invitees. The weighting factor may be based upon, at least in part, an invitee characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The instructions for scheduling the event based upon, at least in part, the disruption factors associated with each of the plurality of invitees may include instructions for recommending one or more of an alternative time and an alternative location. Instructions may also be included for enforcing one or more of the alternative time and the alternative location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another implementation, a computing system includes a processor and a memory module coupled with the processor. A first software module is executable by the processor and the memory module. The first software module is configured to receive an event scheduling request. A second software module is executable by the processor and the memory module. The second software module is configured to associate a disruption factor with each of a plurality of invitees. The disruption factor is based upon, at least in part, an event parameter and at least one invitee attribute. A third software module is executable by the processor and the memory module. The third software module is configured to schedule an event based upon, at least in part, the disruption factors associated with each of the plurality of invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One or more of the following features may be included. The at least one event parameter may include one or more of: an event time and an event location. The at least one invitee attribute may include a time zone location of an invitee. The second software module, which may be configured to associate the disruption factor with each of the plurality of invitees, may be further configured to associate a weighting factor with each of the plurality of event invitees. The weighting factor may be based upon, at least in part, an invitee characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The third software module, which may be configured to schedule the event based upon, at least in part, the disruption factors associated with each of the plurality of invitees, may be further configured to recommend one or more of an alternative time and an alternative location. The computing system may include a fourth software module that may be executable by the processor and the memory module. The fourth software module may be configured to enforce one or more of the alternative time and the alternative location.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to yet another implementation, a computer implemented method includes receiving an event scheduling request, and associating a disruption factor with each of a plurality of invitees. The disruption factor is based upon, at least in part, an event parameter and at least one invitee attribute. An event is scheduled based upon, at least in part, the disruption factors associated with each of the plurality of invitees. The scheduled event may be stored on a computer readable medium coupled to a computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One or more of the following features may be include. The at least one event parameter may include one or more of: an event time and an event location. The at least one invitee attribute may include a time zone location of an invitee. Associating the disruption factor with each of the plurality of invitees may include associating a weighting factor with each of the plurality of event invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Scheduling the event based upon, at least in part, the disruption factors associated with each of the plurality of invitees may include recommending one or more of an alternative time and an alternative location. The method may also include enforcing one or more of the alternative time and the alternative location.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.</p>

Equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may be a stand alone application that interfaces with calendaring server application <b>20</b> or an applet/application that is executed within calendaring server application <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The instruction sets and subroutines of calendaring server application <b>20</b>, which may be configured as one or more software modules, and which may be stored on storage device <b>16</b> coupled to server computer <b>12</b> may be executed by one or more processors (not shown) and one or more memory modules (not shown) incorporated into server computer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the equitable scheduling process is shown and described as residing on, and being executed by, server computer <b>12</b>, other implementations may equally be utilized. For example, the equitable scheduling process may be a client-side process stored on one or more storage devices (e.g., storage devices <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>) coupled to one or more client electronic devices (e.g., client electronic devices <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>; respectively). In such an implementation, the equitable scheduling process may be a stand alone application that interfaces with a calendaring client application (e.g., one or more of calendaring client application <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>) or an applet/application that is executed within a calendaring client application. As such, the equitable scheduling process may be a server-side process executed on server computer <b>12</b>, a client-side process executed by one or more client electronic device (e.g., one or more of client electronic devices <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>), or a hybrid client-side/server-side process, executed in part by server computer <b>12</b> and one or more client electronic device (e.g., one or more of client electronic devices <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The instruction sets and subroutines of calendaring client applications <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, which may be configured as one or more software modules, and which may be stored on storage devices <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> (respectively) coupled to client electronic devices <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> (respectively), may be executed by one or more processors (not shown) and one or more memory modules (not shown) incorporated into client electronic devices <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> (respectively). Storage devices <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may include but are not limited to: hard disk drives; solid state drives; tape drives; optical drives; RAID arrays; random access memories (RAM); read-only memories (ROM), compact flash (CF) storage devices, secure digital (SD) storage devices, and memory stick storage devices. Examples of computing devices <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may include, but are not limited to, personal computer <b>38</b>, laptop computer <b>40</b>, personal digital assistant <b>42</b>, notebook computer <b>44</b>, a data-enabled, cellular telephone (not shown), and a dedicated network device (not shown), for example. Using email client applications <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, users <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may access email server application <b>20</b> and may allow users to e.g., created, receive, and manage email messages.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Users <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may access calendaring server application <b>20</b> directly through the device on which the calendaring client application (e.g., calendaring client applications <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>) is executed, namely client electronic devices <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, for example. Users <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may access calendaring server application <b>20</b> directly through network <b>14</b> or through secondary network <b>18</b>. Further, server computer <b>12</b> (i.e., the computer that executes email server application <b>20</b>) may be connected to network <b>14</b> through secondary network <b>18</b>, as illustrated with phantom link line <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The various client electronic devices may be directly or indirectly coupled to network <b>14</b> (or network <b>18</b>). For example, personal computer <b>38</b> is shown directly coupled to network <b>14</b> via a hardwired network connection. Further, notebook computer <b>44</b> is shown directly coupled to network <b>18</b> via a hardwired network connection. Laptop computer <b>40</b> is shown wirelessly coupled to network <b>14</b> via wireless communication channel <b>56</b> established between laptop computer <b>40</b> and wireless access point (i.e., WAP) <b>58</b>, which is shown directly coupled to network <b>14</b>. WAP <b>58</b> may be, for example, an IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, Wi-Fi, and/or Bluetooth device that is capable of establishing wireless communication channel <b>56</b> between laptop computer <b>40</b> and WAP <b>58</b>. Personal digital assistant <b>42</b> is shown wirelessly coupled to network <b>14</b> via wireless communication channel <b>60</b> established between personal digital assistant <b>42</b> and cellular network/bridge <b>62</b>, which is shown directly coupled to network <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As is known in the art, all of the IEEE 802.11x specifications may use Ethernet protocol and carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (i.e., CSMA/CA) for path sharing. The various 802.11x specifications may use phase-shift keying (i.e., PSK) modulation or complementary code keying (i.e., CCK) modulation, for example. As is known in the art, Bluetooth is a telecommunications industry specification that allows e.g., mobile phones, computers, and personal digital assistants to be interconnected using a short-range wireless connection.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Client electronic devices <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> may each execute an operating system, examples of which may include but are not limited to Microsofti Windows&#xae;, Microsoft Windows CE&#xae;, Red Hat&#xae; Linux&#xae;, or a custom operating system (Windows CE is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation in the United States, other countries, or both).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may receive <b>100</b> an event scheduling request. Further, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may associate <b>102</b> a disruption factor with each of a plurality of invitees. The disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with each of the plurality of invitees may be based upon, at least in part, an event parameter and at least one invitee attribute. Equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may schedule <b>104</b> the event based upon, at least in part, the disruption factors associated with each of the plurality of invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, and referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a user (e.g., user <b>46</b>) may schedule an event (e.g., a meeting) via scheduling user interface <b>150</b> (e.g., which may be provided by calendaring client application <b>22</b> alone or in conjunction with calendaring server application <b>20</b>, and/or equitable scheduling process <b>10</b>). Via scheduling user interface <b>150</b>, and using one or more input devices, such as a keyboard (not shown) and a mouse (not shown), user <b>46</b> may specify, for example, a subject of the meeting (namely, &#x201c;marketing strategy&#x201d;) in subject field <b>152</b>, and a location of the meeting (namely, &#x201c;teleconference&#x201d;) in location field <b>154</b>. Similarly, user <b>46</b> may specify a start time (e.g., using pull-down menus <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>), and an end time (e.g., using pull-down menus <b>160</b>, <b>162</b>). Further, user <b>46</b> may define invitees to the meeting, e.g., in invitee pane <b>164</b>. For example, user <b>46</b> may directly define the invitees (e.g., by inputting an email address, or other identifier, of one or more intended invitees), and/or may select invitees via pull-down menu <b>166</b> (e.g., which may allow user <b>46</b> to select one or more invitees from a personal contacts list, and organization contacts list, such as and LDAP directory, or the like). Additionally, user <b>46</b> may specify whether individual invitees are necessary for the meeting or options, e.g., by checking associated checkboxes <b>168</b>, generally. Further any notes or other information relevant to the meeting may be input in notes pane <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once user <b>46</b> has defined the various attributes of the meeting, user <b>46</b> may select, e.g., using onscreen pointer <b>172</b> (which may be controlled by a pointing device, such as a mouse; not shown), &#x201c;Schedule Now&#x201d; option from a tool bar of scheduling user interface <b>150</b>. In response to user <b>46</b> selecting &#x201c;Schedule Now,&#x201d; equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may receive <b>100</b> an event scheduling request. Equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may associate <b>102</b> a disruption factor with each of a plurality of invitees. The disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with each of the plurality of invitees may be based upon, at least in part, an event parameter and at least one invitee attribute. The disruption factor may be based upon, for example, a likelihood that the proposed event (i.e., the meeting) may be disruptive and/or inconvenient to an invitee (e.g., in absolute terms and/or by comparison to the disruption and/or inconvenience that the meeting may present to another invitee).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The at least one event parameter, upon which the disruption factor associated with each of the plurality of invitees may be, at least in part, based, may include one or more of an event time and an event location. The event location may include a physical/geographic location, and may additionally/alternatively include an event format, such as a teleconference, a web conference, a virtual meeting (e.g., utilizing a common team room), or the like. Further, the at least one invitee attribute, upon which the disruption factor associated with each of the plurality of invitees may be, at least in part, based, may include a time zone location of an invitee. Additionally/alternatively, the at least one invitee attribute may be based upon, at least in part, a location of an invitee. For example, the disruption factor may be based upon, at least in part, a holiday schedule local to an invitee. For example, a meeting scheduled for July 4<sup>th </sup>may be disruptive and/or inconvenient for an invitee in the United States of America, and July 4<sup>th </sup>is a national holiday. However, July 4<sup>th </sup>may not be disruptive for an invitee outside of the United States of America. Accordingly, a disruption factor indicative of a likely disruption/inconvenience may be associated with the invitee in the United States of America, which a disruption factor associated with an invitee outside of the United States of America may not be indicative of a likely disruption/inconvenience.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Continuing with the above-stated example, the meeting scheduled by user <b>46</b> may be scheduled for the time slot of 8:00 AM-10:00 AM on Wednesday Nov. 26, 2008. User <b>46</b> may be located in Boston, Mass., placing the time zone reference for the meeting as Easter Standard Time. Further, assume that user <b>48</b>, user <b>50</b>, user <b>52</b>, and Tom Smith are all located in Sydney, Australia, while user <b>46</b> and Anthony Michaels may be located in Boston, Mass. As such, the proposed start time for the meeting would be 12:00 AM for user <b>48</b>, user <b>50</b>, user <b>52</b>, and Tom Smith. As such, the proposed time for the meeting may be disruptive for user <b>48</b>, user <b>50</b>, user <b>52</b>, and Tom Smith (e.g., by requiring their attendance at midnight). Accordingly, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may associate <b>102</b> a disruption factor indicating likely disruption (e.g., a disruption factor of &#x201c;1&#x201d;) with each of user <b>48</b>, user <b>50</b>, user <b>52</b>, and Tom Smith. Additionally, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may associate <b>102</b> a disruption factor indicating unlikely disruption (e.g., a disruption factor of &#x201c;0&#x201d;) with each of user <b>46</b> and Anthony Michaels.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While the foregoing example includes a single disruption factor indicating likely disruption and a single disruption factor indicating unlikely disruption, this is for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as a limitation of the present disclosure. For example, disruption factors may be graduate, e.g., to indicate varying likelihood of disruption. Additionally/alternative, non-numerical disruption factors and/or indicators may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Associating <b>102</b> the disruption factor with each of the plurality of invitees may include associating <b>106</b> a weighting factor with each of the plurality of event invitees. According to one aspect, the weighting factor may be based upon an anticipated contribution by an individual invitee, e.g., in terms of whether the invitee is a required invitee or an optional invitee, and whether the invitee is likely to attend the meeting. As such, the weighting factor may, for example, be utilized to reduce users from &#x201c;gaming&#x201d; the invitees of the event to achieve a favorable time or location. For example, numerous invitees from a desired location, who may be unlikely to attend the event, may be invited, thereby making it appear as though the meeting may be convenient for the majority of the invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A weighting factor based upon, at least in part, an invitees status as a required invitee or an optional invitee (e.g., as indicated by checkboxes <b>168</b>) may reduce weighting of the disruption factor associated with an optional invitee and/or may increase the weighting of the disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with a required invitee. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, user <b>52</b> may be an optional invitee (e.g., based upon an un-checked checkbox). According to one example, in determining an average disruption value for the meeting, the disruption factor associated with user <b>52</b> may only be given half-weight.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Similarly, a weighting factor associated <b>106</b> with an invitee who is unlikely to attend the event may reduce the weighting of the disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with the invitee, and/or a weighting factor associated <b>106</b> with an invitee who is likely to attend the event may increase the weighting of the disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with the invitee. The likelihood that an invitee will in fact attend the event may be based upon, for example, a history of attendance at events to which the invitee has been invited. Further, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> (alone or in conjunction with calendaring server application <b>20</b> and/or calendaring client application <b>22</b>) may poll the plurality of invitees, requiring the plurality of invitees to indicate an intention to attend or to not attend. Further, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> (alone or in conjunction with calendaring server application <b>20</b> and/or calendaring client application <b>22</b>) may additionally, monitor a change in status of each of plurality of invitees. For example, should an invitee initially accept an invitation to the event and later change the acceptance to a decline, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may associate <b>106</b> a weighting factor with the invitee indicative of a likelihood of non-attendance (e.g., in a post hoc manner).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, the weighting factor may be based upon, at least in part, an invitee characteristic. The invitee characteristic may be based upon, at least in part, a policy for determining individuals whose time is considered more valuable, and who may be required to suffer fewer disruptions. For example, Anthony Michaels may be a department head, and as such his time may be considered to be very valuable. Accordingly, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may associate <b>106</b> a weighting factor with the disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with Anthony Michaels, e.g., which give more weight to the disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with Anthony Michaels. For example, a weighting factor associated <b>106</b> with Anthony Michaels may weight the disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with Anthony Michaels to count as a full additional person having the same disruption factor as associated <b>102</b> with Anthony Michaels. Of course, various additional and/or alternative weighting schemes may be equally utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As generally stated above, weighting factors may be based upon, at least in part an invitee characteristic. The invitee characteristic may relate to a position of the invitee within an organization (such as a corporation), and/or may relate to a relative status of an invitee relative to the other invitees (e.g., based on rank, pay grade, seniority, or other characteristic that may be established, e.g., by a system administrator). Invitee characteristics may be accessible by equitable scheduling process <b>10</b>, e.g., via an organizational directory (such as a corporate LDAP directory), user profiles, or the like. Further, invitee characteristics may include interfering meetings (e.g., based upon information extracted from calendaring server application <b>20</b>). Weighting factors may be associated with an invitee based upon, at least in part, various additional/alternative characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may schedule <b>104</b> an event (e.g., the meeting) based upon, at least in part, the disruption factors associated with each invitee. For example, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may determine an average of the weighted disruption factor of the plurality of invitees. Consistent with the above-described example, user <b>48</b>, user <b>50</b>, user <b>52</b>, and Tom Smith may have an associated <b>102</b> disruption factor of &#x201c;1&#x201d;, user <b>46</b> may have an associated <b>102</b> disruption factor of &#x201c;0&#x201d;, and Anthony Michaels may have an associated <b>102</b> disruption factor of &#x201c;0&#x201d; and an associated <b>106</b> weighting factor doubling the weight of the associated <b>102</b> disruption factor. Accordingly, the average disruption factor may be 4/7 or about 57%, indicating that the meeting may be disruptive for more than half of the plurality of invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further as discussed above, a weighting factor may also be associated <b>106</b> with each of the plurality of invitees, for example, based upon, at least in part, whether each invitee is a required invitee or an optional invitee. In an embodiment in which required invitees may be given full weighting and optional invitees may be given half weighting (and counting the associated <b>106</b> weighting factor doubling the weight of the disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with Anthony Michaels), an average of the disruption factors associated <b>102</b> with each of the plurality of invitees may be 3/5.5 or about 55%. Therefore, even considering the associated <b>106</b> weighting factor based upon, at least in part, an invitees required or optional status, the average of the weighted disruption factors may indicate that the meeting, as proposed, may be disruptive for more than half of the plurality of invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Scheduling <b>104</b> the event based upon, at least in part, the disruption factors associated with each of the plurality of invitees may include recommending <b>108</b> one or more of an alternative time and an alternative location. Continuing with the above-stated example, even considering associated <b>106</b> weighting factors, the meeting may be disruptive for more than half of the plurality of invitees. Additionally, in the above-example, the meeting may be inconvenient based upon, at least in part, a difference in the time zones of the plurality of invitees. As such, one possible way to make the meeting less disruptive may be to move the time. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> (alone or in conjunction with one or more of calendaring client application <b>22</b> and/or calendaring server application <b>20</b>) may render warning <b>174</b>. Via warning <b>174</b>, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may recommend <b>108</b> rescheduling the event to 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, e.g., which may be 8:00 AM in Sydney, Australia. The recommended <b>108</b> time may be within (or closer to) normal business hours for all of the invitees, and may therefore be a less disruptive time for user <b>48</b>, user <b>50</b>, user <b>52</b>, and Tom Smith.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may recommend <b>108</b> various additional/alternative resolutions for decreasing the disruptiveness of the meeting. Examples of such recommendations may include splitting the meeting into multiple meetings (e.g., with each of the multiple meetings respectively including only those individuals for whom the meeting would be commonly non-disruptive), uninviting optional invitees, or the like. Additionally, in a situation in which the event (e.g., the meeting) is a recurring event (such as a monthly meeting), equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may additionally/alternatively recommend <b>108</b>, for example, rotating the time of the meeting between a preferred time for a first group of invitees and a preferred time for a second group of invitees. As such, over time the disruption may be equally shared by all invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may enforce <b>110</b> one or more of the alternative time and the alternative location. For example, warning <b>174</b>, which may include a recommended <b>108</b> alternative time, may only include the options to accept the recommended <b>108</b> alternative time (e.g., by selecting change button <b>176</b>) or to cancel the event completely (e.g., by selecting cancel button <b>178</b>). In the event that user <b>46</b> chooses to cancel the event (e.g., by selecting cancel button <b>178</b> using onscreen pointer <b>172</b>), user <b>46</b> may try to create a new event at a different time (e.g., of user <b>46</b>'s choosing rather than the time recommended <b>108</b> by equitable scheduling process <b>10</b>), and/or including a different set of invitees, e.g., which may result in a less disruptive event.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additionally/alternatively, and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may provide and individualized disruption factor, <b>180</b>, generally, associated with each of the plurality of invitees. While disruption factor <b>180</b> is shown including designators &#x201c;low&#x201d; and &#x201c;high&#x201d; (e.g., and which may similarly include the designator &#x201c;med&#x201d;), this should not be construed as a limitation of the present disclosure as the disruption factor associated with each of the plurality of invitees may include various additional/alternative designators (e.g., numerical, color coded flags, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition to providing an indicator of how disruptive the meeting is for the various invitees, each disruption factor <b>180</b> may be interrogated by user <b>46</b>, e.g., to ascertain the nature of the disruption giving rise to the disruption factor. For example, and referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, user <b>46</b> may &#x201c;right-click&#x201d; on disruption factor <b>180</b> associated with user <b>48</b>, resulting in equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> (alone or in conjunction with one or more of calendaring server application <b>20</b> and/or calendaring client application <b>22</b>) rendering pop-up <b>182</b>. Pop-up <b>182</b> may include information relating to the disruption factor (e.g., &#x201c;user <b>48</b> is located in Sydney, Australia (GMT+10)&#x201d;), recommendations for reducing the disruption factor associated user <b>48</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Enforcing <b>110</b> one or more of the alternative time and the alternative location may be based upon, at least in part, policies that may be established, e.g., system wide, for specific users, and/or specific groups of users. Such policies may be established by, for example, a system administrator, or the like. For example, a system administrator may associate policies with electronic meetings, such that organizational policies around disruption factors may be enforced. For example, an organization policy to minimize the disruption factor based on majority may be chosen by and administrator and may be applied to all electronic meetings automatically. This may result in the meeting scheduler not being able to refute meeting times that suited the majority from a &#x201c;least disruption&#x201d; perspective. Further, filters may be set (e.g., by the system administrator), such that certain individuals may be excluded from being disrupted. For example, a filter may be set such that an executive, or other &#x201c;important&#x201d; individual may not be disrupted, even if such a disruption would suit the majority of the invitees.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Additionally, once the event has been scheduled <b>104</b>, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> (alone or in conjunction with one or more of calendaring client application <b>22</b> and/or calendaring server application <b>20</b>) may save <b>112</b> the scheduled event on a computer readable medium coupled to a computing device (e.g., storage device <b>30</b> coupled to client electronic device <b>38</b>, storage device <b>16</b> coupled to server computer <b>12</b>, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The foregoing description has generally related to a generally real-time implementation in order to motivate corrections during the act of scheduling, e.g., in which equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may associate <b>102</b> a disruption factor with each of the plurality of invitees and may schedule <b>104</b> the event based upon, at least in part, the disruption factor associated <b>102</b> with each of the plurality of invitees while a user (e.g., user <b>46</b>) is scheduling the event via calendaring client application <b>22</b> (alone or in conjunction with calendaring server application <b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Additionally/alternatively, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may be implemented in a post hoc manner. For example, once a user (e.g., user <b>46</b>) has scheduled the event (e.g., a meeting) via calendaring user interface <b>150</b>, invitations may be sent to the plurality of invitees, in a generally conventional manner. Upon receiving (and/or at some point in time after receiving) an invitation to the meeting, one or more invitee may make a request to arbitrate a new time and/or location for the meeting. Upon making the request to arbitrate a new time and/or location for the meeting, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may associate a disruption factor with the invitee (and/or additional invitees of the meeting). Equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may schedule <b>104</b> the event including recommending <b>108</b> (e.g., to user <b>46</b> and/or to all invitees of the meeting) and alternative time and/or location for the meeting.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, in addition to motivating equitable behavior in calendaring events, equitable scheduling process <b>10</b> may collect information regarding scheduled meetings, as well as attempted scheduled meetings, over a period of time. This information may be aggregated and stored (e.g., on storage device <b>16</b> coupled to server computer <b>12</b>). The aggregated information may be analyzed (e.g., by equitable scheduling process), for example, to determine anomalies (e.g., which may include disruptive meetings and/or attempts at scheduling disruptive meetings). The determined anomalies may allow systemic decisions and actions, e.g., to rectify such anomalies and/or address causes of such anomalies.</p>
