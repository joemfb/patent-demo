<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/778,664, filed Mar. 3, 2006, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Providing successful medical care is highly dependent on the skill of health care professionals in correctly selecting and performing medical procedures and the timeliness of performing the procedures. Currently, surgeons must perform increasingly complex procedures through progressively smaller openings in their patient's bodies while incurring the lowest possible incidence of complications and side effects. The exponential growth of medical knowledge and the rapid development and deployment of new therapeutic technologies intensify these demands. These developments constitute a constantly changing standard of care in the treatment of specific conditions from which the surgeon must rapidly choose the optimal care for a given patient during a surgical procedure. These decisions must be made within the financial context of a typical hospital experiencing tighter fiscal restraints and managed and staffed by employees experiencing rapid turnovers. In such a financial context, an experienced surgeon supported by experienced technicians is a rare combination. Yet, regardless of the staff and resource support, each patient expects optimal quality and results. Accordingly, surgeons are pressured to reduce the cost of their interventions and maximize the number of patients they see. As a result, some surgeons may have sufficient time to familiarize themselves with either complex surgical devices and the specific anatomy of the patient, and to keep up with every change in medical therapeutics as it occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The challenge of providing successful medical care is further magnified in hospital emergency departments. Whereas most surgical interventions may be at least partially planned, interventions and interactions in the emergency department are completely dependent on the trauma that has occurred to the incoming patient. The emergency room (ER) care professionals may be confronted with a massive head injury, a simple laceration, a fractured bone, or massive internal bleeding. Although, ER care professionals are trained to triage these injuries to appropriate specialists, in certain situations, the appropriate specialists are not available. For instance, many rural hospitals are unable to staff a variety of specialists. Similarly, such a variety specialists are generally not present in battlefields. In these situations, the ER care professionals are unable to rely on a staffed specialist and must develop a complete diagnosis of the injuries received, and in many instances institute treatment. Where the injuries suffered by the patient are complex, the survival of the patient may ultimately hinge on a consultation with an expert specialist.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One prevalent cause of such complex injuries is motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). Particularly, MVCs are a major cause of traumatic brain injuries in persons ages 5-64 (Traumatic Brain Injury and Outcomes Associated with Motor Vehicle Crashes. University of Maryland CIREN Center. http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot/gov/pdf/nrd-50/ciren/2004/1104Maryland.pdf). However, the majority of MVCs occur in rural areas and such rural crashes are generally more serve and result in greater injury than urban crashes (<i>Contrasting Rural and Urban Fatal Crashes </i>1994-2003. NHTSA. December 2005. p I.). Thus, although expert specialists may be necessary for managing the complex injuries resulting from MVCs, the appropriate expert specialists may not be available for the majority of such injuries.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Even in situations where the assistance of expert specialists may be available, such assistance is untimely and thereby ineffective. Particularly, reliable assistance generally requires the ER care professional to contact and schedule a consultation with the appropriate specialist. In scheduling such a consultation, the ER care professional must attend to procedures required to uphold the patient's privacy rights. The delay resulting from properly acquiring of the assistance limits patient's recovery. For many complex trauma injuries, a short period of time, referred to as the &#x201c;magic hour&#x201d;, exists after the injury where prompt resuscitation is critical to the patient's recovery, and in which secondary injuries, if allowed to occur, can be devastating to the patient's recovery. Thus, a need exists for a system and method which allows a local healthcare professional to promptly and securely communicate with a remote healthcare professional.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the invention provide a local health care professional (LHCP) located at a local health care facility with on-demand, instantaneous, and specialized health care assistance by a remote health care professional (RHCP) located at a remote health care facility. Particularly, embodiments of the present invention instantaneously link the LHCP to the RHCP in response to a verbal request for assistance. Embodiments of the invention further facilitate the need for timely and effective assistance by allowing the RHCP to remotely control local devices at the local health care facility using a control form modified for use by a RHCP. Additionally, embodiments contemplate the need to protect patients' privacy by restricting the recipient of data to a particular RHCP and restricting the content and source of the data communicated to the particular RHCP. Advantageously, embodiments of the present invention improve health care by providing secure and timely remote assistance to health care professionals.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram illustrates an exemplary network environment <b>100</b> for use in a health care facility in which embodiments of the invention may be used to selectively communicate data. In general, the network environment <b>100</b> includes a local site <b>102</b> with a local user <b>104</b> and a remote site <b>106</b> with a remote user <b>108</b>. According to embodiments of the invention, the local user is a LHCP <b>104</b> and the local site is a local health care facility <b>102</b>. For example, the local user <b>104</b> may be a person who has experience and/or training as a paramedic, a medical technician, a nurse, a nurse's assistant, a physician's assistant, a physician, a veterinarian, or other administrator of health care. The local health care facility <b>102</b> may be any place where the LHCP <b>104</b> administers health care. Exemplary health care facilities include a hospital, a doctor's office, a private residence where a patient is being cared for, an ambulance or helicopter, a first aid station, a battalion aid station, and/or a mobile station. In the illustrated network environment <b>100</b>, the remote user is a RHCP <b>108</b> and the remote site is a remote health care facility <b>106</b> which may include any location where the RHCP <b>108</b> administers health care assistance. For example, the remote site <b>106</b> may the RHCP's car when the RHCP <b>108</b> provides assistance via a cellular phone, PDA, or other mobile device. In another example, the remote health care facility <b>106</b> is a hospital or doctor's office.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">While the remote health care facility <b>106</b> is located remote from the local health care facility <b>102</b>, the local and remote health care facilities <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> are connected such that the LHCP <b>104</b> is able to obtain assistance from the RHCP <b>108</b> by selectively communicating data between the two facilities, <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>. According to embodiments of the invention, the local health care facility <b>102</b> and the remote health care facility <b>106</b> are not limited to a physical location. For example, the local health care facility <b>102</b> may be a mobile aid station and the remote health care facility <b>106</b> may be the RHCP's medical office in the morning and the RHCP's personal home in the evening. Additionally, the local health care facility <b>102</b> and the remote health care facility <b>106</b> may be associated with the same entity or different entities. For example, the local health care facility <b>102</b> may be a public hospital building in Missouri and the remote health care facility <b>106</b> may be a private hospital building in Texas. In another example, the local health care facility <b>102</b> may be a hospital building on particular college campus and the remote health care facility <b>106</b> is a mile way at a doctor's office affiliated with the college.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the network environment <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the local health care facility <b>102</b> includes a local data communication network <b>112</b> in communication with the remote device <b>110</b> at the remote health care facility <b>106</b> such that the LHCP <b>104</b> and the RHCP <b>108</b> can communicate with each other through devices located at their respective remote locations. According to embodiments of the invention, the local data communication network <b>112</b> may include a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), metropolitan/municipal network (MAN), a hospital or campus area network (CAN), and/or other area networks known in the art. The remote device <b>110</b> may be directly coupled to the to the local data communication network <b>112</b> or may be coupled to another data communication network (e.g., WAN such as the Internet) which is coupled to the local data communication network <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the network environment <b>100</b> illustrated, the local health care facility <b>102</b> further includes one or more local devices <b>114</b> which are connected to the local data communication network <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the local devices <b>114</b> include a controllable component for performing one or more end functions and a controller connected to the controllable component for controlling the controllable component. The controllable component responds exclusively to signals transmitted from the controller. The controller is connected to the local data communication network <b>112</b> via a wired (e.g., wired network or direct-wired connection) or wireless (e.g., acoustic, radio frequency (RF), infrared) connection for transmitting data and/or receiving control signals/data via the local data communication network <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the local device <b>114</b> may be remotely controlled (e.g., perform specific functions) by control data transmitted via the local data communication network <b>112</b> to the controller of the local device <b>114</b>. The control signals/data received by the controller via the local data communication network <b>112</b> influences the signals used by the controller to control the controllable component. Thus, the local device <b>114</b> is responsive to the control signal provided via the local data communication network <b>112</b>. Exemplary local devices include a CT or MRI scanner, a hospital image retrieval system, hospital electronic health records (EHR), a digital stethoscope, an ultrasound device, a device for monitoring patient vital signs, a microscope, a bipolar coagulator, a camera, or any other device instrumental in administering health care.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the local device <b>114</b> includes a memory (e.g., ROM) for storing a control form. The local device <b>114</b> may also include a display for displaying the user interface and a user interface for allowing a user to interact with the control form and obtaining control data associated with the user interactions. In particular, the control form associates a particular user input with a particular control signal used by the controller to control the controllable component. For example, an MRI scanner local device has a control form which uses html language to create virtual buttons (e.g., power, scan, zoom) which are displayed via a user interface on a touch screen to allow a user to control the MRI scanner local device. In one embodiment, the control form associated with the local device <b>114</b> is used by the LHCP <b>104</b> to control the local device. In another embodiment, the control form associated with the local device <b>114</b> is additionally or alternatively communicated to the remote device <b>110</b> to allow the remote device <b>110</b> to remotely control the local device <b>114</b> via the control form. In yet another embodiment, described below, the remote device <b>110</b> controls the local device <b>114</b> using a different control form which is based on the control form associated with the local device <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The local health care facility <b>102</b> further includes a firewall <b>116</b> associated with the local data communication network <b>112</b> and a master controller <b>118</b> for controlling the communication of data. The firewall <b>116</b> includes a set of parameters to control communication via the local data communication network <b>112</b> with devices located at the local health care facility <b>102</b> (e.g., local devices). The master controller <b>118</b> controls the firewall <b>116</b> to selectively link one or more device(s) located at the health care facility to the remote device <b>110</b> via the local data communication network <b>112</b> and selectively permits the device(s) to transmit data signals via the link and receive control signals via the link. For instance, the master controller <b>118</b> may control the firewall <b>116</b> parameters to allow local device N (<b>114</b>-N) to transmit data signals to and receive control signals from the remote device <b>110</b> via the local data communication network <b>112</b> while restricting local devices <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> (<b>114</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>114</b>-<b>2</b>) from communicating via the local data communication network <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the firewall <b>116</b> is a software program residing on the master controller <b>118</b>. In another embodiment, a device separate from the master controller <b>118</b> includes the firewall <b>116</b> and the master controller <b>118</b> is connected to the device which includes the firewall <b>116</b>. For example, the firewall <b>116</b> is a hardware device or a portion of a hardware device which is connected to the local data communication network <b>112</b> and the master controller <b>118</b> is also connected to the local data communication network <b>112</b> such that the master controller <b>118</b> can control the firewall <b>116</b>. In another example, the firewall <b>116</b> is a software program or application residing on a hardware device which is connected to the local data communication network <b>112</b> and the master controller <b>118</b> is also connected to the local data communication network <b>112</b> such that the master controller <b>118</b> can control the firewall <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The local health care facility <b>102</b> further includes an input device <b>120</b> connected to the master controller <b>118</b> via a wire (e.g., USB) or wireless (e.g., acoustic, radio frequency (RF), infrared) connection for providing a control interface to the LHCP <b>104</b>. The input device <b>120</b> obtains an input from the LHCP <b>104</b> and transmits a data signal representative of the input from the LHCP <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the input indicates a particular parameter of the firewall <b>116</b>. In another embodiment, the input additionally or alternatively includes data for communicating to the remote health care facility <b>106</b>. Exemplary input devices <b>120</b> include a keyboard, a mouse, a switch, a microphone, or a joystick. In one embodiment, the input device <b>120</b> includes an output component for receiving a signal from the master controller <b>118</b> and delivering data representative of the received signal to the LHCP <b>104</b>.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exemplary system employing the network environment <b>100</b> is used to provide the LHCP <b>104</b> with on-demand, instantaneous, and specialized health care assistance by the RHCP <b>108</b> at the remote health care facility <b>106</b>. The LHCP <b>104</b> is equipped with the master controller <b>118</b> for initiating assistance and controlling communication via a first network <b>112</b> (e.g., local area network). In one embodiment, the master controller <b>118</b> is a small computing device that is affixed to the body of the LCHP, minimizing cables which clutter health care facility rooms. For example, the master controller <b>118</b> is attached to a belt worn by the LHCP <b>104</b> and operates under battery power. In this example, the belt may include slots securing extra charged batteries. In one embodiment, the master controller <b>118</b> runs software programs (e.g., voice recognition) to interface with input devices <b>120</b> and/or output devices connected to the master controller <b>118</b>. In one embodiment, the master controller <b>118</b> includes a removable memory device for storing data associated with the LHCP <b>104</b>. For example, the master controller <b>118</b> includes a secure digital card which has preferences (e.g., preferences for control forms for controlling local devices) and speech files associated with the LHCP <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An imaging device <b>120</b> located at the local health care facility <b>102</b> is wire (e.g., USB) or wirelessly (e.g., acoustic, radio frequency (RF), infrared) coupled to the master controller <b>118</b> for generating a video signal representative of images at the local health care facility <b>102</b>. The master controller <b>118</b> receives the video signal from the imaging device <b>120</b> and adapts it (e.g., using MPEG-4) for sending to the RHCP <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the imaging device <b>120</b> is affixed to the LHCP <b>104</b>. In another embodiment, the imaging device <b>120</b> further includes a light. For example, a camera with an integrated light is attached to protective eyewear worn by the LHCP <b>104</b> and is connected by a cable to the master controller <b>118</b> attached to the belt worn by the LHCP <b>104</b>. Advantageously, the LHCP <b>104</b> does not have to hold the camera and the light enhances the visibility of dark areas and serves as a guide allowing the LHCP <b>104</b> to aim the camera at a particular area (e.g., a body cavity of a patient undergoing surgery).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An input device <b>120</b>, such as an audio device <b>204</b>, located at the local health care facility <b>102</b> is wire or wirelessly coupled to the master controller <b>118</b> for generating audio signals representative of a sound patterns verbally created by the LHCP <b>104</b>. The master controller <b>118</b> receives the audio signals from the imaging device <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the master controller <b>118</b> recognizes the audio signal as a particular verbal request by the LHCP <b>104</b> and responds to the request. Requests made by the LHCP <b>104</b> may include initiating communication with a remote device <b>110</b>/RHCP <b>108</b>, permitting transmission of data signals from devices located at the local health care facility <b>102</b>, and permitting the receipt by devices located at the local health care facility <b>102</b> of data signals and/or control signals transmitted from devices located remote to the local health care facility <b>102</b>, and permitting the receipt and/or transmission between devices located at the local facility. For example, the LHCP <b>104</b> says &#x201c;initiate communication with Dr. Jones&#x201d;, the audio device <b>204</b> generates an audio signal representative of the request, the master controller <b>118</b> recognizes the audio signal (e.g., using voice recognition software running on the master controller <b>118</b> and speech files stored on a memory card read by the master controller <b>118</b>) as a request to communicate with Dr. Jones and responds to the request by linking a remote device <b>110</b> associated with Dr. Jones to the master controller <b>118</b>. In another embodiment, the master controller <b>118</b> additionally or alternatively adapts the audio signal for sending to the RHCP <b>108</b>. For example, the LHCP <b>104</b> says &#x201c;the patient was in a car accident approximately 20 minutes ago and has been unconscious for the last 7 minutes,&#x201d; the audio device <b>204</b> generates an audio signal representative of the information, and the master controller <b>118</b> adapts the audio signal (e.g., using MPEG-4) for sending to the remote device <b>110</b> of the RHCP <b>108</b> (e.g., Dr. Jones). In one embodiment, the audio device <b>204</b> also includes an output component for generating a sound pattern from an audio signal received from the master controller <b>118</b>. For example, an audio signal representative of the RHCP's verbal instructions is transmitted via the first data network <b>112</b> to the master controller <b>118</b> and is in turn received by the audio device <b>204</b>. The audio device <b>204</b> generates a sound pattern which can be heard by the LHCP <b>104</b>. Thus, the LHCP <b>104</b> and the RHCP <b>108</b> can communicate verbally. In the illustrated embodiment, the audio device <b>204</b> is affixed to the LHCP <b>104</b>. For example, the audio device <b>204</b> is a headset worn by the LHCP <b>104</b> and is connected by a cable to the master controller <b>118</b> attached to the belt worn by the LHCP <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The master controller <b>118</b> having the audio device <b>204</b> and the imaging device <b>120</b> coupled thereto is connected wire or wirelessly to the first network <b>112</b> (e.g., local area network) located at the local health care facility <b>102</b>. The first network <b>112</b> is associated with a programmable firewall <b>116</b> controlling communication on the first network <b>112</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the master controller <b>118</b> controls the firewall <b>116</b> as a function of the audio signal received by the audio device <b>204</b>. For example, the LHCP <b>104</b> says &#x201c;transmit video signal to remote device <b>110</b>&#x201d;, the audio device <b>204</b> generates an audio signal representative of the request, and the master controller <b>118</b> receives and recognizes the request. The master controller <b>118</b> then transmits to the firewall <b>116</b> a signal to program the firewall <b>116</b> so as to permit the video signal from the imaging device <b>120</b> to transmit video signals to the remote device <b>110</b>. The firewall <b>116</b> also controls communication (e.g., transmission of data signals and receiving of control signals) of local devices <b>114</b> at the local health care facility <b>102</b> which are connected wire or wirelessly to the first network <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, the master controller <b>118</b> specifies particular content permitted for sending in the data signal to the RHCP <b>108</b> via the first network <b>112</b>. For example, the LCHP says &#x201c;transmit electronic hospital records for current patient,&#x201d; the master controller <b>118</b> accordingly controls the firewall <b>116</b> to allow the transmission of only those hospital records for the current patient, and the local device which includes electronic hospital records transmits a data signal to the RHCP <b>108</b> which includes the hospital records for the current patient only. Advantageously, the LHCP <b>104</b> is able to quickly communicate vital information with the RHCP <b>108</b> while protecting patient privacy by preventing the RHCP <b>108</b> from accessing other patient records and sharing the current patient information exclusively with the RHCP <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plurality of remote devices <b>110</b> located at one or more remote health care facilities <b>106</b> is connected to a second network <b>206</b> (e.g., the Internet) which is connected to the first network <b>112</b> (e.g., local health care facility <b>102</b> trauma bay intranet). Each of the remote device <b>110</b><i>s </i>are associated with providing a particular assistance to the LHCP <b>104</b>. For example, a first remote device <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> is a PDA of a cardiologist for providing remote cardiology assistance, a second remote device <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> is a computing device located in the neurosurgery department of hospital in Kansas for providing remote assistance with neurosurgery, and a third remote device <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> is a computing device located in the pediatric surgery department of a hospital in Missouri for providing assistance with pediatric patients. A processing device <b>208</b> is coupled to the remote device <b>110</b><i>s </i>and the devices at the local health care facility <b>102</b> for locating the appropriate remote device <b>110</b> based on a communication request from the LHCP <b>104</b>. The processing device <b>208</b> is coupled to the plurality remote devices <b>110</b> via the second network <b>206</b> and to the master controller <b>118</b> and the local devices via the first network <b>112</b>. For example, the processing device <b>208</b> may be a server having a website associated therewith and the first, second, and third remote devices <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>, and the master controller <b>118</b>, and the local devices <b>114</b> are connected to the website. In the illustrated embodiment, the master controller <b>118</b> sends data to the processing device <b>208</b> via the first network <b>112</b> to initiate remote communication. The data indicates one or more devices located at the local health care facility <b>102</b> (e.g., the imaging device <b>120</b>, the audio device <b>204</b>, the local devices) selected by the LHCP <b>104</b> via the master controller <b>118</b> for linking to a remote device <b>110</b>. The processing device <b>208</b> locates the appropriate remote device <b>110</b> based on the data, and the remote device <b>110</b> is then linked to the selected device(s) for communicating in accordance with the firewall <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the data sent to the processing device <b>208</b> for initiating communication identifies a specific remote device <b>110</b> (e.g., IP address, or hospital+RHCP's name). In another embodiment, the data sent identifies one or more medical credentials of a RHCP <b>108</b> (e.g., neurosurgeon) and the processing device <b>208</b> locates the second remote device <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> (e.g., the computing device associated with neurosurgery department) where the second remote device <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> is available and connected to the processing device <b>208</b> (e.g., logged into the website). In yet another embodiment, the data includes a general request for remote communication and additional data which responds to the processing device <b>208</b> prompting the master controller <b>118</b> for additional data needed to locate the particular remote device <b>110</b>. For example, the LHCP <b>104</b> says &#x201c;initiate communication&#x201d; and the master controller <b>118</b> sends a corresponding data signal (e.g., a first collection of data) to the processing device <b>208</b> for requesting communication with a remote device. The processing device <b>208</b> receives the data and then prompts the master controller <b>118</b> for additional data needed to locate/identify a particular remote device <b>110</b>. For instance, the processing device <b>208</b> may include an automated audio system or a live receptionist that receives the request and responds by sending the master controller <b>118</b> an audio signal asking the type of injury suffered by the patient. The master controller <b>118</b> transmits a data signal (e.g., second collection of data) responding to the inquiry in accordance with the LHCP's verbal response (e.g., &#x201c;heart attack&#x201d;) via the audio device <b>204</b>.</p>

Thus, the processing device <b>208</b> simultaneously receives the video stream from the imaging device <b>120</b> and the MRI Scanner, text data from the MRI Scanner and the EHR device, and audio streams (not shown) from the audio device <b>204</b>. Concurrent with the receiving of multiple data streams, the processing device <b>208</b> additionally transmits multiple streams of data to the devices located at the local hospital facility. Advantageously, the processing device <b>208</b> simultaneously processes multiple bidirectional data streams associated with multiple devices and displays the processed data on a single user-friendly web page allowing the RHCP <b>108</b> to provide efficient assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the illustrated embodiment, LHCP <b>104</b>, Dr. John Smith <b>302</b> at local health care facility, MO HOS44 <b>304</b>, has requested remote communication. For example, Dr. John Smith has verbally requested communication and the master controller <b>118</b> has transmitted a signal to the processing device <b>208</b> requesting communication and identifying Dr. John Smith as the LHCP <b>104</b> and MO HOS44 as the local health care facility <b>102</b>. The master controller <b>118</b> has provided the processing device <b>208</b> with data for locating a remote device <b>110</b> associated with RHCP <b>108</b>, Dr. Mary Jones <b>306</b>, at remote health care facility <b>106</b> MO HOS82 <b>308</b>. Additionally, the master controller <b>118</b> has controlled the firewall <b>116</b> associated with the network at MO HOS44 in order selectively link devices at the local health care facility <b>102</b> (the local camera, the MRI Scanner, and the Electronic Hospital Records Device (HOS44 EHR)) to the remote device <b>110</b>. The processing device <b>208</b> processes data communicated from the local health care facility <b>102</b> and includes content from the data on the web page. A display and a user interface (e.g., web browser) associated with the remote device <b>110</b> displays the web page <b>300</b> and allows the user to interact with the web page. The processing device <b>208</b> processes signals transmitted from the remote device <b>110</b> to the processing device <b>208</b> indicating the user's interactions with the web page.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the screenshot illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the web page includes displayed control forms <b>310</b> associated with local devices selectively linked to the remote device <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the processing device <b>208</b> includes a memory and stores a primary control form and data associating the control form with the local device. In another embodiment, the local device <b>114</b> stores the primary control form and transmits the control form to the processing device <b>208</b> when the local device <b>114</b> is linked to the remote device <b>110</b>. Accordingly, the processing device <b>208</b> configures the web page based on the stored or received control forms. In one embodiment, the processing device <b>208</b> may modify the primary control form and include the modified control form on the webpage. The modification may be based on data stored by the processing device <b>208</b>, data received from the local health care facility <b>102</b> via the first and second networks, and/or data received from the remote health care facility <b>106</b> via the second network.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C, in one embodiment, the processing device <b>208</b> displays a control form <b>310</b>-A, <b>310</b>-B (e.g., graphic user interface). The displayed control forms <b>310</b>-A, <b>310</b>-B are generated by modifying the primary control forms <b>300</b>-A, <b>300</b>-B based on the identity of the RHCP <b>108</b>. According to the embodiment illustrated by FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>C, the processing device <b>208</b> modifies the primary control form <b>300</b>-A, <b>300</b>-B based on preferences associated with the RHCP <b>108</b>. The processing device <b>208</b> stores preferences associated with identifying information associated with the RHCP <b>108</b> (e.g., a login ID). When the RHCP <b>108</b> logins to provide remote assistance, the processing device <b>208</b> modifies the control forms of local devices according to the preferences. The primary control form for the MRI scanner <b>300</b>-A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> locates the X and Y coordinates on the X and Y axis of the associated image, the zoom button at the top of the control form, and the rotate button at the bottom of the control form. The RHCP <b>108</b> has preferences indicating a different location for the X and Y axis and to hide the rotate button as shown in the displayed control form <b>310</b>-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. According to the embodiment illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, the processing may additionally or alternatively modify the primary control form <b>300</b> based on an access level associated with the RHCP <b>108</b>. The access level could be based on a number of factors such as the relationship between the patient and the doctor (e.g., whether the doctor is the primary doctor), the type of RHCP <b>108</b> (e.g., technicians restricted to particular controls), the relevancy of the information, whether patient has signed a release for the information). The primary control form associated with the EHR <b>300</b>-B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> includes buttons for accessing mental health records and a picture of the selected patient. These buttons are eliminated from the control form <b>310</b>-B displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> because Dr. Mary Jones is not associated with access to the buttons.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the processing device <b>208</b> displays a control form <b>310</b> which additionally or alternatively modifies the primary control form <b>300</b> in order to standardize the control form. Particularly, the primary control form <b>300</b> is modified to standardize at least one feature associated with a function performed by local devices <b>114</b> located at a plurality of remote health care facilities <b>108</b> so that the standardized feature appears substantially similar in the control forms <b>310</b> displayed for each of the local devices <b>114</b>. In one example, for all devices having an on/off function, the &#x201c;power&#x201d; button associated with the on/off function is shaded and located at the lower right hand side of the control form <b>310</b>-A, <b>310</b>-B. In another example, all devices of a particular type, such as all MRI scanning devices (regardless of the model number) display the image on the left side of the control form <b>310</b>-A and use scroll bars adjust the image (e.g., rather than buttons, touching on the edge of the image, dragging the edge of the image). Advantageously, standardizing features of the control form eliminates the time required for the RHCP <b>108</b> to become familiar with the particular controls of a particular local device <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates operations for selectively communicating between a LHCP <b>104</b> at a local health care facility <b>102</b> and a RHCP <b>108</b> at a remote health care facility <b>106</b> via a data communication network (e.g., <b>112</b> and <b>206</b>) according to an embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, the data communication network includes a network <b>112</b> associated with the local health care facility <b>102</b> and controlled by a firewall <b>116</b>. At <b>400</b>, the imaging device <b>120</b> generates a video signal (e.g., video of injured portion of patient). In one embodiment the imaging device <b>120</b> is a camera coupled to a controller <b>118</b> and the controller <b>118</b> is connected to the data communication network. At <b>402</b>, the audio device <b>204</b> generates a first permission signal. In one embodiment, the audio signal is representative of a request verbalized by the LHCP <b>104</b> (e.g., &#x201c;permit transmission of imaging signal from imaging device <b>120</b> and audio communication with the audio device <b>204</b>&#x201d;). The request permits transmitting of the video signal generated by the imaging device <b>120</b> via the data communication network to the RHCP <b>108</b> and permits transmitting to and receiving from the RHCP <b>108</b> audio signal via the data communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The audio signal is received by the controller <b>118</b> and the controller <b>118</b> recognizes the communication request. In one embodiment, the controller <b>118</b> has voice recognition software and speech files associated with the LHCP <b>104</b> which are used to recognize the communication request. At <b>404</b>, the controller <b>118</b> configures the firewall <b>116</b> associated with data communication network as a function of the permissions included in the first audio signal. Thus, the controller <b>118</b> configures the firewall <b>116</b> to allow the transmission of the video signal to the RHCP <b>108</b> and to allow bidirectional communication of audio signals between the RHCP <b>108</b> and the audio device <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">At <b>406</b>, the audio device <b>204</b> audio device <b>204</b> generates audio signals including information verbalized by the LHCP <b>104</b> for to communicating to the RHCP <b>108</b> (e.g., status of the patient, information regarding the patient's injuries, questions regarding patient diagnosis/treatment). The controller <b>118</b> receives the audio signals including the information and determines the signal is not a communication request. The controller <b>118</b> then converts the audio signal to be transmitted via the data communication network. The controller <b>118</b> similarly receives the video signal generated by the imaging device <b>120</b> and converts the video signal to be transmitted via the data communication network. At <b>408</b>, the controller <b>118</b> transmits the converted video and audio information signals to a remote device <b>110</b> associated with the RHCP <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, a processing device <b>208</b> connected to the data communication network, such as a server associated with a website/web pages, is used to locate an appropriate remote device <b>110</b> and a particular RHCP <b>108</b>. The appropriate remote device <b>110</b> then accesses the video signals through a web page via the data communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At <b>410</b>, one or more local devices located at the local health care facility <b>102</b> generate data signals. For example, a heart monitor obtains data regarding the functioning of the patient's heart and an MRI scanner is initialized and generates a data signal indicating a &#x201c;ready&#x201d; status. At <b>412</b>, the audio device <b>204</b> generates a second permission signal. In one embodiment, the second permission signal is representative of a second communication request verbalized by the LHCP <b>104</b>. For example, the second communication request permits one or more local devices located at the local health care facility <b>102</b> and coupled to the data communication network to transmit data signals to the remote device <b>110</b> and receive control signals from the remote device <b>110</b> via the data communication network. In another example, the second communication request specifies the particular content of the data permitted to be included in the data signals (e.g., restrictions based on a particular patient, a particular injury received by a particular patient, information obtained during a certain time period regarding a particular patient, information obtained from a particular source regarding a particular patient) transmitted by the local device(s). Similarly, the second communication request may also specify the particular content permitted to be included in the control signals (e.g., restrictions based on functions the LCHP designates to be remote controlled, restrictions based on the identity of the RHCP <b>108</b>) received by the local device(s).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The second audio permission signal is received by the controller <b>118</b> and the controller <b>118</b> recognizes the communication request. In one embodiment, the controller <b>118</b> has voice recognition software and speech files associated with the LHCP <b>104</b> which are used to recognize the second communication request. At <b>414</b>, the controller <b>118</b> configures the firewall <b>116</b> associated with data communication network as a function of the permissions included in the second audio permission signal. Thus, the controller <b>118</b> configures the firewall <b>116</b> to allow the transmission of the data signal(s) to the remote device <b>110</b> and to allow the local device(s) to receive control signal(s) via the data communication network from the remote device <b>110</b>. At <b>416</b>, the local device(s) transmit data signal(s) as requested by the LHCP <b>104</b> to the remote device <b>110</b> via the data communication network. In one embodiment, the processing device <b>208</b> processes the data signals such that they are included in the web page along with the video signal from the imaging device <b>120</b> which is accessed by the remote device <b>110</b> via the data communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At <b>418</b>, the controller <b>118</b> receives audio signals generated by the RHCP <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the RHCP <b>108</b> has an audio device <b>204</b> which generates the audio signals from information verbalized by the RHCP <b>108</b> and transmits the audio signals to the controller <b>118</b> via the data communication network. The controller <b>118</b> sends the audio signals to the audio device <b>204</b>. At <b>420</b>, the audio device <b>204</b> generates a sound pattern from the received audio signals representative of the audio signals verbalized by the RHCP <b>108</b>. Thus, the bidirectional transmission of audio signals via the data communication network, controller <b>118</b>, and audio controller <b>118</b> allows the LHCP <b>104</b> and the RHCP <b>108</b> to verbally communicate remotely.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also at <b>418</b>, the local device(s) receive control signals for controlling a function performed by the local device(s). In one embodiment, a control form is used to associate inputs by the RHCP <b>108</b> to the remote device <b>110</b> with control signals. In another one embodiment, the control form is processed by the processing device <b>208</b> and accessed by the remote device <b>110</b> via the web page (or other web page included in the web site) and the data communication network. In yet another embodiment, the processing device <b>208</b> includes a modified control form in the web page for being accessed by the remote device <b>110</b> via the web page and the data communication network. At <b>422</b>, the local device(s) perform the function associated with the control signal in response to receiving the control signal from the RHCP <b>108</b>.</p>
