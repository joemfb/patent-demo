<p id="p-0002" num="0001">As network operators and service providers strive to provide new or improved services and/or assets to users, network demands may correspondingly increase. As a result, network operators and service providers must confront a host of challenges to ensure that quality of service (QOS) and other performance metrics are maintained. For example, one important challenge confronted by network operators and service providers is to ensure that service is not degraded or minimally degraded due to failures in the network.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Link and node failures may occur unexpectedly in a network and there are numerous techniques to manage these issues. In a multicast network, a source device may transmit multicast packets to multiple destination devices. Unlike a broadcast transmission, a multicast transmission corresponds to a transmission to a subset of all destination devices. When a failure occurs or exists during a multicast transmission, the aim is to achieve fast restoration while minimizing added network operation complexities, overhead, congestion, etc. Time-sensitive and real-time transmissions (e.g., video, audio, telephony, streaming media, push-to-talk, etc) versus non-real-time or non-time-sensitive transmissions add further complexities to achieve fast restoration. Other issues arise when not all routing nodes have knowledge of the multicast group pertaining to the multicast transmission. Additionally, reverse path forwarding (RPF) checks can result in dropped packets when detecting a wrong ingress interface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One approach to attain fast restoration involves building backup trees. However, this approach can become very cumbersome as numerous failure scenarios applied to numerous sub-tress can result in numerous backup trees for a multicast group. This is particularly true when the network is not fully-meshed or nearly fully-meshed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;packet,&#x201d; as used herein, is intended to be broadly interpreted to include a data transmission or communication, the packaging of which may correspond to, for example, a packet, a cell, a frame, a datagram, some other type of container or unit of data, and/or a fragment thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to exemplary embodiments, routing nodes may include unicast information with multicast packets when a network failure occurs to permit the multicast packets to be re-routed. According to an exemplary embodiment, a multicast packet may be encapsulated with unicast information. For example, the unicast information may be encapsulated as a unicast header and/or a unicast trailer. According to other embodiments, the unicast information may be included in an options field, a reserved field, an extension field, and/or some other available field(s), depending on the format of the multicast packet.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an exemplary embodiment, the unicast information may include a source address of the routing node that includes the unicast information and a destination address of another routing node. According to an exemplary embodiment, the destination address may correspond to a neighbor routing node of the routing node to which the multicast packet was not successfully delivered (e.g., due to node failure and/or link failure). According to another exemplary embodiment, the destination address may correspond to the routing node to which the multicast packet was not successfully delivered.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an exemplary embodiment, a routing node that receives the multicast packet including the unicast information may route the multicast packet including the unicast information toward the unicast destination address. When the routing node corresponds to the destination routing node, the routing node may determine whether the routing node is a part of the multicast group. For example, the routing node may inspect a multicast group address included in the multicast packet and recognize whether or not it is part of the multicast group. If the routing node determines that is not part of the multicast group, the routing node may discard or drop the multicast packet. On the other hand, if the routing node determines that it is a part of the multicast group, the routing node may process the multicast packet normally.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an exemplary embodiment, the processing of the multicast packet may include the routing node determining whether the multicast packet is a duplicate multicast packet. By way of example, the routing node may determine whether the multicast packet is a duplicate based on, for example, a sequence number included in the multicast packet. Alternatively, the routing node may use other conventional techniques to determine whether a multicast packet is a duplicate based on the format of the multicast packet and information included therein. If the multicast packet is a duplicate, the routing node may discard or drop the multicast packet. If it is determined that the multicast packet is not a duplicate, the routing node may not drop or discard the multicast packet. Rather, the routing node may continue to process the multicast packet, which may include routing the multicast packet to its next multicast hop (e.g., another routing node, a receiver (e.g., an end user device, etc.). According to another exemplary embodiment, the routing node may not be able to determine whether the multicast packet is a duplicate (e.g., no sequence number or other information included in the multicast packet to permit the routing node to make such a determination, etc.) or duplicate multicast packets may be managed by the receiver. According to this embodiment, the routing node may route the multicast packet to its next multicast hop.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According an exemplary embodiment, the routing node may decapsulate the unicast information from the unicast-encapsulated multicast packet or may remove the unicast information from the multicast packet when the routing node recognizes that a unicast destination address included in the unicast information corresponds to its own unicast address. According to another exemplary embodiment, the routing node may decapsulate the unicast information from the unicast-encapsulated multicast packet or may remove the unicast information from the multicast packet when the routing node recognizes that it is a part of the multicast group. According to yet another exemplary embodiment, the routing node may decapsulate the unicast information from the unicast-encapsulated multicast packet or may remove the unicast information from the multicast packet when the routing node recognizes that the multicast packet is not a duplicate.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, it may be assumed that a sender (e.g., device <b>115</b>, user device <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) sends a multicast packet to network <b>105</b>, and the multicast packet is received by routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>. In this example, the multicast packet may include the source address of the sender and a multicast group address. According to other embodiments, the addressing used for a multicast transmission may be different. Upon receipt of the multicast packet, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> may inspect the multicast packet and determine that the multicast packet should be sent to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>. Routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> may send the multicast packet to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>. For example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> may not be aware of the link failure between routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> and routing <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>.

In this example, the unicast path may be considered distinguishable from a multicast path since, in this example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> may not be a part of the multicast group pertaining to the multicast packet. Routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> may encapsulate the multicast packet with a unicast header to generate a unicast-encapsulated multicast packet.

However, since the multicast packet is unicast-encapsulated, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> may not drop the multicast packet.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As previously described, routing node <b>110</b> may provide multicast fast rerouting. Provided below are further examples and discussion pertaining to exemplary embodiments of the multicast fast rerouting.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are diagrams illustrating an exemplary process for providing multicast fast rerouting when a link failure occurs. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, according to this exemplary scenario, a sender may send multicast packets to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, which propagate to routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>, and <b>110</b>-<b>6</b>. Upon receipt by routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b>, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may send the multicast packets to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b>, however, due to a link failure, the multicast packets are not received by routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Depending on the protocols, network topology management, and/or link state management used by network <b>105</b> (e.g., by routing nodes <b>110</b>, etc.), as well as other factors (e.g., time of failure relative to time of receipt of multicast packets), routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may or may not determine or have knowledge that the link between routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> and routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> has failed. According to an exemplary embodiment, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may determine or has knowledge that the link has failed. For example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may use a link state protocol (e.g., Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), etc.) and/or other conventional techniques. According to another embodiment, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may not determine or has knowledge that the link has failed, but may recognize that the multicast packets have not been successfully forwarded and/or received by routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b>. For example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may not receive an acknowledgement from routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> and/or other conventional techniques may be used.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, based on the determination of link failure, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may determine to send the multicast packets as a unicast transmission. For example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may select a path (e.g., a unicast path) to reach routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b>. According to this example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may choose to send unicast-encapsulated multicast packets to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> via routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b>. Additionally, as illustrated, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may perform unicast encapsulation with respect to the multicast packets. The unicast encapsulation may include unicast information that at least includes a destination address of routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b>. The unicast information may also include a network address of routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> (e.g., as the source address).

Routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> may perform unicast decapsulation with respect to the received unicast-encapsulated multicast packets. Thereafter, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> (i.e., by solid arrows), routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> may send the multicast packets to routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>9</b> and <b>110</b>-<b>11</b>. Routing node <b>110</b>-<b>11</b> may route the multicast packets to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>12</b>. According to other embodiments, as previously described, encapsulation and decapsulation may not be used. For example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may insert unicast information to an available field(s) of the multicast packets, and routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> may remove the unicast information from these fields.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the above example, multicast packets are rerouted to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> via routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b> when a link failure occurs.

As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b> may determine, however, that the multicast packets are duplicates (e.g., based on the multicast packets sent to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>4</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), and routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>9</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>110</b>-<b>12</b> may determine that the multicast packets are not duplicates. According to another exemplary embodiment, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may not send the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets to routing <b>110</b>-<b>5</b>, despite the fact that routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b> is a neighboring routing node <b>110</b> of routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b>, because routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> has knowledge that the multicast packets previously sent (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), where successfully transmitted and/or received by routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b>. In this way, additional overhead in network <b>105</b> may be avoided. Routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>9</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>110</b>-<b>12</b> may perform unicast decapsulation with respect to the received unicast-encapsulated multicast packets.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b> may drop the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets. Routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>9</b> and <b>110</b>-<b>11</b> may forward the multicast packets to their next multicast hop (e.g., towards a receiver, another routing node <b>110</b>, etc.). In this example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>12</b> may recognize that it is not part of the multicast group, and may drop the multicast packets. According to other embodiments, as previously described, encapsulation and decapsulation may not be used. For example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may insert unicast information to an available field(s) of the multicast packets, and the neighboring routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>9</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>110</b>-<b>12</b> may remove the unicast information from these fields.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to an exemplary embodiment, when duplicate multicast packets are received, routing nodes <b>110</b> may give preference to multicast packets over unicast-encapsulated multicast packets when it comes to determining duplicates and dropping duplicates. That is, routing nodes <b>110</b> may drop unicast-encapsulated multicast packets instead of multicast packets. According to other exemplary embodiments, routing nodes <b>110</b> may not give preference to multicast packets. Rather, routing nodes <b>110</b> may simply drop the later-arriving multicast packet (i.e., the multicast packet or the unicast-encapsulated multicast packet). According to other embodiments, routing nodes <b>110</b> may not be able to determine whether multicast packets are duplicates (e.g., not enough information in the header to determine whether the multicast packet is a duplicate, etc.). Under such circumstances, routing nodes <b>110</b> may route multicast packets that may be duplicates. However, the receiver may be able to manage the duplicate problem, if it should exist.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref> are diagrams illustrating another exemplary process for providing multicast fast rerouting when a node failure occurs. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, according to an exemplary scenario, a sender may send multicast packets to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, which may be routed to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>. Upon receipt of the multicast packets, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> may send the multicast packets to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>. However, due to node failure of routing node <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>, the multicast packets are not received by routing node <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>. In this example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> is the last-hop, multicast routing node before the receiver. Additionally, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>3</b> may be the routing node to forward multicast packets to both routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>110</b>-<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, based on the determining of node failure (or failed transmission/receipt of multicast packets), and according to this example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> may select all neighboring routing nodes (i.e., excluding routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>) of routing node <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>. For example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> may select routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>110</b>-<b>8</b>. As further illustrated, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> may perform unicast encapsulation to the multicast packets. Routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>2</b> may send the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets to routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>110</b>-<b>8</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, upon receipt of the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets, routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>110</b>-<b>8</b> may inspect the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets, determine whether the unicast destination address corresponds to them, determine whether they are a part of the multicast group, and determine whether the multicast packets are duplicates. Routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>7</b> and <b>110</b>-<b>8</b> may perform unicast decapsulation with respect to the received unicast-encapsulated multicast packets.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>7</b> may send the multicast packets to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>11</b>, which in turn, may send the multicast packets to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>13</b>. Additionally, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>8</b> may send the multicast packets to a receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the above examples have addressed multicast fast rerouting pertaining to a link failure or a node failure, in some cases, both types of failures may occur. According to an exemplary embodiment, routing node <b>110</b> may use both approaches, in combination, to provide multicast fast rerouting. According to other embodiments, routing node <b>110</b> may use only one of the approaches to provide multicast fast rerouting. By way of example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, if routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> knows that routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> has failed, it would be impractical to use the multicast fast rerouting approach previously described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, it may be assumed that a link failure and a node failure exist. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may perform unicast encapsulation of multicast packets to generate unicast-encapsulated multicast packets. Routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may send the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> via routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b>. Additionally, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>6</b> may perform unicast encapsulation to the multicast packets to generate unicast-encapsulated multicast packets and send the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets to neighboring routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>5</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>9</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>110</b>-<b>12</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>5</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>9</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>110</b>-<b>12</b> may perform operations similarly to those previously described. For example, routing nodes <b>110</b>-<b>9</b>, <b>110</b>-<b>11</b>, and <b>110</b>-<b>12</b> may perform unicast decapsulation to the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets and appropriately forward the multicast packets. In this example, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b> may drop the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets having a destination to routing <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> when it knows that routing node <b>110</b>-<b>10</b> has failed. However, routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b> may decapsulate the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets having a destination to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b> (i.e., the neighbor unicast-encapsulated packets) and send the decapsulated multicast packets (i.e., the multicast packets) to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>4</b>. Routing node <b>110</b>-<b>5</b> may send the unicast-encapsulated multicast packets having unicast destinations of routing node <b>110</b>-<b>9</b> and <b>110</b>-<b>12</b> to routing node <b>110</b>-<b>4</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Process <b>700</b> may include receiving a multicast packet to route (block <b>705</b>). For example, as previously described, routing node <b>110</b> may receive a multicast packet from another routing node <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It may be determined that a next multicast hop is not available (block <b>710</b>).

Routing node <b>110</b> may use network state information (e.g., link state information (e.g., obtained from other routing nodes <b>110</b>, associated with a protocol, etc.), etc.) to determine that a link failure exists and/or that a multicast path to the next multicast hop cannot be used.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Unicast encapsulation of the multicast packet may be performed based on the next multicast hop (block <b>715</b>).
