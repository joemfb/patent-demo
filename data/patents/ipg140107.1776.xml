<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a needlestick prevention device for use with injection devices, such as syringes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A needlestick injury generally occurs in a medical environment, and particularly before or after use of a syringe or other injection device, when the user accidentally sticks the needle into himself or herself, or indeed another person. It is of course important to prevent such injuries, since they can spread infections and diseases, as well as being painful and possibly incapacitating.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are several known ways of trying to prevent needlestick injuries. For example, some syringes are made with needles which are retracted automatically after use by means of a spring in the syringe. However, this requires a complex construction, and is expensive to manufacture. Further, it does not address the possibility of injury occurring before the injection is given.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another known way is to replace the tubular sheath which is supplied with the syringe, protecting the needle. It is not now recommended practice to replace the sheath after the syringe has been used, because of the difficulty of placing the end of the needle accurately in the sheath. It is thought that trying to re-sheath the needle has actually been the cause of a significant number of needlestick injuries. Further, the sheath can easily be removed again, so that injury is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Yet another known needlestick prevention device is an automatic needle sheath mounted on the syringe barrel, the sheath being able to slide out to cover the needle. EP-A-0 268 445 shows a construction with a stationary sheath part, and a movable sheath part spring-biassed to an extended position in which it covers the needle. The movable sheath part retracts to expose the needle for use, and when the retracting pressure is released the spring moves it automatically into its extended position, where it is locked. The movable sheath part has a projection received in a track in the stationary part to determine its movement and to lock it. Again, this is a relatively complex construction which is expensive to manufacture. A similar construction is found in WO 03/105935.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present invention, a needlestick prevention device for an injection device having a hollow needle comprises a sheath for attachment to the injection device, the sheath being so constructed and arranged that in a first, inoperative position it sealingly encloses the needle, in a second, operative position a first part of the sheath is removed, a second part remains attached to the injection device, and a third part is pivoted about a hinge means to expose the needle, and in a third, cover position the third part is pivoted about the hinge means to cover at least the tip of the needle, and is retained by the second part.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The device of the invention is simple to manufacture, as it only uses the sheath, and no springs or tracks. It is also simple to use, but without the inherent danger of replacing the sheath over the needle, as the pivotal movement effectively moves the sheath sideways over the needle so that a user does not need to put their hands near the needle. In the cover position the third part is retained by the second part, so that it is difficult to remove the third part again. The device is therefore simple to manufacture and use, and is safe in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The second part is adapted for attachment to a hub which carries the needle. It may be substantially cylindrical.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the inoperative position the first and third parts extend axially from the second part beyond the end of the needle, to form a substantially cylindrical cover for the needle. The first part may extend round approximately one sixth to one half of the circumference of the cover. At its end remote from the second part, the first part has a projection extending axially beyond the third part. The projection is grasped in order to remove the first part.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The third part may be moved angularly from the inoperative position into the operative position, and from the operative position into the cover position by applying a force to the third part. The third part may have a tongue projecting beyond the tip of the needle in the inoperative position. The third part may be moved by applying a force to the tongue.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the inoperative position the tip of the needle may be covered by the first part or the third part. The first part may have a projection, at its end remote from the second part, extending radially inwardly to cover the tip of the needle. Alternatively the third part may have a closure member extending radially inwardly to cover the tip of the needle.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The second and third parts are connected by the hinge means and a retaining means, which is engaged in the inoperative position and the cover position. The arrangement is such that in the inoperative position the first part prevents disengagement of the retaining means, but once the first part is removed the retaining means disengages on movement of the third part about the hinge means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The hinge means may extend round one sixth to one quarter of the circumference of the second part. It is preferably a spring or living hinge, so that, on movement of the third part from the inoperative position and following disengagement of the retaining means, the hinge means acts to move the third part automatically into the operative position. This automatic movement means that the user has to touch the third part only once to move it into the operative position. In the operative position the third part is conveniently as near as possible in line with the injection device, so that it has moved angularly through 180&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">On movement of the third part from the operative position the hinge means acts to move the third part towards the cover position once its angular movement exceeds a predetermined amount. This amount may be between 80&#xb0; and 100&#xb0;. The hinge means may move the third part directly into the cover position, so that the user has to touch the third part only once to effect this movement. Alternatively, a further manual force may be applied to move the third part into the cover position. In the cover position the third part moves beyond the inoperative position, and the retaining means engages in a position where a permanent locking arrangement is actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment the retaining means comprises at least one pair of corresponding stepped portions on the second and third parts. In the inoperative position the stepped portions of a pair are attached by a weakened portion which is adapted to break when the angular movement of the third part from the inoperative position exceeds a predetermined amount. This amount may be between 30&#xb0; and 45&#xb0;. The hinge means may extend between one sixth and one quarter of the circumference of the second part, with the weakened portion accounting for the remaining circumference (approximately two thirds), after removal of the first part.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably two pairs of stepped portions are provided on the second and third parts, the pairs being separated by the hinge means, and the stepped portions of each pair being attached by a weakened portion. This ensures that the weakened portions break easily, and that the hinge means operates correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the cover position the stepped portion on the third part engages behind the stepped portion on the second part to retain the third part in the cover position. In the cover position the third part has moved beyond the inoperative position, ensuring that it covers the needle, and is retained in that position, so that it is not easy to expose the needle again.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, the retaining means may comprise at least one peg on one of the second or third parts engaging in a complementary slot on the other part. Conveniently the or each peg is provided on the third part, and the or each slot on the second part. The or each peg may have two detents, the first engaging in a recess in a slot in the inoperative position, and the second engaging in the recess in the cover position to provide the permanent locking. There may be two pegs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a modification the retaining means may comprise a first mechanism for the inoperative position and a second mechanism for the cover position. For the inoperative position, the first mechanism comprises a projection on one of the second and third parts engaging in a complementary recess on the other part, and for the cover position the second mechanism comprises a peg on one part engaging in a complementary slot on the other part. The projection and the peg may be on different parts. Thus, a projection on the third part may engage in a recess on the second part, and a peg on the second part may engage in a slot on the second part to provide the permanent locking. Conveniently there are two projections and two pegs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A secondary locking mechanism may also be provided for the needle in the cover position. The secondary mechanism may comprise locking means on the third part allowing the needle to pass through as the third part goes beyond the inoperative position into the cover position, but preventing the needle passing back again. The secondary locking mechanism may comprise a pair of opposing hooks, arranged such that the needle is able to pass between them in one direction, but not in the other.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to ensure that it is difficult to remove the whole sheath from the injection device, the sheath is attached to the hub carrying the needle by a locking mechanism. The locking mechanism comprises projections on the sheath or the hub engaging in complementary recesses in the hub or the sheath. Alternatively, the sheath and hub may be made as a single component, for example by injection moulding of plastics material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The sheath may be moulded as a single component, with the first part sealing against the second and third parts, but not actually fused to them. This is achieved by moulding a small gap around the first part. As the sheath cools it shrinks, but the second and third parts shrink more than the first part, so that the gap disappears, and the first part is retained by the second and third parts. This means that the first part, being sealingly retained but not fused, can be readily removed, like a tear-off strip, when the injection device is to be used. Alternatively, the second and third parts may be moulded as a single component, with the first part being a strip, for example of foil, attached subsequently.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The needlestick prevention device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref> comprises a sheath <b>1</b> for attachment to an injection device, such as a syringe (not shown) with a hollow needle for injecting or removing fluid from a human or animal body. The sheath <b>1</b> is shown attached to a hub <b>2</b> carrying the needle <b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>). The hub <b>2</b> in turn is attached to a syringe in any known way.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The sheath <b>1</b> is designed to prevent a user accidentally sticking the needle into him or herself, or indeed another person, either before or after correct use of the syringe. The sheath <b>1</b> is injection moulded of plastics material such as polypropylene as a single component, formed from three parts <b>4</b>,<b>5</b>,<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The three parts <b>4</b>,<b>5</b>,<b>6</b> can take up three positions. The first, inoperative, position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where the three parts sealingly enclose the needle <b>3</b>. The second, operative, position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, where the first part <b>4</b> is removed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), the second part <b>5</b> remains attached to the hub <b>2</b>, and the third part <b>6</b> is pivoted to expose the needle <b>3</b>. The third, cover, position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, where the third part <b>6</b> is pivoted back again to cover the needle <b>3</b>, and is retained by the second part <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The second part <b>5</b> is substantially cylindrical for attachment to the hub <b>2</b> by projections (not shown) on the second part <b>5</b> received in recesses (not shown) on the hub <b>2</b>. While this is a standard way of attaching a sheath to a hub, in this case the projections and recesses are larger and deeper than in a standard attachment, to ensure that it is difficult to pull the sheath <b>1</b> off the hub <b>2</b>. This means that the sheath <b>1</b> will be used correctly, and not as a standard sheath, which is normally pulled off the hub to expose the needle for use.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first part <b>4</b> and third part <b>6</b> extend axially from the distal end of the second part <b>5</b> to form a substantially cylindrical cover for the needle <b>3</b>. Both the first part <b>4</b> and third part <b>6</b> extend beyond the needle tip. The first part <b>4</b> extends round approximately one sixth of the circumference of the second and third parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> in the manner of a tear-off strip. This is achieved in the moulding of the sheath <b>1</b>, by providing a small gap round the first part <b>4</b>, which disappears as the sheath <b>1</b> cools and shrinks. The first part <b>4</b> extends axially beyond the third part <b>6</b> at its distal end <b>8</b>, which carries a radially-inwardly directed projection <b>9</b> to seal off the distal end of the sheath <b>1</b>. The first part <b>4</b> is tapered inwardly slightly adjacent the second part <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The third part <b>6</b> extends round the remaining circumference of the second part <b>5</b> (about five-sixths of the circumference). The distal end <b>10</b> of the third part <b>6</b> is formed with a transverse notch <b>11</b>, and an internally ribbed tongue <b>12</b> on the side of the notch <b>11</b> opposite the first part <b>4</b>. The ribbed tongue <b>12</b> is slightly longer than the portions <b>13</b> adjacent the first part <b>4</b>. The projection <b>9</b> seals with the third part at the base of the tongue <b>12</b>. A reinforcing rib <b>14</b> extends from the base of the notch <b>11</b> on opposing sides of the third part <b>6</b> to a point adjacent the second part <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The third part <b>6</b> is attached to the second part <b>5</b> by a retaining means <b>19</b> and a hinge means <b>16</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, the hinge <b>16</b> is opposite the first part <b>4</b>, and extends between one-quarter and one-sixth of the circumference of the second part <b>5</b>. The retaining means <b>19</b> is in two parts <b>17</b>,<b>18</b> separated by the hinge <b>16</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, each retaining part <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> comprises a radial stepped projection <b>20</b> on the third part <b>6</b>, and a corresponding radial stepped projection <b>21</b> on the second part <b>5</b>, each pair of corresponding radial projections <b>20</b>,<b>21</b> being connected by a weakened portion <b>15</b>. Each radial projection <b>20</b> forms an external shoulder <b>22</b> on the third part <b>6</b>. Each radial projection <b>21</b> is substantially wedge-shaped, forming an external abutment <b>23</b> and an internal shoulder <b>24</b> on the second part <b>5</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The radial projections <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> also add to the strength of the construction at the weakened portions <b>15</b>. Each weakened portion <b>15</b> extends from the projections <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> towards the hinge <b>16</b>, and has a split line generally inclined to the axis of the sheath <b>1</b>, and stepped axially towards the hinge <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the sheath <b>1</b> is moved from the inoperative position into the operative position, as shown in FIGS. <b>2</b>,<b>3</b> and <b>5</b>, movement of the third part <b>6</b> towards the injection device firstly causes the weakened portions <b>15</b> to break along the split lines. The third part <b>6</b> is then connected to the second part <b>5</b> only by the hinge <b>16</b>. This is constructed as a living hinge, so that once the weakened portions <b>15</b> have broken, and the third part <b>6</b> has moved through an angle of about 90&#xb0;, the hinge <b>16</b> automatically moves the third part <b>6</b> into the operative position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Similarly, when the sheath <b>1</b> is to be moved from the operative position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to the cover position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the user performs the first part of the movement, but once the third part <b>6</b> has moved through an angle of about 90&#xb0; the hinge <b>16</b> will move the third part <b>6</b> into the cover position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. It will be noted that in the cover position the third part <b>6</b> is over centre, so that it is in contact with the tip of the needle <b>3</b>, to protect against needlestick. The third part <b>6</b> is retained in the cover position by the retaining means <b>19</b>, with each external shoulder <b>22</b> on the third part <b>6</b> engaging with the corresponding internal shoulder <b>24</b> on the second part <b>5</b>. It will be appreciated that, in order to achieve this, the second part <b>5</b> and third part <b>6</b> are deflected relatively in a radial direction. Normally it will be the third part <b>6</b> that is deflected radially inwardly, a movement accommodated by the hinge <b>16</b>. In the cover position the injection device is ready for disposal.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The sheath <b>1</b>, as mentioned above, is injection moulded with two parts in a single moulding operation, resulting in a single component. The second and third parts <b>5</b>,<b>6</b> are moulded as one part, and the first part <b>4</b> as a separate part, with a small gap around it. The material shrinks as it cools after moulding, so that the gap disappears and the first part <b>4</b> engages sealingly with the second and third parts <b>5</b>,<b>6</b>, but without being fused to them. Once cooled, the sheath <b>1</b> can be mounted on a hub <b>2</b> carrying a needle <b>3</b>, so that the needle <b>3</b> is sealingly enclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For use, the hub <b>2</b> with the sheath <b>1</b> enclosing the needle <b>3</b> is attached to an injection device such as a syringe. The sheath <b>1</b> is in the inoperative position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The user then grasps the projection <b>9</b> at the distal end of the first part <b>4</b>, and pulls the first part to remove it from the second and third parts <b>5</b>,<b>6</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). There is no danger of the user touching the needle <b>3</b>, as the projection <b>9</b> is located beyond the end of the needle <b>3</b>. The user discards the first part <b>4</b>, and then either grasps the tongue <b>12</b> or places it on the edge of a convenient solid surface, and applies a force urging the third part <b>6</b> away from the needle <b>3</b>. As the third part moves the weakened portions <b>15</b> break, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, leaving the third part <b>6</b> attached to the second part <b>5</b> by the hinge <b>16</b>. When the third part has moved through an angle of about 90&#xb0; the hinge <b>16</b> then urges it into the operative position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The user then gives the injection, and when it is completed applies a force to the free end <b>10</b> of the third part <b>6</b> to urge it towards the needle <b>3</b> again. When the third part has moved through about 90&#xb0; the hinge <b>16</b> urges it into the cover position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, with the shoulders <b>22</b> on the third part <b>6</b> engaging with the internal shoulders <b>24</b> on the second part <b>5</b>. In this position the third part <b>6</b> engages the needle tip and extends beyond it, protecting against the possibility of needlestick. It will be appreciated that there is no danger of a needlestick injury in applying the force to urge the third part <b>6</b> into the cover position, as the third part <b>6</b> in the operative position is not near the needle tip. It will also be appreciated that the retaining means <b>19</b> ensure that the third part <b>6</b> cannot readily be moved away from the cover position to expose the needle <b>3</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A second embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 12</figref>. This embodiment is a modification of the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>, and corresponding reference numerals have been applied to corresponding parts.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 12</figref>, the sheath <b>1</b> is again formed from three parts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> attached to a hub <b>2</b> carrying a needle <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second part <b>5</b> is substantially cylindrical and is attached to the hub <b>2</b>, in this case by being integrally moulded. This means that the sheath <b>1</b> will be used correctly, and not as a standard sheath, which is normally pulled off the hub to expose the needle for use.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first part <b>4</b> and third part <b>6</b> extend axially from the distal end of the second part <b>5</b> to form a substantially cylindrical cover for the needle <b>3</b>. Both the first part <b>4</b> and third part <b>6</b> extend beyond the needle tip. The first part <b>4</b> extends round approximately one quarter of the circumference of the second and third parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and is provided as a foil tear-off strip. The first part <b>4</b> extends axially beyond the third part <b>6</b> at its distal end <b>8</b>, forming a projection <b>9</b> which is grasped by the user to remove the first part <b>4</b>. At its proximal end the first part <b>4</b> extends over the second part <b>5</b>. Both the second part <b>5</b> and the third part <b>6</b> have flat surfaces (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref>) for attachment of the first part <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The third part <b>6</b> extends round the remaining circumference of the second part <b>5</b> (about three-quarters of the circumference). The distal end <b>10</b> of the third part <b>6</b> is formed with a closure member <b>29</b> to cover the tip of the needle <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The hub <b>2</b> with the needle <b>3</b>, and the second and third parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> are injection moulded of plastics material as a single component. The foil tear-off strip (first part <b>4</b>) is attached after moulding, in any suitable way.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The third part <b>6</b> is attached to the second part <b>5</b> by a retaining means <b>19</b> and a hinge means <b>16</b>, which is a living hinge.

The retaining means <b>19</b> is opposite the hinge <b>16</b>, and in the inoperative position is covered by the first part <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The retaining means <b>19</b> is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, and comprises a peg and slot arrangement. Two pegs <b>30</b> are provided on the proximal end of the third part <b>6</b>, extending axially towards the second part <b>5</b>, each for engagement in a complementary slot <b>31</b> formed in the second part <b>5</b>. Each peg <b>30</b> is arranged adjacent a flat surface <b>32</b> of the third part <b>6</b>, which is formed with a reinforcing rib <b>33</b> at the base of each peg <b>30</b>. An axial slot <b>34</b> is formed in the third part <b>5</b> adjacent each peg <b>30</b>, to provide the necessary amount of radial resilience for each peg.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Each peg <b>30</b> has two detents <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> projecting outwardly (away from each other), and adapted to engage in a recess (not shown) in the respective slot <b>31</b>. A first detent <b>35</b> is a retaining detent at the free end of the peg <b>30</b>. The retaining detent <b>35</b> has a rounded profile <b>37</b>, so that it can disengage from the recess. In the inoperative position the first detent <b>35</b> is engaged in the recess, from where it can be disengaged on movement of the third part <b>6</b> to the operative position. The second detent <b>36</b> is adjacent the base of the peg <b>30</b>, and has a fir tree profile <b>38</b>, with an inclined face <b>39</b> and a flat face <b>40</b>, perpendicular to the axis of the third part. The second detent <b>36</b> is a locking detent, which will not disengage from the recess. The second detent <b>36</b> engages in the recess when the third part <b>6</b> moves into the cover position, to provide permanent locking.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The third part <b>6</b> also has a pair of inclined ledges <b>41</b> (only one of which is shown). Each ledge <b>41</b> extends from the hinge <b>16</b> towards one of the pegs <b>30</b>. The ledges <b>41</b> form a stop for the third part <b>6</b> when it moves into the cover position, in order to define that position and to ensure that the locking detents <b>36</b> on the pegs <b>30</b> engage in the recesses.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a secondary locking mechanism <b>42</b> for the needle <b>3</b>. The secondary locking mechanism comprises a pair of hooks <b>43</b> provided on the internal surface of the third part <b>6</b>. A gap <b>44</b> is defined between the free ends of the hooks <b>43</b>, the arrangement being such that the needle <b>3</b> can deflect the hooks <b>43</b> resiliently to allow it to pass through the gap <b>44</b>. The hooks <b>43</b> then return to their original positions, in which the needle <b>3</b> cannot pass back through the gap <b>44</b>. This locks the needle <b>3</b> into the third part in the cover position.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The cover position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, with the third part <b>6</b> over centre, the pegs <b>30</b> locked in the slots <b>31</b>, and a proximal part <b>45</b> of the third part <b>6</b> between the ledge <b>41</b> and the free edge deformed outwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For use, the hub <b>2</b> with the sheath <b>1</b> enclosing the needle <b>3</b> is attached to an injection device such as a syringe.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A third embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 19</figref>. This is a modification of the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 12</figref>, and corresponding reference numerals have been applied to corresponding parts.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 12</figref>, the sheath <b>1</b> is formed of three parts <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, of which the second and third parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> are moulded integrally with the hub <b>2</b> carrying the needle <b>3</b>. The first part <b>4</b> is a foil tear-off strip. The hub <b>2</b> is shown attached to an injection device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In this embodiment the second part <b>5</b> has a rectangular external profile, and the third part <b>6</b> has a correspondingly-shaped base <b>50</b> for engagement with the second part <b>5</b>. Internally the second part <b>5</b> accommodates the hub <b>2</b> for the needle <b>3</b>. The third part <b>6</b> has a substantially U-shaped portion <b>51</b> extending axially from three sides of the base <b>50</b> to form the cover for the needle <b>3</b>, completed by the first part <b>4</b>. The first and third parts <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> each extend beyond the needle tip, with the third part <b>6</b> having a chamfered distal end <b>52</b>. The first part <b>4</b> extends axially beyond the third part <b>6</b> at its distal end, forming a projection <b>9</b> which is grasped by the user to remove the first part <b>4</b>.

The second part <b>5</b> and third part <b>6</b> each have flat surfaces, co-planar in the inoperative position, for attachment of the first part <b>4</b>. The first part <b>4</b> is attached to the second and third parts in any suitable way.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The third part <b>6</b> is attached to the second part <b>5</b> by the retaining means <b>19</b>, and the hinge means <b>16</b>, which as before is a living hinge. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the hinge <b>16</b> is provided on the side <b>55</b> of the base <b>50</b> opposite the open side <b>53</b>. The other two sides <b>56</b>, <b>57</b> of the base <b>50</b> extend over the corresponding sides <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> of the second part <b>5</b>, and their internal surfaces engage sealingly with the external surfaces of the second part <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The retaining means <b>19</b> is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, and comprises a modified peg and slot arrangement. Two pegs <b>30</b> again extend from the third part <b>6</b> towards the second part <b>5</b>, but are accommodated within the base <b>50</b>. As with the previous embodiment each peg has two detents <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, but these project towards the open side <b>53</b>, rather than away from each other. The shape and function of the detents <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> is otherwise the same as that of the previous embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Each peg <b>30</b> has a complementary slot <b>31</b> formed externally on a respective side <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> of the second part <b>5</b>.

The proximal base end <b>62</b> of each slot <b>31</b> is closed, and extends below the projection <b>61</b> to accommodate the peg <b>30</b> in the cover position. The base <b>62</b> of each slot <b>31</b> forms a stop for the third part <b>6</b> when it moves into the cover position, in order to define that position, in which the locking detent <b>36</b> engages below the projection <b>61</b>. This position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the retaining means <b>19</b> in the inoperative position, in which the retaining detents <b>35</b> on the pegs <b>30</b> engage sealingly in the open ends of the slots <b>31</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the retaining means <b>19</b> with the pegs <b>30</b> just out of the slots <b>31</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows the device in the operative position.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In use, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 19</figref> operates in a very similar way to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 12</figref>. The only difference lies in the movement into the cover position. As before, a force applied to the third part in the operative position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) urges the third part <b>6</b> towards the needle <b>3</b> again, and when the third part <b>6</b> has moved through about 90&#xb0; the hinge <b>16</b> urges it towards the inoperative position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The user then applies a further force to move the third part <b>6</b> into the cover position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, where the point of the needle <b>3</b> is protected by the end <b>52</b> of the third part <b>6</b>. The pegs <b>30</b> enter the slots <b>31</b>, and the movement continues until the free ends of the pegs <b>30</b> engage the bases <b>62</b> of the slots, in which position the locking detents <b>36</b> engage below the projections <b>61</b>, to lock the third part <b>6</b> against movement away from the cover position in a direction to expose the needle <b>3</b> again. The needle <b>3</b> is also locked by the secondary locking mechanism <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> show a modification of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 19</figref>. The modification is to the retaining means <b>19</b>. In this embodiment the retaining means <b>19</b> has a first mechanism <b>63</b> for the inoperative position, and a second mechanism <b>64</b> for the cover position. The first mechanism <b>63</b> comprises an externally projecting rib <b>65</b> of triangular profile formed on each of the sides <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> of the second part <b>5</b>, and adapted to engage in a complementary recess <b>66</b> in the internal surface of each of the sides <b>56</b>, <b>57</b> of the base <b>50</b>. Each rib <b>63</b> extends only part of the way along the side <b>58</b> or <b>59</b>. The engagement of the ribs <b>65</b> in the recesses <b>66</b> will maintain the second and third parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> in position until the manual force is applied to the third part <b>6</b> move it into the operative position.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The second mechanism <b>64</b> provides locking in the cover position, and comprises a peg and slot arrangement. Two pegs <b>67</b> are provided on the third part <b>6</b>, extending axially towards the second part <b>5</b>, and essentially parallel to the needle <b>3</b>. Each peg <b>67</b> terminates in an outward-facing hook <b>68</b>. Each peg <b>67</b> is adapted to slide in an axial slot <b>69</b> formed internally in the second part <b>5</b>, adjacent the open side <b>54</b>. Each slot <b>69</b> has an aperture <b>70</b> whose shape is complementary to the hook <b>68</b> on the respective peg <b>67</b>. The second part <b>5</b> also has stop ribs (not shown) extending internally on each side <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> from the open side <b>54</b> towards the hinge <b>16</b>. On movement of the third part <b>6</b> into the cover position each peg <b>67</b> moves axially into the second part <b>5</b>. Each hook <b>68</b> engages with a respective stop rib, which urges it resiliently towards the other hook <b>68</b> so that it is inclined to the needle <b>3</b>. On further axial movement each hook <b>68</b> moves past the stop rib and is returned by its resilience to its position parallel to the needle <b>3</b>, and enters the respective aperture <b>70</b>. The hooks <b>68</b> are then locked in the apertures <b>70</b>, since the stop ribs are constructed to prevent movement of the hooks <b>68</b> in the reverse direction. The stop ribs thus provide a stop for the third part <b>6</b> when it moves into the cover position, in order to define that position and to ensure that the second mechanism <b>64</b> operates to provide the locking.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For use, the hub <b>2</b> with the sheath <b>1</b> enclosing the needle <b>3</b> is attached to an injection device such as a syringe <b>100</b>.

The user then grasps the projection <b>9</b> at the distal end of the first part <b>4</b>, and pulls the first part to remove it from the second and third parts <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>. There is no danger of the user touching the needle <b>3</b> as the projection <b>9</b> is located beyond the end of the needle <b>3</b>.

The user then gives the injection, and when it is completed applies a force to the free end of the third part <b>6</b> to urge it towards the needle <b>3</b> again. There is no danger of a needlestick injury in applying the force to urge the third part <b>6</b> into the cover position, as the third part <b>6</b> in the operative position is not near the needle tip. When the third part has moved through about 90&#xb0; the hinge <b>16</b> urges it back towards the inoperative position. The user applies a further force to move the third part <b>6</b> into the cover position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. There is no danger of the user touching the point of the needle <b>3</b>, as in the inoperative position the point is protected by the end <b>52</b> of the third part <b>6</b>. The ribs <b>65</b> move into and then out of the recesses <b>66</b>, and then the hooks <b>68</b> move over the stop ribs, being deflected resiliently by them, and then engage in the locking apertures <b>70</b>, to define the cover position. This is about 8&#xb0; over centre. The needle <b>3</b> also passes through the gap <b>44</b> of the secondary locking mechanism. In the cover position the third part <b>6</b> engages the needle tip and extends beyond it, protecting against the possibility of needlestick. It will be appreciated that the locking mechanism <b>64</b> ensures that the third part <b>6</b> cannot readily be moved away from the cover position to expose the needle <b>3</b> again.</p>
