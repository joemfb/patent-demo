<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A monitoring apparatus includes a detection circuit, a filter circuit, an amplifying circuit, a regulation circuit, a delay and charging circuit, and a driving circuit. The detection circuit receives a video signal, and performs an operation to obtain an image signal from the video signal. The filter circuit obtains an average intensity of a luminance signal corresponding to the image signal. The delay and charging circuit charges an input capacitor when receiving a low level regulated signal from the amplifying circuit. The driving circuit activates an alarm when a charging voltage of the chargeable capacitor exceeds a predetermined value.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an apparatus for monitoring a television.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a related art, a television displays pictures from a video signal from a file, and a frequency range of the video signal is between 10 hertz (Hz) and 6 Megahertz (MHz). A frequency exceeding 500 Hz of the video signal will get a clear and smooth picture. Additionally, the picture displayed by the television needs to be monitored in real time by operators, to make sure the picture is normal. If the picture becomes abnormal, such as the television turning to a black screen, the file needs to be replaced with other files or manually played back, which is time-consuming and labour intensive.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is need for improvement in the art.</p>

The components in the drawing(s) are not necessarily drawn to scale, the emphasis instead being placed upon clearly illustrating the principles of the present disclosure. Moreover, in the drawing(s), like reference numerals designate corresponding parts throughout the several views.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> illustrate an embodiment of a monitoring apparatus for a television of the present disclosure. The monitoring apparatus includes a detection circuit <b>10</b>, a filter circuit <b>20</b>, an amplifying circuit <b>30</b>, a regulation circuit <b>40</b>, a delay and charging circuit <b>50</b>, a driving circuit <b>60</b>, and a power circuit <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the art of television, a television video signal includes an image signal (including a chrominance signal and a luminance signal), a composite blanking signal, and a composite sync signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The detection circuit <b>10</b> receives a video signal outputted to the television, and carries out an operation to obtain an image signal of the video signal. The filter circuit <b>20</b> receives the image signal, and carries out a filter operation to obtain an average intensity of a luminance of the image signal. The amplifying circuit <b>30</b> amplifies a low frequency part of the average intensity of the luminance signal, and outputs an amplified signal. The regulation circuit <b>40</b> receives the amplified signal, carries out an operation to generate a regulated signal.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the video signal is normal, that is, within the frequency range from 10 Hz to 6 MHz, the capacitor C<b>4</b> of the amplifying circuit <b>30</b> performs a filter operation on the luminance signal, to filter out the high frequency part of the average intensity of the luminance signal, thereby obtaining only the low frequency part, with the frequency from 10 Hz to 100 Hz.

Consequently, the electronic switch Q<b>4</b> is turned off, and the capacitor C<b>9</b> begins to be charged. When the charging voltage of the capacitor exceeds &#x2154; of the voltage provided by the power chip U<b>1</b>, the output pin OUT of the control chip U<b>2</b> outputs a high level signal to the third terminal of the electronic switch Q<b>5</b>.
