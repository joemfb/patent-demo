<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to telecommunications systems and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for monitoring a network element in a communications network, such as a packet network, e.g., a voice over internet protocol (VoIP) network.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, telecommunications systems provide the ability for two or more people or machines (e.g., computerized or other electronic devices) to communicate with each other. A telecommunications system may include various networks for facilitating communication that may be generally organized into packet networks and circuit-switched networks. An exemplary circuit-switched network includes a plain old telephone system (POTS), such as the publicly switched telephone network (PSTN). Exemplary packet networks include internet protocol (IP) networks, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks, frame-relay networks, and the like. One type of packet network is a voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) network.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order for a network (e.g., VoIP network) infrastructure to operate at a high performance level, it is critical to understand how each component is operating. Network operators that respond in a proactive way to potential problems can prevent service disruptions that might otherwise occur.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus for monitoring a network element.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, a method and apparatus for monitoring a network element in a communications network are described. Specifically, an alarm message from the network element when a change in rate associated with at least one of a central processing unit (CPU) utilization or a memory usage by the network element exceeds a predefined threshold. An instruction is subsequently sent to the network element to reduce the change in rate associated with the at least one of the CPU utilization or the memory usage.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To better understand the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates communication architecture <b>100</b> comprising an example network, e.g., a packet network such as a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network, related to the present invention. Exemplary packet networks include internet protocol (IP) networks, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks, frame-relay networks, and the like. An IP network is broadly defined as a network that uses Internet Protocol to exchange data packets. Thus, a VoIP network or a SoIP (Service over Internet Protocol) network is considered an IP network.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the VoIP network may comprise various types of customer endpoint devices connected via various types of access networks to a carrier (a service provider) VoIP core infrastructure over an Internet Protocol/Multi-Protocol Label Switching (IP/MPLS) based core backbone network. Broadly defined, a VoIP network is a network that is capable of carrying voice signals as packetized data over an IP network. The present invention is described below in the context of an illustrative VoIP network. Thus, the present invention should not be interpreted to be limited by this particular illustrative architecture.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The customer endpoint devices can be either Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) based or IP based. TDM based customer endpoint devices <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>134</b>, and <b>135</b> typically comprise of TDM phones or Private Branch Exchange (PBX). IP based customer endpoint devices <b>144</b> and <b>145</b> typically comprise IP phones or IP PBX. The Terminal Adaptors (TA) <b>132</b> and <b>133</b> are used to provide necessary interworking functions between TDM customer endpoint devices, such as analog phones, and packet based access network technologies, such as Digital Subscriber Loop (DSL) or Cable broadband access networks. TDM based customer endpoint devices access VoIP services by using either a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> or a broadband access network <b>130</b>, <b>131</b> via a TA <b>132</b> or <b>133</b>. IP based customer endpoint devices access VoIP services by using a Local Area Network (LAN) <b>140</b> and <b>141</b> with a VoIP gateway or router <b>142</b> and <b>143</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The access networks can be either TDM or packet based. A TDM PSTN <b>120</b> or <b>121</b> is used to support TDM customer endpoint devices connected via traditional phone lines. A packet based access network, such as Frame Relay, ATM, Ethernet or IP, is used to support IP based customer endpoint devices via a customer LAN, e.g., <b>140</b> with a VoIP gateway and router <b>142</b>. A packet based access network <b>130</b> or <b>131</b>, such as DSL or Cable, when used together with a TA <b>132</b> or <b>133</b>, is used to support TDM based customer endpoint devices.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The core VoIP infrastructure comprises of several key VoIP components, such as the Border Elements (BEs) <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>, the Call Control Element (CCE) <b>111</b>, VoIP related Application Servers (AS) <b>114</b>, Core elements (CEs), and Media Servers (MS) <b>115</b>. The BE resides at the edge of the VoIP core infrastructure and interfaces with customers endpoints over various types of access networks. A BE is typically implemented as a Media Gateway and performs signaling, media control, security, and call admission control and related functions. The CCE resides within the VoIP infrastructure and is connected to the BEs using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over the underlying IP/MPLS based core backbone network <b>110</b>. The CCE is typically implemented as a Media Gateway Controller or a softswitch and performs network wide call control related functions as well as interacts with the appropriate VoIP service related servers when necessary. The CCE functions as a SIP back-to-back user agent and is a signaling endpoint for all call legs between all BEs and the CCE. The CCE may need to interact with various VoIP related Application Servers (AS) in order to complete a call that require certain service specific features, e.g. translation of an E.164 voice network address into an IP address and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For calls that originate or terminate in a different carrier, they can be handled through the PSTN <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> or the Partner IP Carrier <b>160</b> interconnections. For originating or terminating TDM calls, they can be handled via existing PSTN interconnections to the other carrier. For originating or terminating VoIP calls, they can be handled via the Partner IP carrier interface <b>160</b> to the other carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to illustrate how the different components operate to support a VoIP call, the following call scenario is used to illustrate how a VoIP call is setup between two customer endpoints. A customer using IP device <b>144</b> at location A places a call to another customer at location Z using TDM device <b>135</b>. During the call setup, a setup signaling message is sent from IP device <b>144</b>, through the LAN <b>140</b>, the VoIP Gateway/Router <b>142</b>, and the associated packet based access network, to BE <b>112</b>. BE <b>112</b> will then send a setup signaling message, such as a SIP-INVITE message if SIP is used, to CCE <b>111</b>. CCE <b>111</b> looks at the called party information and queries the necessary VoIP service related application server <b>114</b> to obtain the information to complete this call. In one embodiment, the Application Server (AS) functions as a back-to-back user agent. If BE <b>113</b> needs to be involved in completing the call; CCE <b>111</b> sends another call setup message, such as a SIP-INVITE message if SIP is used, to BE <b>113</b>. Upon receiving the call setup message, BE <b>113</b> forwards the call setup message, via broadband network <b>131</b>, to TA <b>133</b>. TA <b>133</b> then identifies the appropriate TDM device <b>135</b> and rings that device. Once the call is accepted at location Z by the called party, a call acknowledgement signaling message, such as a SIP 200 OK response message if SIP is used, is sent in the reverse direction back to the CCE <b>111</b>. After the CCE <b>111</b> receives the call acknowledgement message, it will then send a call acknowledgement signaling message, such as a SIP 200 OK response message if SIP is used, toward the calling party. In addition, the CCE <b>111</b> also provides the necessary information of the call to both BE <b>112</b> and BE <b>113</b> so that the call data exchange can proceed directly between BE <b>112</b> and BE <b>113</b>. The call signaling path <b>150</b> and the call media path <b>151</b> are illustratively shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Note that the call signaling path and the call media path are different because once a call has been setup up between two endpoints, the CCE <b>111</b> does not need to be in the data path for actual direct data exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Media Servers (MS) <b>115</b> are special servers that typically handle and terminate media streams, and to provide services such as announcements, bridges, transcoding, and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) messages for VoIP service applications.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Note that a customer in location A using any endpoint device type with its associated access network type can communicate with another customer in location Z using any endpoint device type with its associated network type as well. For instance, a customer at location A using IP customer endpoint device <b>144</b> with packet based access network <b>140</b> can call another customer at location Z using TDM endpoint device <b>123</b> with PSTN access network <b>121</b>. The BEs <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> are responsible for the necessary signaling protocol translation, e.g., SS7 to and from SIP, and media format conversion, such as TDM voice format to and from IP based packet voice format.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram depicting an exemplary configuration of the communication system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> constructed in accordance with one or more aspects of the invention. An endpoint device <b>202</b> is configured for communication with the core network <b>110</b> via an access network <b>204</b> and at least one border element (BE) <b>206</b>. An endpoint device <b>212</b> is configured for communication with the core network <b>110</b> via an access network <b>210</b> and at least one BE <b>208</b>. The endpoint device <b>202</b> and the endpoint device <b>212</b> may comprise any of the customer endpoint devices described above (e.g., TDM devices, IP devices, etc.). The access networks <b>204</b> and <b>210</b> may comprise any of the access networks detailed above (e.g., PSTN, DSL/Cable, LAN, etc).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The core network <b>110</b> further includes a dedicated application server <b>214</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, the server <b>214</b> is configured to monitor the rate changes in the central processing unit (CPU) utilization and memory usage for each network component (e.g., border elements, core elements, call control elements, application servers, etc.) in the core network <b>110</b>. Notably, each network component may include various hardware and software components under control of a CPU coupled to a memory. In the event either activity exceeds a certain predefined level in a given network element (e.g., BE <b>206</b>), the server <b>214</b> sends at least one instruction message to the network element in order to resolve the excess rate change in the utilization of CPU and/or memory. Although only one server <b>214</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, those skilled in the art will appreciate that more than one server <b>214</b> may be utilized in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, each network element may be configured with two predefined thresholds. One threshold corresponds to the rate change in the CPU utilization level (e.g., a predefined number of instructions/second over a given time period). The second threshold is associated with the rate change in memory space used by the network element (e.g., a predefined number of bytes per second over a given time period). Typically, these thresholds are set at levels that may be considered high or excessive by a network operator (e.g., 5 billion instructions per second over a predefined time period of 5 seconds). In the event either threshold level is exceeded (e.g., if the border element experiences a large incoming call volume that causes the CPU utilization rate change to exceed the predefined threshold level), the network element may be configured to transmit an alarm message to the application server <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For instance, if the CPU utilization is measured in instructions per second, the rate of change in CPU utilization is measured as the difference of the number of instructions/sec at time A and the number of instructions/sec at time B. In one embodiment, the present invention may be a threshold of &#x201c;X&#x201d; instructions/sec over a period of 5 seconds. For example, if a measurement of 15 billion instructions/sec is made at t=0 (where t represents time) and a subsequent measurement is made at 20 billion instructions/sec at t=5 seconds, then the resulting change in rate is equal to 5 billion instructions (i.e., 20 billion instructions/sec&#x2212;15 billion instructions/sec) over the 5 second period. If this rate is greater than the predefined threshold of &#x201c;X&#x201d; instructions/sec over a period of 5 seconds, then the threshold is exceed and an alarm message is generated. Depending on the embodiment, the network element (e.g., BE <b>206</b>) may send the alarm message to the server <b>214</b> or it may autonomously process the alert.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Similarly, the rate change of memory usage is calculated in a similar manner. If the memory usage is measured in bytes per second, the rate of change in memory usage is measured as the difference of the number of bytes/sec at time A and the number of bytes/sec at time B. In one embodiment, the present invention may be a threshold of &#x201c;X&#x201d; bytes/sec over a period of 5 seconds. For example, if a measurement of 15 billion bytes/sec is made at t=0 and a subsequent measurement is made at 20 billion bytes/sec at t=5 seconds, then the resulting change in rate is equal to 5 billion bytes (i.e., 20 billion bytes/sec&#x2212;15 billion bytes/sec) over the 5 second period. If this rate is greater than the predefined threshold of &#x201c;X&#x201d; bytes/sec over a period of 5 seconds, then the threshold is exceed and an alarm message is generated. Depending on the embodiment, the network element (e.g., BE <b>206</b>) may send the alarm message to the server <b>214</b> or it may autonomously process the alert.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Once received, the alarm message is processed by the server <b>214</b> and an instruction message is subsequently sent back to the network element. Notably, the instruction message may detail a specified action that can remedy the problem (that is detailed in the alarm message) at the network element. For example, if the CPU utilization rate change threshold has been exceeded, the server <b>214</b> may instruct the network element to block a number of incoming calls (e.g., call flows) in order to reduce the network element's CPU workload (or alternatively, memory usage) which in turn reduces the rate change to an acceptable level (i.e. below the threshold). Similarly, the network element may be instructed to reroute at least one call flow to another network element in an effort to reduce the rate change in the network's CPU usage (or memory usage).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an alternative embodiment, the present invention completely resides in the network element. Specifically, the monitoring functions are executed by the network element as opposed to the application server <b>214</b>. Notably, instructions to remedy problems existing at a network element are generated by the network element itself.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram depicting an exemplary embodiment of a method <b>300</b> for monitoring a network element in a communications network as related to one or more aspects of the invention. The method <b>300</b> begins at step <b>302</b> where the rate changes in CPU utilization and memory usage in a network component is monitored. At step <b>304</b> where a determination is made as to whether the change in rate of the CPU utilization or memory usage exceed a predefined threshold. In one embodiment, each network element comprises two predefined thresholds (e.g., a CPU utilization and memory usage) rate changes. If at least one of the two thresholds is exceeded, the method <b>300</b> proceeds to step <b>306</b>. If neither threshold is exceeded, the method returns to step <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At step <b>306</b>, an alert is received from the network element. In one embodiment, a server <b>214</b> receives an alarm message from a network element when either the change in the rate of the CPU utilization or the memory usage (or both) of the network element exceeds a predefined threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At step <b>308</b>, an instruction is sent to the network element. In one embodiment, the server <b>214</b> responds by sending a message to the network element instructing it to reduce either the change in rate of the CPU utilization or the memory usage (or both). The instruction message may direct the network element to block or to reroute a number of calls received by the network element in an effort to reduce CPU utilization or memory usage rate change. The method <b>300</b> then returns to step <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a high level block diagram of a general purpose computer suitable for use in performing the functions described herein. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the system <b>400</b> comprises a processor element <b>402</b> (e.g., a CPU), a memory <b>404</b>, e.g., random access memory (RAM) and/or read only memory (ROM), a module <b>405</b> for monitoring a network element, and various input/output devices <b>406</b> (e.g., storage devices, including but not limited to, a tape drive, a floppy drive, a hard disk drive or a compact disk drive, a receiver, a transmitter, a speaker, a display, a speech synthesizer, an output port, and a user input device (such as a keyboard, a keypad, a mouse, and the like)).</p>
