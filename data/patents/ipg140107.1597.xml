<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a light-emitting element utilizing electroluminescence and a light-emitting device having the light-emitting element, and an apparatus for manufacturing the light-emitting device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, light-emitting elements using light-emissive organic compounds have actively been researched and developed. Such light-emitting elements basically have a structure where a layer containing a light-emissive organic compound is sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. By applying a voltage to such elements, electrons and holes are respectively injected into the layer containing a light-emissive organic compound from the pair of electrodes, and thus current flows therein. Then, these carriers (electrons and holes) are recombined with each other to bring the light-emissive organic compound into an excited state. The light-emissive organic compound emits light upon returning from the excited state to the ground state. Because of such a mechanism, the light-emitting element is called a light-emitting element of a current excitation type.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Note that as the kind of excited states formed by an organic compound, there are a singlet excited state and a triplet excited state. Light emission obtained from the singlet excited state is called fluorescence, while light emission obtained from the triplet excited state is called phosphorescence.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since such a light-emitting element is formed of an organic thin film with a thickness of about, for example, 0.1 &#x3bc;m, it has a big advantage in that manufacture with thin shape and light weight is enabled. In addition, there is another advantage in that quite a high response speed is achieved since it takes only about 1&#x3bc; second or less from the time when carriers are injected until the light emission is obtained. Such characteristics are considered as advantageous for a flat panel display element.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, since such a light-emitting element is formed in a film form, light emission with a plane surface can be easily obtained by forming a light-emitting element with a large area. Such an advantage cannot be obtained easily with either a point light source typified by an incandescent lamp or an LED or a linear light source typified by a fluorescent lamp; therefore, the light-emitting element has a high potential to be used as a surface light source which can be applied to illumination or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As described above, a light-emitting element of a current excitation type which uses a light-emissive organic compound is expected to be applied to various fields such as a light-emitting device and illumination; however, there remain a number of essential tasks to be completed. As one of the tasks, there is a reduction in power consumption. In order to reduce power consumption, it is required to reduce the driving voltage of the light-emitting element. Since the emission intensity of a light-emitting element of a current excitation type is determined by the amount of current flowing therein, it is required to flow large current with low voltage in order to reduce the driving voltage of the light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to Patent Document 1, it is reported that a driving voltage of a light-emitting element can be decreased by doping an organic layer which is in contact with an anode with an electron-accepting compound having a property capable of oxidizing an organic compound contained in the organic layer. The organic layer doped with an electron-accepting dopant does not cause a voltage rise in the element even when it is formed thick; therefore, a distance between the electrodes can be set longer than usual, which is advantageous in that a possibility of causing a short circuit can be significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, various attempts have been made to increase the extraction efficiency of light emitted from a light-emitting element to the outside by adjusting the optical distance. According to Patent Document 2, it is reported that the emission spectrum can be controlled by changing the thickness of an organic compound layer doped with an electron-accepting compound which is provided in the interface between an anode and a light-emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The organic compound layer doped with an electron-accepting compound disclosed in Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2 is formed by adding an electron-accepting compound by co-deposition or by applying a liquid solution which is adjusted by reacting an electron-accepting compound with an organic compound. Therefore, the organic compound and the electron-accepting compound are uniformly mixed, and thus the organic compound layer doped with the electron-accepting compound has isotropic conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, in order to control the electrical characteristics such as conductivity, it has been required to change the composition ratio of the organic compound to the electron-accepting compound included in the layer, or to change the kind of compounds included in the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, when the composition ratio of the layer is changed or the kind of compounds included in the layer is changed, characteristics other than the electrical characteristics, for example, optical characteristics (e.g., refractive index) change. If the optical characteristics change, the emission spectrum changes, which in turn changes the emission color and the extraction efficiency of light to the outside. Thus, it has been difficult to change the electrical characteristics without changing the optical characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">That is, light-emitting elements are required to be designed exactly in consideration of various characteristics such as the electrical characteristics and optical characteristics. In addition, light-emitting elements have been required to be manufactured very exactly in accordance with its original design.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although the invention will be fully described by way of embodiment modes and embodiment with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, unless otherwise such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the invention, they should be construed as being included therein.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(Embodiment Mode 1)</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this embodiment mode, description is made on a layer containing a composite material which is included in the light-emitting element of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The layer containing a composite material includes an organic compound and an inorganic compound, and the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound changes periodically. Since the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound changes periodically, conductivity in a stacked direction (also called a thickness direction) can be controlled. The &#x201c;stacked direction&#x201d; in this specification means a direction in one electrode of electrodes at the both side of the layer containing the composite material from the other electrode of the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">By changing the length of a cycle in which the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound changes periodically, a layer having desired conductivity can be obtained. For example, conductivity in the stacked direction (thickness direction) can be increased by shortening one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio, whereas the conductivity in the stacked direction can be decreased by lengthening the one cycle. &#x201c;A concentration ratio or a concentration changes periodically&#x201d; in this specification means that the concentration ratio or the concentration changes in the stacked direction so that a maximum value and a minimum value of the concentration ratio or the concentration are alternately repeated. The periodical change includes both a monotonous increase and a monotonous decrease. Note that, it is not necessary that repeated periods of the periodical change are the same completely and it is not necessary that repeated amplitudes of the periodical change are the same completely.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The organic compound and the inorganic compound included in the layer containing a composite material are insulators; therefore, conductivity as roughly an insulator can be obtained in the surface direction of the layer containing a composite material. Accordingly, desired conductivity can be obtained in the direction in which the concentration ratio changes periodically (e.g., stacked direction or thickness direction), while the conductivity in the direction in which the concentration ratio does not change periodically (e.g., surface direction) has a constant value, and therefore, there is an anisotropy in conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As an organic compound included in the layer containing a composite material, a material with an excellent hole transporting property is preferably used. In particular, an organic material having an arylamine skeleton is preferably used, and for example, a layer formed of the following aromatic amine compound (i.e., having benzene ring-nitrogen bonds) can be used: 4,4&#x2032;-bis(N-(4-(N,N-di-m-tolylamino)phenyl)-N-phenylamino)biphenyl (abbreviation: DNTPD); 4,4&#x2032;-bis[N-(4-diphenylaminophenyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: DPAB); N,N&#x2032;-diphenyl-N,N&#x2032;-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl-4,4&#x2032;-diamine (abbreviation: TPD); 4,4&#x2032;-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: a-NPD); 4,4&#x2032;-bis[N-(9,9-dimethylfluorene-2-yl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: DFLDPBi); 4,4&#x2032;-bis[N-(4-biphenylyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: BBPB); 1,5-bis(diphenylamino)naphthalene (abbreviation: DPAN); 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris(NN-diphenylamino)triphenylamine (abbreviation: TDATA); or 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino]triphenylamine (abbreviation: MTDATA). Alternatively, an organic material having a carbazole skeleton is preferably used, such as: N-(2-naphthyl)carbazolyl (abbreviation: NCz); 4,4&#x2032;-di(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (abbreviation: CBP); 9,10-bis[4-(N-carbazolyl)phenyl]anthracene (abbreviation: BCPA); 3,5-bis[4-(N-carbazolyl)phenyl]biphenyl (abbreviation: BCPBi); or 1,3,5-tris[4-(N-carbazolyl)phenyl]benzene (abbreviation: TCPB). Note that other materials can be used as long as they have a hole transporting property higher than an electron transporting property.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As an inorganic compound included in the layer containing a composite material, transition metal oxide is preferably used, specifically such as titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, vanadium oxide, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, manganese oxide, or rhenium oxide. In particular, vanadium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, or rhenium oxide is preferably used since each of them has a high electron-accepting property. Above all, molybdenum oxide is preferably used since it is stable even in the atmospheric air and thus is easy to be handled.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Note that the layer containing a composite material included in the light-emitting element of the invention can be manufactured by vapor deposition. Note that molybdenum oxide easily evaporates in vacuum, and thus is preferable in view of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The layer containing a composite material included in the light-emitting element of the invention can be manufactured by vapor-depositing an organic compound and an inorganic compound. By periodically changing the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound, conductivity in the stacked direction (thickness direction) can be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As a method of periodically changing the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound, a substrate, an evaporation source, and a mask may be rotated relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, by fixing an evaporation source for holding the organic compound and an evaporation source for holding the inorganic compound with a certain distance secured therebetween, and rotating the substrate (self-rotation with a center axis of the substrate), the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound can be changed periodically. The length of one cycle can be changed by controlling the deposition rate and the rotation rate.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this case, if the rotation rate of the substrate is decreased, one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound is lengthened, thereby conductivity in the stacked direction becomes small.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, by fixing the rotation rate of the substrate while increasing the deposition rate of materials from the evaporation sources, one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of the inorganic compound to the inorganic compound can be lengthened.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, by fixing the evaporation source for holding the organic compound and the evaporation source for holding the inorganic compound with a certain distance secured therebetween, and rotating the substrate by moving it relative to the evaporation sources (orbital rotation of the substrate), the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound can be changed periodically. In this case, by setting the orbital rate of the substrate to be slow, one cycle of the periodic change can be made longer.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, the substrate may be rotated by a combination of the self rotation and the orbital rotation. In this case also, the length of one cycle can be changed by controlling the deposition rate and the rotation rate of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Alternatively, by fixing the evaporation sources and the substrate while moving a mask, the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound can be changed periodically. For example, by increasing the rotation rate of the mask, one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio can be shortened. Accordingly, a layer having high conductivity in the stacked direction can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound can be changed periodically by rotating the evaporation sources while fixing the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, by opening/closing a shutter while fixing the evaporation sources and the substrate, the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound may be periodically changed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, by changing the adsorption rate by changing the temperature of the substrate, the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound may be periodically changed. That is, by changing the adsorption rate by increasing or decreasing the temperature of the substrate, the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound may be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Note that one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio differs depending on the distance between the substrate and the evaporation sources, the distance between the respective evaporation sources, and the like as well as the rotation rate of the substrate and the deposition rate; therefore, the optimal value may be set appropriately for each apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">By using the aforementioned method, a layer having a periodic change in the concentration ratio of an organic compound to an inorganic compound, that is the layer containing a composite material of the invention can be formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows an example of the concentration distribution of the layer containing a composite material of the invention in the depth direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, there is an anisotropy in conductivity because concentrations of the organic compound and the inorganic compound change periodically in the depth direction (e.g., stacked direction or thickness direction). The concentration of the inorganic compound is preferably not less than 5 wt % and not more than 90 wt %, and more preferably, not less than 10 wt % and not more than 80 wt %. Meanwhile, the concentration of the organic compound is preferably not less than 10 wt % and not more than 95 wt %, and more preferably, not less than 20 wt % and not more than 90 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio is preferably not less than 0.5 nm and not more than 30 nm, and more preferably, not less than 1 nm and not more than 10 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">By changing the length of one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of the layer containing a composite material of the invention, desired conductivity can be obtained in the stacked direction. In addition, since the organic compound and the inorganic compound included in the layer containing a composite material are insulators, conductivity as roughly an insulator can be obtained in the surface direction of the layer containing a composite material, which means the conductivity has a constant value. That is, desired conductivity can be obtained in the direction in which the concentration ratio changes periodically (e.g., stacked direction or thickness direction), while the conductivity in the direction in which the concentration ratio does not change periodically (e.g., surface direction) has a constant value, and therefore, there is an anisotropy in conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Accordingly, the conductivity of the layer containing a composite material can be provided with an anisotropy, unlike a layer having a simple mixture of an organic compound and an inorganic compound.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition, crystallization can be suppressed because an organic compound and an inorganic compound are mixed, unlike a case of stacking a layer containing only an organic compound and a layer containing only an inorganic compound.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Further, the layer containing a composite material can be changed in electrical characteristics without changing the composition ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound in the layer or changing the kind of compounds used for the layer. Therefore, other characteristics such as the optical characteristics are not changed much. Accordingly, a light-emitting element can be designed and manufactured with redundancy.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Description is made with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> on a vapor deposition apparatus used for carrying out the invention, and a method for forming a layer containing a composite material by using the vapor deposition apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A vapor deposition apparatus used for carrying out the invention is provided with a processing chamber <b>1001</b> where vapor deposition is performed with respect to an object to be processed, and a transfer chamber <b>1002</b>. The object to be processed is transferred to the processing chamber <b>1001</b> through the transfer chamber <b>1002</b>. The transfer chamber <b>1002</b> is provided with an arm <b>1003</b> for transferring the object to be processed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Inside the processing chamber <b>1001</b>, a holding portion for holding the object to be processed, an evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>a </i>for holding a first material, and an evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>b </i>for holding a second material are provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the holding portion for holding the object to be processed is composed of a first rotating plate <b>1012</b> which rotates with an axis <b>1013</b> as a center, and a plurality of second rotating plates <b>1014</b><i>a </i>to <b>1014</b><i>d </i>provided on the first rotating plate <b>1012</b>. The second rotating plates <b>1014</b><i>a </i>to <b>1014</b><i>d </i>rotate with axes provided on the respective second rotating plates <b>1014</b><i>a </i>to <b>1014</b><i>d </i>as centers, independently of the axis <b>1013</b>. Objects to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a </i>to <b>1015</b><i>d </i>are held on the second rotating plates <b>1014</b><i>a </i>to <b>1014</b><i>d </i>respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the second rotating plate <b>1014</b><i>a </i>holds the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a</i>, the second rotating plate <b>1014</b><i>b </i>holds the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>b</i>, the second rotating plate <b>1014</b><i>c </i>holds the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>c</i>, and the second rotating plate <b>1014</b><i>d </i>holds the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">A layer containing a composite material is formed as follows. First, materials held in the evaporation sources <b>1011</b><i>a </i>and <b>1011</b><i>b </i>are heated to sublime. Meanwhile, the first rotating plate <b>1012</b> and the second rotating plates <b>1014</b><i>a </i>to <b>1014</b><i>d </i>which hold the objects to be processed are rotated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, when the distance between the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a </i>and the evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>a </i>is shorter than the distance between the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a </i>and the evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>b</i>, each material is deposited onto the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a </i>in such a manner that the first material has a higher concentration than the second material. To the contrary, as is seen in the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>c</i>, when the distance between the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>c </i>and the evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>b </i>is shorter than the distance between the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>c </i>and the evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>a</i>, each material is deposited onto the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>c </i>in such a manner that the second material has a higher concentration than the first material.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Next, when the first rotating plate <b>1012</b> is rotated to change the position of the second rotating plate <b>1014</b><i>a </i>in the processing chamber <b>1001</b>, the second rotating plate <b>1014</b><i>c </i>in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> holds the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a</i>. When the distance between the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a </i>and the evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>b </i>becomes shorter than the distance between the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a </i>and the evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>a</i>, each material is deposited onto the object to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a </i>in such a manner that the second material has a higher concentration than the first material.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In this manner, by changing the position of the objects to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a </i>to <b>1015</b><i>d </i>relative to the evaporation sources <b>1011</b><i>a </i>and <b>1011</b><i>b</i>, a layer containing a composite material which has a plurality of regions each having a different concentration ratio of materials can be formed on the objects to be processed <b>1015</b><i>a </i>to <b>1015</b><i>d</i>. Here, the width of each region in the stacked direction (e.g., thickness direction) included in the layer containing a composite material (length of one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio) may be appropriately changed by controlling the rotation rate of the first rotating plate <b>1012</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">For example, when the rotation rate of the first rotating plate <b>1012</b> is increased, one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of the first material to the second material becomes shorter, thereby conductivity in the stacked direction is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition, by fixing the rotation rate of the first rotating plate <b>102</b> while increasing the deposition rate of materials from the evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>a </i>and the evaporation source <b>1011</b><i>b</i>, one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of the first material to the second material can be lengthened.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Note that shapes of the first rotating plate <b>1012</b> and the second rotating plates <b>1014</b><i>a </i>to <b>1014</b><i>d </i>are not specifically limited, and polygons such as a quadrangle may be employed as well as a circular shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In addition, although the second rotating plates <b>1014</b><i>a </i>to <b>1014</b><i>d </i>are not necessarily required, the provision of the second rotating plates <b>1014</b><i>a </i>to <b>1014</b><i>d </i>will reduce variations in the thickness of a layer formed on the object to be processed, and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The first electrode <b>102</b> may be formed by using various metals, alloys, electrically conductive compounds, or a mixture of such materials. For example, the first electrode <b>102</b> may be formed by using indium tin oxide (ITO); indium tin oxide containing silicon; IZO (Indium Zinc Oxide) obtained by mixing indium oxide with 2 to 20 wt % of zinc oxide (ZnO); or indium oxide containing 0.5 to 5 wt % of tungsten oxide and 0.1 to 1 wt % of zinc oxide (IWZO).

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The second layer <b>104</b> is a layer formed of a substance with a high hole transporting property, for example, an aromatic amine compound (i.e., having benzene ring-nitrogen bonds) such as 4,4&#x2032;-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: a-NPD); N,N&#x2032;-dipheny-N,N&#x2032;-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1&#x2032;-biphenyl-4,4&#x2032;-diamine (abbreviation: TPD); 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris(N,N-diphenylamino)triphenylamine (abbreviation: TDATA); or 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino]triphenylamine (abbreviation: MTDATA).

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The second electrode <b>107</b> may be formed of a material with a high work function (3.8 eV or lower) such as a metal, an alloy, an electrically conductive compound, or a mixture of them. As a specific example of such cathode material, there are metals belonging to the group 1 or 2 of the periodic table, namely alkaline metals such as lithium (Li) or cesium (Cs), alkaline earth metals such as magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), or strontium (Sr), or alloys containing such metals (MgAg or AlLi). However, by providing a layer having a function to promote electron injection on the second electrode <b>107</b> so as to be located between the second electrode <b>107</b> and the light-emitting layer, various conductive materials can be used as the second electrode <b>107</b> regardless of the value of the work function, such as Al, Ag, ITO, or ITO containing silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Note that the layer having a function to promote electron injection includes a compound of alkaline metals such as lithium fluoride (LiF) or cesium fluoride (CsF) or a compound of alkaline earth metals such as calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>).

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The second layer <b>104</b>, the third layer <b>105</b>, and the fourth layer <b>106</b> may be formed by a known method such as vapor deposition, ink-jet deposition, or spin coating. In addition, different deposition methods may be used for forming the respective electrodes or layers.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the light-emitting element of the invention having the aforementioned structure, current flows by a potential difference generated between the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b>, thereby holes and electrons are recombined in the third layer <b>105</b> as a layer containing a substance with a high light-emitting property, and thus light emission is obtained. That is, a light-emitting region is formed in the third layer <b>105</b>. Note that not the whole region of the third layer <b>105</b> is required to function as a light-emitting region, but a light-emitting region may be formed, for example, only in a part of the third layer <b>105</b> which is closer to the second electrode <b>104</b> or the fourth layer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Light emission is extracted to the outside through one or both of the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b>. Accordingly, one or both of the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> is formed of a light-transmissive substance. In the case where only the first electrode <b>102</b> is formed of a light-transmissive substance, light is emitted from the substrate side through the first electrode <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Alternatively, in the case where only the second electrode <b>107</b> is formed of a light-transmissive substance, light is emitted from the opposite side of the substrate through the second electrode <b>107</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Further alternatively, in the case where both the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> are formed of a light-transmissive substance, light is emitted from both the substrate side and the opposite side of the substrate through the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>

Any other structure may be employed as long as a region for recombining holes and electrodes is provided away from the first electrode <b>102</b> and the second electrode <b>107</b> in order to prevent light quenching which would be caused when the light-emitting region is located close to a metal, and a layer containing a composite material as shown in Embodiment Mode 1 is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">That is, the stacked structure of the layers is not specifically limited, and a layer containing a composite material of the invention may be freely combined with a layer formed of a substance with a high electron transporting property, a substance with a high hole transporting property, a substance with a high electron injection property, a substance with a high hole injection property, a substance with a high bipolar property (substance with both a high electron transporting property and a hole transporting property), and the like. In addition, a layer formed of a silicon oxide film or the like may be provided over the first electrode <b>102</b> in order to control a portion for recombining carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The light-emitting element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a structure where a first electrode <b>302</b> functioning as a cathode, a first layer <b>303</b> formed of a substance with a high electron transporting property, a second layer <b>304</b> containing a substance with a high light-emitting property, a third layer <b>305</b> with a high hole transporting property, a fourth layer <b>306</b> as a layer containing a composite material of the invention, and a second electrode <b>307</b> functioning as an anode are stacked in this order. Note that reference numeral <b>301</b> denotes a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In this embodiment mode, a light-emitting element is formed over a substrate made of glass, plastic or the like. By forming a plurality of such light-emitting elements over a substrate, a passive matrix light-emitting device can be manufactured. Alternatively, the light-emitting elements may be formed over a substrate having a thin film transistor (TFT) array as well as the aforementioned substrate made of glass, plastic or the like. Accordingly, an active matrix light-emitting device can be manufactured, where drive of light-emitting elements is controlled with TFTs. Note that the structure of each TFT is not specifically limited. It may be staggered TFT or an inversely staggered TFT. As for a driver circuit formed on the TFT array substrate also, one or both of n-channel transistors and p-channel transistors may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The light-emitting element of the invention has a layer containing a composite material as shown in Embodiment Mode 1. Therefore, the layer containing a composite material can be changed in electrical characteristics by changing the length of one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound included in the layer containing a composite material. That is, electrical characteristics can be changed without changing the composition ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound in the layer or changing the kind of compounds used for the layer. Therefore, other characteristics such as the optical characteristics are not changed much. Accordingly, a light-emitting element can be designed and manufactured with redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In addition, since the layer containing a composite material of the invention has high conductivity in the stacked direction, the driving voltage of the light-emitting element can be decreased. Meanwhile, since the conductivity in the surface direction is low, cross talk which would be generated between adjacent light-emitting elements can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In addition, since the layer containing a composite material of the invention has high conductivity in the stacked direction, the driving voltage of the light-emitting element can be prevented from increasing even when the layer containing a composite material is formed thick.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In addition, since the layer containing a composite material can be formed to have a desired thickness, the color purity and the light extraction efficiency can be increased by optical designs without the need for increasing the driving voltage of the light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, since the increased thickness of the layer containing a composite material can prevent short circuit due to dust, shocks, and the like, a light-emitting element with high reliability can be obtained. For example, although layers between a pair of electrodes of a general light-emitting element have a thickness of 100 to 150 nm, layers (including a layer containing a composite material) between a pair of electrodes of a light-emitting element of the invention can be formed to have a thickness of 100 to 500 nm, or preferably 200 to 500 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A layer containing a composite material used for a light-emitting element of the invention is capable of having an ohmic contact with an electrode; therefore, contact resistance with the electrode is low. Thus, electrode materials can be selected without considering the work function or the like. That is, the selection range of the electrode materials can be widened.</p>

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Since the driving voltage of the light-emitting element can be prevented from increasing even if the third layer <b>413</b> is formed thick, the thickness of the third layer <b>413</b> can be freely set and the extraction efficiency of light emitted from the first layer <b>411</b> can be increased.

<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows an example of a structure of the light-emitting element of the invention.

<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The first electrode <b>201</b> and the second electrode <b>202</b> may have the same structure as that of Embodiment Mode 3.

The third layer <b>213</b> is a layer containing a high electron-donating substance and a compound having a high electron transporting property, and the fourth layer <b>214</b> is a layer containing a composite material shown in Embodiment Mode 1. An electron-donating substance contained in the third layer <b>213</b> is preferably an alkaline metal, an alkaline earth metal, oxide thereof, or salt. Specifically, there are lithium, cesium, calcium, lithium oxide, calcium oxide, barium oxide, cesium carbonate, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">With such a structure, electrons are given/received in the vicinity of an interface between the third layer <b>213</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b> by applying a voltage as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, and electrons and holes are generated. At this time, the third layer <b>213</b> transports electrons to the second layer <b>212</b> while the fourth layer <b>214</b> transports holes to the second electrode <b>202</b>. That is, the third layer <b>213</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b> jointly function as a carrier generating layer.

Note that by providing another set of the second layer and the third layer between the fourth layer <b>214</b> and the second electrode <b>202</b>, a tandem light-emitting element can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Each of the first layer <b>211</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b> has high conductivity in the stacked direction while having low conductivity in the surface direction.

Further, even in the case of forming the first layer <b>211</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b> to be thick, the driving voltage of the light-emitting element can be prevented from increasing.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Since the driving voltage of the light-emitting element can be prevented from increasing even if the first layer <b>211</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b> are formed thick, the thickness of the first layer <b>211</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b> can be freely set, and the extraction efficiency of light emitted from the second layer <b>212</b> can be improved. In addition, the thickness of the first layer <b>211</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b> may be set so as to improve the color purity of light emitted from the second layer <b>212</b>. Since the first layer <b>211</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b> have high transmissivity of visible light, decrease in the extraction efficiency of light to the outside can be suppressed regardless of the increased thickness of the first layer <b>211</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the light-emitting element of this embodiment mode, layers between the second layer having a light-emitting function and the anode, and layers between the second layer and the cathode can be formed quite thick; therefore, short circuit of the light-emitting element can be effectively prevented.

Further, by forming the first layer <b>211</b> and the fourth layer <b>214</b> by using the same material, layers formed of the same material can be provided on opposite sides of the layer having a light-emitting function; therefore, distortion due to stress can be suppressed.</p>

<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In this embodiment mode, description is made on the optical design of a light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In using the light-emitting elements shown in Embodiment Mode 3 to Embodiment Mode 6, the extraction efficiency of light for each color can be increased by varying the thickness of at least one of the layers other than the first electrode and the second electrode among each light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, light-emitting elements which respectively emit light with a red color (R), green color (G), and blue color (B) share a first electrode <b>1101</b> as a reflective electrode and a second electrode <b>1102</b> having a light-transmitting property. The light-emitting element which emits red light has a first layer <b>1111</b>R, a second layer <b>1112</b>R, a third layer <b>1113</b>R, and a fourth layer <b>1114</b>R. The light-emitting element which emits green light has a first layer <b>1111</b>G, a second layer <b>1112</b>G, and a third layer <b>1113</b>G, and a fourth layer <b>1114</b>G. The light-emitting element which emits blue light has a first layer <b>1111</b>B, a second layer <b>1112</b>B, a third layer <b>1113</b>B, and a fourth layer <b>1114</b>B. The first layers <b>1111</b>R, <b>1111</b>G and <b>1111</b>B are formed to have different thickness from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Note that when a voltage which allows a potential of the first electrode <b>1101</b> to be higher than that of the second electrode <b>1102</b> is applied to the light-emitting element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, holes are injected into the second layer <b>1112</b> from the first layer <b>1111</b>. Electrons are given/received in the vicinity of an interface between the third layer <b>1113</b> and the fourth layer <b>1114</b>, and electrons and holes are generated. At this time, the third layer <b>1113</b> transports electrons to the second layer <b>1112</b> while the fourth layer <b>1114</b> transports holes to the second electrode <b>1102</b>. The holes and electrons are recombined in the second layer <b>1112</b> to bring the light-emissive substance into an excited state. The light-emissive substance in the excited state emits light in returning to the ground state.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">By varying the respective thickness of the first layers <b>1111</b>R, <b>1111</b>G, and <b>1111</b>B for each emission color as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the light extraction efficiency can be prevented from decreasing, which would otherwise be caused by having a different optical path between the case where the light emission is recognized directly through the second electrode and the case where the light emission is recognized through the second electrode after being reflected by the first electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Specifically, in the case where light enters the first electrode, the reflected light is inverted in phase, which yields an interference effect of light. As a result, the extraction efficiency of light to the outside can be increased if the optical distance between the light-emitting region and the reflective electrode, that is the refraction index times distance is (2 m&#x2212;1)/4 times (m is an arbitrary positive integer) as large as the emission wavelength, specifically when the refraction index times distance is &#xbc;, &#xbe;, 5/4 or . . . . On the other hand, if the refraction index times distance is m/2 times (m is an arbitrary positive integer) as large as the emission wavelength, specifically when the refraction index times distance is &#xbd;, 1, 3/2 or . . . , the extraction efficiency of light to the outside is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Accordingly, in the light-emitting element of the invention, the thickness of one of the first to fourth layers is varied between each light-emitting element in order that the optical distance between the light-emitting region and the reflective electrode, that is the refraction index times distance, can be (2 m&#x2212;1)/4 times (m is an arbitrary positive integer) as large as the emission wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In particular, it is preferable to vary the thickness of a layer provided between the reflective electrode and the layer where electrons and holes are recombined, among the first to fourth layers. Alternatively, the thickness of a layer provided between the light-transmissive electrode and the layer where electrons and holes are recombined may be varied as well. Further, both of such layers may be varied in thickness. As a result, light can be efficiently extracted to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In order to vary the thickness of one of the first to fourth layers, the layer is required to be formed thick. The light-emitting element of the invention has a feature that a layer containing a composite material shown in Embodiment Mode 1 is used as the layer to be formed thick.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In general, when a layer of a light-emitting element is formed thick, the driving voltage of the light-emitting element is undesirably increased. However, if a layer containing a composite material shown in Embodiment Mode 1 is used as the layer to be formed thick, the driving voltage per se can be suppressed, thereby the driving voltage can be prevented from increasing even when the layer is formed thick.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an example where the optical distance between a light-emitting region and a reflective electrode of a light-emitting element for red (R) emission is &#xbc; times as long as the emission wavelength, the optical distance between a light-emitting region and a reflective electrode of a light-emitting element for green (G) emission is &#xbe; times as long as the emission wavelength, and the optical distance between a light-emitting region and a reflective electrode of a light-emitting element for blue (B) emission is 5/4 times as long as the emission wavelength. Note that the invention is not limited to these values, and the value of m may be set appropriately. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the value of m in (2 m&#x2212;1)/4 may be different among each light-emitting element as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">By forming one of the first to fourth layers to be thick, short circuit between the first electrode and the second electrode can be prevented, which is quite preferable for increasing the productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In this manner, by using the light-emitting element of the invention, at least one of the first to fourth layers may be varied in thickness among light-emitting elements for the respective emission colors. At this time, a layer provided between the reflective electrode and the layer where electrons and holes are recombined is preferably varied in thickness among the light-emitting elements for the respective emission colors. Further, a layer containing a composite material shown in Embodiment Mode 1 is preferably used for the layer which is required to be formed thick because the driving voltage of the light-emitting element can be prevented from increasing accordingly.</p>

<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The layer <b>616</b> containing a light-emissive substance has a layer containing a composite material shown in Embodiment Mode 1. As other materials which constitute the layer <b>616</b> containing a light-emissive substance, a low molecular material, a medium molecular material (including oligomer and dendrimer), or a high molecular material may be used. The materials used for the layer containing a light-emissive substance are generally formed in a single layer or a stacked layer of organic compounds. In the invention, such a structure can also be employed that a film formed of an organic compound partially includes an inorganic compound. In addition, the layer <b>616</b> containing a light-emissive substance may be formed by a known method such as vapor deposition using a vapor-deposition mask, ink-jet deposition, or spin coating. Note that the layer containing a composite material is preferably formed by the method shown in Embodiment Mode 1 or Embodiment Mode 2.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">As a material used for the second electrode <b>617</b> which is formed over the layer <b>616</b> containing a light-emissive substance and functions as a cathode, a material with a low work function is preferably used such as Al, Ag, Li, or Ca, or an alloy or compound thereof such as MgAg, MgIn, AlLi, CaF<sub>2</sub>, LiF, or calcium nitride. In the case where light generated in the layer <b>616</b> containing a light-emissive substance travels through the second electrode <b>617</b>, the second electrode <b>617</b> is preferably formed by using a stacked layer of a thin metal film and a light-transmissive conductive film (ITO, indium oxide containing 2 to 20 wt % of zinc oxide, indium tin oxide containing silicon, zinc oxide (ZnO), or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Further, by attaching the sealing substrate <b>604</b> to the element substrate <b>610</b> with the sealant <b>605</b>, such a structure is obtained that a light-emitting element <b>618</b> is provided in the space <b>607</b> surrounded by the element substrate <b>610</b>, the sealing substrate <b>604</b>, and the sealant <b>605</b>. Note that the space <b>607</b> is filled with a filling material such as an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen, argon, or the like) or the sealant <b>605</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Note also that the sealant <b>605</b> is preferably formed with an epoxy resin. It is desirable that such a material should not transmit moisture or oxygen as mush as possible. As a material used for the sealing substrate <b>604</b>, a glass substrate or a quartz substrate may be used as well as a plastic substrate formed of FRP (Fiberglass-Reinforced Plastic), PVF (polyvinylfluoride), mylar, polyester, acrylic, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In this manner, a light-emitting device having the light-emitting element of the invention can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The light-emitting device of the invention has a layer containing a composite material shown in Embodiment Mode 1. Therefore, the layer containing a composite material can be changed in electrical characteristics by changing the length of one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of an organic compound to an inorganic compound included in the layer containing a composite material. That is, the electrical characteristics can be changed without changing the composition ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound in the layer or changing the kind of compounds used for the layer. Therefore, other characteristics such as the optical characteristics are not changed much. Accordingly, a light-emitting device can be designed and manufactured with redundancy.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In addition, since the light-emitting device of the invention has a layer containing a composite material shown in Embodiment Mode 1, conductivity in the stacked direction can be increased. Therefore, the driving voltage of the light-emitting element can be decreased. Meanwhile, since the conductivity in the surface direction can be low, cross talk which would be generated between adjacent light-emitting elements can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In addition, since the layer containing a composite material shown in Embodiment Mode 1 has high conductivity in the stacked direction, the driving voltage of the light-emitting element can be prevented from increasing even when the layer containing a composite material is formed thick. Therefore, short circuit of the light-emitting element can be prevented by forming the layer containing a composite layer to be thick. Further, a light-emitting device with reduced power consumption can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In addition, since the layer containing a composite material can be formed to have a desired thickness, the color purity and the light extraction efficiency can be increased by optical designs without the need for increasing the driving voltage of the light-emitting element. Thus, a light-emitting device having reduced power consumption and increased reliability can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">As described heretofore, although this embodiment mode illustrates an active matrix light-emitting device where drive of light-emitting elements is controlled with TFTs, a passive matrix light-emitting device may be formed as well, where light-emitting elements are driven without specifically providing driving elements such as transistors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a perspective view of a passive matrix light-emitting device manufactured in accordance with the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a layer <b>955</b> containing a light-emissive substance is provided between an electrode <b>952</b> and an electrode <b>956</b> over a substrate <b>951</b>. An end portion of the electrode <b>952</b> is covered with an insulating layer <b>953</b>. Over the insulating layer <b>953</b>, a partition layer <b>954</b> is provided. The partition layer <b>954</b> has tapered sidewalls with such a slope that the distance between opposite sidewalls diminishes toward the substrate surface. That is, the cross section of the partition layer <b>954</b> in the short side direction has a trapezoidal shape where a bottom base (side in the same direction as the surface direction of the insulating layer <b>953</b>, which is in contact with the insulating layer <b>953</b>) is shorter than a top base (side in the same direction as the surface direction of the insulating layer <b>953</b>, which is not in contact with the insulating layer <b>953</b>). By providing the insulating layer <b>954</b> in this manner, defects of light-emitting elements resulting from static electricity or the like can be prevented. In the passive matrix light-emitting device also, low-power-consumption drive can be achieved by providing the light-emitting element of the invention which can operate with low driving voltage.</p>

<p id="p-0210" num="0209">In this embodiment, description is made specifically on a layer containing a composite material.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Indium tin oxide containing silicon was formed over a substrate. Then, a layer formed by co-depositing DNTPD with molybdenum oxide was formed thereover to have a thickness of 120 nm with the condition that the weight ratio of DNTPD to molybdenum oxide in the whole layer is 1:0.67.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Then, aluminum was formed with a thickness of 200 nm over the layer formed by co-depositing DNTPD with molybdenum oxide, and the element characteristics were inspected.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The following conditions were set. An element <b>1</b> was formed by co-depositing DNTPD with molybdenum oxide under the condition that the deposition rate of the organic compound is 0.4 nm/s, and the rotation rate of the substrate (orbital rotation) is 8 rpm. An element <b>2</b> was formed by co-depositing DNTPD with molybdenum oxide under the condition that the deposition rate of the organic compound is 0.4 nm/s, and the rotation rate of the substrate (orbital rotation) is 2 rpm. An element <b>3</b> was formed by co-depositing DNTPD with molybdenum oxide under the condition that the deposition rate of the organic compound is 1.6 nm/s, and the rotation rate of the substrate (orbital rotation) is 8 rpm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the current density-voltage characteristics of the elements <b>1</b> to <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">As is seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, current can flow between electrodes (stacked direction) of the element <b>1</b> more easily than in the elements <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Cross sections of the elements <b>1</b> to <b>3</b> were observed with a transmission electron microscope. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> show the observation results (TEM photographs). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an image of the element <b>1</b> (magnification of 150,000&#xd7;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an image of the element <b>1</b> (magnification of 1,000,000&#xd7;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an image of the element <b>2</b> (magnification of 150,000&#xd7;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows an image of the element <b>2</b> (magnification of 1,000,000&#xd7;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows an image of the element <b>3</b> (magnification of 150,000&#xd7;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows an image of the element <b>3</b> (magnification of 1,000,000&#xd7;).</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">From the results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, it can be seen that a first region with a dark color and a second region with a light color are alternately provided. The first region with a dark color is a region where the average atomic weight is high, while the second region with a light color is a region where the average atomic weight is low. Since the atomic weight of the inorganic compound is higher than that of the organic compound in the layer containing a composite material of the invention, the first region with a dark color in the TEM photographs corresponds to a region containing a larger amount of inorganic compound, while the second region with a light color corresponds to a region containing a larger amount of organic compound.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">In this embodiment, the first region with a dark color is a region where the concentration of molybdenum oxide is higher, while the second region with a light color is a region where the concentration of DNTPD is higher. Accordingly, it can be confirmed in the element manufactured in this embodiment that the region having a high concentration of molybdenum oxide and the region having a low concentration of molybdenum oxide are alternately provided.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In addition, each arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> indicates one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of DNTPD to molybdenum oxide. In the element <b>1</b>, one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio is as long as about 3 nm. In addition, in the elements <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio is as long as about 12 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Accordingly, it can be seen that in the element <b>1</b>, the region having a high concentration of molybdenum oxide and the region having a low concentration of molybdenum oxide are alternately provided in quite a shorter cycle than those of the elements <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. This shows that one cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of DNTPD to molybdenum oxide is lengthened by increasing the deposition rate or by decreasing the rotation rate of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In addition, from the observation results with a transmission electron microscope in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and the current density-voltage characteristics of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, it can be seen that a current can easily flow in the stacked direction and the conductivity is thus improved by shortening the cycle of the periodic change in the concentration ratio of DNTPD to molybdenum oxide. Accordingly, by controlling the periodic change in the concentration ratio of the organic compound to the inorganic compound, a layer having desired conductivity can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Though the elements were observed with a transmission electron microscope in this embodiment, they are also observed with means for detecting a difference of a density or average atomic weight.</p>
