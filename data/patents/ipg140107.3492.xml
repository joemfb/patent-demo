<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention, in its several embodiments, pertains generally to methods and devices for electrical transmission via a transmission cable extendable and retractable via a conduit that may be repositioned.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 7,256,516 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,999 disclose electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. EV charging stations in the state of the art typically emulate conventional gas station fueling characteristics and accordingly may be described generally as segmented into three main systems analogous to a gasoline station pump. The analogous segments include: (a) a base unit for managing the fuel supply, in this case electricity from the electric utility system; (b) a fuel transfer hose, or in the EV case a transmission cable to carry the flow of electricity to the EV; and (c) a connector from the transmission cable to the EV itself.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention, in its several embodiments, comprises methods and devices for connecting a current source to a target storage device via a transmission cable extendable and retractable via a conduit that may be repositioned. For example, a battery charging device embodiment of the present invention may comprise: a conduit segment configured to receive an extending transmission cable; the transmission cable connectable, e.g., switchably, and/or directly, or in some fashion the transmission cable may be placed in an electrical communication with a current source; and a transmission cable drive mechanism configured to extend the transmission cable into the conduit segment. An exemplary embodiment may also include a housing that comprises the transmission cable connectable to the current source and a transmission cable drive mechanism configured to extend the transmission cable into the conduit segment. The transmission cable of some battery charging device embodiments may be disposed about at least one drive wheel aligned to extend the transmission cable in a direction away from the housing and into the conduit segment. The transmission cable drive mechanism of some battery charging device embodiments may comprise a tow wire and drive pulley. The transmission cable drive mechanism of some battery charging device embodiments may be further configured to retract the transmission cable from the conduit segment. Some battery charging device embodiments may further comprise a conduit assembly comprising the conduit segment and a handle-connector assembly comprising a transmission cable connector and a target port connector and for some of the embodiments, the transmission cable drive mechanism may comprise a partial vacuum generator effecting a partial vacuum, the partial vacuum effected proximate to the handle-connector assembly. Some battery charging device embodiments may have a transmission cable drive mechanism comprising a pressure differential generator effecting a pressure differential, the pressure differential having a volume of lower pressure effected proximate to the handle-connector assembly. Some battery charging device embodiments may air cool the transmission cable by blowing air within the conduit segment. Some battery charging device embodiments may further comprise a transmission cable comprised of at least two conductive cables, e.g., two, three or four conductive cables. Some battery charging device embodiments may further comprise a coating having a low coefficient of sliding friction interposed between the transmission cable and the conduit segment. Some battery charging device embodiments may further comprise a transmission cable drive mechanism where a first wheel opposes a second wheel and where at least one of: (a) the first wheel; and (b) the second wheel is a drive wheel, and where at least one of the first wheel and the second wheel may retractably engage the transmission cable via active mechanisms, such as via the powering of a solenoid, e.g., when extending or holding in place the transmission cable due to pulley rotation or non-rotation respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present invention include methods of charging a target storage device. For example, a method of charging a target storage device may comprise the steps of: (a) engaging a target storage device electrical receptacle with the target port connector of a conduit assembly comprising a conduit segment; (b) extending a transmission cable, within the conduit segment and away from a conduit assembly support structure, by a transmission cable drive mechanism, to engage the target port connector via the conduit segment; and (c) initiating current flow to the target storage device from a current source via the transmission cable. For some of the method embodiments, the transmission cable may be disposed about at least one drive wheel aligned to extend the transmission cable in a direction away from the housing and into the conduit segment. For some of the method embodiments, the transmission cable drive mechanism may comprise a tow wire and drive pulley. The exemplary methods of charging a target storage device may further comprise the steps of: (d) stopping current flow to the target storage device from the current source via the transmission cable and (e) retracting the transmission cable from the conduit segment. Some of the method embodiments may further comprise air cooling the transmission cable within the conduit segment. The exemplary methods of charging a target storage device may further comprise a coating having a low coefficient of sliding friction interposed between the transmission cable and the conduit segment.</p>

In this example, at least one of: the reel <b>150</b>, upper wheel or pulley <b>271</b>, and/or lower wheel or pulley <b>272</b> may be powered to rotate the reel clockwise <b>211</b> and counterclockwise <b>212</b>. The pair of transmission cables <b>160</b> travel <b>290</b> within the conduit segment <b>122</b> according to the direction of rotation of the at least one drive wheel. The transmission cable <b>160</b> may generally comprise an electrically insulative material, and/or a material that exhibits a low sliding friction coefficient about conductive cables, but a distal portion <b>261</b> of each of the transmission cables may be not be insulated.

A transverse cut <b>3</b> of the conduit segment <b>122</b> containing the transmission cable <b>160</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary cable and conduit arrangement as a cross-sectional view of the conduit segment <b>122</b> containing a portion of the transmission cable <b>160</b> that comprises two major channels <b>311</b>, <b>312</b> and two minor channels <b>321</b>, <b>322</b>. The inner wall of the conduit segment and the outer wall of the transmission cable may be coated or have applied to them a material exhibiting a low sliding friction coefficient. The inner walls of the two major channels <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, may be coated or have applied, e.g., as a layer or a wrap, to them a material exhibiting a low sliding friction coefficient. In this example, a first conductive cable <b>331</b> and a second conductive cable <b>332</b> together comprise a conductive core of the transmission cable <b>160</b>. The first conductive cable <b>331</b> may be encased in an electrically insulative material <b>341</b>, and/or a material that exhibits a low sliding friction coefficient. Likewise, the second conductive cable <b>332</b> may be encased in an electrically insulative material <b>342</b>, and/or a material that exhibits a low sliding friction coefficient. The outer wall of the cable encasing material <b>341</b>, <b>342</b> may not fully contact each of the inner walls of the two major channels <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, thereby allowing an air volume to be disposed between a portion of a major channel inner wall <b>361</b> and a portion of an encasing material outer wall <b>362</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">During the charging process, the transmission cables may heat due to resistive effects. The conductive cables <b>331</b>, <b>332</b> may be characterized for their resistivity as a function of temperature. The temperature of the conductive cables <b>331</b>, <b>332</b> may be monitored by reading the voltage from one end of the cable to the other. Based on the instant current, the resistance of the cable may be derived, e.g., R=V/I. From the derived resistance, the temperature of the conductive cables <b>331</b>, <b>332</b> may be inferred. The inferred temperature may be used in determining whether the charging is occurring within acceptably safe regions of cable temperature. To enhance the duration of a safe charging interval, active cooling of the conductive cables, the transmission cable, and/or the conduit segment may be effected by providing a conduit segment having an inner diameter larger than the outer diameter of each of the conductive cables and forcing air through the resulting volume in a direction from the charger housing to the connector end, or the reverse of that direction. The target device being charged, e.g., an electric vehicle, may have a mating receptacle, i.e., a target port, that has a mating hole that may be aligned with an exit air flow hole of the handle-connector assembly. Such an alignment may provide for the cooling of both the conductive cables <b>331</b>, <b>332</b> and the target port, e.g., an EV receptacle. Accordingly, a blower (not shown) may be disposed within the housing <b>110</b>, a housing <b>110</b> having an air intake duct, and the blower may be oriented to move the volume of air from the proximal portion of the conduit segment <b>121</b> toward the distal portion of the conduit segment <b>123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). One of the exemplary minor channels <b>321</b> may house an electrical pilot wire <b>351</b> that may be used to verify a closed electrical circuit prior to powering the converter to drive current through the transmission cable <b>160</b>. The other of the exemplary minor channels <b>322</b> may house a ground wire <b>352</b> and the other of the exemplary minor channels <b>322</b>, or an additional minor channel, may house a communication cable (not shown) to allow for communication between a processor (not shown) enclosed by the processor housing <b>130</b> and the handle-connector assembly <b>124</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). These or additional minor channels may be used as conduits for tow cable embodiments of a transmission cable drive mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary electrical interface at the distal end <b>123</b> of the conduit segment particularly between a handle-connector assembly <b>424</b> and the pair of conductive cables <b>331</b>, <b>332</b>. This example shows a first electrical connector <b>410</b> having a socket portion <b>411</b> for receiving the distal end of the first conductive cable <b>331</b> and a second electrical connector <b>420</b> having a socket portion <b>421</b> for receiving the distal end of the second conductive cable <b>332</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the electrical interface <b>251</b> within the reel hub may provide an electrical connection with the converter-base unit source end of the transmission cable <b>160</b> as a rotary, brush-type connection. For power and amp levels higher than those practically supported by brush-type connectors, and/or for longer wearing connections, the transmission cable <b>160</b>, particularly the conductive cables <b>331</b>, <b>332</b>, may be solidly attached to the source end. Embodiments having fixed attachments may be configured with the transmission cable <b>160</b> disposed in a droop-loop fashion within the housing <b>110</b>. One or more pulleys are powered to extend the pair of transmission cables from the housing and one or more masses or resilient elements are used to retract a previously extended transmission cable. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the invention <b>500</b> where the transmission cable <b>160</b> is looped within a housing <b>510</b> between a converter connector <b>551</b> and an exit port <b>514</b> at a proximal portion of the conduit segment <b>122</b> and by one or more powered wheels, pulleys, or rollers, operating as one or more drive wheels. In this example, in order to extend the transmission cable <b>160</b>, at least a unidirectional rotational drive is applied to at least one of: (a) one or both of the minor guiding pulleys <b>571</b>, <b>572</b>; and (b) one or more major looping pulleys <b>521</b>-<b>523</b>. One or more pulleys <b>531</b>-<b>533</b> may be deployed gravitationally below the one or more powered pulleys, e.g., one or more major looping pulleys <b>521</b>-<b>523</b>, and aid in the retraction of the transmission cable <b>160</b>. These one or more lower pulleys <b>531</b>-<b>533</b> may have mass augmentation <b>541</b>-<b>543</b>, e.g., attached pendulous weights, and these one or more lower pulleys <b>531</b>-<b>533</b> may be disposed within guide channels <b>561</b>-<b>563</b>. In some embodiments, at least a bidirectional rotational drive is applied to at least one of: (a) one or both of the minor guiding pulleys <b>571</b>, <b>572</b>; and (b) one or more major looping pulleys <b>521</b>-<b>523</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> in a state of transmission cable extension. The optional mass augmentation elements <b>541</b>-<b>543</b>, e.g., pendulous weights, may be further augmented or replaced by resilient elements such as springs that under tension pull downward on the lower pulleys <b>531</b>-<b>533</b>. Weights and or springs may be sized to overcome the sliding friction of the looping pulley system. Upon cessation of cable <b>160</b> extending mode, the rotation position of one or more powered pulleys, e.g., one or more major looping pulleys <b>521</b>-<b>523</b> and/or minor guiding pulleys <b>571</b>, <b>572</b>, may be held by one or more actuated latches, such as a solenoid-actuated clamp, that, when a charging cycle is complete or if the device losses power, the one or more solenoids retract and allow the pulleys to turn freely and thereby allow the cable to retract into the looping pulley assembly due to gravity and/or spring tension. In another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> illustrates an exemplary drive mechanism comprising the minor guiding pulleys <b>571</b>, <b>572</b>, one of which is at least a unidirectional drive wheel, where one of the minor guiding pulleys <b>571</b>, <b>572</b>, in this example the lower drive pulley <b>572</b>, is positioned proximate the transmission cable <b>160</b>, and attached to a mounting member <b>591</b> engaging a solenoid element <b>592</b>. Accordingly, the transmission cable <b>160</b> may be able to translate into the looped pulled assembly (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> shows the lower pulley <b>572</b> engaging the transmission cable <b>160</b> due to the solenoid element <b>592</b> extending the mounting member <b>591</b>. Whether an active or passive retraction mechanism is embodied, the absence of the transmission cable in the conduit segment when not in use for charging a target battery protects the transmission cable from damage and/or theft.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exploded, end-on view of another transmission cable embodiment of the invention where the pilot wire <b>621</b> and/or the ground wire <b>622</b> and/or the communication cable (not shown) are within a first conduit <b>630</b> and the pair of conductive cables <b>331</b>, <b>332</b> are within a second conduit <b>640</b>. The minor channels shown and/or additional minor channels may be used as conduits for tow cable embodiments of a transmission cable drive mechanism. The lower minor wheel, pulley <b>671</b>, or roller and/or the upper minor wheel, pulley <b>672</b>, or roller may be used to guide and/or drive the first conduit along with the second conduit into the conduit segment <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Accordingly, additional padding material <b>681</b>, <b>682</b> exhibiting a high sliding friction coefficient may be disposed, e.g., as a layer or a wrap, between the first conduit <b>630</b> and second conduit <b>640</b> proximate to the regions of the first conduit housing the pilot wire <b>621</b>, and/or a ground wire <b>622</b>, and/or a communication cable (not shown). The outer wall <b>641</b> of the second conduit <b>640</b> may not fully contact the inner wall <b>631</b> of the first conduit <b>630</b>, thereby allowing an air volume to be disposed between a portion of the first conduit inner wall <b>631</b> and a portion of the second conduit outer wall <b>641</b>. A blower (not shown) may be disposed within the housing <b>110</b> and may be oriented to move the volume of air from the proximal portion of the conduit segment <b>121</b> toward the distal portion of the conduit segment <b>123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In some embodiments, the conduit assembly <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may comprise a portion of the first conduit <b>630</b> and the conduit segment <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may comprise the first conduit <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additional channels may be present for embodiments with additional conductive cables such examples are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an exploded, end-on view of another transmission cable embodiment of the invention supportive of three-phase charging where a pilot wire <b>721</b>, and/or a ground wire <b>722</b>, are within a first conduit <b>730</b> and three or four conductive cables <b>741</b>-<b>744</b>, and an optional communication cable (<b>723</b>), are within a second conduit <b>740</b>. The minor channels shown and/or additional minor channels may be used as conduits for tow cable embodiments of a transmission cable drive mechanism. The lower minor wheel, pulley <b>771</b>, or roller and/or the upper minor wheel, pulley <b>772</b>, or roller may be used to guide and/or drive the first conduit along with the second conduit into the conduit segment <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Material exhibiting a high sliding friction coefficient may be disposed e.g., as a layer or a wrap, between the first conduit <b>730</b> and second conduit <b>740</b> The outer wall <b>745</b> of the second conduit <b>740</b> may not fully contact the inner wall <b>731</b> of the first conduit <b>730</b>, thereby allowing an air volume to be disposed between a portion of the first conduit inner wall <b>731</b> and a portion of the second conduit outer wall <b>745</b>. A blower (not shown) may be disposed within the housing <b>110</b> and may be oriented to move the volume of air from the proximal portion of the conduit segment <b>121</b> toward the distal portion of the conduit segment <b>123</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In some embodiments, the conduit assembly <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may comprise a portion of the first conduit <b>730</b> and the conduit segment <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may comprise the first conduit <b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary method of use, for example, as an EV charging station, has a user handling the conduit segment <b>122</b> via the handle-connector assembly <b>124</b> where the transmission cable <b>160</b> has not yet been extended into the conduit segment <b>122</b>. The charging conduit assembly <b>120</b> does not have the mass of the transmission cable <b>160</b> in this state. Accordingly, the user may be handling a charging conduit assembly that may be manufactured to be of a similar size, weight, and maneuverability to a conventional gasoline station fuel hose or, in some embodiments at least an assembly that is of less mass and greater maneuverability than that of a transmission cable, or cables, included therein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">To initiate the extension of the transmission cables, the user may input a signal via a user interface <b>112</b>, such as a button, at the handle-connector assembly <b>124</b>, that may be communicated to a processor via a communication cable, and/or the user may input a signal via a user interface <b>112</b> at the housing <b>110</b>. Responsive to the user input, the transmission cables are extended from the housing <b>110</b> and within the conduit segment <b>122</b> until connected with the handle-connector assembly <b>124</b>. Once a safe connection has been verified, e.g., via an electrical controller unit within the handle, flow of current via the transmission cables may begin.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B, the retraction of the transmission cable <b>160</b> may be automated in that once a full charge level and/or time of charging is achieved, a signal may be sent to the converter unit that signals the stoppage of the current flow, and that signal, or a signal based one or more similar parameters, may initiate the detachment of the transmission cable <b>160</b>, i.e., the conducting core, e.g., conductive cable <b>331</b>, <b>332</b>, from the connector. The transmission cable may then be retracted through the conduit segment and into the housing. Once the transmission cable <b>160</b> is retracted fully, or at least retracted sufficiently to a point of protecting the ends of the conductive core, e.g., the distal ends of the conductive cables <b>331</b>, <b>331</b>, the user may be signaled, e.g., by lights, a user interface panel, and/or an audible bell and/or an automated voice, e.g., &#x201c;return the handle to its cradle,&#x201d; to return the conduit assembly, to its resting position at or about the housing of the charging device. In some embodiments, the handle <b>424</b> may be attached or affixed to the vehicle in such a fashion that the handle <b>424</b> cannot be removed by the user until a disengaging signal is sent to the handle indicating that the transmission cable <b>160</b> has retracted sufficiently from the conduit segment <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention in its several embodiments may not be limited to a transmission cable for EV charging stations, and may include other embodiments and applications where reduction of transmission cable weight is desirable for its handling and the absence of the transmission cables in a conduit prior to charging may be preferred on a basis of improved human safety. Embodiments of the present invention may be enhanced with the inclusion of one or more safety switches and electrical control circuitry that may be included so the user is assured of these measures.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiments may be configured with various cable drive mechanisms and other ways of extending and retracting the transmission cable. For example, in addition to a pair of opposed dual wheels, pulleys, or rollers, <b>271</b>, <b>272</b>, <b>571</b>, <b>572</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5A</figref>) that may have troughs for a snug cable fitting, the transmission cables may be pulled through the conduit segment <b>122</b> by a small diameter, nonconductive, tow cable where the tow cable may be driven by one or more powered wheels, pulleys, or rollers. A cable collar, preferably nonconductive, may be connected to either a reciprocating tow cable, i.e., configured in tandem with the extending tow cable, or a second tow cable, independent of the extending tow cable, may be used to retract the transmission cable. For some smaller diameter transmission cable <b>160</b>, the transmission cable <b>160</b> may be drawn into a partial vacuum, or otherwise respond to a pressure differential created on the handle-connector portion <b>124</b> of the conduit <b>120</b> by a vacuum device that may be located within the housing <b>110</b> and a vacuum tube (not shown) integral to the conduit segment <b>122</b> and/or via a blower (not shown) located within the housing <b>110</b> impinging on an air-blocking collar disposed about a distal portion of the transmission cable <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The core of the transmission cable may be made of copper wire strands braided and/or twisted together. The conduit and the transmission cable covering may be made of weather resistant synthetic rubbers, such as neoprene. Plastics, including thermosetting plastics, may be used in insulative conduit connections. Polytetrafluoroethenes, such as TELFON&#x2122; by DuPont De Nemours and Company Corporation, may be used for surfaces having low sliding friction coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is contemplated that various combinations and/or subcombinations of the specific features and aspects of the above embodiments may be made and still fall within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that various features and aspects of the disclosed embodiments may be combined with or substituted for one another in order to form varying modes of the disclosed invention.
