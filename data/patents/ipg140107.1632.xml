<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems, and more particularly to wagering game systems that reflect current events.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wagering game machines, such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally, the popularity of such machines depends on the likelihood (or perceived likelihood) of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing wagering game machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same (or believed to be the same), players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines, features, and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore, there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The description that follows includes exemplary systems, methods, techniques, instruction sequences and computer program products that embody techniques of the present inventive subject matter. However, it is understood that the described embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obfuscate the description. Furthermore, the description utilizes indications of stages to aid in illustrating various examples. Indications of stages are intended to aid in understanding embodiments and do not indicate a required order of operations.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Wagering games can utilize current data about real-life (e.g., current events, public figures (e.g., political figures, athletes, movie/television stars, reality television contestants), etc.) to invigorate the wagering games. Utilizing the current real-life data invigorates the wagering games by dynamically changing various wagering game attributes (e.g., aesthetics, winning criteria, game mathematics and/or logic, etc.) to reflect real-life, which can include any one or more of current sports events, athletic performances, reality television shows, political races, etc. A dynamic current wagering game that reflects current events maintains a contemporary and relevant wagering game experience for players, as well as provides a familiar context to players. A system that supports dynamic current wagering games determines the relevancy of each injection of current real-life data and distributes wagering game data updates accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a conceptual example of updating wagering game data based on current real-life data. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wagering game servers <b>103</b>, <b>109</b>, and <b>113</b> operate to process current real-life data, and to update game data of wagering games instantiated on wagering game machines <b>115</b> and <b>117</b> based on the current real-life data. The wagering game server <b>103</b> acquires, parses, and communicates current real-life data. The wagering game server <b>103</b> acquires current real-life data via a network <b>101</b>. At a stage A, the wagering game server <b>103</b> parses the current real-life data and stores the parsed current real-life data into parsed current real-life data stores <b>105</b>. In this illustration, the current real-life data comprises sporting event data, political event data, and reality television show data. The data can be provided from a source over the network <b>101</b> as a single stream that is parsed into the different types of data, can be provided on different channels, can be provided individually from one or more sources, etc. The wagering game server <b>103</b> stores the parsed sporting event data, the parsed political event data, and the parsed reality television show data on different ones of the stores <b>105</b>. A variety of implementations of the stores <b>105</b> are possible (e.g., partitions on a store, network attached storage, shared storage at one of the wagering game servers, virtual storage aggregated over separate physical stores, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The wagering game server <b>109</b> accesses the parsed current real-life data stores <b>105</b> and a license database <b>107</b>. The wagering game server <b>109</b> accesses the stores <b>105</b> and to update game data. At a stage B, the wagering game server <b>109</b> accesses the parsed current real-life data stores <b>105</b>. The wagering game server <b>109</b> determines the appropriate updates to game data in accordance with the parsed current real-life data. Current real-life data can implicate protected assets. Examples of protected assets include depictions of a famous person, assets protected by copyright (e.g., visual assets, aural assets, statistical assets, etc.), assets protected by trademark laws, etc. If a protected asset is implicated, the wagering game server <b>109</b> accesses the license database <b>107</b>. With the data in the license database <b>107</b>, the wagering game server <b>109</b> verifies that a gaming establishment and/or wagering game manufacturer has permission to use the one or more protected assets implicated by the parsed current real-life data. For example, the wagering game server <b>109</b> determines that the parsed current real-life data implicates 1) an image of a new driver who currently leads a racing series, 2) a portion of song of a current loser of a reality television show singing contest, and 3) an image of a current leader in a political race. The wagering gamer server <b>109</b> uses the license database to verify permission to use the images and the portion of the song.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At a stage C, the wagering game server <b>109</b> updates wagering game data on wagering game data store <b>111</b> based on the parsed current real-life data and the verification. The wagering game server <b>109</b> may update values, update flags, update pointers, etc. To continue the above example, the wagering game server <b>109</b> activates and/or stores the image of the leading driver, the portion of the song of the losing contestant, and the image of the current leader.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The wagering game server <b>113</b> propagates the updated game data to the appropriate wagering game machines. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the wagering game server <b>113</b> causes reel symbols of a wagering game instance on a wagering game machine <b>115</b> to be updated with the images of the leading driver in the racing series. The wagering game server <b>113</b> also causes the reel symbols to be updated with an image of the leading driver's racing automobile. The wagering game server <b>113</b> updates an instance of a wagering game on a wagering game machine <b>117</b> to play the portion of the song of the losing contestant when player loses. The wagering game machine <b>113</b> also updates an instance of a bonus game hosted by a wagering game server <b>119</b>. A winner of the bonus game instance is selected based on the current leader of the political race. The wagering game server <b>113</b> also updates the bonus game instance to display the image of the political figure. As illustrated with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, changes in current events propagate to wagering game instances resulting in a living wagering game.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The specific examples provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> should not be used to limit embodiments. For instance, the update game data can take place at one or both of back-end stores and the wagering game machines. In addition, a push, pull, or hybrid model for updating wagering game data can be implemented. Wagering game machines can be notified that updated game data is available for download. As another example, a back-end server can push game data updates to wagering game machines when not active. Furthermore, a living wagering game system can acquire current real-life data in accordance with any one of a variety of models, formats, etc. To illustrate, a third party may provide updated wagering game data to back-end stores and/or servers of a gaming establishment. As another illustration, the wagering game or wagering game establishment can subscribe to different data feeds for current real-life data (e.g., a sports data channel, a political data channel, etc.). Moreover, a player may initiate update of wagering game data by requesting a live version of a wagering game, refresh of a wagering game instance, etc. The living wagering game system then fetches up to date data for the wagering game instance.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a conceptual example of processing current real-life data. A wagering game server <b>201</b> comprises a current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b> and a living wagering game data unit <b>213</b>. The wagering game server <b>205</b> acquires current racing series data from a data source A <b>201</b> and current political race data from a data source B <b>203</b>. The current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b> is aware of the data sources. For instance, the data is received on a particular socket, the data indicates data source, etc. At a stage A, the current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b> looks up an entry in a structure <b>209</b> based on the data sources <b>201</b> and <b>203</b>. The structure <b>209</b> (e.g., a hash table, a tree, a hardware table, etc.) includes multiple entries. In this example, the table <b>209</b> includes respective entries the data source A and the data source B.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For the current racing series data, the current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b> looks up the data source A entry in the structure <b>209</b>. The entry for the data source A associates the data source A with a parse function pointer and a reference to indications of wagering games and actions associated with the data source A. The parse function pointer references a function for parsing the current racing series data (e.g., based on format, content, etc. of the current racing series data). Wagering games A and C are associated with the data source A (e.g., wagering game A may use images from the racing series for reel symbols and wagering game C may use images and statistics from the racing series). Each wagering game has one or more actions for updating game data (e.g., set flag, upload image, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For the current political race data, the current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b> looks up the data source B entry in the structure <b>209</b>. The entry for the data source B associates the data source B with a parse function pointer and a reference to indications of wagering games and actions associated with the data source B. The parse function pointer references a function for parsing the current political race data. A wagering game B is associated with the data source B. The wagering game B an actions defined for updating corresponding game data.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The current real-life data unit <b>207</b> parses with the respective functions referenced by the parse function pointers looked up in the structure <b>209</b>. For instance, the current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b> parses the current political race data into indications of the political candidates and respective number of votes in the race. The current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b> parses the current racing series data into each competing driver following by respective current points. Embodiments can implement general parsing functionality in the current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b>. The current real-life data unit can look up formatting in the structure <b>209</b> and parses in accordance with the formatting indicated in the structure <b>209</b>. Embodiments can also assume a standard format for the current real-life data. The current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b> communicates the information looked up in the structure <b>209</b> to the living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> and the parsed current real-life data.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> examines the information communicated by the current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b>. The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> determines that the action associated with the wagering game A indicates object look-up operations in an object store based on a driver with most points as indicated in the parsed racing series data. The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> examines the parsed current racing series data, and identifies the driver with the most points. The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> then accesses an object store <b>211</b> at a stage B. The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> looks up a driver object (e.g., licensed image of the driver) and a car object (e.g., an image of the driver's car). The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> determines that the action associated with the wagering game B indicates that a flag is to be set for the political candidate with the most votes. The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> examines the parsed current political race data and determines that political candidate A has the most votes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> updates wagering game data after examining the parsed data and information communicated from the current real-life data parser unit <b>207</b>. At a stage C, the living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> accesses wagering game A data <b>215</b>, and writes pointers to reference the driver image and the car image objects looked up in the object store <b>211</b>. At a stage D, the living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> accesses wagering game B data <b>217</b> to set values to indicate the current political race leader. The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> sets a &#x2018;1&#x2019; for the political candidate A to identify the political candidate A as the current leader. The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> writes a &#x2018;0&#x2019; for the political candidate B.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> depict parsing of acquired current real-life data, embodiments can utilize current real-life data that is prepared and/or delivered in a manner that obviates parsing operations. The living wagering game data unit <b>213</b> could determine wagering games associated with a data source, and update game data based on the current real-life data without parsing. In addition, embodiments can perform different operations according to different implementation to process current real-life data and update wagering game data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> depict flowcharts of example operations for processing current real-life data and updating wagering game data accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a flowchart of example operations for parsing current real-life data. At block <b>301</b>, current real-life data is acquired from a data source(s). For example, current real-life data can be acquired from a service that streams current sports data. As another example, current real-life data can be scraped from various web sites. The depicted conceptual examples and the described examples represent only a few instances of the possible models for data acquisition. Variations arise with different protocols, connection settings, architectures, etc. For example, a server can acquire current real-life data from a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) based service, which can operate in passive mode, active mode, or extended passive mode. The provider of the FTP service and/or a wagering game establishment can require security credentials to establish the FTP connection. Various security measures can also be applied to the data acquisition technique being employed. Block <b>301</b> can include operations for the data source and a wagering game server to exchange security credentials before data is transmitted. As another example technique, a wagering game establishment and/or wagering game developer can provide the data source with security credentials and a destination address for the data source to put current real-life data.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At block <b>303</b>, a parsing scheme is determined based on the data source(s). When a connection is established with the data source, the data source may indicate the formatting scheme of the current real-life data. An administrator can configure a system with a formatting scheme of the current real-life data from the data source. In addition, an intelligent parser can analyze current real-life data and presume a formatting scheme based, at least in part, on one or more heuristics.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At block <b>305</b>, a wagering game(s) associated with the data source(s) is determined. A wagering game can be configured to automatically subscribe to any data feeds relevant to a particular reality television show, for example. An administrator can configure a system to associate the wagering game with a data source.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At block <b>307</b>, an action(s) associated with the wagering game is determined. The action indicates one or more operations to be performed with the current real-life data to update the game data of the wagering game (e.g., search for images based on name of basketball player with lowest shooting percentage, modify wagering game variables to reflect demographic data of certain voters for a particular candidate, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At block <b>309</b>, the current real-life data is parsed in accordance with the determined parsing scheme. For example, data is extracted from the current real-life data. Embodiments may reformat, order, etc., the current real-life data.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At block <b>311</b>, the parsed current real-life data and indications of the determined wagering game(s) and action(s) are communicated. The parsed current real-life data and the indications can be communicated between different processes, threads, servers, integrated circuits, electronic devices, etc. Embodiments can also communicate the parsed current-real life data and indications to different entities. For example, a parser unit can communicate the parsed current real-life data to a process that stores the parsed current real-life data while the parser unit communicates the indications to a different device that updates game data.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a flowchart of example operations for updating wagering game data. At block <b>401</b>, parsed current real-life data and indication of a wagering game(s) and an action(s) are received. Embodiments can pass the parsed current real-life data and the indications of the wagering game(s) and the action(s) referentially or literally to a process. For instance, a parser unit can pass an address to the parsed current real-life data to a process that updates wagering game data, and pass a data structure with the wagering game indication and the action indication. The indication of the action can be a piece of code passed for execution, a procedure call, a pointer to a function that implements the action, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At block <b>403</b>, a loop that includes blocks <b>405</b>, <b>407</b>, <b>409</b>, and <b>411</b> begins for each indicated wagering game. At block <b>405</b>, a loop that includes block <b>407</b> begins for each indication action for the indicated wagering game. At block <b>407</b>, the indication action is performed to update game data for the indicated wagering game based on the parsed current real-life data. The same current real-life data can be used to perform different actions for different wagering games. Embodiments may delay performance of one or more of the determined actions. For example, the determined actions may include obtaining assets and then influencing game logic with the obtained assets. A system can obtain the assets in a first time period, but delay influencing the wagering game logic with the obtained assets until a later time (e.g., until an event occurs, time passes, a given amount of money is wagered, etc.). Block <b>409</b> terminates the loop begin at block <b>405</b>. At block <b>411</b>, the update of game for the indicated wagering game is indicated. For instance, a process transmits a notification or sets a flag to indicate the update. Embodiments can communicate the update to the instances of the wagering game on the wagering game machines. Embodiments can indicate the update to a back-end process that manages distribution and/or performance of updates to wagering game instances over a network. Block <b>413</b> terminates the loop of operations begun at block <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As stated earlier, update of game data may involve protected assets. The dynamic nature of business relationships can create some uncertainty with respect to rights in protected assets and/or availability of protected assets. For instance, a license agreement for official images of a particular public figure may not be complete until after a living wagering game is already active. The official images may be provided in anticipation of the agreement completing, but they cannot be utilized until the agreement completes. The living wagering can initially utilize simple indications (e.g., text, user created images of the public figure, etc.) until the license agreement completes. Once the agreement is complete, the living wagering game can then utilize the official images to enhance player experience.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a flowchart of example operations for verifying permission to use a protected asset. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts the example operations as a part of the operations performed to implement block <b>407</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. At block <b>501</b>, it is determined if an indicated action utilizes a protected asset. For instance, the action may specifically indicate utilization of a protected asset. As another example, the action can specify a location to search for an image based on the parsed current real-life data. Embodiments can indicate and utilize protected assets with various techniques (e.g., the location may only host protected assets, the image may be flagged as a protected asset, etc.). If the action does not utilize a protected asset, then control flows to block <b>511</b>. If the action does utilize a protected asset, then control flows to block <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At block <b>503</b>, it is determined if the protected asset is available. For example, a protected asset is available if the protected asset is in a database accessible to the wagering game and/or a process associated with the wagering game. If the protected asset is available, then control flows to block <b>511</b>. If the protected asset is not available, then control flows to block <b>505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At block <b>505</b>, it is determined if a license database indicates permission to use the protected asset. Embodiments can implement the license database with a variety of techniques. The license database can be implemented as a store of searchable agreements. For example, a process can search the license database for a name of an organization or public figure extracted from the parsed current real-life data. If the name is found, then the process searches an associated store of protected assets for use as wagering game data. Although the wagering game may have permission to use the protected asset, the protected asset might not be available. As another example, the license database can be implemented as a store with entries for each protected asset that can be utilized. The store, however, may not yet have the protected asset. So an entry exists that implies (or explicitly indicates) permission to use the protected asset, but the protected asset has not been received, created, etc. If the database indicates permission to use the protected asset, then control flows to block <b>509</b>. If the database does not indicate permission to use the protected asset, then control flows to block <b>507</b>. Although a license database is described, embodiments can indicate permission to use a protected asset, as well as store and indicate protected assets with various techniques (e.g., single directory, a database and a directory, searching across multiple network drives that host agreements, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At block <b>507</b>, the protected asset is indicated with text. For example, a name of a current leader in a dance contest may be displayed instead of the official photo of the current leader. Embodiments are not limited to text as an alternative to a protected asset. Embodiments can utilize a generic symbol or graphic to display for figures when permission to use the protected asset is not allowed. From block <b>507</b>, control flows to block <b>409</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At block <b>509</b>, content that corresponds to the protected asset is searched for. For example, a process can search for an outline of a dancer and apply the current dancing leader's name to the outline. As another example, a process can search for a freely available user created sketch of the current dancing leader. If content is found that corresponds to the protected asset, then control flows to block <b>511</b>. If content is not found, then control flows to block <b>507</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At block <b>511</b>, an operation(s) is performed to implement the action. For instance, the action may direct a process to search for an audio file using the name of a singing contest loser as a query. Example operations to implement the action include searching the parsed current real-life data for the name, determining a location of audio game data, building a query, and submitting the query using the name to a process that manages the store of audio game data. Control flows from block <b>511</b> to block <b>409</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It should be understood that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts the example operation in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the operations can be performed independent of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For instance, a separate unit or module can analyze parsed current real-life data to determine if it implicated protected assets and then verify permission to use any implicated protected assets.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In embodiments, the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine-readable media (e.g., software), while in other embodiments, the operations can be performed by hardware and/or other logic (e.g., firmware). It should be understood that the depicted flow diagrams are examples meant to aid in understanding embodiments and should not be used to limit embodiments or limit scope of the claims. Embodiments may perform additional operations, fewer operations, operations in a different order, operations in parallel, and some operations differently. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, block <b>309</b> can be performed before blocks <b>305</b> and <b>307</b>. In addition, blocks <b>305</b> and <b>307</b> can be performed independent of blocks <b>303</b> and <b>309</b>. Operations depicted in block <b>311</b> can be split into different blocks. Additional operations can be performed to acquire data when an event occurs that interferes with acquiring the current real-life data. For instance, a data source may be aware of a pending interruption in delivery of current real-life data. The data source can notify a server that acquires the current real-life data of the pending interruption, and identify an alternate data source. As another example, alternative data sources can be configured and/or communicated in advance. When the server detects some interference (e.g., expiration of a given time period since a last update, lack of an acknowledgement to a keep-alive packet, etc.), the server can access a predefined alternative data source. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, blocks <b>503</b> and <b>505</b> could be merged into a single block. In addition, different operations may be performed when a protected asset is not available/permitted for use. For example, driver A may be the current leader in a racing series. The wagering game developer and/or gaming establishment may only have licenses to images of drivers B, C, and D. Operations can be performed to select game data for the next highest ranked driver if protected assets for driver A are not available or permitted for use. Moreover, operations may be performed to aggregate game data that is a mixture of protected assets, unprotected assets, and/or from different sources.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Operations can also be performed to implement various security measures. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, embodiments may perform additional operations to decrypt current real-life data prior to parsing. In addition, embodiments can implement multiple levels of security.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The wagering game machines <b>702</b> described herein can take any suitable form, such as floor standing models, handheld mobile units, bartop models, workstation-type console models, etc. Further, the wagering game machines <b>702</b> can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games, or can include non-dedicated devices, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, personal computers, etc. In one embodiment, the wagering game network <b>700</b> can include other network devices, such as accounting servers, wide area progressive servers, player tracking servers, and/or other devices suitable for use in connection with embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, wagering game machines <b>702</b> and wagering game servers <b>706</b> work together such that a wagering game machine <b>702</b> can be operated as a thin, thick, or intermediate client. For example, one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the wagering game machine <b>702</b> (client) or the wagering game server <b>706</b> (server). Game play elements can include executable game code, lookup tables, configuration files, game outcome, audio or visual representations of the game, game assets or the like. In a thin-client example, the wagering game server <b>706</b> can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets, while the wagering game machine <b>702</b> can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the user (e.g., player). In a thick-client example, the wagering game machines <b>702</b> can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the wagering game server <b>706</b> for recording or managing a player's account.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, either the wagering game machines <b>702</b> (client) or the wagering game server <b>706</b> can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example, account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally (e.g., by the wagering game server <b>706</b>) or locally (e.g., by the wagering game machine <b>702</b>). Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management, presentation of advertising, software or firmware updates, system quality or security checks, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Any of the wagering game network components (e.g., the wagering game machines <b>702</b>) can include hardware and machine-readable media including instructions for performing the operations described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The examples have been described only with respect to current real-life data acquisition. Systems, however, can utilize a connection that carries current real-life (&#x201c;current real-life data channel&#x201d;) to carry other data in either direction.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts a conceptual example for utilizing a current real-life data channel for back-channel communications and piggybacking A server <b>801</b> and a data source <b>804</b> establish a current real-life data channel <b>803</b>. The data source <b>804</b> transmits a data frame <b>805</b> comprised of current real-life data and configuration data, which may or may not relate to the current real-life data. The configuration data piggybacks the current real-life data in the data frame <b>805</b>. Piggybacking allows a wagering game developer, third party add-on developer, etc., to take advantage of the architecture, security, etc. established for the current real-life data channel <b>803</b>. For example, the configuration data may be a configuration script, update, patch, new game logic, new wagering bonus game, etc. The configuration data may be executed before, after, in parallel, etc. with any action performed that corresponds to the current real-life data.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The server <b>801</b> also uses the current real-life data channel <b>803</b> to transmit a formatting message <b>807</b>. The formatting message <b>807</b> can communicate a variety of messages. For example, the formatting message <b>807</b> can indicate that the server <b>801</b> expects to start receiving data formatted in accordance with a different formatting scheme. As another example, the formatting message <b>807</b> can communicate to the data source <b>804</b> that a wagering game establishment expects a different security scheme to be utilized.</p>
