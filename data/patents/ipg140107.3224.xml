<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-062636, filed on Mar. 19, 2012; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments are generally related to a semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A photo-coupler is one of the semiconductor devices. The photocoupler includes a light emitting element and a light receiving element, and transmits signals by optical coupling. The photo-coupler has various applications. A dual type photo-coupler includes two pairs of light emitting elements and light receiving elements, and has two transmission channels. This type of photo-coupler needs to suppress inter-channel crosstalk.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In such a device, the two light receiving elements may be bonded to a common lead, and two pairs of light emitting elements and light receiving elements may be molded within a single piece of resin for easing complexity in a fabrication. But the inter-channel crosstalk cannot be suppressed in such case. In another method, each pair of the light emitting element and the light receiving element is molded in an individual resin, and then molded together with a light blocking outer resin. This method may suppress the crosstalk. However, in the first molding step, a deformation may sometimes occurs in the portion of the common lead not sealed with resin. Thus, misalignment between the light emitting element and the light receiving element may be induced by the deformation, resulting in the wiring deformation and the reduction of optical coupling efficiency. Thus, there is demand for a semiconductor device capable of suppressing the inter-channel crosstalk and the misalignment between the light emitting element and the light receiving element, thereby improving the manufacturing yield.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are schematic views showing a semiconductor device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a perspective view showing the appearance of the semiconductor device <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line I<sub>b</sub>-I<sub>b </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The semiconductor device <b>100</b> is e.g. a photo-coupler. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the semiconductor device <b>100</b> includes a resin package <b>10</b> and a plurality of terminals (leads) extending from the resin package <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, inside the resin package <b>10</b>, a light emitting element <b>7</b> and a light receiving element <b>13</b> are incorporated and fixed to the leads <b>5</b> and <b>15</b> spaced from each other. The light emitting element <b>7</b> fixed to the lead <b>5</b> and the light receiving element <b>13</b> fixed to the lead <b>15</b> are opposed to each other. That is, the light emitting surface of the light emitting element <b>7</b> and the light receiving surface of the light receiving element <b>13</b> are placed opposite to each other. The signal light emitted by the light emitting element <b>7</b> is sensed by the light receiving element <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The resin package <b>10</b> includes an internal mold <b>9</b> sealing the light emitting element <b>7</b> and the light receiving element <b>13</b>, and an external mold <b>3</b> covering the outside thereof. The internal mold <b>9</b> is e.g. a transparent resin. The internal mold <b>9</b> transmits light emitted by the light emitting element <b>7</b> and causes the light to be incident on the light receiving surface of the light receiving element <b>13</b>. On the other hand, the external mold <b>3</b> is a resin blocking the external light. The external mold <b>3</b> suppresses dark current of the light receiving element <b>13</b> and reduces the noise level.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The transparent resin used for the internal mold <b>9</b> preferably transmits 100% of the light emitted by the light emitting element <b>7</b>. However, the transparent resin may absorb part of the light. For instance, epoxy resin can be used for the external resin.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The external mold <b>3</b> is preferably made of a resin having the same main ingredient as the internal mold <b>9</b>. This can increase adhesiveness between the internal mold <b>9</b> and the external mold <b>3</b>. The resin forming the external mold <b>3</b> includes a material absorbing the external light. For instance, the so-called black resin can be used as the light absorbing material. The black resin is made of epoxy resin dispersed with carbon. Alternatively, the so-called white resin may be used, in which, a material reflecting the external light is dispersed. For instance, epoxy resin dispersed with fine powder of titanium oxide may be used for the external resin. Here, the external light refers to the background light except the light emitted by the light emitting element <b>7</b> in the wavelength range, where the light receiving element <b>13</b> has sensitivity.</p>

Thus, the connecting portions <b>15</b><i>c </i>and <b>19</b><i>a </i>are not pressed between the upper die <b>41</b> and the lower die <b>42</b>. This suppresses deformation of the lead <b>15</b>. Thus, the light receiving elements <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>can be molded respectively at prescribed positions in the internal molds <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, the first resin formed around the internal molds <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>and therebetween is removed.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For instance, the central portion of the thin film <b>9</b><i>f </i>is irradiated with laser light to locally heat the first resin.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, the second resin in the melted state is injected via a runner <b>65</b> communicating to the cavity <b>63</b>.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above manufacturing process, the first molding is advantageously performed preventing the deformation of the common leads <b>15</b> and <b>19</b>, since the connecting portions <b>15</b><i>c </i>and <b>19</b><i>a </i>are housed in the gap <b>47</b> and not directly clumped between the dies. Thereby, it becomes possible to suppress the misalignment between the light emitting element <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the light receiving element <b>13</b><i>a</i>, and misalignment between the light emitting element <b>7</b><i>b </i>and the light receiving element <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, the first resin is e.g. a hard epoxy resin. Thus, the strength of the connecting portions <b>15</b><i>c </i>and <b>19</b><i>a </i>covered with the thin film <b>9</b><i>f </i>can be increased. This can suppress deformation of the lead frames <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> with the internal molds <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>molded thereon in the following process.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The second resin having light blocking property is molded between the first thin film <b>9</b><i>c </i>and the second thin film <b>9</b><i>d</i>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the above embodiment, for instance, the first light receiving element <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the second light receiving element <b>13</b><i>b </i>are mounted on a common lead.
