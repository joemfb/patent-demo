<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a device for converting wave energy in a hydrostatic layer into electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electricity generated by wave power is advantages in pollution free and no fuel consumption, so that how to utilize the wave power becomes a worldwide focus for ocean engineering researchers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Wave power generation is using an electricity generation device in a hydrostatic layer of the ocean to transform the wave energy into the electrical energy. To effectively capture the wave energy, the operation of the electricity generation device in the hydrostatic layer is designed according to the up and down vibration of the wave; the movement of the electricity generation device is stabilized to capture the kinetic energy which is then utilized to generate electricity. In a word, the up and down vibration of the wave is transformed into the rotation of are volution axis.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Because of the instability of the wave, two types of the electricity generation devices are generally used. One type of the electricity generation device is placed on the sea floor; this type of the device has a complicated structure, is easy to damage by the corrosion of the sea water and the invasion of the wave, thereby shortening the service life, increasing the cost in construction and maintenance. The other type of the electricity generation device floats on the water surface, and adopts an impeller to drive the motor rotor to rotate alternatively forward and backward; however, a large amount of energy is consumed in reversing the rotation direction of the motor rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, it is desired to study the technology of wave power generation and simplify the structure of the electric generator.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantages of the invention are summarized as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">1. The electric generator is arranged inside the guiding-accelerating wheel, which lowers the energy consumption in the transmission mechanism and the transmission process; the adopted curved conical wheel center and the laminar deflectors have a better effect in the acceleration and pressurization of the water flow, and a high efficiency in collecting the wave energy. Besides, the curved blade of the impeller is capable of accumulating the kinetic energy of the water flow.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">2. The device for generating electricity using wave energy employs the air compressor or the hydraulic pump to transform the wave energy into a pressure energy which is further transformed to the kinetic energy via the air motor or the hydraulic motor, and finally the kinetic energy is transformed into the electric energy. Thus, the electric elements of the electric generator are not necessitated to operate in the water, thereby prolonging the service life of the electric generator, lowering the cost in maintenance and sealing.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">3. It is simple to accumulate the high-pressure air or oil from a plurality of air compressors or hydraulic pumps.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For further illustrating the invention, experiments detailing a device for generating electricity using wave energy are described below. It should be noted that the following examples are intended to describe and not to limit the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, a device for converting wave energy in a hydrostatic layer into electricity comprises: a float <b>5</b>; a guiding-accelerating wheel <b>2</b>, the guiding-accelerating wheel <b>2</b> comprising a wheel body <b>201</b> comprising a casing <b>2010</b>, a wheel center <b>2011</b>, and a chamber <b>208</b>; an impeller <b>1</b>; and an electric generator <b>4</b>, the electric generator <b>4</b> comprising a rotor <b>402</b>. The float <b>5</b> is upward and downward movable in accord with a movement of wave. The guiding-accelerating wheel <b>2</b> is connected to a lower part of the float <b>5</b>. The wheel center <b>2011</b> is disposed inside the casing <b>2010</b>; a plurality of deflectors <b>2012</b> is annularly arranged between the casing <b>2010</b> and the wheel body <b>201</b>, and the deflectors <b>2012</b> are inclined to a same direction. Water channels <b>202</b> are formed by the casing <b>2010</b>, the wheel center <b>2011</b>, and every two adjacent deflectors <b>2012</b>. Each water channel comprises a water outlet <b>2022</b>. The impeller <b>1</b> is clamped on the guiding-accelerating wheel <b>2</b> at a position corresponding to the water outlet <b>2022</b> of the water channel <b>202</b>, and the impeller <b>1</b> is movable in relation to the guiding-accelerating wheel <b>2</b>. A plurality of blades <b>101</b> is annularly arranged on the impeller <b>1</b>. The blades <b>101</b> cooperate with the water outlet <b>2022</b> to allow the water from the water outlet <b>2022</b> to collide with the blades <b>101</b> and drive the impeller <b>1</b> to rotate. The electric generator <b>4</b> is arranged inside the chamber <b>208</b>; and the rotor <b>402</b> is driven by the impeller <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The chamber <b>208</b> is arranged inside the wheel center <b>2011</b> close to the impeller <b>1</b>. The electric generator further comprises a stator <b>401</b>. The impeller <b>1</b> further comprises an impeller shaft <b>102</b>. The stator <b>401</b> is in rigid connection with the wheel center <b>2011</b>; and the rotor <b>402</b> is connected to and driven by the impeller shaft <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electric generator <b>4</b> can be optionally arranged in the guiding-accelerating wheel <b>2</b> at an upper or lower side of the impeller <b>1</b>, or both. The rotor <b>402</b> can be fixed and sleeved on an outer side of the impeller <b>1</b> as needed, and the chamber <b>28</b> extends to the outer side of the impeller <b>1</b>. The stator <b>401</b> is fixed in the chamber <b>28</b> and is sleeved on the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At least one of the wheel center <b>2011</b> and the casing <b>2010</b> is in a shape of a cone for forming a tapered cross section of the water channel <b>202</b> and a relatively small water outlet <b>2022</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The casing <b>2010</b> is in a shape of a cylinder. The wheel center <b>2011</b> is in a shape of a cone.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The deflectors <b>2012</b> are disposed on a lower part of the casing <b>2010</b>. A top of the casing <b>2010</b> and the wheel center <b>2011</b> form a water inlet cavity <b>2015</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The blades <b>101</b> are a curved blade comprising a concave side. The concave side of the blades <b>101</b> faces the water outlet <b>2022</b> for allowing the water from the water outlet <b>2022</b> to collide with the concave side of the blades <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A downward pressurizing cylinder <b>6</b> is connected to the lower part of the float <b>5</b>. The downward pressurizing cylinder <b>6</b> comprises a water storage cavity <b>601</b> comprising a top and a bottom. The top of the water storage cavity <b>601</b> is open. A water leaking hole <b>602</b> is arranged on the bottom of the water cavity <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A plurality of vertical anti-rotating boards <b>205</b> is disposed on an outer side of the casing <b>2010</b>. A vertical height of the vertical anti-rotating board <b>205</b> is much larger than a thickness thereof. A plurality of anti-rotating ear-shaped plates <b>603</b> is disposed on an outer side of the downward pressurizing cylinder <b>6</b>. The vertical anti-rotating boards <b>205</b> are in rigid connection with the anti-rotating ear-shaped plates <b>603</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The float <b>5</b> comprises a sealed cavity inside.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The deflectors <b>2012</b> are spirally inclined.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Water outlets <b>2022</b> of the two guiding-accelerating wheels <b>2</b> arranged on two sides of the impeller <b>1</b> are all face the concave sides of the blades arranged on the impeller <b>1</b> for allowing the water from the water outlet <b>2022</b> to collide with the blades and drive the impeller <b>1</b> to rotate to a same direction. When the electricity generation device moves upward, the water flows through an upper part of the guiding-accelerating wheel <b>2</b> disposed on the upper side of the impeller <b>1</b> into the water channel <b>202</b>; then, the water flows out of the water outlet <b>2022</b> arranged on the upper side of the impeller <b>1</b>, collides with the blades <b>101</b>, and drives the impeller <b>1</b> to rotate. When the electricity generation device moves downward, the water flows through lower part of the guiding-accelerating wheel <b>2</b> disposed on the lower side of the impeller <b>1</b> into the water channel <b>202</b>; then, the water flows out of the water outlet <b>2022</b> arranged on the lower side of the impeller <b>1</b>, collides with the blades <b>101</b>, and drives the impeller <b>1</b> to rotate. The spiral direction of the water channels disposed on the upper side of the impeller <b>1</b> is opposite to the spiral direction of the water channels disposed on the lower side of the impeller <b>1</b> for assuring the impeller rotates to the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the electricity generation device moves upward along with the wave, a buoyant force imposed on the float <b>5</b> overcomes the gravity thereof and a drag force from the lower elements, thus, the whole electricity generation device moves upward in accord with the movement of the wave. An upper water surface inside the water storage cavity <b>601</b> is open to the seawater outside the water storage cavity <b>601</b>, thus no buoyant force is produced on the water storage cavity <b>601</b>. When the electricity generation device moves downward along with the wave, the water does not leak from the water leaking hole <b>602</b> quickly; a drag force from the lower elements, such as the lower water inlet, makes the water flow out of the water surface of the water storage cavity <b>601</b>. When the water gravity is equal to the drag force, the water gravity is imposed on the electricity generation device to enlarge a downward press on the device, thereby improving a rotational torque of the shaft.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Example 2 is different from Example 1 in that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref>, an air compressor <b>8</b> is arranged inside the chamber <b>208</b> and is driven by the impeller <b>1</b>. An air inlet and an air outlet of the air compressor <b>8</b> are connected to an air inlet pipe <b>9</b> and an air outlet pipe <b>10</b>, respectively. The air inlet pipe <b>9</b> and the air outlet pipe <b>10</b> are extended out of a water surface. The air outlet pipe <b>10</b> is connected to the air motor <b>11</b>; and the air motor <b>11</b> drives the electric generator to generate electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The air compressor <b>8</b> is a rotary screw air compressor comprising a compressor casing <b>801</b>, a main rotor <b>802</b>, and an auxiliary rotor <b>803</b>. The main rotor <b>802</b> and the auxiliary rotor <b>803</b> are engaged with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A number of the guiding-accelerating wheel <b>2</b> is two; the two guiding-accelerating wheels <b>2</b> are arranged on a lower side and an upper side of the impeller <b>1</b>, respectively. The air compressor <b>8</b> is arranged inside each of the guiding-accelerating wheels <b>2</b>. The pressurized air from the two air compressors is accumulated and transported to the air motor as a power source.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The air compressor <b>8</b> can also be a scroll air compressor, a piston air compressor, or other types of air compressors.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electric generator is placed on the float; or the air outlet pipe is extended away from the device in the water, such as an offshore platform or the land, to actuate the air motor which further drives the electric generator to operate. Thus, the pressurized air from the different air outlet pipes can be accumulated to drive a large scale electric generator, or the accumulated pressurized air source drives different electric generators via a plurality of air pipes.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Example 3 is different from Example 2 in that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-13</figref>, a hydraulic pump <b>15</b> is arranged inside the chamber <b>208</b> and is driven by the impeller <b>1</b>. An oil inlet and an oil outlet of the hydraulic pump <b>15</b> are connected to an oil inlet pipe <b>16</b> and an oil outlet pipe <b>17</b>, respectively. The oil inlet pipe <b>16</b> and the oil outlet pipe <b>17</b> are extended out of a water surface. The oil inlet pipe <b>16</b> and the oil outlet pipe <b>17</b> are connected to the hydraulic motor <b>19</b>. The hydraulic motor <b>19</b> drives the electric generator to generate electricity. The hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor can be connected via hydraulic elements, such as hydraulic valves.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The hydraulic pump <b>15</b> is a rotary screw hydraulic pump comprising a pump casing <b>151</b>, a main pump rotor <b>152</b>, and an auxiliary pump rotor <b>153</b>. The main pump rotor <b>152</b> and the auxiliary pump rotor <b>153</b> are engaged with each other.</p>
