<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of electronics. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to design for test (DFT) systems and devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A scan design is a technique used in design for test (DFT). A scan chain may be formed in a chip, such as system-on-chip, by connecting every flip-flop in the chip as a long shift register when a scan mode or scan test mode is asserted. During the scan mode, a scan shift operation or a scan capture operation may be performed. When the scan shift operation is enabled, one input pin may be used to load a serial input of test pattern to the scan chain. While the scan shift operation is ongoing, the normal operation of the chip may be ceased. During the ensuing scan capture operation, the normal operation of the chip may be performed based on the test pattern in the scan chain as well as functional inputs to combinational circuits in the chip. Then, the result of the scan capture operation may be shifted out during the subsequent scan shift operation, where the result may be compared with the expected test pattern to verify the sound operation of the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As all the flip-flops in the chip perform shifting of the test pattern according to an input clock signal or scan clock signal from a tester (e.g., external tester), the simultaneous shifting or switching of the flip-flops may cause high instantaneous voltage droop (IVD) in the power grid, which is used to supply power to various circuit elements of the chip. The high IVD may impede a faster completion of the scan shift operation, thus causing an additional chip testing time and/or cost.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Consequently, there have been a number of approaches to reduce the IVD. In one such approach, a test pattern which is loaded into the scan chain may be modified to reduce the IVD. For example, 0-fill and/or 1-fill may be an automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) technique employed to reduce the number of flip-flop transitions during the scan shift operation. Although the technique may be effective in reducing the IVD, more test patterns, thus more testing time, may be required to compensate for the modification of the test patterns with extra 0's and 1's.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Alternatively, the design of the chip may be modified to reduce the IVD. For example, in a flip-flop output gating technique, flip-flop outputs may be gated off during the scan shift operation so that circuit elements (e.g., logic gates in combinational circuits) driven by the flip-flop outputs may not see any changes in the flip-flops during the scan shift operation. In another example, the flip-flops in the scan chain may be designed to have separate output pins for functional and scan connections. As a result, the functional outputs of the flip-flops may not change during the scan shift operation, thus reducing the IVD. However, both of the techniques may require additional hardware and/or degrade the performance of the chip.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A system and device for reducing instantaneous voltage droop (IVD) during a scan shift operation is disclosed. In the following detailed description of the embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary system <b>100</b> for reducing instantaneous voltage droop (IVD) during a scan shift operation of a logic device (e.g., a system on chip, etc.) according to one embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>100</b> includes a first group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>A, a second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B, a first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A, and a second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B. The first group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>A includes clock gating cells (CGCs) <b>106</b>A-N, and the second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B includes a clock gating cells (CGCs) <b>122</b>A-N.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The clock gating cells <b>106</b>A-N include first delay elements <b>116</b>A-N, respectively. The clock gating cells <b>122</b>A-N include second delay elements <b>132</b>A-N, respectively. Each of the first delay elements <b>116</b>A-N and the second delay elements <b>132</b>A-N may be a delay buffer. The first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A includes flip-flops <b>118</b>A-N, and the second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B includes flip-flops <b>134</b>A-N. In one embodiment, the first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A and the second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B may include a substantially equal number of flip-flops.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the system <b>100</b> including the first group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>A and the second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B, it is appreciated that the system <b>100</b> may include more than two groups of clock gating cells, where each group of clock gating cells shares a delay element of an equal duration and is coupled to a group of flip-flops.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown, clock input (CI) pins or nodes <b>112</b>A-N of the first group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>A and clock input (CI) pins <b>128</b>A-N of the second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B are configured to receive an input clock signal <b>138</b>. The input clock signal <b>138</b> may be a clock signal generated and forwarded by a tester module <b>140</b> (e.g., an external tester) connected to the system <b>100</b>. Further, scan shift enable (SE) pins or nodes <b>108</b>A-N of the first group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>A and scan shift enable (SE) pins <b>1124</b>A-N of the second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B are configured to receive a scan shift enable (SE) signal <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, enable (EN) pins or nodes <b>110</b>A-N of the first group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>A are configured to receive a functional mode enable signal from outputs of flip-flops <b>120</b>A-N. Similarly, enable (EN) pins or nodes <b>126</b>A-N of the second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B are configured to receive a functional mode enable signal from outputs of flip-flops <b>136</b>A-N. Furthermore, as illustrated, clock output (CO) pins or nodes <b>114</b>A-N of the first group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>A are coupled to the first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A, and clock output (CO) pins or nodes <b>130</b>A-N of the second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B are coupled to the second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one exemplary operation, when a scan mode of the logic device is asserted, a scan shift operation and a scan capture operation are performed by the system <b>100</b>. The scan shift operation is enabled when the SE signal <b>142</b> is logical high. During the scan shift operation, using their respective first delay elements <b>116</b>A-N, the clock gating cells <b>106</b>A-N of the first group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>A provides the input clock signal <b>138</b> delayed by a first duration (e.g., in nanoseconds) to the first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A via respective CO pins <b>114</b>A-N. In one embodiment, the first delay elements <b>116</b>A-N are configured to delay the input clock signal <b>138</b> by the first duration during the scan shift operation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Similarly, during the scan shift operation of the logic device, the second delay elements <b>132</b>A-N of the second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B are configured to delay the input clock signal <b>138</b> by a second duration (e.g., in nanoseconds). It is appreciated that the second duration is not equivalent to the first duration. As a result, the second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B provides the input clock signal <b>138</b> delayed by the second duration to the second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B during the scan shift operation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As the input clock signal <b>138</b> to the first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A is delayed by the first duration and the input clock signal <b>138</b> to the second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B is delayed by the second duration during the scan shift operation, the flip-flops <b>118</b>A-N perform their shift operations at a different instance than the instance the flip-flops <b>134</b>A-N perform their shift operations. As the two groups of flip-flops perform their shift operations at two different instances, the load to the power grid of the logic device is divided between the two groups of flip-flops. Subsequently, this may help significantly reduce the IVD in the power grid of the logic device during its scan shift operation, thus enabling faster completion of the scan shift operation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Following the scan shift operation, the scan capture operation is performed. The scan capture operation is enabled when the SE signal <b>142</b> is logical low and the functional mode enable signal is logical high. During the scan capture operation, the first group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>A provide the input clock signal <b>138</b> without delay to the first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A, and the second group of clock gating cells <b>102</b>B provide the input clock signal <b>138</b> without delay to the second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B. Further, a subsequent scan shift operation is performed during which the result of the scan capture operation is shifted out of the first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A and the second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B and another test pattern data is shifted in the first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A and the second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B. During the subsequent scan shift operation, the input clock signal <b>138</b> fed to the first group of flip-flops <b>104</b>A is delayed by the first duration and the input clock signal <b>138</b> fed to the second group of flip-flops <b>104</b>B is delayed by the second duration.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the clock gating cell <b>106</b>A includes the first delay element <b>116</b>A, an AND gate <b>202</b>, and a multiplexer <b>204</b>. The multiplexer <b>204</b> is coupled to the first delay element <b>116</b>A and the AND gate <b>202</b>. The first delay element <b>116</b>A is configured to receive the input clock signal <b>138</b> from the tester module <b>140</b> and to delay the input clock signal <b>138</b> by a first duration (&#x394;<sub>t1</sub>). Further, the first delay element <b>116</b>A is configured to forward the input clock signal <b>138</b> delayed by the first duration (&#x394;<sub>t1</sub>) to the multiplexer <b>204</b>. The AND gate <b>202</b> is configured to receive a functional mode enable signal <b>206</b> and the input clock signal <b>138</b> as inputs and to generate a logical value &#x2018;0&#x2019; or &#x2018;1&#x2019; based on the inputs. The output of the AND gate <b>202</b> is fed as an input to the multiplexer <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When a scan shift operation is enabled, the SE signal <b>142</b> applied to the SE pin <b>108</b>A is logical high. During the scan shift operation, the multiplexer <b>204</b> is configured to select the input clock signal <b>138</b> delayed by the first duration (&#x394;<sub>t1</sub>) as an output clock signal <b>208</b> based on the SE signal <b>142</b> (logical high). Alternatively, when a scan capture mode is asserted, the SE signal <b>142</b> applied to the SE pin <b>108</b>A is logical low. Further, the functional mode enable signal <b>206</b> applied to the EN pin <b>110</b>A is logical high. Thus, during the scan capture operation, the multiplexer <b>204</b> is configured to select the input clock signal <b>138</b> as the output clock signal <b>208</b> based on the SE signal <b>142</b> (logical low).</p>
