<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional application to U.S. application Ser. No. 12/115,817, filed on May 6, 2008 U.S. Pat. No. 8,138,603, the contents of all of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to integrated circuits (ICs), a design structure and a method of manufacturing and, more particularly, to an IC interconnect for high direct current (DC) that is substantially immune to electro-migration (EM) damage, a design structure of the IC interconnect and a method of manufacturing the IC interconnect.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Back-end-of-line (BEOL) interconnects, consisting of metal wires and inter-level vias, carry high direct current (DC) in advanced integrated circuit (IC) chip technology. In particular, as IC chip technology advances, the current density required in these metal wires/vias increases with the ever-decreasing dimensions in IC chip technology. Also, self-heating by high current devices raises the temperature of nearby interconnects under circuit operation and makes use of high current carrying BEOL interconnects extremely challenging. For example, a device that uses high current and self-heats (e.g., a resistor, a bipolar transistor, etc.) may heat up an interconnect wire that couples to the device. The high current leads to electro-migration (EM) degradation of the interconnect (via and/or line), causing shorts or opens.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As a result, the current-carrying capability (or the I<sub>dc </sub>limit specified in the design manuals) is significantly reduced to avoid electro-migration degradation in interconnects. As an example, a direct current limit in a copper interconnect may be reduced by a factor of more than three resulting from a temperature rise of about 15&#xb0; C. from, for example, 85&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C., and by almost a factor of 20 at a 125&#xb0; C. interconnect temperature. As a result, high direct current at elevated temperatures is almost impossible with conventional interconnect structures.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are various methods aimed at addressing this reliability issue in metal wires/vias. Known methods, though, result in EM induced voids occurring in any section of the segment, which will cause the wire to eventually open as the void grows in size. Other methods use liners to enclose vias. However, such structures and methods do not provide any means to protect EM damage in metal wires, nor such structures address the EM damage at the via/wire interface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there exists a need in the art to overcome the deficiencies and limitations described hereinabove.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first aspect of the invention, a structure having electro-migration immunity and redundancy of design, comprises a plurality of wires laid out in parallel and each of which are coated with a liner material. Two adjacent of the wires are physically contacted to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect of the invention, a structure comprises a cluster-of-via structure at an intersection between inter-level wires. The cluster-of-via structure comprises a plurality of vias each of which are filled with a refractory metal and lined with a liner material. The vias that are adjacent to one another are in contact. The plurality of vias lowers current loading between the inter-level wires.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further aspect of the invention, a method to fabricate a ribbon wire structure comprises: forming wires in an insulation material, wrapping the wires with a liner material; forming spaces between the wires by removing the insulating material between adjacent wires; and depositing a metal in the spaces to form additional wires between and adjacent to the wires already formed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet a still further aspect of the invention, a design structure is embodied in a machine-readable medium for designing, manufacturing, or testing an integrated circuit. The design structure comprises a plurality of metal wires laid out in parallel and each of which are coated with a liner material. Two adjacent of the metal wires are physically contacted to each other.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention relates to an IC interconnect for high direct current (DC) that is substantially immune to electro-migration (EM) damage, a design structure of the IC interconnect and a method of manufacture. In implementation, the present invention provides a metal wire design to overcome EM induced damage, which includes a plurality of narrow metal lines (wires). The narrow metal wires are separated from one another by a layer of conductive liner material, which serves as an EM blocking layer as well as a mechanical reinforcement layer within the overall metal wire structure. Such a cluster-of-wire structure carries several unique features, including:</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">(1) a plurality of fine wires;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">(2) each wire is surrounded by the liner material; and</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">(3) no spacing between any adjacent wires, referred to as ribbon wires.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In further embodiments, a cluster-of-via structure is provided which not only significantly lowers the current loading of each via, but also provides a larger via density (e.g., via opening per unit area) to address electro-migration concerns occurring at the via/wire interface. This approach forms sufficient and robust contact when two wires cross each other, especially for thinner wires.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Redundant Metal Ribbon Wire</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention provides a metal wire design to overcome EM induced damage. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a single metal wire line <b>10</b>. Comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the single metal wire is split into a plurality of fine metal (or metal alloy) wires <b>10</b><i>a</i>, or a ribbon-wire configuration. The plurality of fine wires <b>10</b><i>a </i>may be in parallel to one another, with adjacent wires <b>10</b><i>a </i>contacting with one another. In this example, a power supply wire with a width of 10 um (or &#x201c;w&#x201d;) and length of 1 mm is split into five (or any &#x201c;n&#x201d; number) fine wires (all shown as <b>10</b><i>a</i>), with each fine wire <b>10</b><i>a </i>having a width of 2 um (or width of &#x201c;n&#x201d;). Those of ordinary skill in the art should understand, that the wire can be of other dimensions and be split into more or less metal wiring lines, depending on the particular application as discussed herein. As such, the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> should not be considered a limiting feature of the present invention and is but one illustrative embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As further seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, each fine wire <b>10</b><i>a </i>is wrapped with a layer of electrically conductive liner <b>12</b>. The liner layer comprises refractory metal materials that are electrically conductive and mechanically rigid.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As seen further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, assuming identical net metal width and pitch for each fine wire <b>10</b><i>a</i>, no extra space is provided nor needed between adjacent fine wires <b>10</b><i>a</i>. Also, with the liner <b>12</b>, the overall width of wire design of the present invention may occupy a slightly larger area (e.g., about 1% to 5%) than a conventional design.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In embodiments, the width of the fine wire <b>10</b><i>a </i>is narrow enough to promote a bamboo grain structure for improved EM resistance. In this contemplated embodiment, the grain boundaries span across the entire line width and perpendicular to the current flow direction after the metal annealing process, while being wide enough so that its resistivity is not impacted by undesirable electron scattering at the wire/liner interfaces. In general, a width of Al or Cu metal wires range between 0.1 &#x3bc;m and 1 &#x3bc;m, which should be sufficient to result in a bamboo grain structure so as to suppress EM degradation, while their intrinsic resistivities are still maintained. (In a conventional metal layer having a thickness of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 0.5 &#x3bc;m, the thickness rather than its width predominantly limits the grain size.)</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The effectiveness of EM prevention with the disclosed design is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. When a pin-hole or defect exists in a conventional metal wire <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), the void size will increase as the electron wind flows across the metal line (arrow). The size of the void will continue to grow during the lifetime of the circuits. This will ultimately deplete the metal wire and open the metal wire, at which moment EM permanently damages the circuit. On the other hand, if the same pin hole or defect occurs at the same location of the disclosed ribbon-wire with plurality of fine wires <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the void will only grow within a single fine wire and will be confined and quarantined by the liner <b>12</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Such a confined defect will not significantly damage the whole wire structure, and thus the disclosed ribbon-wire provides redundancy against EM damage and greatly extends the lifetime of the metal wire.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-8</figref> show respective processing steps for fabricating the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, three fine wires <b>10</b><i>a </i>are formed in an insulation material <b>20</b> via a conventional method. Liner material <b>12</b> wraps the fine wires <b>10</b><i>a</i>. A hard cap layer <b>50</b> is formed on top of the insulating material <b>20</b>, which serves as CMP (chemical-mechanical-polish) stop layer.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a photo-resist mask <b>60</b> is used to remove the insulating material <b>20</b> between adjacent fine wires <b>10</b><i>a</i>. More specifically, using a conventional lithographic process, an opening <b>65</b> is formed in the photo-resist mask <b>60</b> about selective adjacent fine wires <b>10</b><i>a</i>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a selective RIE (reactive ion etching) process is performed to remove the insulating material <b>20</b> between adjacent fine wires <b>10</b><i>a </i>without damaging the fine wires <b>10</b><i>a </i>and liner material <b>12</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the liner material <b>12</b> is re-deposited which conformally coats the etched surface <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a layer of metal <b>70</b> is then deposited on the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the metal <b>70</b> forms the ribbon-wire after a CMP process step. That is, the metal forms additional fine metal wires <b>10</b><i>b</i>. This forms the ribbon structure of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the hard cap layer <b>50</b> can be removed using conventional stripping processes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With this approach, layers of liners are presented between two adjacent metal wires. These liner layers can effectively quarantine the void growth due to EM. Also, each fine wire within the ribbon-wire serves as independent interconnects which connect two nodes. The ribbon-wire structure provides redundant links, which remains functional even when any of the links is defective due to defect or EM damage.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further embodiments of using liners as barrier layers against EM damage are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, additional liner layers <b>14</b>, or walls, can be oriented perpendicular to the length of the entirety of the metal wires. Alternatively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, additional liner layers <b>14</b>, or walls, are oriented perpendicular to the length of individual fine wires within the ribbon-wire. These liners <b>14</b> and all other liners can be placed in any strategic location by etching and filling via conventional phase shift lithography technique, with aluminum being patterned using dry etching. For example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> the perpendicular liner material can be offset between adjacent of the individual metal wires.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another embodiment, liners <b>12</b> can be placed in a direction perpendicular to the fine wires <b>10</b><i>a </i>to adopt jogged-shaped wiring lines as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>. For example, using double Damascene processes the shape of the first metal patterns (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>) and second metal patterns (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>) can be irregular. The design of these metal shapes can be generated using software simulation based on optimization of both conductivity and EM protection. In other words, the shaped metal pattern can be designed to yield the best EM protection for multi-void cases. As discussed herein, these additional liners <b>12</b> serve as barriers to contain EM voiding along the line length direction. Also, these liners <b>12</b> provide extra mechanical reinforcement to enhance the rigidity of the overall wire, which improves EM resistance. Also, these additional liners <b>12</b> within the fine wire <b>10</b><i>a </i>will not have significant impact on the total wire resistance, since the thickness of these liners <b>12</b> is about 20 nm or less.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Cluster-of-Vias</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Vias provide electrical contact between inter-level metal wires. Vias filled with refractory metals, such as tungsten (W), are not prone to EM damage, but they have higher resistivity than metals (e.g. Al or Cu) used for wiring levels. To reduce via resistance, Al and Cu metals are also used to form vias for multiple-level metal interconnections. However, a bottleneck of wiring resistance still often occurs at via levels, especially at those places where there are an insufficient number of via contacts. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, voids are typically found at the upper portion of the vias due to the EM effect, which eventually leads to an electrical open. Under such an event, current loading of the remaining vias is exacerbated and EM damage is accelerated there.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to avoid this situation, the present invention uses a formation of a cluster-of-via structure which not only significantly lowers the current loading of each via but also provides more redundant vias per unit area with respect to EM concerns. More specifically, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, a cluster of vias <b>15</b> is formed with liner material <b>120</b> therebetween. The vias are filled with refractory metal and, in embodiments, are parallel to one another. The cluster of vias effectively lowers the resistance of the structure and prevents the formation of EM voids from opening a circuit. This approach is necessary to produce sufficient contact when two wide wires cross each other.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 16B</figref> show method steps for forming the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> is a top-view of a plurality of vias <b>15</b>, which are formed using a conventional via formation method. The corresponding cross-sectional view is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. A mask <b>100</b> is used to print redundant via patterns <b>110</b>. The top and cross-sectional views of redundant via patterning are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The second set of vias are aligned and formed in between the first set of vias. The insulating material is removed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> using a conventional RIFF etching processes. Liner materials <b>120</b> are deposited after the removal of photo-resist in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. After metal deposition <b>130</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, and CMP, the final cluster-of-via structure is formed by use of conventional deposition processes (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, the vias <b>15</b> are clustered together with liner material <b>120</b> therebetween.</p>
