<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage filing under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Application PCT/CN2007/002311, filed on Jul. 31, 2007. International Application Application PCT/CN2007/002311 was published as WO 2008/049305 on May 2, 2008. The entire teachings of the referenced Application are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to the field of communication, particularly, relates to a method for reducing information load of Packet Service Control Channel and a method for updating channelization code.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. General Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the High-Speed Packet Access System introduced by IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), voice can be transmitted in the manner of packet service, which enables the transmission of voice service on a High-Speed Shared Channel. As to the voice service, the valid load sent each time is relatively small because the strong real-time feature thereof. Additionally, a High-Speed Downlink Data Shared Channel needs a High-Speed Shared Control Channel (HS-SCCH for short) to transmit associated signaling information and uses a spread factor of 128. Moreover, the ACK/NACK Control Channel fed back by the uplink also occupies a bandwidth of 256. Compared with the bandwidth occupied by the valid load of voice, the bandwidth occupied by the HS-SCCH and feed back Control Channel thereby accounts for a much higher proportion, which goes against the resource application of the system. To increase the utilization efficiency of resource, for the transmission of voice on a High-Speed Shared Channel, 3GPP standard brings forward that: a HS-SCCH need not to be monitored by a user equipment (UE for short), and a fixed channelization code of a High-Speed Physical Shared Data Channel and a fixed transport block size index used when the UE does not need to monitor the HS-SCCH is designated for such service, so that the UE can receive data on the High-Speed Physical Shared Data Channel without monitoring the HS-SCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To achieve the above function, the combination of a base station (BS for short) with UE is required, to ensure a correct receiving of data by the UE, so as to achieve the purpose of saving resource, that is, the BS must transmit data on a fixed High-Speed achieve Physical Shared Data Channel by a fixed transport block size index used when the UE does not need to monitor the HS-SCCH, and the UE must receive data on a fixed High-Speed Physical Shared Data Channel by a fixed transport block size index used when the UE does not need to monitor the HS-SCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">At present, 3GPP protocol can not guarantee that the High-Speed Physical Shared Data Channel and the fixed transport block size index used when the UE does not need to monitor the HS-SCCH of the UE is identical with those of the BS, so that the above function can not be achieved well and the purpose of saving resource can not be achieved.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above one or more problems, the present disclosure provides a method for reducing information load of a packet service control channel and a method for updating channelization code, wherein the High-Speed Physical Shared Data Channel and the transport block size used when the UE does not need to monitor the HS-SCCH are configured by a radio network controller (RNC for short) and a BS, to ensure that the High-Speed Physical Shared Data Channel and the fixed transport block size index used when the UE does not need to monitor the HS-SCCH of the UE is identical with those of the BS, so that the purpose of saving resource can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method for reducing information load of packet service control channel comprises the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Step <b>102</b>, sending a service access request to a RNC by means of a UE;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Step <b>104</b>, determining whether the service need to monitor HS-SCCH, and if the HS-SCCH is determined not to be monitored, configuring a transport block size index used when the UE does not need to monitor the HS-SCCH and transmitting the transport block size index to a BS, by means of a RNC;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Step <b>106</b>, determining a channelization code of a High-Speed Physical Shared Channel according to the transport block size index, and sending the channelization code to the RNC, by means of the BS;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Step <b>108</b>, transmitting the transport block size index and the channelization code to the UE by means of the RNC.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the RNC transmits the channelization code of the High-Speed Physical Shared Data Channel to the BS when the BS is the one of a service cell of High-Speed Downlink Packet Service.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, in the case of establishing a new radio link, the RNC transmits the transport block size index and/or the channelization code to the BS via a radio link establishing request message, and the BS transmits the determined channelization code to the RNC via a radio link establishing response message.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, when the transport block size index and/or the channelization code need to be updated, the RNC transmits the transport block size index and/or the channelization code to the BS via radio link synchronous reconfiguration or radio link asynchronous reconfiguration, and the BS feeds back a new channelization code to the RNC.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, when a radio link needs to be added for the UE and the added radio link is a service cell of High-Speed Downlink Packet Service, the RNC transmits the transport block size index and/or the channelization code to the BS via a radio link adding message, and the BS feeds back the determined channelization code to the RNC via a radio link adding response message.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the transport block size index configured by the RNC is associated with MAC-D stream, and the BS sends data directly in the case of transmitting MAC-D stream, without transmitting signaling information, the transport block size index and/or the channelization code.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the transport block size index configured by the RNC is not associated with MAC-D stream, the BS needs to determine the time to transmit signaling information, the transport block size index and/or the channelization code, for sending data.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the RNC configures at least one transport block size index and/or at least one channelization code.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the BS feeds back at least one channelization code.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, when the channelization code needs to be updated, the BS transmits change indication information of the channelization code to the RNC via a wireless interface parameter message, and when the change indication information of the channelization code is received, the RNC can originate a reconfiguration process to the BS.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">By configuring the High-Speed Physical Shared Data Channel and the transport block size index used when the UE does not need to monitor the HS-SCCH, the present disclosure enables the UE to receive data on a fixed High-Speed Physical Shared Data Channel by a fixed transport block size, so data can be correctly received and the purpose of saving resource can be achieved.</p>
