<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a radially deformable tubular prosthesis, of the type comprising a tubular body deformable between a retracted state of small diameter and an expanded state of larger diameter. The prosthesis includes at least two outer hooks delimiting between them a clamp for engaging in an outer tissue, the two hooks being carried by the body and moveable between a spaced-apart position in which the clamp is open and a closer-together position in which the clamp is closed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For different types of treatment, putting a tubular prosthesis in place inside a blood vessel, whether a vein or an artery, is known. Such tubular prostheses are generally designated by the term &#x201c;stent&#x201d;. WO-A-2005/079705 describes such a prosthesis. The prosthesis is introduced inside the vessel while the prosthesis is in the retracted state. Then, to put it in place, the prosthesis is expanded so as to be applied against the inner surface of the vessel. This expansion occurs either automatically because of the resilience of the prosthesis lattice, or by inflating a small inner balloon, causing plastic deformation of the material making up the lattice.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To avoid subsequent displacement of the prosthesis, the end of the metal lattice has pairs of hooks each forming an engagement clamp to immobilize the prosthesis axially in the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each clamp is thus delimited by two hooks carried by the lattice that can move between a spaced-apart position in which the clamp is open and a closer-together position in which the clamp is closed. Each hook is threadlike and has one end fixed to the lattice. The other end of the hook is free and forms an endpiece for engaging in the tissue delimiting the blood vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The two fixing ends of each clamp are carried by the same mesh of the lattice. The hooks are moved from their spaced-apart position to their closer-together position by moving the fixing end thereof when the mesh carrying the clamp expands. The mesh is first held in a retracted state during expansion of the entire lattice, then released to close the clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the lattice does not deform uniformly, in particular depending on the morphology of the blood vessel in which it is implanted. The free ends of the hooks forming the same clamp can therefore be separated from each other in particular after expansion of the lattice. This impairs the robustness of the fixture of the lattice in the tissue delimiting the vessel.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the invention is to propose a tubular prosthesis that allows more reliable engagement of the lattice of the tubular prosthesis in the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, the invention relates to a tubular prosthesis of the above-mentioned type, in which the prosthesis comprises a member for guiding the movement of at least one of the hooks during deformation of the prosthesis. The guiding member delimits a guide passage in which at least one of the hooks is engaged.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0040">The tubular prosthesis <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is designed to be put in place in a blood vessel. It comprises a tubular body <b>11</b> comprising a lattice <b>12</b> embedded, over most of the length of the prosthesis, in a film <b>14</b> of the body <b>11</b>. The prosthesis <b>10</b> also comprises, in the vicinity of one of its ends, three clamps <b>16</b> spaced regularly at angles on its periphery.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0041">Each clamp <b>16</b> is made up of two hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> carried by the metal lattice <b>12</b>. These hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> can be moved in relation to each other between a spaced-apart position in which the clamp is open and a closer-together position in which the clamp is closed. The clamp further comprises a guiding member <b>20</b> carried on one of the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). The hook <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> carrying the member <b>20</b> is a guiding hook <b>18</b> delimiting a guide passage <b>21</b> in which the other hook, a guided hook <b>19</b>, is engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0042">In the example illustrated, the clamps <b>16</b> are provided on an end portion <b>22</b> of the prosthesis with no film <b>14</b>, the lattice <b>12</b> therefore not being covered in this region. However, in the main portion <b>23</b> of the prosthesis, the lattice <b>12</b> is embedded in the film <b>14</b>. In a variant, the clamps <b>16</b> are provided over the entire length of the prosthesis, in particular where the prosthesis has no film.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0043">The lattice <b>12</b> consists of biocompatible stainless steel. It is produced for example by weaving or knitting a thread, axial deployment of a tube, or by any other appropriate technique.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0044">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lattice <b>12</b> consists of two bundles of threads wound in a helix in opposite directions, the threads in the same bundle extending generally parallel to one other and transverse to the threads in the bundle of threads wound in the opposite direction. The threads of the two bundles wound in opposite directions cross each other alternately above and beneath to form meshes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0045">The lattice <b>12</b> is preferably elastically deformable by radial expansion, between a retracted state of small diameter and an expanded state of larger diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0046">In its expanded state, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the meshes of the lattice form diamonds generally elongated in the circumferential direction. Conversely, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the retracted state of the prosthesis, the meshes form diamonds elongated parallel to the axis of the prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0047">In a variant, the prosthesis is plastically deformable. In other words, the body <b>11</b> and the lattice <b>12</b> have a first stable form of small diameter and a second stable form of larger diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0048">Over the main portion <b>23</b>, the lattice <b>12</b> is entirely embedded in the film <b>14</b>. This film is formed of an expandable material that is impermeable with respect to the liquids that fill the meshes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0049">This material is sufficiently expandable for the film <b>14</b> to follow the deformation of the lattice <b>12</b> from its retracted state to its expanded state without tearing or coming loose, despite the deformation of the meshes and of the lattice. Appropriate materials are a biocompatible elastomer, which may be natural, or synthetic rubber or a biocompatible polymer such as polyurethane.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0050">Coating of the lattice <b>12</b> by the film <b>14</b> is obtained for example by a coextrusion or steeping technique, after degreasing the metal and treating it with a primary adhesion substance.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, each hook <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> is formed of a threadlike metal element, a free end of which is curved outwards to form an endpiece <b>24</b>. The hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> overlap to form the clamp <b>16</b> between the facing endpieces <b>24</b>. The endpieces <b>24</b> are alike.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0052">Each hook <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> comprises an arm <b>25</b> extended by the endpiece <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0053">The arm <b>25</b> of the guided hook <b>19</b> consists of a rectilinear portion. However, the arm <b>25</b> of the guiding hook <b>18</b> comprises a loop forming the guiding member <b>20</b>. The loop is produced by twisting the hook <b>18</b> upon itself over one, or any other suitable number of turns. The twisting is performed around the guided hook <b>19</b>, which facilitates assembly of the clamps <b>16</b>. Moreover, twisting is by plastic deformation, so that it is permanent.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0054">The guiding member <b>20</b> formed by twisting is situated in the vicinity of the endpiece <b>24</b> of the guiding hook <b>18</b>, in the extension of the endpiece <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0055">The guided hook <b>19</b> can move along an axis of translation and two orthogonal axes of rotation in the passage <b>21</b> delimited by the guiding member <b>20</b>. The mechanical stresses that could be exerted between the two hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are thus minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0056">In a variant, the guiding member <b>20</b> is formed by twisting the hook <b>18</b> upon itself over more than one turn.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0057">In another variant, the passage <b>21</b> is not delimited by a loop. It is for example delimited by a ring, or tube, or any other element with a form suitable for guiding the hook <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0058">At its end opposite the endpiece <b>24</b>, each arm <b>25</b> is fixed to the metal lattice <b>12</b> in opposite corners of a mesh as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The endpieces <b>24</b> project outwards in relation to the tubular portion delimited by the body <b>11</b> and the lattice <b>12</b>, and their curved ends extend, at rest, in a plane transverse to the tubular prosthesis (in other words, perpendicular to the general axis thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0059">The diameter of the endpieces <b>24</b> of the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> is between 0.1 and several millimeters. Preferably, the diameter of the endpieces <b>24</b> is smaller than the diameter of the passage <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0060">The length of the arm <b>25</b> of the guided hook <b>19</b> is adapted to the diameter of the prosthesis <b>10</b>. The length of the arm <b>25</b> of the guiding hook <b>18</b> is small and is smaller than that of the arm <b>25</b> of the guided hook <b>19</b> in such a way that the guiding member <b>20</b> is very close to the anchoring point <b>28</b> of the hook <b>18</b>. In fact, the short length of the arm <b>25</b> of the guiding hook <b>18</b> provides rigidity to the arm <b>25</b> and thus increases guiding reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0061">The diameter of the guide passage <b>21</b> is greater than the diameter of the cross-section of the arm <b>25</b> of the hook <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0062">The lengths of the arms <b>25</b> are such that, in the expanded state of the prosthesis illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the two endpieces <b>24</b> of the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are brought closer and together delimit a closed or practically closed loop.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0063">Initially, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, the prosthesis is associated with a retaining device <b>30</b> for releasably retaining the clamps <b>16</b> in their open position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0064">Further, the prosthesis <b>10</b>, the clamps <b>16</b> of which are held open, is received, as is known per se, in a delivery tube <b>32</b> inside which the prosthesis is confined, in the retracted state thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0065">Advantageously, the inner conduit of the tube <b>32</b> has canals <b>33</b> longitudinally for receiving the ends of the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> projecting in relation to the generally tubular surface of the metal lattice.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0066">As illustrated more precisely in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, each retaining device <b>30</b> for holding a clamp <b>16</b> open comprises a flexible tube <b>34</b> made for example of PEEK. This tube <b>34</b> extends longitudinally between a distal end <b>36</b> intended to be received in the blood vessel and a proximal end <b>38</b> intended to be accessible by the surgeon outside the patient's body. Therefore, the tube <b>34</b> has for example a length of one meter.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0067">A retaining opening <b>40</b> is arranged laterally in the tube <b>34</b> generally facing the associated clamp <b>16</b>. The tube <b>34</b> is further equipped, in the vicinity of its proximal end <b>38</b>, with a hollow side branch <b>42</b> provided with a ring <b>43</b> for axially locking a sliding thread.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0068">The releasable retaining retaining device <b>30</b> further comprises a retaining rod <b>44</b> engaged axially in the tube <b>34</b>, and a retaining thread <b>46</b> encircling the mesh of the prosthesis carrying the clamp <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0069">The retaining rod <b>44</b> extends from one end of the tube <b>34</b> to the other. It projects outside the tube at the proximal end <b>38</b>. This rod <b>44</b> is moveable in the tube <b>34</b> between a retaining position (in which the rod is facing the opening <b>40</b>) and a release position (in which the rod <b>44</b> is spaced-apart from the opening <b>40</b> and shifted towards the proximal end of the tube <b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0070">The retaining thread <b>46</b> comprises a single strand which has at one end a circlet <b>48</b>, a tightening loop <b>50</b> and a control portion <b>52</b> which extends along the entire length of the tube <b>34</b> from the opening <b>40</b> to the branch <b>42</b> out of which it projects after having passed through the locking ring <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0071">The end circlet <b>48</b> is formed by a closed loop of small diameter in which the rod <b>44</b> is engaged initially when the rod <b>44</b> is in its retaining position. The tightening loop <b>50</b> is formed by a portion of the strand, engaged so as to slide through two meshes of the lattice adjacent to the mesh carrying the clamp <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0072">The tightening loop <b>50</b> passes through the opening <b>40</b> to join the circlet <b>48</b> at one end and the control portion <b>52</b> at its other end. The active length of the tightening loop <b>50</b> varies according to the traction applied to the control portion <b>52</b>, in such a way that it controls the form (width) of the mesh carrying the clamp <b>16</b>, as will be set out below.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0073">Initially, before being put in place, the prosthesis is arranged in the delivery tube <b>32</b> and the control portions <b>52</b> of the retaining device <b>30</b> for retaining the clips are taut, so that the clamps are held open, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In fact, in this position, the tightening loop <b>50</b> tightens the mesh carrying the clamp, so that the diamond defining the mesh is extended along the diagonal thereof parallel to the axis of the prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0074">To put the prosthesis <b>10</b> in place, the prosthesis <b>10</b> is introduced with the tube <b>32</b> as far as the insertion zone, and then the tube <b>32</b> is withdrawn thus releasing the prosthesis. The prosthesis <b>10</b> expands and is then laid flat against the inner surface of the blood vessel, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0075">During this expansion, the meshes of the lattice of the prosthesis extend due to the resilience of the lattice along the peripheral diagonal of the prosthesis <b>10</b> thus allowing the diameter of the prosthesis to increase. Conversely, the meshes carrying a clamp remain contracted, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> because of the tightening loop <b>50</b>. Thus, the clamps <b>16</b> are laid against the surface of the blood vessel while the clamps <b>16</b> are still in the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0076">By acting on the locking ring <b>43</b>, the practioner then proceeds to release the retaining threads <b>46</b> to allow the elastic deformation of the meshes carrying the clamps <b>16</b>, and the two opposite hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> therefore draw closer, causing each clamp <b>16</b> to close and the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> to penetrate into the wall delimiting the blood vessel, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0077">As the two hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> draw closer, the guided hook <b>19</b> slides in the guiding member <b>20</b>. The guiding member <b>20</b> is situated in the vicinity of the endpiece <b>24</b> of the guiding hook <b>18</b>, so the endpiece <b>24</b> of the guided hook <b>19</b> necessarily draws closer to that of the guiding hook <b>18</b> when the clamp <b>16</b> closes. This closure is therefore reliable whatever the deformation of the lattice <b>12</b>. Thus, even if the deformation of the mesh carrying the clamp <b>16</b> is not uniform, the relative position of the endpieces <b>24</b> of the two hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> is substantially the same as during a uniform deformation of the mesh. In fact, in the closer-together position, the endpieces <b>24</b> are held in the vicinity of each other by the guiding member <b>20</b> and the clamping function of the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0078">After releasing the retaining thread <b>46</b>, the rod <b>44</b> is taken to the release position, so that the circlet <b>48</b> is released from the rod <b>44</b>. The practioner then pulls on the control portion <b>52</b> allowing the retaining thread <b>46</b> to escape from the metal lattice, by passing through the two meshes adjacent to the mesh carrying the clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0079">Thus, since the retaining device <b>30</b> of the clamp are made independent of the prosthesis <b>10</b>, the retaining device <b>30</b> can be withdrawn by endoluminal means.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0080">It will be understood that the prosthesis <b>10</b> is held effectively against the inner surface of the vessel by the presence of the clamps <b>16</b> which are maintained resiliently in the closed position under the action of the prosthesis <b>10</b>. Furthermore, since the clamps <b>16</b> are closed at the same time as the prosthesis is put in place, installation of the prosthesis is relatively easy.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0081">Moreover, the guiding of the hook <b>19</b> by the hook <b>18</b> stiffens the clamp <b>16</b> formed by the two hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>. If one of the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> is subjected to external stress, it is held by the other hook <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> by the guiding member <b>20</b> so that they remain in the vicinity of each other. If the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are deformed around their respective fixing point <b>28</b>, their relative position remains substantially unchanged and the function of the clamp <b>16</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0082">Obtaining the guiding member <b>20</b> by means of twisting the hook <b>18</b> on itself ensures that the manufacturing cost is low. Moreover, the hook <b>19</b> is moveable in the hook <b>18</b> along two orthogonal axes of rotation and at least one axis of translation. The stresses exerted between the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> are thus minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0083">In a variant that has not been illustrated, the guiding member is carried by the lattice. The two hooks are then engaged in the guiding member. The guiding member consists for example of a rigid rod welded on the mesh carrying the clamp, the rod being extended by a ring forming the guiding member.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0084">In a variant, the guiding member <b>20</b> is of any suitable known type, such as for example a ring integral with the hook <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0085">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a second embodiment of a prosthesis according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0086">The tubular body <b>11</b> of the vascular prosthesis <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> comprises a lattice <b>12</b> itself made up of eight resilient metal threads, such as the threads F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b> and F<b>3</b>, twisted together in a way that will be explained in detail below. These threads define, over the length of the lattice, several successive regions which are, from top to bottom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0087">a first end region <b>102</b> with eight loops <b>104</b>;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0088">successive main regions <b>106</b> which each have peripheral crowns of twisted nodes <b>108</b>; and</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0089">a second end region <b>111</b> with end twists <b>112</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0090">In the case of the thread F<b>1</b>:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0091">the loop <b>104</b> is formed by twisting the thread F<b>1</b> on itself, by at least one half turn;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0092">each node <b>108</b> is formed by twisting the thread F<b>1</b> with an adjacent thread such as F<b>2</b>, F<b>3</b> over one turn or more.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0093">Thus, on either side of each so-called double-twisted node marked <b>115</b> where the thread is twisted over an even number of half turns in particular equal to two, each strand of the thread that forms the node extends in two directions parallel to each other and close to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0094">On the other hand, with regard to the so-called triple-twisted nodes <b>117</b> where the thread is twisted over an uneven number of half turns in particular equal to three, each thread emerges from it in two directions which between them form an angle considerably less than 180&#xb0;, for example a right angle or an acute angle as illustrated, to form two adjacent sides of a mesh of the lattice.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in the example illustrated, the thread F<b>1</b> emerges from a twist <b>112</b> then forms successively a node <b>115</b>, a node <b>117</b>, a node <b>115</b>, another node <b>115</b>, a node <b>117</b>, a node <b>115</b>, another node <b>115</b>, a loop <b>104</b>, a node <b>115</b>, another node <b>115</b>, a node <b>117</b>, a node <b>115</b>, another node <b>115</b>, a node <b>117</b>, a node <b>115</b> and another twist <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0096">In this embodiment, each clamp marked <b>116</b> is formed by a single metal thread <b>120</b>, the running part of which is engaged and twisted round the threads delimiting the lattice, and the two free ends of which are curved outwards to form hooks <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> similar to the hooks <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> of the previous embodiment. The guiding hook <b>118</b> also comprises a guiding member <b>20</b> delimiting a guide passage <b>21</b> in which the guided hook <b>119</b> is engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0097">More precisely and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, the thread <b>120</b> is twisted from a node <b>115</b> round two divergent and angularly offset strands. Each branch of the thread <b>120</b> is then twisted with the next twisted node and then extends transversely along a diameter of the mesh, to form the two arms <b>25</b> and the two endpieces <b>24</b> of the hooks <b>118</b>, <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0098">Thus, as in the previous embodiment, deformation of the mesh carrying the clamp <b>116</b> causes the clamp <b>116</b> to open or close, the two hooks <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> at the curved end moving in relation to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0099">In the same way, the guiding member <b>20</b> ensures that fixing is reliable by maintaining the hooks <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> facing each other after deployment of the prosthesis <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0100">In a third embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the body <b>11</b> of the vascular prosthesis <b>200</b> is formed by a fabric tube <b>212</b> that can be deployed between a retracted state and an expanded state of large diameter. It is, for example, a Dacron&#x2122; fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0101">Two hooks <b>218</b>, <b>219</b> similar to the hooks <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> of the second embodiment are sewn on the tube <b>212</b>. The hooks <b>218</b>, <b>219</b> are formed by a single thread <b>220</b> in the form of a triangle, the hooks <b>218</b>, <b>219</b> and the guiding member <b>20</b> being placed in the vicinity of the apex of the triangle. Deployment of the fabric <b>212</b> to its expanded state moves the two hooks <b>218</b>, <b>219</b> between their spaced-apart position and their closer-together position, this movement being guided by the guiding member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0102">Unlike the previous two embodiments, the fabric <b>212</b> cannot be deployed spontaneously to its expanded state.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0103">Initially, the fabric prosthesis <b>200</b> is held in its retracted state. In this state, the clamp <b>216</b> is open and the hooks <b>218</b>, <b>219</b> are arranged spaced-apart from each other. The surface area delimited by the thread <b>220</b> in the form of a triangle is therefore minimal.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0104">The prosthesis <b>200</b> is deployed by means of a small balloon <b>230</b> that can be inflated between a retracted state and an expanded state, and inserted in the fabric tube <b>212</b>. The small balloon <b>230</b> is conveyed into the tube <b>212</b> by the delivery tube <b>32</b> it its retracted state and is then inflated.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0105">Deployment of the fabric tube <b>212</b> causes the surface area delimited by the thread <b>220</b> to increase. The guided hook <b>219</b> then moves closer to the guiding hook <b>218</b> while being held close to the guiding hook by the guiding member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0106">By engaging radially in the blood vessel, the clamps <b>216</b> maintain the fabric <b>212</b> in its expanded state. Moreover, the two hooks <b>218</b>, <b>219</b> axially engage the prosthesis <b>200</b>, as in the two previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0107">Unlike the two previous embodiments, the insertion member does not have a retaining device <b>30</b> for retaining the clamp <b>216</b> in its open position. Closure of the clamp <b>216</b> occurs as the fabric <b>212</b> is deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0108">In a fourth embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the body <b>11</b> of the prosthesis <b>300</b> is similar to that of the third embodiment. However, the prosthesis <b>300</b> also comprises a deformable ring <b>302</b> which encircles the fabric <b>212</b> and is sewn thereto by a thread <b>303</b>. The ring <b>302</b> is therefore provided so as to deform with the fabric <b>212</b> between a retracted state in which it has a minimum diameter and an expanded state in which it has a maximum diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0109">Furthermore, the ring <b>302</b> carries at its ends the two hooks <b>318</b>, <b>319</b> and the guiding member <b>20</b> and moves them between their spaced-apart position and their closer-together position during deformation thereof. The two hooks <b>318</b>, <b>319</b> are for example similar to the hooks of the first embodiment, and have their ends <b>28</b> welded to the ring <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0110">In a variant, the ring <b>302</b> is used with the prostheses <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> of the first two embodiments.</p>
