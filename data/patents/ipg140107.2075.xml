<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to containers formed by injection moulding of plastics material such as polypropylene, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such containers generally have a base and side walls (in the event of a cylindrical container then there is only a single side wall) and are formed from a mould having an interior and a core which extends into the mould. The core is said to be unsupported in the sense that the only support for the core is at one end of the mould and thereafter the core does not come in contact with the interior of the mould. The space between the core and the mould interior is the space which receives the plastic which will form the side walls and base of the container. Normally the injection point or points at which the molten plastic is injected into the mould are located in the base since this means that the marks formed at the point of injection are not visible when the container is upright in its normal condition.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Normally during the moulding process, the flow of plastic into the mould is not exactly even in all directions and thus molten plastic flows more to one side of the core than the other. As a consequence of this uneven flow the core deforms slightly so as to bend away from the side which has the more plastic and towards the side which has the less plastic. The consequence of this is that the moulded plastics container has side wall(s) which are not exactly uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This lack of uniformity is generally only visible by holding the container up to the light and observing the light transmission through the side walls of the container. The thinner portions of the wall are naturally lighter in color since they transmit more light than the thicker portions of the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For most containers this small difference in wall thickness, typically a very small fraction of a millimeter, is of no consequence to the operation of the container and is easily tolerated as a non-consequential manufacturing defect.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, a particular class of container, known as &#x201c;sharps&#x201d; containers are intended for the disposal of syringes which have extremely sharp needle points. Examples of such containers are those illustrated in Australian Patent No. 741,793 and in the first four drawings of the present specification. Such containers may or may not have an interior partition which divides the container into two, namely one compartment containing unused syringes and the other compartment containing used syringes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Outside of the hospital and medical systems, there are two types of persons who regularly use syringes for the self-administration of drugs. These are essentially diabetics and intravenous drug addicts. Diabetics are insulin-dependent and require a regular injection of insulin in order to maintain their blood sugar levels. Intravenous drug addicts are dependent upon a drug such as heroin and regularly inject themselves in order to maintain a sense of euphoria.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Both classes of persons carry syringes about them from place to place and thus require a portable means of safe disposal of the syringes after the injection has taken place. For diabetics this is relatively straight forward since the syringes are not in themselves normally infected and thus it is a matter of preventing the needle tip from puncturing anything or anybody.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, for intravenous drug users, there is a high likelihood that the syringe is infected with either Hepatitis C or HIV AIDS, or both, and thus members of the general public should be protected from the possibility of needle stick injury which may result in permanent and even fatal infection.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore highly desirable from a public health point of view that intravenous drug users not leave infected syringes lying about in public places such as parks, beaches, and the like where they can be accidentally stepped upon by members of the general public. Thus it is desirable from a public health point of view that intravenous drug users, as well is diabetics, be able to safely dispose of syringes after they have been used. Thus there is a need for an inexpensive portable used syringe container device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, modern and more enlightened public health policy is to prevent, as much as possible, intravenous drug users from sharing needles since this can prevent the spread of Hepatitis C and HIV AIDS. It is therefore desirable that used syringe container devices have a one-way locking arrangement which prevents used syringes once they are inserted in the container, from then being extracted from the container for re-use.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, many intravenous drug users are eventually able to resist and overcome their addiction. Thus if they can be maintained healthy by not contracting Hepatitis C or HIV AIDS whilst they are addicted, this can greatly assist their eventual recovery.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another aspect of public health is the need to protect the health of sanitary workers such as garbage collectors who may accidentally, or who may routinely be required to, come into contact with such used syringe container devices. Thus there is a desirable public health outcome if such used syringe containers are able to withstand moderate force and thus can retain the point of the needle within the container. In this way, the incidence of needle stick injuries, even of gloved hands, can be lessened.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It has been observed by the present inventors that when such sharps containers are crushed, for example, by garbage compacting devices, there is a propensity for the needle points of the used syringes disposed of therein to penetrate the side walls at those locations where the side walls are the thinnest. Another situation where such containers may be crushed is when seat belt wearing motorists carry such containers in a breast pocket and under a seat belt prior to a motor vehicle accident.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">GENESIS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The genesis of the present invention is the desire to improve the performance of sharps containers, in particular, when crushed by a seat belt or by garbage handling apparatus. In particular, if a sharps container is provided with substantially uniform side walls them no one location is more likely than another to yield to the urging of needles to penetrate the side wall. In this connection it should be noted that the base of such containers is normally much thicker than the side wall and therefore needle penetration through the base is not a problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is towards the abovementioned desire for such containers with substantially uniform side walls that the present invention is directed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a method of injection moulding a container having side walls of substantially uniform thickness and a base from a mould having an interior and an unsupported core extending into said mould interior, said method comprising the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(i) injection moulding a trial container and ejecting same from the mould;</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">(ii) observing which portion of the side walls of said trial container is thinner than the remainder thereof;</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">(iii) removing a small amount of material from a portion of said mould forms the base of said container to slightly re-direct towards said thinner portion the molten plastic entering said mould;</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">(iv) repeating step (i); and</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">(v) repeating steps (ii) to (iv) as necessary until said ejected trial container has substantially uniform side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a container moulded by the abovementioned method.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The ensuing detailed description provides preferred exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention. Rather, the ensuing detailed description of the preferred exemplary embodiments will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing the preferred exemplary embodiments of the invention. It being understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To aid in describing the invention, directional terms are used in the specification and claims to describe portions of the present invention (e.g., upper, lower, left, right, etc.). These directional definitions are merely intended to assist in describing and claiming the invention and are not intended to limit the invention in any way. In addition, reference numerals that are introduced in the specification in association with a drawing figure may be repeated in one or more subsequent figures without additional description in the specification in order to provide context for other features.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, a prior art sharps container <b>1</b> has a top <b>3</b> and a container body <b>4</b> with a side wall <b>2</b>. The container body <b>4</b> and top <b>3</b> are each independently injection moulded and are subsequently brought together and joined, for example, by means of ultrasonic welding. The top <b>3</b> has a hinged lid <b>5</b> and a one way syringe orifice <b>6</b> which enables the disposal of used syringes in a substantially safe manner. Not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> but interconnecting the side walls <b>2</b> is a base <b>7</b> for the container body <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a cross-sectional view through the mould interior used to mould the body <b>4</b> of the container <b>1</b> is illustrated schematically. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the mould <b>10</b> has an interior <b>11</b> and an unsupported core <b>12</b> which projects into the mould interior <b>11</b>. The gap between the mould interior <b>11</b> and the core <b>12</b> defines the shape of the body <b>4</b> with its side wall <b>2</b> and base <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by means of the designations <b>2</b> and <b>7</b> are the portions of the mould <b>10</b> in which the corresponding side walls <b>2</b> and base <b>7</b> of the container body <b>4</b> are formed during the moulding process. Two injection points <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are provided in the mould adjacent that portion of the mould body which will form the base <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates in the exaggerated fashion what happens during the moulding of the container body <b>4</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, molten plastic can be visualized as entering into the mould <b>10</b> via the injection points <b>14</b> and <b>15</b>. Instead of being entirely an even flow as desired, the flow is more to the right as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> than to the left. Since the molten plastic is under high pressure, the flow which is more to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> defects the core <b>12</b> to the left as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This has the consequence that the left hand side wall <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is thinner than the resulting right hand side wall <b>2</b> because of this deflection of the core <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is known to cure this problem of non-uniform side wall thickness by means of fabricating one or more openings formed in the base <b>7</b> which permit a pin or like supporting structure to be passed into the mould interior and thereby support the free end of the core <b>12</b>. However, such pins results in corresponding openings in the base <b>7</b> and this is undesirable for a &#x201c;crush survivable&#x201d; sharps container since it would enable needle tips to pass through the resulting openings.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Instead of providing such a core support, a trial container is moulded, ejected from the mould and then examined to see which portions of the side wall <b>2</b> are thin and which are thick. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, since the side wall is thin on the left hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and thick on the right hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, so the free end of the core <b>2</b> has a thin sliver <b>17</b> filed or ground away from the free end of the core <b>12</b> as indicated by broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (but to an exaggerated scale). The size of the sliver <b>17</b> removed is a very small fraction of a millimeter but it is removed on the side of the core <b>12</b> which corresponds to the thinnest portion of the side wall <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the sliver <b>17</b> has been removed, a second trial container is fabricated from the mould with the injection conditions unchanged, and the resulting side wall <b>2</b> is again examined by holding the container <b>1</b> up to the light. If it is found, for example, that the side wall <b>2</b> is still thin on the left hand side as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, then a further sliver <b>17</b> is ground away and the process repeated. The process is continuously repeated until the side wall <b>2</b> is substantially uniform when the container <b>1</b> is viewed whilst being held up to the light. The removal of the sliver <b>17</b> means that the base <b>7</b> of the container body <b>4</b> is a little thicker on the left hand side with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> than the right, however, this manufacturing non-uniformity is of no consequence.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">What is of substantial consequence, is that the side wall <b>2</b> is now substantially uniform and therefore in the event that the container <b>1</b> is crushed there is no inherent point of weakness at one location of the side wall <b>2</b> relative to the remainder of the side wall. Thus the propensity for needle tips to project through the side wall <b>2</b> is substantially reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The foregoing describes only one embodiment of the present invention and modifications, obvious to those skilled in the plastic moulding arts, can be made thereto without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, rather than grind a sliver <b>17</b> from the free end of the core, an equivalent sliver can be ground off the base of the mould opposite the free end of the core as indicted at <b>117</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
