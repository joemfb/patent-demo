<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An automatic manifold mount gun <b>20</b> is capable of being used as an air-assisted hydraulic atomizer, or in a high-volume, low-pressure (hereinafter sometimes HVLP) applications. Gun <b>20</b> is mounted on an air/fluid inlet junction manifold <b>22</b>. Manifold <b>22</b> provides inlet fittings <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> for atomizing air, spray pattern-shaping air (hereinafter sometimes &#x201c;fan air&#x201d;), and the air supply to the piston <b>34</b> and cylinder <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>) which operate the valve <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) which controls the flow of coating material from gun <b>20</b> (hereinafter sometimes &#x201c;cylinder air&#x201d;), respectively. Gun <b>20</b> generally produces a relatively flat, cat's-eye shaped, oval or elliptical cross section pattern with somewhat fan-shaped margins.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the piston <b>34</b> is reciprocable in the cylinder <b>36</b> at a rearward end of gun <b>20</b>. Piston <b>34</b> controls the opening and closing of coating material valve <b>38</b> at a forward end of gun <b>20</b> through a stem <b>40</b>. Stem <b>40</b> is held in place in relation to piston <b>34</b> by a collet <b>42</b> and a collet locknut <b>44</b> which is threaded into the rearward end <b>46</b> of collet <b>42</b> and grips stem <b>40</b>, capturing stem <b>40</b> in collet <b>42</b>. The collet <b>42</b> is positioned in a passageway <b>48</b> through piston <b>34</b> by a retaining ring <b>50</b> which snaps into a groove <b>52</b> provided therefor in the collet <b>42</b> stem at a front face <b>54</b> of piston <b>34</b>. The piston <b>34</b> is yieldably urged forward in its cylinder <b>36</b> by a piston spring <b>64</b> which is captured between a spring seat <b>66</b> provided on a rearward face <b>68</b> of piston <b>34</b> and a spring seat <b>70</b> formed on the inside of a cylinder end cap <b>74</b>. Stem <b>40</b> extends through a cartridge assembly <b>80</b> which provides a seal around stem <b>40</b>. Cartridge assembly <b>80</b> is of the general type, and generally for the purposes, described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,272,616.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Coating material to be dispensed from gun <b>20</b> is provided through either of two ports <b>82</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>82</b>-<b>2</b> provided in manifold <b>22</b>. The other of ports <b>82</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>82</b>-<b>2</b> can be plugged with a threaded plug (not shown), or coupled through (a) suitable conduit(s) (not shown) to another gun <b>20</b> to supply coating material thereto, to recirculate coating material to the coating material source, such as a paint kitchen, or the like. Ports <b>82</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>82</b>-<b>2</b> intersect a filter chamber <b>84</b> internally within manifold <b>22</b>. Filter chamber <b>84</b> houses a filter <b>86</b> for the material to be dispensed. The filter may be, for example, a 100 mesh edge filter such as a Binks part number 54-1836 filter. Filter <b>86</b> is held removably in gun <b>20</b> by a threaded filter retainer assembly <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A passageway <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) leads from filter chamber <b>84</b> to a surface <b>92</b> of manifold <b>22</b>. A mating passageway <b>94</b> extends from a mating surface <b>96</b> of gun <b>20</b> and intersects a central passageway <b>98</b> which extends generally longitudinally of the body of gun <b>20</b>. Passageway <b>94</b> intersects passageway <b>98</b> forward of cartridge assembly <b>80</b> which is threaded into passageway <b>98</b> from the cylinder <b>36</b> end of gun <b>20</b>. A passageway <b>102</b> extends from cylinder air fitting <b>28</b> to surface <b>92</b> of manifold <b>22</b>. A mating passageway <b>104</b> extends from surface <b>96</b> to cylinder <b>36</b> in front of a working surface of piston <b>34</b>. A passageway <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 10</figref>) extends from atomizing air fitting <b>24</b> to surface <b>92</b> of manifold <b>22</b>. A mating passageway <b>108</b> extends from surface <b>96</b> to, for example, an air-assisted hydraulic atomizing nozzle/air cap <b>110</b> (hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as a &#x201c;nozzle&#x201d;) at the front of gun <b>20</b>. A passageway <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 10</figref>) extends from fan air fitting <b>26</b> to surface <b>92</b> of manifold <b>22</b>. A mating passageway <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) extends from surface <b>96</b> to nozzle <b>110</b>. Suitable seals <b>116</b>, such as, for example, O-ring seals of materials suitably inert to the materials flowing through them, are provided at the mating surfaces <b>92</b>, <b>96</b> around passageways <b>90</b>, <b>94</b>; <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>; <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>; and <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> to seal these passageways against leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24</figref>, the flows of atomizing air, fan air, and coating material flows from nozzle <b>110</b> can be synchronized to occur in a desired order. In the embodiment of the piston <b>34</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24</figref>, this is achieved by valve members <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> mounted to piston <b>34</b> and extending forward in passageways <b>108</b>, <b>114</b>, respectively, to points at which passageways <b>108</b>, <b>114</b> turns from generally perpendicular to surface <b>96</b> to generally parallel to surface <b>96</b> as passageways <b>108</b>, <b>114</b> progress forward toward nozzle <b>110</b>. For example, when cylinder air is first triggered on, piston <b>34</b> starts rearward against the urging of spring <b>64</b>. Coating material begins to flow from nozzle <b>110</b>, the coating material being atomized by the pressure drop across nozzle <b>110</b>. Once piston <b>34</b> has traveled rearward a sufficient distance, valve members <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> open passageways <b>108</b>, <b>114</b> and atomizing air and fan air flow forward to nozzle <b>110</b> is established. The valve members <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> are illustrated as being the same length, resulting in passageways <b>108</b>, <b>114</b> being opened to the nozzle <b>110</b> substantially simultaneously. However, it should be understood that the time sequence and time delay among the supply of coating material, atomizing air and fan air to nozzle <b>110</b> may be controlled by selection of valve members <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> having appropriate lengths, which may be the same or different. The illustrated piston <b>34</b> configuration permits the piston <b>34</b> and its associated components, including the wire collet to be assembled into, and removed from, the gun <b>20</b>, for example, to service the O-ring seals on the piston <b>34</b>, or to service the cartridge assembly <b>80</b>, or to service the atomizing or fan air valve members <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>. This construction also permits the atomizing and/or fan air valve members <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> to be removed from the piston <b>34</b> without removing the piston <b>34</b> from the cylinder <b>36</b> by removing cap <b>74</b> and spring <b>64</b> and unscrewing atomizing and/or fan air valve members <b>120</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> from rearward face <b>68</b> of piston <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Instead of passageway <b>112</b> supplying fan air from fan air fitting <b>26</b> to passageway <b>114</b>, other means may be provided for supplying and regulating the supply of fan air through passageway <b>114</b> from the atomizing air supply coupled to fitting <b>24</b>. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>, a passageway <b>122</b> may be provided across manifold <b>22</b> from passageway <b>106</b> to passageway <b>114</b>. Fitting <b>26</b> can be plugged, and flow from passageway <b>106</b> to passageway <b>114</b> may be controlled by a valve mechanism <b>125</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) including a valve needle <b>127</b> which threads into a packing <b>129</b>. Packing <b>129</b> is threaded into passageway <b>122</b> from the passageway <b>112</b> side. Valve needle <b>127</b> can be threaded into packing <b>129</b> a desired distance from a valve seat <b>131</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) provided in passageway <b>122</b> to obstruct all but the desired fan airflow from passageway <b>106</b> through passageway <b>122</b> to passageway <b>114</b> and thence to the fan air outlets from nozzle <b>110</b>. In this way, the amount of air delivered from passageway <b>106</b> to passageway <b>114</b> to serve as fan air can be controlled at any desired level within the capacities of port <b>24</b> and passageways <b>106</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. If fan air fitting <b>26</b> is to be unplugged and air is to be supplied from fan air fitting <b>26</b> in a manifold <b>22</b> including such a passageway <b>122</b>, a plug <b>133</b> may be inserted into passageway <b>122</b> at the valve seat <b>131</b>, and the external opening of passageway <b>122</b> closed with a threaded plug <b>135</b> having the same relevant dimensions as packing <b>129</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The manifold <b>22</b> includes a forward portion <b>150</b> and a rearward portion <b>152</b>. The forward portion <b>150</b>, which is exposed to the coating material being dispensed, is constructed from a material which is relatively unaffected by the coating material, for example, stainless steel. To reduce the weight of forward portion <b>150</b>, it may be desirable to machine (a) cavity(ies) <b>154</b> in non-critical areas of the forward portion. Such cavities <b>154</b> are illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>. The rearward portion, which is exposed only to compressed air or the like, can be constructed from the same material, or from another, for example, lighter weight material, which is relatively unaffected by the compressed air. An example would be aluminum. The forward and rearward portions <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, respectively, of the manifold are coupled together by dowel pins <b>156</b>, one of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The gun <b>20</b> also is divided into a forward portion <b>160</b> and a rearward portion <b>162</b>. Alignment between the forward and rearward portions of the gun <b>20</b> is promoted by locating pins <b>166</b>, one of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The forward and rearward portions <b>160</b>, <b>162</b> are coupled together by cap bolts <b>167</b> inserted into bores extending forward from cylinder <b>36</b> and threaded into threaded bores in the back surface <b>180</b> of forward portion <b>160</b>. One of cap bolts <b>167</b> is illustrated in broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As was the case with manifold <b>22</b>, the forward portion <b>160</b> can be constructed from a material which is relatively unaffected by the coating material, for example, stainless steel, and the rearward portion from the same or a different material which is relatively unaffected by the compressed air. Gun <b>20</b> and manifold <b>22</b> are joined by cap bolts <b>168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Manifold <b>22</b> can be mounted on a rod (not shown). To accommodate such a mounting, a passageway <b>190</b> is provided through manifold <b>22</b> for receiving such a rod. A threaded opening <b>192</b> intersects passageway <b>190</b> to accommodate a locking bolt for fixing the position of manifold <b>22</b> along the length of such a rod. Manifold <b>22</b> can also be mounted to, for example, a suitable bracket, not shown. Threaded holes <b>194</b> and holes <b>196</b> for locating pins are provided in the bottom surface <b>198</b> of manifold <b>22</b> for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring now particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a weep port <b>200</b> extends through manifold <b>22</b>. A passageway <b>202</b> intersects weep port <b>200</b> and extends to surface <b>92</b>. A mating passageway <b>204</b> extends from mating surface <b>96</b> to central passageway <b>98</b> behind cartridge <b>80</b>. The presence of coating material in weep port <b>200</b> provides an indication that cartridge <b>80</b> is compromised, and in need of service.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Nozzle <b>110</b> includes a carbide tip assembly <b>208</b> including a spray orifice having a maximum dimension of, for example, 0.012&#x2033; (about 0.3 mm.). The spray orifice may be circular, oval, cat's eye shaped, or any of a number of other desired shapes in cross section perpendicular to the nozzle <b>110</b> axis (in this case, generally perpendicular to the longitudinal extent of stem <b>40</b>). Nozzle <b>110</b> also includes an air cap <b>210</b>, details of which are best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-22</figref>. Carbide tip assembly <b>208</b> is retained in air cap <b>210</b>. Air cap <b>210</b>, in turn, is retained against an ultra high molecular weight polymer (UHMW) fluid seat assembly <b>212</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) by a threaded retaining ring <b>214</b> which is threaded onto the front of forward portion <b>160</b> of gun <b>20</b>. O-ring <b>216</b> seals the air cap <b>210</b> to the UHMW fluid seat assembly <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-22</figref>, air cap <b>210</b> includes two diametrically opposed wings <b>220</b>, each of which illustratively includes two passageways <b>222</b> which extend generally perpendicularly to facing, generally parallel surfaces <b>224</b> of the wings <b>220</b>, and a passageway <b>226</b> which extends forward at an angle of, for example, 60&#xb0; to the axis <b>228</b> of air cap <b>210</b>. The axes of passageways <b>222</b> lie at distances of, for example, 0.050&#x2033; on either side of a plane <b>230</b> which bisects air cap <b>210</b> and includes the axis <b>228</b>. The axes of passageways <b>226</b> lie in the plane <b>230</b>. The axes of passageways <b>222</b> lie a distance of, for example, 0.082&#x2033; (about 2.1 mm) forward of the front face <b>232</b> of air cap <b>210</b>. The axes of passageways <b>226</b> where passageways <b>226</b> open through surfaces <b>224</b> lie a distance of, for example, 0.044&#x2033; (about 1.1 mm) forward of front face <b>232</b>. Passageways <b>222</b> and <b>226</b> have diameters of, for example, 0.040&#x2033; (about 0.9 mm). Passageways <b>233</b> are provided through the outer surfaces of wings <b>220</b>, for example, to aid in machining passageways <b>222</b>, <b>226</b>. Passageways <b>233</b> are closed by appropriate plugs <b>235</b> which are then machined during the assembly of air cap <b>210</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Atomizing air from passageway <b>108</b> is coupled through passageways <b>222</b> and <b>226</b> onto the spray exiting from tip <b>208</b> to assist in atomizing and shaping the spray.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Six additional passageways <b>236</b> extend forwardly and radially inwardly at angles of, for example, 45&#xb0; to the axis <b>228</b> of air cap <b>210</b>. The axes of one diametrically opposed pair of passageways <b>236</b> lie generally in a plane <b>240</b> which bisects air cap <b>210</b> and lies generally parallel to surfaces <b>224</b>. The axes of the remaining diametrically opposed pairs of passageways <b>236</b> lie generally in planes oriented at angles of, for example, 40&#xb0; to plane <b>240</b>, and intersect plane <b>240</b> on the axis <b>228</b> of air cap <b>210</b>. Passageways <b>236</b> exit the face <b>232</b> of air cap <b>210</b> at a distance of, for example, about 0.218&#x2033; (about 5.5 mm) from the axis <b>228</b> of air cap <b>210</b>. Passageways <b>240</b> have diameters of, for example, 0.020&#x2033; (about 0.5 mm). Atomizing air from passageway <b>108</b> is coupled through passageways <b>236</b> onto the spray exiting from tip <b>208</b> to assist in reducing the buildup of coating material on the carbide fluid tip <b>208</b> and on the air cap <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">An additional pair of diametrically opposed passageways <b>244</b> exit from the front face <b>232</b> of air cap <b>210</b> a distance of, for example, 0.352&#x2033; (about 8.9 mm) from the axis <b>228</b> of air cap <b>210</b>. The axes of passageways <b>236</b> make angles of, for example, 20&#xb0; with the front face <b>232</b> of air cap <b>210</b>. Shaping air from passageway <b>114</b> is coupled through passageways <b>244</b> onto the spray exiting from tip <b>208</b> to assist in atomizing and shaping the spray.</p>
