<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a capacitor structure and a fabrication method thereof, and more particularly, to a dynamic random access memory stack capacitor structure having a particular supporting structure and a fabrication method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device is made up of many memory cells. Generally, the memory cell is a semiconductor memory device with an access transistor and a storage capacitor. Each memory cell can store one bit of data by storing electric charges in the storage capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the storage capacitor contains an upper electrode, a dielectric layer, and a lower electrode. The storage capability of the storage capacitor is proportional to an overlapping area between the upper/lower electrodes and the dielectric layer. Since modern electrical products are developed with minimized sizes thereof, the area of each memory cell tends to be reduced, so that the DRAM device can be designed with high integrated density. However, the reduction of the area of each memory cell leads to lower storage capability of the memory cell, which requires high refresh frequency and therefore affects the performance of the DRAM device. Currently, two methods are provided to increase storage capability of the storage capacitor. A method is proposed to use a material with higher dielectric constant for the dielectric layer, and the other method is proposed to increase the overlapping area between the upper/lower electrodes and the dielectric layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several methods of increasing the area of the capacitor electrode have been proposed in the prior art. For example, crown-type stacked capacitors can be used to increase the total surface area of the capacitor electrode owing to its sidewall structures. According to the prior art, lithography and etching process is performed to form a plurality of crown-type stacked capacitors, and each crown-type stacked capacitor is supported by a supporting structure. However, the existing supporting structures are only formed at a top of each crown-type stacked capacitor and tend to be damaged, which may cause a reduction of product yield. Therefore, a capacitor structure having a particular supporting structure and a fabrication method thereof are required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore one of the objectives of the present invention is to provide a capacitor structure with a particular supporting structure and a fabrication method thereof, in which storage capacitors can be well supported.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the present invention, a capacitor structure is disposed on an interior surface of a vertical hollow cylinder of a supporting structure. The supporting structure is disposed on a substrate, and the supporting structure further includes a horizontal supporting layer connected to the vertical hollow cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with the present invention, a fabrication method of the capacitor structure is provided as follows. A substrate is provided, and at least one capacitor disposing region is defined on the substrate. A supporting region is defined on a portion of the substrate where no capacitor disposing region is located. Then, a supporting structure is formed on the substrate, where the supporting structure includes at least one vertical hollow cylinder and a horizontal supporting layer connected to the vertical hollow cylinder. Each vertical hollow cylinder surrounds the corresponding capacitor disposing region, and the supporting layer is disposed on the substrate within the supporting region. Finally, a capacitor structure is formed in the vertical hollow cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the present invention, the storage capacitor is not only disposed on an exterior surface of the capacitor structure, but also entirely supports sidewalls of the capacitor structure. Thus, product yield of the storage capacitor can be promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">To provide a better understanding of the presented invention for one skilled in the art, preferred embodiments will be detailed as follows. The preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings with numbered elements to elaborate the contents and effects to be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which schematically illustrates a capacitor structure of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a storage capacitor <b>300</b> of the present invention includes a substrate <b>302</b>, a supporting structure <b>327</b>, and at least a capacitor structure <b>333</b>. The substrate <b>302</b> has a plurality of capacitor disposing regions <b>304</b> defined thereon, and the capacitor disposing regions <b>304</b> are preferably rectangles and arranged in an array. The capacitor disposing regions <b>304</b> also can be designed to be other shapes, such as circular shape, based on different requirements. A supporting region <b>306</b> is defined on a portion of the substrate <b>302</b> where no capacitor disposing region <b>304</b> is located. The supporting structure <b>327</b> is formed on the substrate <b>302</b> within the supporting region <b>306</b>, and the supporting structure <b>327</b> includes a plurality of vertical hollow cylinders <b>329</b> and a horizontal supporting layer <b>331</b> connected to a bottom of each vertical hollow cylinder <b>329</b>. Each vertical hollow cylinder <b>329</b> is vertically extended from the horizontal supporting layer <b>331</b>, and a central axis of each vertical hollow cylinder <b>329</b> is substantially perpendicular to a horizontal plane of the substrate <b>302</b>. Also, each vertical hollow cylinder <b>329</b> surrounds the corresponding capacitor disposing region <b>304</b>. The capacitor structure <b>333</b> is formed on the substrate <b>302</b> within each capacitor disposing region <b>304</b>, and is correspondingly disposed on an interior surface of each vertical hollow cylinder <b>329</b>. In other words, the vertical hollow cylinder <b>329</b> surrounds each capacitor structure <b>333</b> so as to support each capacitor structure <b>333</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which schematically illustrates a cross-sectional view of the capacitor structure along line AA&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the storage capacitor <b>300</b> of the present invention further includes a first conductive layer <b>330</b>, a dielectric layer <b>334</b>, and a second conductive layer <b>336</b> disposed on the substrate <b>302</b> (for the sake of clear illustration, the first conductive layer <b>330</b>, the dielectric layer <b>334</b>, and the second conductive layer <b>336</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The first conductive layer <b>330</b>, the dielectric layer <b>334</b>, and the second conductive layer <b>336</b> located in each capacitor disposing region <b>304</b> constitute the capacitor structure <b>333</b>. The first conductive layer <b>330</b> serves as a first capacitor electrode <b>335</b>, the dielectric layer <b>334</b> serves as a capacitor dielectric layer <b>337</b>, and the second conductive layer <b>336</b> serves as a second capacitor electrode <b>339</b>. It is noted that the first conductive layer <b>330</b> located on the intersectional regions (region B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between each capacitor disposing regions <b>304</b> and the supporting region <b>306</b> is discontinuous without linkage, so that the first conductive layer <b>330</b> located in each capacitor disposing regions <b>304</b> is not electrically connected to the first conductive layer <b>330</b> located in the supporting region <b>306</b>. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a low-k dielectric layer <b>338</b> and a metal layer <b>340</b> are disposed on the second conductive layer <b>336</b> (for sake of clear illustration, the low-k dielectric layer <b>338</b> and the metal layer <b>340</b> are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A preferred thickness of the low-k dielectric layer <b>338</b> is substantially smaller than a height of the second conductive layer <b>336</b>, so that the metal layer <b>340</b> can be electrically connected to the second conductive layer <b>336</b>. In an embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of storage node contacts <b>310</b> are disposed in the substrate <b>302</b>. Each storage node contact <b>310</b> is extended downward so as to electrically connect to an access transistor (not shown), and extended upward so as to electrically connect to each capacitor structure <b>333</b>. Accordingly, different capacitor structures <b>333</b> can be accessed by different access transistors and the storage node contacts <b>310</b> electrically connected thereto.</p>

In the lithography process, the light transmissive regions <b>322</b> are orientated corresponding to each capacitor disposing region <b>304</b>, so that the photoresist layer <b>318</b> located in each capacitor disposing region <b>304</b> is exposed by light, and the photoresist layer <b>318</b> located in the supporting region <b>306</b> is not exposed by the light. Next, a developing process is performed to remove the photoresist layer <b>318</b> located in the supporting region <b>306</b>.

The second sacrificial layer <b>328</b> is formed on the material layer <b>326</b>. In this preferred embodiment of the present invention, the material layer <b>326</b> is a carbon layer with electrical neutrality, which provides preferable hardness and rigidity. The second sacrificial layer <b>328</b> is a material layer, such as a spin-on glass (SOG) layer, a bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC) layer or a photoresist layer, with good gap filling ability, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a planarization process, such as an etch back process, is performed to remove the material layer <b>326</b> located in each capacitor disposing region <b>304</b>, i.e. the material layer <b>326</b> located at a top of each sacrificial cylinder <b>324</b>.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It can be seen from the aforementioned descriptions that a capacitor structure and a fabrication method thereof are provided in the present invention. The storage capacitor of the present invention has particular supporting structure, and therefore is not only disposed on the exterior surface of each capacitor structure, but also entirely supports sidewalls of each capacitor structure. Thus, the product yield of the storage capacitor can be promoted. In accordance with an embodiment, the supporting structure includes a carbon layer with electrical neutrality, which provides preferable supporting strength. In accordance with another embodiment, the low-k dielectric layer disposed in the storage capacitor can reduce the capacitive coupling effect between the metal layer and the capacitor structure. Additionally, according to conventional method of fabricating storage capacitor, a plurality of concavities are formed in advance, and then the capacitor structures are formed in the concavities. In the present invention, a plurality of sacrificial cylinders are formed in advance, and then the supporting structure and the capacitor structures are formed by utilizing the sacrificial cylinders. The sacrificial cylinders are formed by a negative photoresist layer with a mask (please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), which is the same as the prior art, and therefore needs not to be replaced.</p>
