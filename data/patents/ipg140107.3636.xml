The entirety of the above-mentioned patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of specification.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">I. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electronic component and an assembled circuit using the same; and more particularly, the present invention relates to an electronic component and an assembled circuit that can improve power density of a power supply as a whole by reducing an overall size of the electronic component.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">II. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nowadays with the development of the power supply technologies, requirements on the power density and the size of a power supply are more and more critical. There exists a variety of methods for increasing the power density of a power supply, among which a popular method is to increase the power density of a power supply by altering some electrical characteristics of the power supply. For example, an operating frequency of the converter may be increased significantly to shrink the sizes of some passive components (e.g., an inductor) in expectation of an improved power density. However, there also exists many factors that have the influence on the power density and the efficiency of a converter, for example, sizes of individual components, the structural design of the converter as a whole and the like. Hereinafter, a point of load (POL) DC to DC converter, which is one kind of DC-DC voltage converter, will be described for illustration purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram of a POL DC to DC converter, which is a buck converter herein. The POL DC to DC converter <b>1</b> comprises an inductor <b>11</b>, two switch elements <b>12</b>, <b>15</b> (e.g., Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs)), an output capacitor <b>13</b> and a control chip <b>14</b>. The control chip <b>14</b> is configured to receive an output feedback signal and an associated voltage adjustment control signal Vadj to control the operation of the POL DC to DC converter <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrate a top view and a bottom view of a conventional POL DC to DC converter respectively. The conventional POL DC to DC converter <b>2</b> is packaged in a form of an assembled circuit, with conventional through-hole pins being adopted for both input and output pins thereof. As shown, the POL DC to DC converter <b>2</b> comprises a control chip <b>21</b>, a circuit board <b>22</b>, four input/output (I/O) capacitors <b>23</b>, a number of through-hole pins <b>24</b>, a magnetic component (an inductor here) <b>25</b> and two switch elements <b>27</b>. The control chip <b>21</b> and the output capacitors <b>23</b> are disposed on one side of the carrier <b>22</b> which is usually a printed circuit board (PCB), while the magnetic element <b>25</b> and the two switch elements <b>27</b> are disposed on the other side of the circuit board <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The POL DC to DC converter <b>2</b> is plugged into a main circuit board (not shown) via the number of through-hole pins <b>24</b>. However, the through-hole pins <b>24</b> occupy a certain area on a surface of the circuit board <b>22</b>. Furthermore, the supporting effect of the pins <b>24</b> causes a certain thickness of the circuit board <b>22</b>. These inevitably increase the volume of the POL DC to DC converter <b>2</b> and further lowers the overall power density thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A top view and a bottom view of another conventional POL DC to DC converter are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> respectively. This conventional POL DC to DC converter <b>3</b> is packaged in another form of an assembled circuit, with wave pins being adopted for both input and output pins thereof. In this example, the pins are soldered onto a surface of the circuit board. As shown, the POL DC to DC converter <b>3</b> comprises three capacitors <b>31</b> (including output capacitors and/or input capacitors), a switch element <b>32</b>, a plurality of wave pins <b>33</b>, a carrier <b>34</b>, a magnetic component <b>35</b> and a control chip <b>36</b>. The capacitors <b>31</b>, the switch element <b>32</b> and the magnetic component <b>35</b> are disposed on one side of the carrier <b>34</b> which is usually a PCB, while the control chip <b>36</b> is disposed on the other side of the carrier <b>34</b>. The POL DC to DC converter <b>3</b> is connected to a main circuit board (not shown) via the wave pins <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, apart from occupying a certain area on the circuit board <b>34</b>, the wave pins <b>33</b> also present a certain height. All these contribute to an increased volume and a decreased power density of the POL DC to DC converter <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In summary, the conventional POL DC to DC converters all suffer from the oversized overall volume and the low power density due to the pin arrangement in the conventional package. Therefore, it is highly desirable in the art to provide a novel assembled circuit adapted to improve the power density and shrink the overall size of an electronic apparatus and particularly a voltage converter, thereby to overcome the aforesaid problems.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">To effectively improve the power density and shrink the overall dimensions of an electronic apparatus, particularly a power converter, this invention provides a novel pin scheme adapted to be widely used in a variety of common electronic apparatuses. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>C and <b>4</b>B, <b>4</b>D, top views and bottom views of an inductive component <b>62</b> in accordance with a first embodiment of this invention are illustrated respectively therein. More specifically, the inductive component <b>62</b> may be an inductor, and in practical application, may be a co-fired magnetic material inductor or a wire wound compressed inductor. It should be noted that, the inductive component <b>62</b> in this embodiment is only for purpose of illustration, and in practice, the technology disclosed in this invention may be applied to other electronic component such as a field-effect transistor (FET).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As one of the characteristics of this invention, an outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> is wrapped with a first conductive layer <b>61</b> on an outer surface thereof. The first conductive layer <b>61</b> has a connecting conductor <b>40</b> and a pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032;. The connecting conductor <b>40</b> wraps a first surface of the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>, while the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032; wraps a second outer surface of the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>. The pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032; acts as pins of the inductive component <b>62</b>, e.g., as pins of an inductor. When this invention is applied to other electronic component such as an FET, the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032; may act as a gate, a source or a drain of the FET. The inductive component <b>62</b> by itself is connected to external circuits via the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032;. In this embodiment, the first surface comprises several areas of the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>, including a portion of a side surface, a portion of a top surface and a portion of a bottom surface. The second surface comprises several other areas of the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>, including other portions of the side surface and other portions of the top surface. The surface oriented upwards in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is defined as the top surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>, while the surface oriented upwards in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is defined as the bottom surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Areas of the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> covered by the first surface and the second surface recited above and corresponding aspects depicted in the figures are only for purpose of illustration, rather than to limit the scope of this invention. In practical applications, areas belonged to the first surface or the second surface may be optionally adjusted according to practical requirements. Additionally, it should be noted that, the connecting conductor <b>40</b> on the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> has at least a portion thereof isolated from the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032;, i.e., no direct physical and electrical connection exists on the outer surface between at least a portion of the connecting conductor <b>40</b> and the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032;. More specifically, only when the inductive component <b>62</b> is connected with other electronic components or a circuit board, will the connecting conductor <b>40</b> have at least a portion thereof or total electrically connected with the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032; indirectly via the other electronic components or the circuit board. In other aspects, the connecting conductor <b>40</b> on the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> may be entirely isolated from the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032;, i.e., no direct physical and electrical connection exists on the outer surface between the entire connecting conductor <b>40</b> and the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032;. More specifically, only when the inductive component <b>62</b> is connected with other electronic components or a circuit board, will the connecting conductor <b>40</b> as a whole be electrically connected with the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032; indirectly via the other electronic components or the circuit board. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, <b>4</b>C and <b>4</b>D together. In this embodiment, the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032; has two pins <b>41</b>, <b>45</b> disposed at two ends respectively on the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>. The pins <b>41</b>, <b>45</b> act as pins of the inductive component <b>62</b> to electrically connect the inductive component <b>62</b> with any other components or carriers (e.g., a circuit board). Furthermore, the connecting conductor <b>40</b> may be designed in various forms according to practical requirements. In this embodiment, the connecting conductor <b>40</b> has a number of different conductor regions <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> wrapping and attaching on the first surface of a body of the inductive component <b>62</b>. For instance, the conductor regions <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> act as power pins to connect to e.g. an FET switch, and the conductor regions <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> act as signal pins to connect to e.g. a control IC. The conductor region <b>43</b> acting as a power pin has a large area and is spaced apart from the other conductor regions <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> by a small spacing, so that the top surface (i.e., the surface oriented upwards in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>) of the inductive component <b>62</b> is covered almost entirely by the conductor regions <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> of the connecting conductor <b>40</b>. As previously described, the connecting conductor <b>40</b> on the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> has at least a portion thereof isolated from the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032;, i.e., no direct physical and electrical connection exists on the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> between at least a portion of the connecting conductor <b>40</b> and the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032;. More specifically, only when the inductive component <b>62</b> is connected with other electronic components or a circuit board, will the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032; be electrically connected with the surface of at least a portion or total of the connecting conductor <b>40</b> indirectly via the other electronic components or the circuit board. Therefore, no direct electrical connection exists on the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> between portions of the conductor regions <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> and the pins <b>41</b>, <b>45</b> of the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032;. Such a pin design of a large area may not only help to substantially enlarge a heat dissipation area of the first electronic component (i.e., the inductor) <b>62</b>, but may also effectively improve the heat dissipation performance of an electronic apparatus as a whole (e.g., a power converter) using the inductive component <b>62</b>. Typically, the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032; of the first conductive layer <b>61</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is made prior to the formation of the connecting conductor <b>40</b>. Taking a wire wound inductor <b>140</b> as an example of the inductive component <b>62</b>, a schematic diagram of the inductor <b>140</b> and a process for producing the pin conductor <b>40</b>&#x2032; of the inductor <b>140</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> are a top view and a bottom view of an inductor made of a powder core through e.g. a compressing process; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> depicts a profile of the inductor before coil pins are bent, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref> depicts a structure of the coil inside the inductor. In more detail, the inductor <b>140</b> comprises a magnetic material portion <b>141</b> and an internal metal coil <b>142</b>, with two ends of the internal metal coil <b>142</b> stretching out of the magnetic material portion <b>141</b> becoming the pin conductors <b>143</b> respectively. By wrapping the internal metal coil <b>142</b> with the power and compressing them together, the inductor <b>140</b> comes into being, and the pin conductors <b>143</b> at both ends of the internal metal coil <b>142</b> are bent and attached onto a second surface of the inductor <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">On the other hand, the connecting conductor <b>40</b> of the first conductive layer <b>61</b> in this embodiment may be formed on an outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> in two primary methods. One method is to form the connecting conductor <b>40</b> onto a body surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> directly, and the second is to form the connecting conductor <b>40</b> independently before fixing it onto the first surface of the body of the inductive component <b>62</b>. This will be detailed hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, a specific method to form the connecting conductor <b>40</b> onto a body surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> directly may comprise the following steps: initially, a layer of conductive material such as copper is formed on the body surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> through a surface metallization process such as a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or a physical vapor deposition (PVD), e.g., by evaporating, sputtering, or spraying a conductive material. Then, the conductive layer is exposed to light, patterned and developed to form the connecting conductor <b>40</b> on the first surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5E</figref>, the second method to form the first conductive layer <b>61</b> on a body surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> may be implemented in the following two ways. In a first way, a frame <b>51</b> comprising the first conductive layer <b>61</b> is made independently at first, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the frame <b>51</b> is put into a mold for producing the inductive component <b>62</b> during a process of producing the inductive component <b>62</b>, and then compressed into an outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> during a compressing process. After that, an excessive portion of the frame <b>51</b> is cut away and the remaining portion forms the first conductive layer <b>61</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. Then the first conductive layer <b>61</b> is bent in such a way that it wraps the first surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>. Finally, an integrated structure <b>53</b> with a complete wrapped layer is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a second way, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the first conductive layer <b>61</b> of the frame <b>51</b> is adhered to the first surface of the inductive component <b>62</b> through a kind of the adhesive e.g. a thermosetting adhesive. Subsequently, the frame <b>51</b> is bent in such a way that the first conductive layer <b>61</b> wraps the first surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>. Finally, by performing a thermal process to thermoset the adhesive, the first conductive layer <b>61</b> is fixedly wrapped onto the first surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>, thus an integrated structure <b>53</b> with a complete wrapped layer is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, in the integrated structure <b>53</b> obtained by the aforesaid method of this invention, a maximum spacing between the first conductive layer <b>61</b> and the inductive component <b>62</b> is less than 0.3 mm which is good to the thermal conduction performance, small volume or easy application of the production method such as a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or a physical vapor deposition. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5D and 5E</figref> illustrate a bottom view and a top view respectively of the integrated structure <b>53</b> where the frame <b>51</b> is bent to wrap the inductive component <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C, a particular application of the first embodiment of this invention is illustrated therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate a top view and a bottom view of a DC to DC converter respectively, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> illustrates a top view of an assembled circuit incorporating this DC to DC converter. The aforesaid inductive component <b>62</b> having large-area pins is applied in the DC to DC converter <b>60</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, and the DC to DC converter <b>60</b> may be e.g. a point of load (POL) buck converter. The assembled circuit <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> is a circuit structure adopting the DC to DC converter <b>60</b>, and will be described in detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown, the assembled circuit <b>4</b> in this embodiment comprises a first and a second carrier for supporting electronic components, e.g., a first circuit board <b>69</b> and a second circuit board <b>63</b>.

In this embodiment, the inductive component <b>62</b>, the first electronic component <b>66</b>, the second electronic components <b>64</b>, <b>65</b>, and the third electronic components <b>67</b>, <b>68</b> are an inductor, a control chip, capacitors and FETs respectively.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Since the conductor regions <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> of the connecting conductor <b>40</b> of the inductive component <b>62</b> are distributed on the outer surface of the inductive component <b>62</b>, the DC to DC converter <b>60</b> is adapted to be electrically connected with the first circuit board <b>69</b> via the conductor regions <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> of the connecting conductor <b>40</b> of the inductive component <b>62</b>. As a result, when being installed onto the first circuit board <b>69</b>, the DC to DC converter <b>60</b> occupies less space on the first circuit board <b>69</b>. On the other hand, since when the DC to DC converter <b>60</b> is installed onto the first circuit board <b>69</b>, it is the body of the inductive component <b>62</b> not the circuit board <b>63</b> that serves the mechanical support for the entire DC to DC converter <b>60</b>, thus in practical use the thickness needed of the second circuit board <b>63</b> can be remarkably reduced. In this way, a space saving is achieved in the DC to DC converter <b>60</b> and even in the assembled circuit <b>4</b> as a whole, which effectively improves the power density of the DC to DC converter <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Additionally, as the first electronic component <b>66</b> and the third electronic components <b>67</b>, <b>68</b> are the main heat-generating components, the overall heat dissipation performance of the DC to DC converter <b>60</b> can be enhanced by dissipating heat from the pin <b>66</b><i>a </i>of the first electronic component <b>66</b> and the pins <b>67</b><i>a</i>, <b>68</b><i>a </i>of the third electronic components <b>67</b>, <b>68</b> to the ambient through the first conductive layer <b>61</b> and the thinner second circuit board <b>63</b> which has better thermal conduction performance.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The above description relates to a practical application of this invention, which may vary according to practical requirements. For example, a second embodiment of this invention to be described applies the similar structure to an assembled circuit of a DC to DC converter <b>70</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that, the second electronic components <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> of the first embodiment are electrically connected at first to the second circuit board <b>63</b> and then electrically connected to the connecting conductor <b>40</b> of the first conductive layer <b>61</b> via the second circuit board <b>63</b>; in contrast, the second electronic components <b>72</b>, <b>73</b> of the second embodiment make a physical and electrical connection directly with the connecting conductor <b>71</b> on an outer surface of the inductive component <b>74</b>. More specifically, the second electronic components <b>72</b>, <b>73</b> are mounted directly onto the connecting conductor <b>71</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. A perspective view illustrating a structure of the DC to DC converter <b>70</b> connected in the aforementioned way is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It should be noted that, this embodiment adopts a structure where the first conductive layer <b>71</b> wraps a surface of the first electronic component (i.e., an inductor) <b>74</b>. However, in other examples of this embodiment, the first conductive layer <b>71</b> may instead be wrapped on a surface of the first electronic component (not shown) or the third electronic component (not shown) previously described, and then the second electronic components (i.e., capacitors) <b>72</b>, <b>73</b> are attached directly onto the first conductive layer <b>71</b> that wraps the surface of the first electronic component or the third electronic component. This may accomplish the same goal as that described above of improving the power density and shrinking the volume.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11G</figref> illustrate a third embodiment of this invention, which also relates to an assembled circuit applied to a DC to DC converter, and particularly a POL DC to DC converter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> illustrate a top view and a bottom view of the POL DC to DC converter <b>110</b> respectively. The POL DC to DC converter <b>110</b> adopts an inductor made of a co-fired magnetic material as a substrate. The POL DC to DC converter <b>110</b> comprises an inductive component, a first conductive layer <b>112</b>, two second electronic components, a fourth electronic component and an inductance coil <b>116</b>. In this embodiment, the inductive component is formed by stacking a number of co-fired magnetic material substrates <b>111</b> together, the second electronic components are capacitors <b>114</b>, and the fourth electronic component is an integrated circuit (IC) <b>115</b> integrating e.g. an FET (particularly an MOSFET) and a control chip together. As previously described, the first conductive layer <b>112</b> comprises a connecting conductor and a pin conductor. In this embodiment, the connecting conductor has four pins <b>118</b> and a conductor <b>113</b> connected therewith, and the pin conductor has two pins <b>117</b> and a conductor <b>113</b> connected therewith. The first conductive layer <b>112</b> wraps a first surface of the outer surface of the stacked co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b>. The first surface comprises a top surface, a bottom surface and side surfaces. More specifically, the side surfaces are wrapped by the conductors <b>113</b>. The first conductive layer <b>112</b> on the top surface provides electrical connections between the capacitors <b>114</b>, the IC <b>115</b> and the like. When being mounted onto a carrier (which is a main circuit board here and not shown), the assembled circuit may be electrically connected with the carrier via the first conductive layer <b>112</b> of the bottom surface. On the other hand, the conductors <b>113</b> wrapping the side surfaces function to electrically connect the first conductive layer <b>112</b> on the top surface with that on the bottom surface.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In more detail, the co-fired magnetic material inductor <b>111</b> is formed by sintering multiple layers of magnetic material together, which is a process similar to the low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>, the inductance coil <b>116</b> comprises a plurality of connecting conductive elements <b>119</b>, which are formed in the following way. At first, a number of through-holes are formed in each middle magnetic material layer in such a way that corresponding through-holes on these layers will substantially superposed with each other after the magnetic material layers are stacked together in parallel. In a similar way, a number of semi-circular through-holes are formed at two opposite sides of each magnetic material layer, and are filled with a metal material such as silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), gold (Au) or copper (Cu) to form the connecting conductive elements <b>119</b> and the pins <b>117</b>, <b>118</b> of the inductance coil <b>116</b>. A number of conductors are made on a top surface of the uppermost magnetic material layer and a bottom surface of the lowermost magnetic material layer, with each of the conductors connecting two through-holes in the magnetic material layer. Finally, the multiple magnetic material layers are laminated together to form the inductance coil <b>116</b> and a portion of the first conductive layer <b>113</b>, with the inductance coil <b>116</b> being electrically connected to the pins <b>117</b> of the pin conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Subsequently, a magnetic material layer is stacked on or an insulation material layer is applied to each of the top surface and the bottom surfaces of the completed inductor. Then, semi-circular through-holes are formed in the magnetic material layers or the insulation material layers and filled with a metal material to form the co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b>. A first conductive layer <b>112</b> is formed on a surface of the co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b> to connect with electronic components (e.g., the capacitors <b>114</b> and the IC <b>115</b> having an FET and a control chip integrated together) mounted on the substrate <b>111</b>. Thus, a complete POL DC to DC converter <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> is formed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> is a schematic view of the co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b> and the first conductive layer <b>112</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> is a schematic view of the co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b>, with its first layer removed to show the electrical connection between the inductance coil <b>116</b> inside the co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b> and the pins. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref> is a perspective view illustrating an internal structure corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>. The winding direction of the inductance coil <b>116</b> is visible in this figure, and it is clear that the pins <b>117</b> are connected with the inductance coil <b>116</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref> is a schematic view illustrating internal circuits of the co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b> other than the first layer, the second layer and the last layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11G</figref> is a schematic view of the last circuit layer in the co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b>. It can be seen from these figures that, the connecting conductor on the outer surface of the co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b> are at least partially or entirely isolated from the pin conductor, i.e., there exists no direct physical and electrical connection on the outer surface between at least a portion or the entirety of the connecting conductor and the pin conductor. More specifically, at least a portion or the entirety of the connecting conductor is indirectly connected with the pin conductor. That is, only when the co-fired magnetic material substrate <b>111</b> is stacked with other electronic components such as the capacitors <b>114</b> and the IC <b>115</b> thereon, will the pin <b>118</b> of the connecting conductor be electrically connected with the pin <b>117</b> of the pin conductor indirectly via the other electronic components.</p>

The input/output (I/O) terminals for electrical signals of the POL DC to DC converter, i.e., pins of the POL DC to DC converter are disposed on the bottom surface of the inductor, which are adapted to be soldered onto a circuit board (i.e., the first carrier in the previous embodiments). Both the top and the bottom surfaces of the inductor are connected via conductors of the first conductive layer. It should be emphasized that, if such electronic components such as capacitors and resistors are integrated in the POL DC to DC converter, it will be more advantageous for alleviating influence imposed by parasitic parameters inside the POL DC to DC converter, thus resulting in better electrical performance.</p>
