<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2009-0009790, filed on Feb. 6, 2009, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention relates to a motor, the structure of which is improved to prevent cut-off of magnet wire connection parts due to corrosion caused by a potential difference and damage to a magnet wire film, and a washing machine having the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, drum washing machines are apparatuses that wash laundry using frictional force between a drum rotated by the driving force of a motor and the laundry under the condition that detergent, washing water, and the laundry are put into the drum. These drum washing machines scarcely cause damage to the laundry and tangling of the laundry.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The drum washing machines are divided into an indirect connection type, in which the driving force of a motor is indirectly transmitted to a drum through a belt wound on a motor pulley and a drum pulley, and a direct connection type, in which the driving force of a motor is directly transmitted to a drum by directly connecting a BLDC motor to a tub, according to driving methods.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A motor to drive a drum washing machine includes a stator and a rotor, and the rotor is rotated by electromagnetic interaction with the stator.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A magnet wire is wound on the stator, and the rotor is rotated against the stator by applying current to the magnet wire.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The magnet wire, which is generally made of copper, is wound on the stator. The reason copper is used is because copper has both excellent electrical conductivity and excellent ductility and thus is scarcely damaged when the magnet wire made of copper is wound on the stator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, copper has a high price, and thus the production cost of the motor is increased. Further, international demand for copper has suddenly risen, and there are many cases that stable demand and supply of a raw material is not carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, many attempts to reduce the production cost of the motor using a coil made of materials other than copper have been made. Particularly, an attempt to replace copper (Cu) having a high price with aluminum (Al) having a low price has been vigorously made.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, when a magnet wire made of aluminum is used, the corrosion of the magnet wire due to a potential difference is increased and the tensile strength and the hardness of the magnet wire are decreased, compared with the magnet wire made of copper. Therefore, cut-off of mag mate terminal regions, to which the magnet wire is connected, is generated due to corrosion caused by the potential difference, and a magnet wire film is damaged.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, it is an aspect of the present embodiment to provide a motor, which prevents cut-off of magnet wire connection parts due to corrosion caused by a potential difference and damage to a magnet wire film, and a washing machine having the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiment, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a longitudinal-sectional view of a washing machine in accordance with an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the washing machine in accordance with the embodiment includes a case <b>10</b> forming an external appearance of the washing machine, a tub <b>11</b> installed in the case <b>10</b> to store washing water, a drum <b>18</b> rotatably installed in the tub <b>11</b>, and a motor <b>300</b> to drive the drum <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">An opening <b>19</b>, through which laundry is put into the washing machine, is formed through the front surface of the case <b>10</b>, and is opened and closed by a door <b>13</b> rotatably installed on the case <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Lifters <b>12</b> to raise the laundry in the drum <b>18</b> to a designated position are installed on the inner circumferential surface of the drum <b>18</b>, and a plurality of through holes <b>21</b> is formed through the circumferential surface of the drum <b>18</b> such that the washing water is discharged from the drum <b>18</b> through the through holes <b>21</b> in a washing course, such as dehydrating.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A water supply hose <b>17</b> to supply water from an external water source to the inside of the tub <b>11</b>, and a detergent supply device <b>14</b>, into which a detergent is placed such that the water supplied through the water supply hose <b>17</b> and the detergent are fed into the tub <b>11</b>, are installed above the tub <b>11</b>. A drain hose <b>16</b> and a drain pump <b>15</b> are installed below the tub <b>11</b> such that the washing water used in washing and rinsing is discharged to the outside of the washing machine.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The motor <b>300</b> mounted on the rear surface of the tub <b>11</b> is connected to the drum <b>18</b> through a rotary shaft <b>25</b>, and thus rotates the drum <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The motor <b>300</b> includes a stator <b>100</b> mounted on the rear surface of the tub <b>11</b>, and a rotor <b>200</b> rotated by electromagnetic interaction with the stator <b>100</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the stator <b>100</b> includes a stator core <b>110</b>, an upper insulator <b>120</b>, a lower insulator <b>130</b>, and the magnet wire <b>180</b> wound on the insulators <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The stator core <b>110</b> includes a ring-shaped base <b>111</b>, and teeth <b>112</b> protruding outwardly in the radial direction along the outer circumferential surface of the base <b>111</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an outer rotor type motor, in which the rotor <b>200</b> is provided at the outside of the stator core <b>110</b>. On the other hand, the teeth <b>112</b> may protrude inwardly in the radial direction along the inner circumferential surface of the base <b>111</b>. In this case, the stator may be a stator of an inner rotor type motor.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The stator core <b>110</b> may be formed by punching and stacking steel sheets. In order to reduce raw material waste and simplify a working process, the stator core <b>110</b> may be a spiral core formed by bending the band-shaped base <b>111</b> and the teeth <b>112</b> perpendicularly protruded from the base <b>111</b> into a spiral shape.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Calking parts <b>113</b> to integrally connect respective layers of the base <b>111</b> are formed on the stacked ring-shaped base <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The magnet wire <b>180</b> is wound on the teeth <b>112</b> protruding outwardly in the radial direction of the base <b>111</b>. However, since the teeth <b>112</b> are generally made of a conductive material, the insulators <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> for insulation are provided between the teeth <b>112</b> and the magnet wire <b>180</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the stator <b>100</b> formed by respectively connecting the upper insulator <b>120</b> and the lower insulator <b>130</b> to the upper and lower parts of the stator core <b>110</b>. Differently from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a single insulator may be formed integrally with the stator core <b>110</b> by a method, such as insert injection molding.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Winding parts <b>121</b> and <b>131</b> are respectively formed on the upper insulator <b>120</b> and the lower insulator <b>130</b>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In order to prevent separation of the magnet wire <b>180</b> from the winding part units <b>121</b> and <b>13</b>, after the magnet wire <b>180</b> has been wound on the winding part units <b>121</b> and <b>131</b> formed by connecting the winding parts <b>121</b> of the upper insulator <b>120</b> and the winding parts <b>131</b> of the lower insulator <b>130</b>, coil winding ribs <b>122</b> are formed on the upper insulator <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">An insulator rib <b>123</b> is formed at the radial inside of the coil winding ribs <b>122</b> in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">An insulator rib <b>123</b> is formed on the lower insulator <b>130</b> as well as the upper insulator <b>120</b>. The insulator ribs <b>123</b> are formed to a designated height or greater, and thus prevent moisture within the insulators <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> from flowing toward the winding part units <b>121</b> and <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Connection parts <b>125</b> and <b>135</b> protruding in the radial direction are respectively formed at the insides of the insulator ribs <b>123</b>, and connection holes <b>126</b> and <b>136</b> to connect the stator <b>100</b> to the rear surface of the tub <b>11</b> are formed through the connection parts <b>125</b> and <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The connection holes <b>126</b> of the upper insulator <b>120</b> and the connection holes <b>136</b> of the lower insulator <b>130</b> are respectively connected to form connection hole units. Connection members (not shown), such as bolts, for example, respectively pass through the connection hole units, and are connected to grooves (not shown) formed on the rear surface of the tub <b>11</b>, thereby mounting the stator <b>100</b> on the tub <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The magnet wire <b>180</b> wound on the winding part units <b>121</b> and <b>131</b> of the stator <b>100</b> in accordance with the embodiment may be made of aluminum rather than copper. The reason to use aluminum rather than copper is because aluminum has a lower price than copper and equivalent electrical conductivity, but the magnet wire <b>180</b> is not limited thereto and may be made of various other metals.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a perspective view of the portion &#x201c;A&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a longitudinal-sectional view illustrating the connection state of the magnet wire <b>180</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and a magnetic wire mating terminal, which may include, for example, a MAG MATE &#xae; terminal <b>172</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, mag mate terminal receiving units <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>162</b><i>b</i>, and <b>162</b><i>c </i>are formed at the radial inside of the coil winding ribs <b>122</b> of the upper insulator <b>120</b>, and mag mate terminals <b>172</b><i>a</i>, <b>172</b><i>b</i>, <b>172</b><i>c </i>are respectively installed in the mag mate terminal receiving units <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>162</b><i>b</i>, and <b>162</b><i>c</i>. The mag mate terminal receiving units <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>162</b><i>b</i>, and <b>162</b><i>c </i>respectively include a first set of metal receiving parts <b>164</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>b</i>, and <b>164</b><i>c</i>, and a second set of metal receiving parts <b>165</b><i>a</i>, <b>165</b><i>b</i>, and <b>165</b><i>c</i>. The mag mate terminals <b>172</b><i>a</i>, <b>172</b><i>b</i>, <b>172</b><i>c </i>may be made of brass, and respectively include a first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c</i>, which are installed in the first set of metal receiving parts <b>164</b><i>a</i>, <b>164</b><i>b</i>, and <b>164</b><i>c</i>, and a second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c</i>, which are installed in the second set of metal receiving parts <b>165</b><i>a</i>, <b>165</b><i>b</i>, and <b>165</b><i>c</i>. As will be discussed later, an element made of material that is different from the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is connected with the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, while an element made of material that is the same as the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is connected with the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. Here, the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c </i>and the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c </i>are formed integrally. Lower portions of the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c </i>and lower portions of the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c </i>are connected such that current flows between the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c </i>and the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Ends of the magnet wires <b>180</b>, which may be made of aluminum, are connected to the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c</i>, and the remaining portions of the magnet wires <b>180</b> are wound on the winding part units <b>121</b> and <b>131</b>. The magnet wires <b>180</b> are made of a material that is different from that of the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>-<i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a sealing member <b>190</b> serving as an anti-corrosion member to prevent corrosion due to a potential difference is further formed at the connection portion between each of the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c </i>and the magnet wire <b>180</b>. The sealing member <b>190</b> surrounds the connection portion and thus seals the connection portion. By forming the sealing member <b>190</b>, it may be possible to prevent generation of electrolytes at the connection portion of the magnet wire <b>180</b> and each of the mag mate terminals <b>172</b><i>a</i>, <b>172</b><i>b</i>, and <b>172</b><i>c</i>. The sealing member <b>190</b> may be made of epoxy resin, synthetic resin, or bond, for example. Additionally, the sealing member <b>190</b> may be made of various materials, which may prevent the generation of the electrolyte. A power connector (not shown) is connected to the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c</i>. The power connector may be made of brass, which is the same material as that of the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c</i>. Thus, the power connector and the second set of metal connector parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are made from the same kind of material.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Since the mag mate terminals <b>172</b><i>a</i>, <b>172</b><i>b</i>, and <b>172</b><i>c </i>are separated into the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c </i>and the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c</i>, and the magnet wire <b>180</b>, which is made of a material differing from that of the mag mate terminals <b>172</b><i>a</i>, <b>172</b><i>b</i>, and <b>172</b><i>c</i>, i.e., made of aluminum, is connected to the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c</i>, the sealing members <b>190</b> are provided to prevent generation of the electrolytes on the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c</i>. Further, since the power connector, which is made of the same material as that of the mag mate terminals <b>172</b><i>a</i>, <b>172</b><i>b</i>, and <b>172</b><i>c</i>, i.e., made of brass, is connected to the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c</i>, there is no probability of electrolyte generation on the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c</i>, and thus the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c </i>do not require separate sealing treatment. That is, the problem generated when the magnet wire <b>180</b> is made of aluminum is solved by the improvement of the structure of the mag mate terminals <b>172</b><i>a</i>, <b>172</b><i>b</i>, and <b>172</b><i>c </i>(e.g., separating metal connection parts into a first set <b>174</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>which connects with a different type of material and a second set <b>175</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>which connects with the same type of material.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a perspective view of a portion &#x201c;B&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a longitudinal-sectional view taken along the line I-I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b </i>are formed at both corners of the upper surface of each of the winding parts <b>121</b> of the upper insulator <b>120</b>. Further, a groove <b>128</b> is formed between both bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b</i>. Bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b </i>and grooves <b>128</b> are also provided on the lower insulator <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Since the magnet wire <b>180</b> is made of aluminum, for example, instead of copper, the bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b </i>are employed. Compared with the magnet wire made of copper, the magnet wire <b>180</b> made of aluminum has a higher ductility and stretches well when the magnet wire <b>180</b> is wound on the insulators <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>, and thus the stretching portions of the magnet wire <b>180</b> become thin. Thereby, the magnet wire <b>180</b> made of aluminum has a high possibility of dent or damage to a film of the magnet wire <b>130</b> due to the contact with corners of the insulators <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>, and, if severely damaged, may be cut.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">However, when the bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b </i>are formed on the winding parts <b>121</b> and <b>131</b>, on which the magnet wire <b>180</b> is wound, there is no possibility of dent of the magnet wire <b>130</b> or damage to the film of the magnet wire <b>130</b> due to the gentle shape of the bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b</i>. That is, force caused by winding is conventionally concentrated on specific portions of the magnet wire <b>180</b> contacting the insulators <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>, but when the bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b </i>are formed, contact areas between the magnet wire <b>180</b> and the insulators <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> are increased, and thus force caused by winding is uniformly applied to the increased contact areas. Thus, it may be possible to prevent damage to the specific portions of the magnet wire <b>180</b>. Further, it may be possible to prevent the thinning of the specific portions of the magnetic wire <b>180</b> contacting the corners of the insulators <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When the winding part units <b>121</b> and <b>131</b> are formed by connecting the upper insulator <b>120</b> and the lower insulator <b>130</b> and the magnet wire <b>180</b> is wound on the winding part units <b>121</b> and <b>131</b>, the radius of curvature (R) of the bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b </i>is approximately 1.5 times to 5 times the diameter (d) of the magnet wire <b>180</b>. Further, the radius of curvature (R) of the bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b </i>may be about 2 times the diameter (d) of the magnet wire <b>180</b>. These bending parts <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b </i>start from the side surface of the winding part <b>121</b> and are smoothly extended to the groove <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The smaller the radius of curvature (R) is than the diameter (d) of the magnet wire <b>180</b>, the higher a cost reducing effect of the magnet wire <b>180</b>. However, the larger the radius of curvature (R) is than the diameter (d) of the magnet wire <b>180</b>, the higher a damage preventing effect of the magnet wire <b>180</b>. Therefore, the radius of curvature (R) may be about 2 times the diameter (d) of the magnet wire <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, the consumption amount of the magnet wire <b>180</b>, which does not interact with the stator core <b>110</b>, is reduced by forming the grooves <b>128</b> at the central portions of the winding parts <b>121</b> and <b>131</b>. That is, current flowing along the magnet wire <b>180</b> wound on the winding parts <b>121</b> and <b>131</b> causes interaction with the stator core <b>110</b> only within a designated distance between the magnet wire <b>180</b> and the stator core <b>110</b>, but does not cause interaction with the stator core <b>110</b> when the magnet wire <b>180</b> exceeds the designated distance with the stator core <b>110</b>. That is, a portion of the wound magnet wire <b>180</b>, which exceeds the designated distance with the stator core <b>110</b>, becomes an unnecessary portion. Therefore, the consumption amount of the unnecessary magnet wire <b>180</b> located at the central portions of the winding parts <b>121</b> and <b>131</b> is highly reduced by forming the grooves <b>128</b> on the winding parts <b>121</b> and <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Hereinafter, a process of operating a motor and a washing machine having the same in accordance with an embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A user opens the door <b>13</b> of the case <b>10</b> of the washing machine, puts laundry into the washing machine through the opening <b>19</b>, closes the door <b>13</b>, and operates the washing machine. When current is applied to the motor <b>300</b> according to a signal of a control unit (not shown), the motor <b>300</b> is operated and rotates the drum <b>18</b>, and thus washing and dehydrating courses are carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Here, the current applied to the motor <b>300</b> is supplied to the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c </i>of the mag mate terminals <b>172</b><i>a</i>, <b>172</b><i>b</i>, and <b>172</b><i>c </i>of the stator <b>100</b> through the power connector. Since the power connector and the second set of metal connection parts <b>175</b><i>a</i>, <b>175</b><i>b</i>, and <b>175</b><i>c </i>are made of the same kind of material, i.e., brass, for example, there is no possibility of corrosion generation due to a potential difference.

Here, since the first set of metal connection parts <b>174</b><i>a</i>, <b>174</b><i>b</i>, and <b>174</b><i>c </i>may be made of brass and the magnet wire <b>180</b> may be made of aluminum, i.e., different materials, there is a possibility of generation of corrosion due to a potential difference therebetween. However, generation of electrolytes is suppressed due to the presence of the sealing members <b>190</b>. When a rotating magnetic field is formed by applying current to the stator <b>100</b>, as described above, the rotor <b>200</b> is rotated along the stator <b>100</b>, and thus rotates the drum <b>18</b> connected to the rotor <b>200</b> by the rotary shaft <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As is apparent from the above description, in the motor and the washing machine having the same in accordance with an embodiment, the connection portions between the magnet wire and the mag mate terminals, which are made from different materials, are sealed, and thus electrolytes are not generated, and cut-off of the magnetic wire by corrosion due to a potential difference may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, the bending parts, the corners of which are rounded, are formed on the insulators, and thus damage to a film of the magnet wire or dent of the magnet wire may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, the grooves are formed on the central portions of the winding parts of the insulators, and thus the consumption amount of the magnet wire, which is unnecessarily wasted due to the increase of the distance of the magnet wire with the stator core, is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Although a few embodiments have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.</p>
