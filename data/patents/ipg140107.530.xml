<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a cleaning head for a surface cleaning apparatus. In one preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a cleaning head, which comprises a plurality of airflow passages extending between a front portion and a rear portion. In another preferred embodiment, a plurality of struts that are not surrounded by an exterior casing extend between a front portion and a rear portion, wherein one or more of the struts may define airflow passages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Surface cleaning apparatuses, such as vacuum cleaners, typically comprise a surface cleaning head, which engages a surface, such as floor, and draws in dirt. The surface cleaning head generally comprises a front portion having a dirty fluid inlet, and a rear portion connectable to the remainder of the surface cleaning apparatus. Fluid communication between the front portion and the rear portion is provided by an airflow passage. The airflow passage is provided in a housing or casing extending between the front portion and the rear portion, and which extends laterally across the entire surface cleaning head. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,003,196 to Wright.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one broad aspect, a cleaning head for a surface cleaning apparatus is provided. The cleaning head comprises a front portion having at least one dirty fluid inlet. The cleaning head further comprises a rear portion connectable to a surface cleaning apparatus and having at least one dirty fluid outlet. A plurality of struts extend between the front portion and the rear portion. At least one, preferably at least two, and more preferably all of the struts each comprise an airflow passage extending between the front portion and the rear portion. At least two adjacent, and more preferably all of the struts are at least partially spaced apart, and define an open area between the adjacent struts. When the cleaning head is positioned on a surface, the surface is visible through the open area.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments in accordance with this broad aspect may be advantageous because if an airflow passage becomes blocked or clogged, the remainder of the airflow passages may still provide fluid communication between the front portion and the rear portion. Therefore, if a blockage occurs in an airflow passage, the surface cleaning apparatus may remain operational.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, due to the plurality of struts and the open area therebetween, a cleaning head in accordance with this broad aspect may not require a structural housing enclosing the airflow passages. Therefore, the cleaning head may be lighter, and have reduced material costs as compared to a cleaning head comprising a housing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, in use, a cleaning head in accordance with this broad aspect may allow a user to view a relatively large portion of the surface being cleaned. That is, because a user may view the surface being cleaned through the open area between adjacent struts, the user may be able to see whether dirt or other material has been picked up with a pass of the surface cleaning head.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, the use of a plurality of air flow passages may decrease the back pressure in the air flow passage through the cleaning head since the minimum cross sectional area of the air flow passage may be increased. In conventional designs, a single passage is provided and the transverse cross sectional area is typically limited due to the passage having to be placed in a space between other components in the cleaning head, such as the suction motor, the brush drive motor and the like. The use of multiple passages enables a larger cumulative cross sectional area to be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with this broad aspect, there is provided a cleaning head for a surface cleaning apparatus, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(a) a front portion having at least one dirty fluid inlet;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(b) a rear portion connectable to a surface cleaning apparatus and having at least one dirty fluid outlet; and,</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">(c) a plurality of struts extending between the front portion and the rear portion, at least one of the struts comprises an air-flow passage extending between the front portion and the rear portion, and at least two adjacent struts being at least partially spaced apart and defining an open area between the adjacent struts;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">whereby when the cleaning head is positioned on a surface, the surface is visible through the open area.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments at least two of the struts each comprise an airflow passage extending between the front portion and the rear portion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the front portion has a longitudinally extending front chamber and each strut that defines an airflow passage comprises an intake portion in fluid communication with the longitudinally extending front chamber. In further embodiments, the intake portion of each strut that defines an airflow passage is spaced from the intake portion of at least one other strut. Such embodiments may be advantageous because relatively even suction may be provided across the front portion. Therefore, dirt may be drawn into the surface cleaning head from all regions of the front portion. This is particularly advantageous to improve edge cleaning if struts defining air flow passages are positioned adjacent the laterally opposed sides of the front chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments the rear portion has a longitudinally extending rear chamber and each strut that defines an airflow passage further comprises an outlet in fluid communication with the longitudinally extending rear chamber. In further embodiments, the outlet of each strut is spaced from the outlet of at least one other strut. The rear portion is preferably circular in transverse section. An advantage of this design is that the dirt suspended in the airflow stream will tend to be retained in the air as the airflow stream is redirected to the dirty fluid outlet. The outlet from the air flow passages in the struts to the rear chamber may be tangential to create a cyclonic flow in the rear chamber. Advantageously, the use of cyclonic action will permit the airflow stream to clean the sidewalls of the rear chamber and reduce the tendency of entrained material to settle out and clog the passage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, at least a portion of the longitudinally extending rear chamber is rotationally mounted in the cleaning head about a longitudinally extending axis. For example, a pivoting connector forming part of the rear chamber may be rotationally mounted to the surface cleaning head.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments the cleaning head comprises between 2 and 8 struts. In some embodiments the cleaning head comprises 4 struts. In any embodiment each strut preferably comprises an airflow passage. In further embodiments, the plurality of struts are arranged to define an M.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments at least some of the struts that define an airflow passage have a viewing portion with a visibility such that a user can view the interior thereof. In further embodiments, the portion is transparent. Such embodiments may be advantageous because, if a blockage occurs in an airflow passage, a user may be able to view the blockage, and therefore may be able to clear the blockage. The viewing portion is preferably provided on the lower surface of the struts. Accordingly, a user, who will typically only view the top surface of the cleaning head will be able to view a clean painted or finished surface of the cleaning head. If a clog occurs, a user may be alerted by an audio alert or otherwise as is known in the vacuum cleaner art. The user may then turn the cleaning head over to determine if the clog is in the cleaning head. It will be appreciated that the rear chamber may alternately or in addition also have a transparent viewing portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments at least one of the struts that defines an airflow passage is openable. In further embodiments, at least one of the struts that defines an airflow passage has a clean out port. In some embodiments, each strut that defines an airflow passage has a clean out port. Such embodiments may be advantageous because if a blockage occurs, a user may be able to easily clear the blockage. Alternately, all of the passage in the strut may be openable. For example, the strut may comprise an upper section and a lower section wherein one of the upper and lower sections is moveably (e.g. pivotally) or removably mounted to the other. The sections may be secured together by any means known in the art, such as set screws, a latch, clamp or the like. The mating surfaces of the sections may have a gasket or the like to provide an air tight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments the front portion comprises a rotatably mounted brush mounted in the longitudinally extending front chamber, and a brush drive motor is positioned in a housing external to the front portion, the rear portion and the struts.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the cleaning head has surface contacting members that define a plane, and at least some of the struts extend upwardly and rearwardly from the front portion to define a space between the at least some struts and the plane, and the housing for the brush drive motor is positioned in the space.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments the surface cleaning head further comprises rear wheels positioned rearwardly of the rear portion and the dirty fluid outlet. In a further embodiment, the dirty fluid outlet is rotationally mounted to an upright section of an upright vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another broad aspect, a cleaning head for a surface cleaning apparatus is provided. The cleaning head comprises a longitudinally extending front portion having at least one dirty fluid inlet. The cleaning head further comprises a longitudinally extending rear portion connectable to a surface cleaning apparatus and having at least one dirty fluid outlet. A plurality of airflow passages extend between the front portion and the rear portion. Each airflow passage has an inlet portion in flow communication with the front portion, and an outlet portion in flow communication with the rear portion. At least some of the inlet portions are connected to the longitudinally extending front portion at different locations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments in accordance with this broad aspect may be advantageous because if an airflow passage becomes blocked or clogged, the remainder of the airflow passages may still provide fluid communication between the front portion and the rear portion. Therefore, if a blockage occurs in an airflow passage, the surface cleaning apparatus may remain operational.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additionally, because at least some of the inlet portions are connected to the longitudinally extending front portion at different locations, relatively even suction may be provided across the front portion. Therefore, dirt may be drawn into the surface cleaning head from all regions of the front portion.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, the use of a plurality of air flow passages may decrease the back pressure in the air flow passage through the cleaning head since the minimum cross sectional area of the air flow passage may be increased. In conventional designs, a single passage is provided and the transverse cross sectional area is typically limited due the passage having to be placed in a space between other components in the cleaning head, such as the suction motor, the brush drive motor and the like. The use of multiple passages enables a larger cumulative cross sectional area to be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with this broad aspect, there is provided a cleaning head for a surface cleaning apparatus, comprising:</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, at least some of the outlet portions are connected to the longitudinally extending rear portion at different locations. In a further embodiment, the front portion has a longitudinally extending front chamber and the rear portion has a longitudinally extending rear chamber.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a surface cleaning apparatus <b>10</b> comprising an embodiment of a cleaning head <b>100</b> of the present invention is shown. In the embodiment shown, surface cleaning apparatus <b>10</b> is an upright vacuum cleaner comprising a cyclone <b>12</b>, a dirt bin <b>14</b>, a filter housing <b>16</b>, a motor <b>18</b>, and a handle <b>20</b>, which are mounted to a backbone <b>22</b>. Backbone <b>22</b> is tubular, and serves as an air-flow conduit between surface cleaning head <b>100</b>, and the remainder of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>10</b>. In other embodiments, surface cleaning apparatus <b>10</b> may be any other type of surface cleaning apparatus to which a cleaning head <b>100</b> of the present invention may be connectable, such as a canister type vacuum cleaner, a wet/dry vacuum cleaner, a central vacuum cleaner, a stick vac or a carpet extractor.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, cleaning head <b>100</b> comprises a front portion <b>102</b>, and a rear portion <b>104</b>. In the embodiment shown, front portion <b>102</b> comprises a longitudinally extending front chamber <b>106</b>, extending along axis <b>107</b>. Front chamber <b>106</b> comprises a top portion <b>108</b>, a bottom portion <b>110</b>, and two laterally opposed sides <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>. Front portion <b>102</b> comprises at least one dirty fluid inlet <b>115</b> preferably in a lower surface thereof (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), through which dirt, air, and/or other fluids are drawn into surface cleaning apparatus <b>10</b>. In the embodiment shown, the dirt inlet <b>115</b> is defined in bottom portion <b>110</b>, and extends across bottom portion <b>110</b> from side <b>112</b> to side <b>114</b>. In an alternate embodiment, dirt inlet <b>115</b> may be otherwise configured. For example, cleaning head <b>100</b> may comprise two laterally spaced dirt inlets in bottom portion <b>110</b>. Any configuration in the vacuum cleaner arts may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the embodiments shown, rear portion <b>104</b> comprises a longitudinally extending rear chamber <b>116</b>, extending along axis <b>117</b>. Rear chamber <b>116</b> has a dirty fluid outlet <b>118</b>. It will be appreciated that more than one dirty fluid outlet <b>118</b> may be provided. It will be appreciated that more than one rear chamber <b>116</b> may be provided. For example, two longitudinally extending rear chambers <b>116</b>, each extending part way across the rear of surface cleaning head <b>100</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the preferred embodiment, rear chamber <b>116</b> is round or circular in transverse section (i.e. transverse to axis <b>117</b>). In such embodiments, air or fluid passing through rear chamber <b>116</b> may travel in a swirling or cyclonic motion, which may cause the dirt suspended in the airflow stream to be retained in the air as the airflow stream is redirected to the dirty fluid outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Rear chamber <b>116</b> is connectable to the remainder of surface cleaning apparatus <b>10</b> to provide fluid communication between the surface cleaning head <b>100</b> and the remainder of surface cleaning apparatus <b>10</b> via dirty fluid outlet <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, rear portion <b>104</b> may be connectable to the remainder of surface cleaning apparatus <b>10</b> via a neck <b>120</b>, which is mountable to or in rear chamber <b>116</b> (as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Neck <b>120</b> may be connected to a hose (e.g. in the case of a canister or whole house vacuum cleaner or a carpet extractor) or a spine (e.g. in the case of an upright or stick vacuum cleaner). Accordingly, in the case of an upright vacuum cleaner, neck <b>120</b> may be connected to rear chamber <b>116</b> at one end, and mountable to backbone <b>22</b> at the other end. Neck <b>120</b> thereby provides fluid communication between rear chamber <b>116</b> and backbone <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, neck <b>120</b> may be configured to be rotatably mounted to backbone <b>22</b>, such that surface cleaning head <b>100</b> is rotatable relative to the upright portion of surface cleaning apparatus <b>10</b></p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Neck <b>120</b> is preferably pivotally mountable to rear chamber <b>116</b> by a pivoting connector <b>150</b>. In such a construction, an airtight connection is preferably provided such that no, or essentially no, air leaks into the airflow passage as neck <b>120</b> rotates. Accordingly, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, opposed ends <b>153</b> of the transverse portion <b>152</b> of pivoting connector <b>150</b> may comprise sealing members, for example O-rings <b>154</b>, positioned between pivoting connector <b>150</b> and the inner surface of rear portion <b>104</b>, to sealingly connect pivoting connector <b>150</b> to rear portion <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A plurality of struts <b>122</b> extends between front portion <b>102</b> and rear portion <b>104</b>. In the embodiment shown, cleaning head <b>100</b> comprises four struts <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>122</b><i>c</i>, and <b>122</b><i>d</i>. In other embodiments, other numbers of struts may be provided, for example between two and eight or more struts. In an embodiment wherein an outer casing is not provided to create a shell for the cleaning head (as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), then at least one, and preferably at least two of the struts <b>122</b> each comprise an airflow passage extending between front portion <b>102</b> and rear portion <b>104</b>. In an alternate embodiment (not shown) an outer casing may be provided surrounding the struts. For example, the cleaning head may comprise upper and lower clamshell housings surrounding the front and rear chambers and the struts. In such a case at least two of the struts comprise airflow passages.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The struts that are airflow passages comprise an intake portion <b>124</b> in fluid communication with front portion <b>102</b>, an outlet <b>126</b> in fluid communication with rear portion <b>104</b>, and a passage extending therebetween. In the embodiment shown, each of the four struts comprises an air-flow passage. In an alternate embodiment, only some, e.g., two, of the struts may comprise an airflow passage, and the remaining struts do not comprise an airflow passage. The remaining two struts, and preferably all struts, provide structural members to result in surface cleaning head <b>100</b> having sufficient structural strength to functions as a surface cleaning head. It will be appreciated that reinforcing members (e.g., tie rods an cross struts) may be optionally provided.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the preferred embodiment, wherein rear chamber <b>116</b> is round or circular in transverse section, one or more, and preferably each, of outlets <b>126</b> from the air flow passages in the struts <b>122</b> to the rear chamber <b>116</b> may be tangential to create a cyclonic flow in the rear chamber <b>116</b>. This may permit the airflow stream to clean the sidewalls of the rear chamber <b>116</b> and reduce the tendency of entrained material to settle out and clog the passage.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The struts <b>122</b> may have a variety of configurations and any desired configuration may be used. In the preferred embodiment, at least two adjacent struts <b>122</b> are at least partially spaced apart, and define an open area <b>128</b> between the adjacent struts.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>6</b>, the intake portion <b>124</b> of each of the struts <b>122</b> is spaced from the intake portions <b>124</b> of each other strut <b>122</b>. That is, the intake portions <b>124</b> are connected to front chamber <b>106</b> at different locations. Additionally, the intake portions <b>124</b> of struts <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>d </i>are provided adjacent opposed sides <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> of front chamber <b>106</b>, in order to provide improved edge cleaning by providing increased suction adjacent sides <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. Struts <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>d </i>are angled towards a central axis <b>127</b> of cleaning head <b>100</b>, and struts <b>122</b><i>b </i>and <b>122</b><i>c </i>are angled away from central axis <b>127</b> (when viewed in the rearward direction, namely from the front portion to the rear portion). Additionally, the outlet <b>126</b> of each strut <b>122</b> is spaced from the outlet <b>126</b> of each other strut <b>122</b>. That is, the outlets are connected to rear chamber <b>116</b> at different locations. The outlets of struts <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>, and struts <b>122</b><i>c </i>and <b>122</b><i>d </i>are substantially closer together than the outlets of struts <b>122</b><i>b </i>and <b>122</b><i>c</i>. This configuration of struts defines a shape similar to the letter M. In this embodiment, a substantially trapezoidal open space <b>128</b> is defined between struts <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>, between struts <b>122</b><i>b </i>and <b>122</b><i>c</i>, and between struts <b>122</b><i>c </i>and <b>122</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In alternate embodiments, the struts <b>122</b> may be otherwise configured. For example, each strut may be substantially parallel to central axis <b>127</b>, and may be equally spaced from each other, thereby defining rectangular open spaces. In another example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the intake portion <b>124</b> of each strut <b>122</b> may be spaced from the intake portion <b>124</b> of each other strut, and the outlets <b>126</b> of struts <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>may be substantially adjacent each other or at least partially conjoined. The outlets <b>126</b> of struts <b>122</b><i>c </i>and <b>122</b><i>c </i>may further be substantially adjacent each other or at least partially conjoined, and spaced from the outlets <b>126</b> of struts <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>. In this embodiment, the struts may define a shape similar to the letter M. In other embodiments, the intake portions <b>124</b> of some of the struts may be substantially adjacent each other or partially conjoined. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the intake portions <b>124</b> of struts <b>122</b><i>c </i>and <b>122</b><i>d </i>are conjoined. In another example, cleaning head <b>100</b> may comprise two struts which are bifurcated or substantially Y-shaped, such that they each have 2 intake portions <b>124</b>, and one outlet <b>126</b>. In this embodiment, a single hexagonal open space may be defined between the struts <b>122</b>. In other embodiments, the inlets of the struts may all be spaced apart (e.g., evenly paced along the front chamber) or spaced different distances apart or spaced adjacent each other. Alternately, or in addition, the outlets of the struts may all be spaced apart (e.g., evenly paced along the rear chamber) or spaced different distances apart or spaced adjacent each other. Accordingly, each strut <b>122</b> may independently be parallel to axis <b>127</b> or extend at an angle thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the embodiments shown, and as best exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, struts <b>122</b> are positioned and/or configured to provide an open area between struts <b>122</b> and surface <b>130</b>. For example, struts <b>122</b> preferably extend rearwardly and upwardly from front portion <b>102</b>. In alternate embodiments, struts may extend at other angles. For example, struts <b>122</b> may be parallel to surface <b>130</b>. Struts <b>122</b> may extend from an upper portion of the front portion to an upper part of the rear portion. Alternately, or in addition, as shown in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, each of the struts may be substantially straight. However, in alternate embodiments, one or more of the struts <b>122</b> may be curved or bent. For example, one or more of the struts may curve laterally towards or away from axis <b>127</b> and/or curve upwardly or downwardly. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, struts <b>122</b> extend rearwardly and upwardly from front portion to the rear portion. This configuration may be useful in embodiments wherein a brush drive motor is positioned underneath struts <b>122</b>, as will be described subsequently.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, when the cleaning head is positioned on a surface <b>130</b>, if no outer casing is provided or if an outer casing is transparent, then surface <b>130</b> is visible through one or more of the open area(s) <b>128</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, open areas <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>c </i>are substantially devoid of material, such that when the cleaning head <b>100</b> is positioned on surface <b>130</b>, the surface <b>130</b> is visible through open areas <b>128</b><i>a </i>and <b>128</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It will be appreciated that if cleaning head <b>100</b> is not provided with an outer casing, then struts <b>122</b> comprise, or may consist of, the structural members that secure front and rear sections <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> together. It will be appreciated that reinforcing members, e.g., metal tie rods and the like, may be provided to increase the structural integrity of cleaning head <b>100</b>. For example, in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, open area <b>128</b><i>b </i>is partially filled by a rib <b>132</b>, which extends between front portion <b>102</b> and rear portion <b>104</b>, for providing additional structural integrity to cleaning head <b>100</b>. Therefore, surface <b>130</b> is only partially visible through open area <b>128</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In other embodiments, open area(s) <b>128</b> may be otherwise configured. For example, in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, cleaning head <b>100</b> does not comprise a rib or other structural reinforcing member, and therefore surface <b>130</b> is equally visible through open areas <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b</i>, and <b>128</b><i>c</i>. In another example, a web of material may extend fully or partially across one or more open area(s) <b>128</b>, such that surface <b>130</b> is visible through only some of the open areas <b>128</b>, or through only a portion of each open area <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the preferred embodiment, at least some of the struts that define an airflow passage have at least a portion with a visibility such that a user can view the interior thereof. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, wherein each of the four struts <b>122</b> defines an airflow passage, the entirety of each strut <b>122</b> is transparent. Thus, if a blockage <b>134</b> occurs in one or more struts, a user may be able to view the blockage <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In alternate embodiments, only some of the struts may have a viewing portion with a visibility such that a user can view the interior thereof. Furthermore, in some embodiments, only a portion of each strut may be transparent. For example, a top surface of each strut may be transparent, and preferably, the lower surface. The viewing portion may be openable to remove a clog. Alternately, the openable portion need not be transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, one or both of front portion <b>102</b> and rear portion <b>104</b> may comprise a viewing portion with a visibility such that a user can view the interior thereof. For example, in the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, front chamber <b>106</b> comprises two transparent portions <b>136</b> in the top portion <b>108</b> thereof. Preferably, rear portion <b>104</b> has a viewing portion, preferably on a lower surface thereof, so that a user can determine if there is a blockage in rear chamber <b>116</b>. The viewing portion may be openable to remove a clog. Alternately, the openable portion need not be transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the preferred embodiment, transparent portions of cleaning head <b>100</b> are fabricated from a transparent plastic, such as polycarbonate for example. In alternate embodiments, transparent portions may be made from another material.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, cleaning head <b>100</b> may further comprise one or more brushes <b>138</b> for aiding in drawing dirt into the dirty fluid inlet <b>115</b>. The brushes <b>138</b> may be rotatably mounted in front chamber <b>106</b>, such that they roll along a surface on which cleaning head <b>100</b> is moved. In further embodiments, cleaning head <b>100</b> may comprise a brush drive motor mounted in the brushes <b>138</b>. Alternately, a brush drive motor may be provided externally of front chamber <b>108</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, struts <b>122</b> extend rearwardly and upwardly from the front portion to the rear portion, to define an open space therebelow and a brush drive motor is positioned in a housing <b>139</b> under struts <b>122</b> in this space. In a further alternate embodiment, no rotatable brush or the like, and alternately no brush, is provided. The brush drive motor may be drivingly connected to the brush <b>138</b> by a belt or any other drive member known in the art. An advantage of this design is that brush drive motor housing <b>139</b> is exposed to the ambient to assist in cooling the brush drive motor.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, cleaning head <b>100</b> may comprise one or more wheels or glides <b>140</b>, for aiding in moving cleaning head <b>100</b> along a surface. In the embodiments shown, cleaning head <b>100</b> comprises two front wheels <b>141</b> and two rear wheels <b>140</b>. Any configuration of wheels or glide members may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In any particular embodiment, rear wheels <b>140</b> are preferably mounted to rear portion <b>104</b> via brackets <b>142</b>, and extend rearwardly of surface cleaning head <b>10</b>. This configuration may be particularly useful in embodiments wherein surface cleaning head <b>10</b> is mounted to an upright vacuum cleaner including a motor in the upright section. In such embodiments, wheels <b>140</b> and surface cleaning head <b>10</b> may provide a stable platform to the upright section, and prevent it from tilting or tipping rearwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In alternate embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, cleaning head <b>100</b> may comprise a plurality of wheels <b>140</b> positioned under rear chamber <b>116</b>. In such embodiments, each wheel <b>140</b> may have its own axle, or the wheels <b>140</b> and mounted to a common axle. In such embodiments, wherein wheels <b>140</b> are positioned underneath a portion of cleaning head <b>100</b>, wheels <b>140</b> may not be visible when surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is in use. Accordingly, this may provide surface cleaning head <b>10</b> with a cleaner and more appealing appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, one or more of the struts <b>122</b> which comprise an air-flow passage may comprise one or more clean out ports. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, top surface <b>144</b> of each strut <b>122</b> may be removable from the remainder of the strut <b>122</b>, thereby providing a clean out port for each strut <b>122</b>. Thus, in order to clear blockage <b>134</b>, a user may remove the top surface <b>144</b> of strut <b>122</b><i>c</i>, and manually remove blockage <b>134</b>. In this embodiment, the top surface <b>144</b> is completely removable from each strut. Alternatively, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A-11F</figref>, a portion of one or more of the struts may pivot individually or with other portions, for example about a hinge or pivot pin (not shown), with respect to the remainder of surface cleaning head <b>100</b>, to provide an openable window or door. For example, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, top surface <b>144</b> of each strut pivots away from the remainder of each strut <b>122</b> together with top portion <b>108</b> of front chamber <b>106</b> about a hinge provided at the front end of front chamber <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The exemplified embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> except that the top portion of rear chamber <b>116</b> also opens concurrently with the struts <b>122</b>. In this embodiment the part that pivots open is essentially the top half of the surface cleaning head and the bottom half of the surface cleaning head essentially remains in place. Thus, a type of clam shell design is used. This embodiment is advantageous since pivoting connector <b>150</b> is removable when the upper clam shell portion is pivoted open. It will be appreciated that the upper clam shell portion may be removably mounted and not just pivotally mounted to the lower clam shell portion.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The exemplified embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> except that the top portion <b>108</b> of front chamber <b>116</b> remains closed. The openable upper clam shell portion is pivoted at the rearward end of front chamber <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The exemplified embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> except that the top portion <b>108</b> of front chamber <b>116</b> remains closed. The openable upper clam shell portion is pivoted at the rearward end of front chamber <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the exemplified embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref>, the openable portion pivots about the rearward end of rear chamber <b>116</b>. In this embodiment, three openable portions are provided. The left side strut <b>122</b>, when viewed from the front, is shown in the open position. Similarly, the right side strut <b>122</b>, when viewed from the front, may be opened independently. Also, the middle portion may be opened independently.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The exemplified embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11F</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref> except that the upper clam shell portion is a single construction that pivots open about the rear of rear chamber <b>116</b>, which pivot axis is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">It will be appreciated any portion may be pivotally or removably mounted to another portion to provide a access for cleaning one or more of the struts <b>122</b>, front chamber <b>106</b> and/or rear chamber <b>116</b>. Further, any latch or securing means known in the art may be used, including a snap fit, mechanical fasteners such as screws, clamps and the like, a releasable adhesive, and the like. Further, in any of these embodiments, a gasket (not shown) may be provided between top surfaces <b>144</b> and struts <b>122</b>, or any mating parts that open, so that top surfaces <b>144</b> may be sealingly connected to struts <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In alternate embodiments, clean out ports may be provided in another manner. For example, front chamber <b>106</b> may be removable from struts <b>122</b>, such that each intake portion <b>124</b> acts as a clean out port. In another example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a lower surface of one or more struts <b>122</b> may comprise a portion <b>156</b> that is openable or removable to provide a clean out port. In yet another example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, top portion <b>146</b> and bottom portion <b>148</b> of surface cleaning head may be separable from each other, which may allow a user to clean out blockages from front portion <b>102</b>, rear portion <b>104</b>, and pivoting connector <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Cleaning head <b>100</b> may be fabricated from a variety of materials, and by a variety of methods. For example, cleaning head <b>100</b> may be fabricated from one or more of metal alloys, resins, and plastics, or reinforced materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber reinforced polymers. Some such materials may serve to improve the structural integrity of cleaning head <b>100</b> if it does not include an outer casing.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the preferred embodiment, cleaning head <b>100</b> comprises an upper portion <b>146</b>, and a lower portion <b>148</b>, which are separately fabricated from, e.g., a molded plastic. In may be assembled as follows. Brushes <b>138</b> may be placed between upper portion <b>146</b> and lower portion <b>148</b> at front portion <b>102</b>. A pivoting connector <b>150</b> may be connected to rear portion <b>104</b>, between rear chamber <b>116</b> and neck <b>120</b>, by positioning a transverse portion <b>152</b> thereof between upper portion <b>146</b> and lower portion <b>148</b>, and optionally positioning an O-ring or other sealing member between transverse portion <b>152</b> and upper portion <b>146</b> and lower portion <b>148</b>. In this embodiment, pivoting connector <b>150</b> includes a cavity, and dirt and/or fluid passes from rear chamber <b>116</b> and through pivoting connector <b>150</b> to an up flow duct. In this embodiment, any additional components may be positioned between upper portion <b>146</b> and lower portion <b>148</b>. Upper portion <b>146</b> and lower portion <b>148</b> may then be joined. In some embodiments upper portion <b>146</b> and lower portion <b>148</b> may be joined using mechanical fasteners, such as screws. In such embodiments, upper portion <b>146</b> and lower portion <b>148</b> may be manufactured with integral screw ports (not shown). Furthermore, a gasket (not shown) may be positioned between upper portion <b>146</b> and lower portion <b>148</b> to provide an air-tight seal therebetween. In alternate embodiments, upper portion <b>146</b> and lower portion <b>148</b> may be sealingly connected together by using an adhesive, a snap connector or welding.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In use, cleaning head <b>100</b> may be mounted to any surface cleaning apparatus in the art. When the surface cleaning apparatus is actuated (i.e. when a motor is turned on), suction generated by a suction motor <b>18</b> causes fluid to enter cleaning head <b>100</b> via dirty fluid inlet <b>115</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an exemplary pathway followed by the fluid through cleaning head <b>100</b> is shown by arrows A. The fluid enters front chamber <b>106</b> and circulates therein. The fluid passes into the intake portions <b>124</b> of struts <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>122</b><i>c</i>, and <b>122</b><i>d</i>, and exits through outlets <b>126</b>. The fluid then enters rear chamber <b>116</b>, and passes into neck <b>120</b> via pivoting connector <b>150</b>. From neck <b>120</b>, fluid passes into backbone <b>22</b>, which directs the fluid to cyclone <b>120</b> for removal of the dirt entrained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide a cleaning head for a surface cleaning apparatus that may be relatively light and low-cost, may operate even if a blockage occurs, and may allow a user to better visualize a surface to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It will be appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments or separate aspects, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment.
