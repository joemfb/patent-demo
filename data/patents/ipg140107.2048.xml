<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to semiconductor manufacturing and, more particularly, to a method for etching an ultra thin film in semiconductor manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An integrated circuit (IC) is formed by creating one or more devices (e.g., circuit components) on a semiconductor substrate using a fabrication process. As fabrication processes and materials improve, semiconductor device geometries have continued to decrease in size since such devices were first introduced several decades ago. For example, current fabrication processes are producing semiconductor devices with 45 nm process technology and beyond. However, the reduction in size of device geometries frequently introduces new challenges that need to be overcome.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As semiconductor devices are scaled down, various ultra thin films having a thickness of less than 100 Angstroms have been employed. For example, ultra thin SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate oxide dielectric films may be used in semiconductor devices, such as metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices. However, current techniques for patterning ultra thin films have not been satisfactory in all respects. In particular, it has been increasingly difficult to control the etching of ultra thin films without causing lateral etching of the ultra thin film underneath a photoresist layer. Accordingly, patterns formed in the ultra thin film may vary and be distorted which can lead to various problems such as poor device performance and low yield.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, a need exists for a simple and cost-effective method for etching an ultra thin film in semiconductor devices.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure relates generally to semiconductor manufacturing and more particularly, to a method for etching an ultra thin film in semiconductor manufacturing. It is understood, however, that specific embodiments are provided as examples to teach the broader inventive concept, and one of ordinary skill in the art can easily apply the teaching of the present disclosure to other methods or devices. In addition, it is understood that the methods and apparatus discussed in the present disclosure include some conventional structures and/or processes. Since these structures and processes are well known in the art, they will only be discussed in a general level of detail.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, reference numbers are repeated throughout the drawings for sake of convenience and example, and such repetition does not indicate any required combination of features or steps throughout the drawings. Moreover, the formation of a first feature over, on, adjacent, abutting, or coupled to a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed interposing the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. Also, the formation of a feature on a substrate, including for example, etching a substrate, may include embodiments where features are formed above the surface of the substrate, directly on the surface of the substrate, and/or extending below the surface of the substrate (such as, trenches).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, illustrated are cross-section views of a substrate <b>100</b> having an ultra thin film <b>102</b> being processed with a conventional etching process. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the substrate <b>100</b> may include semiconductor substrate such as a silicon in a crystalline structure. The substrate <b>100</b> may further include one or more layers formed on the substrate. Examples of layers that may be formed include doped layers, insulative layers, epitaxial layers, conductive layers including polysilicon layers, dielectric layers, and/or other suitable semiconductor layers.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The ultra thin film <b>102</b> may be formed on the substrate <b>100</b> by various techniques known in the art. The ultra thin film <b>102</b> may have a thickness that is less than 100 Angstrom. The ultra thin film <b>102</b> may include a dielectric material or conductive material. A photoresist layer <b>104</b> may be formed on the ultra thin film <b>102</b>, and may be patterned by photolithography or other suitable process known in the art. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the ultra thin film <b>102</b> may be etched using the patterned photoresist layer <b>104</b>. The etch process may include a wet etch process using an etch chemical <b>106</b> such as an acidic or basic solution depending on the type of material being etched as well as other factors such as etch selectivity and etch rate. However, the small molecules of the etch chemical <b>106</b> may erode <b>108</b> the ultra thin film <b>102</b> underneath the photosensitive layer <b>104</b> due to capillary action. That is, the small molecules of the etch chemical <b>106</b> may be drawn to and may diffuse to a region <b>108</b> underneath the photoresist, and laterally etch a portion of the ultra thin film <b>102</b>. Accordingly, it may be difficult to control the etch rate, and the pattern formed in the ultra thin film <b>102</b> may be distorted which can lead various problems such as poor device performance. The unintentional lateral etching of ultra thin films may be magnified as pattern features continue to be scaled down for patterning technologies below 32 nm node.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrated is a flowchart for a method <b>200</b> for etching an ultra thin film. Also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, illustrated are cross-section views of a ultra thin film being etch according to the method <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The method <b>200</b> begins with block <b>202</b> in which a substrate <b>300</b> having an ultra thin film <b>302</b> formed thereon is provided. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the substrate <b>300</b> may include silicon in a crystalline structure. In alternative embodiments, the substrate <b>300</b> may optionally include other elementary semiconductors such as germanium, or may include a compound semiconductor such as, silicon carbide, gallium arsenide, indium arsenide, or indium phosphide. Additionally, the substrate <b>300</b> may include a silicon on insulator (SOI) substrate, polymer-on-silicon substrate, or &#x201c;silicon-on-nothing&#x201d; (&#x201c;SON&#x201d;) substrate including a thin insulation layer. The thin insulation layer includes air and/or other gaseous composition. The substrate <b>300</b> may further comprise one or more layers formed on the substrate. Examples of layers that may be formed include doped layers, insulative layers, epitaxial layers, conductive layers including polysilicon layers, dielectric layers, and/or other suitable semiconductor layers.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The ultra thin film <b>302</b> may be formed on the substrate <b>300</b> by various techniques. For example, the ultra thin film <b>302</b> may include a silicon dioxide (SiO2) that is deposited by a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process using, for example, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) or silane and oxygen. Alternatively, the ultra thin film <b>302</b> may be formed by physical vapor deposition (PVD or sputtering), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD), high density plasma CVD (HDPCVD), atomic layer CVD (ALCVD), and/or other processes known in the art. Preferably, the ultra thin film <b>302</b> may be formed with a thickness less than about 100 Angstrom. Alternatively, the ultra thin film <b>302</b> may include other materials such as silicon nitrides, silicon oxynitrides (e.g., SiON, SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>), metal oxides (e.g., ZnO, NiO, SnO, or other MetalO<sub>x</sub>), organic materials, metals (e.g., Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Ni, Sn, Pt, Ti, Zn, etc.), and low-k dielectric materials (e.g., fluorinated silica glass (FSG), carbon doped silicon oxide, Black Diamond&#xae; (Applied Materials of Santa Clara, Calif.)).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The method <b>200</b> continues with block <b>204</b> in which a patterned photosensitive layer <b>304</b> may be formed on the ultra thin film <b>302</b>. The photosensitive layer <b>304</b> may include a photoresist such as a chemical amplification resist (CAR). The photosensitive layer <b>304</b> may be formed by a spin-on process, a deposition process, and/or other suitable process. The photosensitive layer <b>304</b> may be patterned by a photolithography process, immersion photolithography process, or other lithography processes. The pattern photosensitive layer <b>304</b> may be used to form one or more features such as gates, interconnects, vias, and contacts in the ultra thin film <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method <b>200</b> continues with block <b>206</b> in which the ultra thin film <b>302</b> may be etched using the patterned photosensitive layer <b>304</b>. The etching process includes a wet etch process (high etch selectivity) using an etch mixture <b>306</b> that includes an etch chemical <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> and a high diffusion resistant carrier <b>314</b>. The etch chemical <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> may be carried in a liquid base such as H<sub>2</sub>O or other solvent, and the viscosity of the solvent may be modified to reduce the chemical diffusion velocity of the etch mixture <b>306</b> including the etch chemical. For example, the viscosity of the solvent may be increased by providing larger molecules such as glycerine (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>), or other suitable chemical compounds, and a colloid or polymer material may be formed having a low rate of diffusion. Accordingly, diffusion of the etch mixture <b>306</b> may be controlled within a region <b>320</b> such that the etch chemical <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> may be prevented from diffusing underneath the photosensitive layer <b>304</b> and removing portions of the ultra thin film <b>302</b> underneath the photosensitive layer.
