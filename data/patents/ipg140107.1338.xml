<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an inkjet head and in particular to an inkjet head having an improved configuration to lead out electrodes from a harmonic type head chip.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past, there has been known an inkjet head having a share mode type head chip. The head chip is a so-called harmonica type head chip in which a plurality of channels are formed on a piezoelectric element substrate in parallel by grinding, drive electrodes are formed on driving walls to divide the channels and openings of the channels are disposed at rear and front surfaces, wherein the driving walls are subject to share deformation by applying voltage onto the drive electrodes to eject ink in the channels from nozzles disposed on a front surface. (Patent Document 1: Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. H10-217456, Patent Document 2: Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2006-35454)</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above harmonica type head chip, has a difficulty in electrical connection between each drive electrode and a drive circuit so as to apply a drive signal onto the drive electrode in each channel therefore various technologies have been elaborated in the past.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, in the Patent Document 1 as to a head chip having two channel rows, a lead-out electrode is led out to an upper surface and a lower surface of the head chip via a front surface of the head chip with respect to the drive electrode in each channel. On a rear surface of the head chip, an ink manifold configuring a common ink chamber to commonly supply ink to each channel in the two rows is jointed. Driver ICs are disposed on an upper surface and a lower surface of the manifold respectively. Respective lead-out electrodes on the upper surface and the lower surface of the head chip are electrically connected to the driver IC via wire bonding. The driver ICs are electrically connected with signal lines from outside by jointing a FPC.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, in Patent Document 2, each drive electrode is electrically connected with a wiring of the wiring substrate via the lead-out electrode by arraying the lead-out electrodes arrayed with respect to respective channels on the rear surface of the head chip and by jointing the wiring substrate, on which the wirings are formed to correspond with the lead-out electrodes, with the rear surface of the head chip so as to protrude in an array direction of the channel rows in the head chip. On the wiring substrate openings are formed to correspond with respective channels thus ink can be supplied to the inside of each channel from the manifold jointed on a rear surface side of the wiring substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the structure of the inkjet head described in Patent Document 2, by forming the wiring substrate so as to protrude at each side in the array direction of the channel rows in the head chip, wiring corresponding to the lead-out electrode from channels in two rows at each side of the head chip can be led out, even in case the head chip has four rows of the channels at a maximum.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">Due to recent demands of density growth of the nozzles, further increase of the channel rows has been necessary for the inkjet head having such harmonic type head chip. Therefore, besides n inkjet head having four rows, an inkjet head having five rows or more than five rows have been further requested.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">However, according to the technology described in Patent Document 1, since the lead-out electrodes let out from respective channels in two channel rows are formed to be separated respectively to the upper surface and the lower surface of the had chip, it is difficult to configure a head chip having three or more channel rows.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">On the other hand, according to the technology described in Patent Document 2, it is possible to configured a head chip having four rows of channels though it is difficult to lead out the wirings corresponding to three or more than three rows of channels to the same direction of the head chip, and the technology can not be applied to a head chip having five or more than five rows of channels.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">It is considered that the inkjet head having five or more than five channel rows can be configured by disposing a plurality of the head chips of Patent Documents 1 and 2. However, in this case, the wirings led outside the head chip from respective channels interfere each head chip to be arranged in parallel with narrow intervals. The inkjet head is required to be thin in a scanning direction, however since the head chips cannot be disposed densely, there was a problem that the head chip having multiple channels is difficult to be thinner.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">Further, the harmonica type head chip has an advantage that a large number of the head chips in the same shape can be produced by separating a large size channel substrate in one piece in which channels are arrayed via full-cut. However, in case a plurality of the head chips of Patent Documents 1 and 2 are arrayed, after connecting wirings for each head chip having two to four channel rows, a plurality of the head chips having been connected with the wirings have to be arranged in parallel each other thus the head chips having five or more than five channel rows cannot be obtained via full-cut of the large size channel substrate at one time, whereby there is a problem of reducing productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">An object of the present invention is to provide an inkjet head superior in the productivity wherein in the inkjet head having the harmonica type head chip, the wirings electrically connected with the drive electrodes in respective channels as is can be led rearwards from the rear surface of the head chip and thickness can be reduced even if the head tip has a plurality of channels rows arranged in parallel.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means to Solved the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">The above problem can be solved by the following</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">1. An inkjet head, having; a head chip, wherein drive walls configured with piezoelectric elements and channels are arranged in parallel alternately, an inlet and an outlet of each channel are provided on a front surface and a rear surface respectively and a drive electrode is fouled on a surface of each drive wall facing inside the channel, so as to eject ink in the channel from a nozzle disposed on the front surface of the head chip by deforming the drive wall by applying voltage onto the drive electrode, wherein a groove is formed along an array direction of the channel on an area of the rear surface of the head chip where the channel is not formed, a lead-out electrode electrically connected with the drive electrode is formed from the rear surface of the head chip to an inside of the groove, and by inserting an end of a wiring member, provided with a connection wiring corresponding to the lead-out electrode on an insulation member, into the groove, the connection wiring in the groove is electrically connected with the lead-out electrode so as to electrically connect the drive electrode with the connection wiring via the lead-out electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">2. The inkjet head of item 1, wherein, the wiring member contacts to a lead-out electrode side in the groove with pressure via a filling member provided at an opposite surface side to a connection wiring forming surface so as to electrically connect the connection wiring with the lead-out electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">3. The inkjet head of any one of item 2, wherein the filling member is a foamable resin material which foams and inflates by heat.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">4. The inkjet head of any one of items 1 to 3, wherein the wiring member includes a solder electrode on the connection wiring disposed in the groove so as to electrically connect the connection wiring and the lead-out electrode by melting the solder electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">5. The inkjet head of any one items 1 to 4, wherein an ink manifold configuring a common ink chamber to commonly supply ink with respect to each channel is provided on the rear surface of the head chip and the wiring member protrudes from the groove via an inside of the common ink chamber so as to penetrate the ink manifold.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">6. The inkjet head of items 1 to 5, wherein the head chip includes five or more than five channel rows.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">The inkjet head related to the present invention has a head chip wherein drive walls configured with piezoelectric elements and channels are arranged alternately in parallel, an outlet port and an inlet port are disposed on a front surface and a rear surface respectively for each channel and a drive electrode is formed on a wall surface of the drive wall facing inward in the channel. The above head chip is a so-called harmonica type head chip in a shape of a hexahedron, wherein by applying voltage onto the drive electrode, the drive wall deforms in a shape of dog leg to create pressure change in the ink supplied to the channel for ejection, so as to eject an ink droplet from the nozzle disposed on the front surface of the head chip.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">In the present invention, as to such harmonica type head chip, a surface on which the nozzle is disposed so as to eject ink is defined as a &#x201c;front surface and a surface on opposite side thereof is defined as a &#x201c;rear surface&#x201d;. Also, opposing outside surfaces of the head chip sandwiching the channel rows are defined as an &#x201c;upper surface&#x201d; and a &#x201c;lower surface&#x201d; respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">In the present invention, in an area where the channels are not formed on the rear surface of the forgoing head chip, a grove is disposed along an array direction of the channels. The area where the channels are not formed on the rear surface of the head chip is to except an area where the inlet ports of the channels are arrayed. It is preferred that the groove is formed in an area adjacent to an area where the inlet ports of the channels are arrayed in parallel to the array direction of the channels.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">A length of the groove is preferred to coincide with a width of the head chip along the array direction of the channels. A width of the groove is appropriately determined in accordance with a width of a forming area of the groove on the rear surface of the head chip and a thickness of a wiring member to be described. Also, a depth of the groove can be 200 to 800 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">The lead-out electrode is formed independently for each channel. An end of the lead-out electrode is electrically connected with the drive electrode disposed on the drive wall facing inward in the channel. The lead-out electrode is formed so that other end of the lead-out electrode reaches to an inside of the groove from each channel via the rear surface of the head chip adjacent to the inlet port of the aforesaid channel. Each lead-out electrode is formed independently for each channel so that short circuit does not occur even inside the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">One end of the wiring member is inserted in the groove. On the wiring member, connection wirings corresponding to respective lead-out electrodes are disposed in the same pitch as that of the lead-out electrode on the insulation material. By inserting the wiring member into the groove, the connection wiring on the wiring member and the lead-out electrode are electrically connected. Whereby, the drive electrode in each channel is electrically connected with the connection wiring on the wiring member via the lead-out electrode on the rear surface of the head chip. By inserting the one end of the wiring member into the groove provided on the rear surface of the head chip, the wiring member is disposed perpendicular to the rear surface of the head chip, thus other end of the wiring member as is protrudes to a rearward of the head chip.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">Therefore, according to the present invention, the connection wiring to be electrically connected with the drive electrode in each channel can be led out rearward as is from the rear surface of the head chip, thus it does not protrude to the upper surface or the lower surface of the head chip. Also, since no electrodes are formed on the upper surface and the lower surface of the head chip, a thin head chip can be formed, even if a plurality of the channel rows are arranged in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">It is remarkable that according to the present invention since even the head chips having five or more than five channel rows can be manufactured at one time via full-cut of a large size channel substrate provided with five or more than five channel rows, the inkjet head can possess excellent productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">Therefore, an effect of the present invention is remarkable particularly in the head chip having five or more than five channel rows.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">In the present invention, while the groove can be disposed to correspond with the channel row one-on-one, in case of the head chip having the plurality of the channel rows, each other end of the lead-out electrode from each channel in the plurality of the channel rows can be led inside one groove. The grooves are disposed between the plurality of the channels and the each lead-out electrodes are formed so as to reach to the inside of each groove from both sides of each groove thereof. Therefore, on the wiring member inserted in the groove, the connection wirings are formed on both sides of the insulation material.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">In the present invention, while the insulation material to form the wiring member is not particularly specified, a flexible material is preferred. For example, resin films such as polyimide, aramid, and polyethylene telephthalate are cited. An aramid film is particularly preferred since the aramid film has high strength which can be maintained even if the film is thin. A thickness of the insulation material of 3 to 100 &#x3bc;m is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0046">The connection wiring on the wiring member and the lead-out electrode have to be electrically connected each other firmly in the groove. To enable electrical connection between the connection wiring and the lead-out electrode in the groove, while an adhesive can be used usually, in the groove, the connection wiring and the lead-out electrode can be electrically connected in a way that by providing a filling material on an opposite surface side to the connection wiring forming surface, the wiring member is pressed to contact with the lead-out electrode side by the filling material.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0047">The above filling material is preferred to be a foam resin material which creates foam and inflates by heat. The foamable resin material is made by adding forming agent (forming capsule) which creates form by heating. After filling the foamable resin material on the opposite surface side to the connection wiring forming surface of the wiring member inserted in the groove, the foaming agent is heated to create foam and inflated, thus pressure contact force to contact the connection wiring with the lead-out electrode by pressure is exerted effectively and reliable electric connection is realized by contacting the connection wiring and the lead-out electrode firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0048">As an example of the foamable resin material, heat expandable micro capsule of Matsumoto Yushi-Seiyaku Co., Ltd. can be utilized. An average particle diameter of the micro capsule and a base polymer of the filling material can be selected in accordance with a width of the channel and a thickness of the wiring member without being restricted. For example, the average particle diameter can be selected in the range of 5 to 50 &#x3bc;m. A forming magnitude can be selected in the range of 2 to 10 times. As a base polymer an epoxy resin can be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0049">As another method, at the wiring member, a solder electrode can be provided on the connection wiring disposed in the groove. By inserting an end of such wiring member into the groove and by melting the solder electrode by heat firm electric connection between the connection wiring and the lead-out electrode can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">On the rear surface of the head chip, an ink manifold forming a common ink chamber to supply ink commonly to each channel is disposed. In this configuration, the groove on the rear surface of the head chip can be disposed so as to avoid the ink manifold. Or by disposing the groove in an area facing the inside of the common ink chamber on the rear surface of the head chip, the wiring member can be disposed and extended from the groove so as to penetrate the ink manifold via the inside of the common ink chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">Next, an exemplary embodiment of an inkjet head related to the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view showing an embodiment of an inkjet head, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view thereof and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is view partially showing only a rear surface of the head chip.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">The inkjet head <b>1</b> of the embodiment includes a head chip <b>2</b>, a nozzle plate <b>3</b>, wiring members <b>4</b> and ink manifolds <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">The head chip <b>2</b> is a harmonica type head chip in a shape of a hexahedron wherein drive walls <b>21</b> configured with the piezoelectric elements and channels <b>22</b> are arranged in parallel alternately, an outlet port of each channel opens at a front surface <b>2</b><i>a</i>, and an inlet port of each channel opens at a rear surface <b>2</b><i>b</i>. In the head chip <b>2</b> shown by the present embodiment, six channel rows configured by arranging a plurality of the drive walls <b>21</b> and a plurality of the channels <b>22</b> in parallel are arrayed one above the other in parallel. In the present embodiment, a dimension of the head chip <b>2</b> in the array direction of the channel rows i.e. a vertical direction of the head chip <b>2</b> in the figure is 10.0860 mm, a height of the channel <b>22</b> in a vertical direction in the figure is 310 &#x3bc;m, a width of the channel <b>22</b> is 70&#x3bc; and a width of the drive wall <b>21</b> is 70 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">Incidentally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> only three rows in a lower half of the channel rows arrayed in parallel in the vertical direction in the figure are shown. The inkjet head <b>1</b> is symmetric in the vertical direction with respect to a line x-x in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">On each drive wall <b>21</b> facing inward in the channel <b>22</b>, a drive electrode <b>23</b> is formed. Also, on the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b> a groove <b>24</b> is formed across the head chip <b>2</b> in the width direction in parallel to an array direction of each channel <b>22</b> in the channel rows. hi the present embodiment, within the six channel rows, every two channel rows from the end section configure one group, and the groove <b>24</b> is formed between the two channel rows in each group, whereby a total of three grooves <b>24</b> are provided. Here, the width of the groove <b>24</b> is 82 &#x3bc;m and the depth thereof is 300 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">The lead-out electrode <b>25</b> corresponding to each channel <b>22</b> one-to-one, is formed from the inside of each channel <b>22</b> to the groove <b>24</b> adjacent to the channel <b>22</b> thereof. Namely, one end of the lead-out electrode <b>25</b> is connected electrically with the drive electrode <b>23</b> in each channel <b>22</b>, and another end is disposed on each side wall surface <b>24</b><i>a </i>facing each other in the groove <b>24</b> via a rear surface of the head chip <b>2</b> from the inside of each channel <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">In the present invention, since the other end of the lead-out electrode <b>25</b> from each channel <b>22</b> disposed on both sides of the groove <b>24</b> is disposed in one groove <b>24</b>, the other end of each lead-out electrode is arranged on the both side walls <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the groove <b>24</b> with the same pitch as the arraying pitch of each channel <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">By inserting the one end of each wiring member <b>4</b> into the groove <b>24</b>, each wiring member <b>4</b> protrudes to the rearward of the head chip <b>2</b> in a direction perpendicular to the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b>. Therefore, the wirings do not protrude at other surfaces than the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">In the wiring member <b>4</b>, on the surface of the substrate <b>41</b> configured with an insulation material, the connection wirings <b>42</b> are arrayed in the same pitch as that of the lead-out electrodes <b>25</b> arrayed in the groove <b>24</b>. Here, in order to correspond with each lead-out electrode <b>25</b> arrayed on both side wall surfaces <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the groove <b>24</b>, one substrate <b>41</b> is folded into two so that each outside surface thereof becomes a wiring member <b>4</b> on which connection wirings <b>42</b> are arrange. The end section on folding side is inserted into the groove <b>24</b>. When inserting, positioning is carried out so that each lead-out electrode <b>25</b> and each connection wiring <b>42</b> corresponding thereto coincided each other.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">In the groove <b>24</b>, a foamable resin material <b>43</b> is filled between the folded substrate <b>41</b> of the wring member <b>4</b> folded into two. Whereby, by utilizing a bias force caused by expansion of the foamable resin member <b>43</b> by heating the foamable resin member, each substrate <b>41</b> is pushed in a receding direction each other and the each connection wiring <b>42</b> is in pressure contact with corresponding lead-out electrode <b>25</b>. Whereby reliable electrical connection between each lead-out electrode <b>25</b> and each connection wring <b>42</b> is realized. The foaming resin material <b>43</b> contacts the connection wiring <b>42</b> to the lead-out electrode <b>25</b> with pressure using an inflation force by foaming, thus appropriate contact pressure is created and there is not dangerousness to damage the head chip <b>2</b>. For a purpose to further ensuring the electrical connection, an anisotropically conductive adhesive can intervene between each lead-out electrode and each connection wiring <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">In case the solder electrode is used to realize electrical connection, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows, a solder electrode <b>44</b> is formed on the end section of the connection wiring <b>42</b> disposed in the channel <b>24</b> in advance, then the wiring member <b>4</b> is positioned and inserted into the groove <b>24</b> thereafter, by heating and melting the solder electrode <b>44</b> electrical connection with the lead-out electrode <b>25</b> is realized. In the embodiment using the solder electrode <b>44</b>, the foamable resin member is also filled on a surface on an opposite side to the forming surface of the connection electrode <b>42</b> in advance, then by foaming when heating the solder electrode <b>44</b> contacts to the lead-out electrode <b>25</b> with pressure. Thus, melted solder electrode <b>44</b> can connect with the lead-out electrode <b>25</b> more firmly.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">In the present embodiment, one ink manifold <b>5</b> is disposed for each channel row positioned at both end sections of the head chip <b>2</b> and for four channels rows therebetween, one ink manifold <b>5</b> is disposed for every two channel rows adjacent each other. Thus a total of four ink manifolds <b>5</b> are jointed on the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">Inside each ink manifold <b>5</b>, a common ink chamber <b>51</b> to commonly supply ink to corresponding channels <b>22</b> is formed. By supplying ink from an unillustrated ink supply port, ink is reserved. Ink of the same color can be supplied to each ink manifold <b>5</b> or ink of different colors can be supplied respectively to ink manifolds <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">In the present embodiment, the groove <b>24</b> is provided on the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b> at each position between the four manifolds <b>5</b>. Since the wiring member <b>4</b> is protruding from each groove <b>24</b> rearward, each wiring member <b>4</b> is disposed between these manifolds <b>5</b>. Whereby, a connection portion between the lead-out electrode <b>25</b> and the connection wiring <b>42</b> does not contact with ink. Thus any kind of ink can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">A jointing section side of the manifold <b>5</b> with the head chip <b>2</b> is formed by laminating a plurality of substrates <b>52</b> to <b>55</b> having a thickness of 500 &#x3bc;m. One substrate <b>53</b> within the above substrates is disposed so as to sandwich each wiring member <b>4</b> at both sides thereof. Whereby, each wiring member <b>4</b> is supported by the substrate <b>53</b> at a vicinity of one end which is inserted into the groove <b>24</b> so as to maintain connection state with the groove <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">Next, an exemplary method to manufacture the head chip <b>2</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">Two piezoelectric element substrates <b>201</b>, wherein the drive walls <b>21</b> and the channels <b>22</b> are formed by grinding and the drive electrode <b>23</b> is formed in each channel <b>22</b>, are laminated on one cover substrate <b>202</b> so that each channel <b>22</b> corresponds each other. Thus a channel substrate <b>203</b> having two channel rows is manufactured (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0069">On the piezoelectric element substrate <b>201</b>, each drive electrode <b>23</b> is formed on both side surfaces and a bottom surface in each channel <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">Next, two channel substrates <b>203</b> each having two channel rows are jointed to form a channel substrate <b>203</b>, <b>203</b> having four channel rows (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>), then on both sides of the channel substrates <b>203</b>, <b>203</b>, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>shows, two channel substrates <b>204</b> each formed by laminating a cover substrate <b>202</b> on one piezoelectric element substrate <b>201</b> having one channel row are jointed in a way that each piezoelectric element substrate <b>201</b> side contacts with the piezoelectric element substrate <b>201</b> of the channel substrate <b>203</b>. Thus a large size channel substrate <b>205</b> having six channel rows is formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0071">Then by cutting the large size substrate <b>205</b> (full cut) along a plurality of cut lines c, c, . . . , in a direction perpendicular to a length direction of the channel <b>22</b>, head chips <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>, . . . , each having six channel rows are manufactured at one time. The distances between the cut lines c, c, . . . , determine drive lengths of the channels <b>22</b> of the head chips <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0072">With respect to the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b> having six channel rows manufactured by the above method, using a dicing blade <b>10</b>, the grooves <b>24</b> along the channel rows are grinded between the channel substrate <b>204</b> and the channel substrate <b>203</b> adjacent thereto as well as between the channel substrates <b>203</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0073">Next, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>to <b>8</b><i>d </i>show lead-out electrodes <b>25</b> are formed on the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b> on which the groove <b>24</b> is formed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref><i>a </i>to <b>8</b><i>d</i>, left figures are magnified cross-sectional views of one groove <b>24</b> of the head chip <b>2</b>, and right figures are that as viewed from a rear surface side.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0074">First, a dry film <b>300</b> is adhered on the entire rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b> on which the grooves <b>24</b> are formed. Then by known exposing and developing processes, a forming area <b>301</b> of the lead-out electrode <b>25</b>, from each channel <b>22</b> (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to the groove <b>24</b>, are opened (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0075">With respect to the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b>, by evaporating an electrode forming material, a metal film <b>400</b> is formed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0076">It is preferred that evaporation is carried out two time from different directions with respect to the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b> so as to ensure electrical connection with the drive electrode <b>23</b> in each channel and to ensure forming of the metal film <b>400</b> on both side wall surfaces <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the groove <b>24</b> as well. Specifically evaporating is carried out in directions 30&#xb0; upward and downward along the array direction of the channel rows. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c </i>shows the angle of evaporation, and the depth and width of the groove are selected so that the metal films <b>400</b> on both side wall surfaces <b>24</b><i>a </i>do not connect each other on the bottom section of the groove <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">Also, instead of the evaporation method, a spattering method can be used. The spattering method is preferable, since flying directions of metal particles are random, the metal film <b>400</b> can be formed inside the channel <b>22</b> and inside the groove <b>24</b> without changing the direction. In case of the spattering method also, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c </i>shows, the depth, the width and conditions of spattering are selected so that the metal films <b>400</b> on both side wall surfaces <b>24</b><i>a </i>do not connect each other on the bottom section of the groove <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">After forming the metal film <b>400</b>, by resolving and separating the dry film <b>300</b> with a solvent, the dry film <b>300</b> formed on the metal film <b>400</b> is removed. Therefore, on the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b>, only the lead-out electrodes <b>25</b>, from the inside of each channel <b>22</b> to the groove <b>24</b>, are formed in an array independently for each channel <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">Next, one end of the wiring member <b>4</b>, having the substrate <b>41</b> on which each connection wiring is formed, is positioned and inserted into the groove <b>24</b>. Between the substrate <b>41</b>,<b>41</b> folded into two, the foamable resin material <b>43</b> is filled. By inflating the foamable resin material <b>43</b> with heat, the each connection wiring <b>42</b> contacts with the electrode <b>25</b> with pressure whereby, electric connection is realized (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">Thereafter, a nozzle plate <b>3</b>, on which nozzles <b>31</b> are formed at positions corresponding to the channels, is jointed on the front surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the head chip <b>2</b>, and on the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b</i>, the ink manifold <b>5</b> is jointed, thus the inkjet head <b>1</b> is completed (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">While the embodiments described in the foregoing are examples of the head chip <b>2</b> provided with three grooves <b>24</b> with respect to six channel rows, as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows, in the head chip <b>2</b>, the grooves <b>24</b> can be disposed to correspond with the channel rows one-to-one. Naturally, such head chip <b>2</b> can be one having one channel row or tow channel rows or more than two channel rows. Even in case of a head chip <b>2</b> having two or more than two channel rows, there can be obtain the same effect that the wiring member <b>4</b> can be disposed to protrude as is rearward from the rear surface <b>2</b><i>b </i>of the head chip <b>2</b>, thus the head chip can be thinner and can be manufactured by full cutting of the large size channel substrate at one time.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">Also, in the embodiments described in the foregoing, one groove <b>24</b> is disposed between two channel rows. Namely, inside the one groove <b>24</b>, there is disposed the other end of the led-out electrode <b>25</b> led out from the inside of each channel <b>22</b> in one channel row on one side of the groove <b>24</b>. However, in the present invention, in the one groove <b>24</b>, there can be disposed the other end of the lead-out electrode <b>25</b> led out from the inside of each channel <b>22</b> in two or more than two channel rows disposed on one side of the groove <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an example of the head chip <b>2</b>, wherein two channel rows are disposed respectively on both sides of one groove <b>24</b> and the other end of the lead-out electrode <b>25</b> led out from each channel <b>22</b> in the four channel rows in total is disposed. The channels <b>22</b> in the two channel rows on one side of the groove <b>24</b> are disposed so as to be displaced by &#xbd; pitch each other.
