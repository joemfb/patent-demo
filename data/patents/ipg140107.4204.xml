<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Portable electronic devices, such as mobile phones, often use docking stations for charging and synchronizing the electronic device. The docking station usually includes a main body and one or more interfaces (such as a USB port) projecting out of the main body. The interface can be inserted into the electronic device, whereby the electronic device is electrically connected to the docking station. When not in use the interface is exposed to dust and other contaminants which can degrade or shorten the life of the interface and hence the docking station.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is room for improvement in the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an electronic device assembly including an electronic device <b>10</b> and a docking station <b>20</b> in accordance with an embodiment is shown. The electronic device <b>10</b> is a mobile phone in the embodiment. The docking station <b>20</b> is adapted to support and electrically connect to the electronic device <b>10</b>. The electronic device <b>10</b> includes a first display <b>110</b> for displaying information, such as, video, pictures, and documents. When the electronic device <b>10</b> is electrically connected to the docking station <b>20</b>, the docking station <b>20</b> is capable of synchronously displaying information (such as videos, picture, documents and music) that are displayed on the electronic device <b>10</b>. The electronic device <b>10</b> includes a socket (not shown) designed for the insertion of a plug (not shown), such as an USB port.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the docking station <b>20</b> is substantially rectangular. The docking station <b>20</b> includes a main body <b>210</b>, a connector mechanism <b>230</b> rotatably mounted to the main body <b>210</b>, a second display <b>250</b> mounted to the main body <b>210</b>, and a latching mechanism <b>270</b> for locking the connector mechanism <b>230</b> to the main body <b>210</b>. The second display <b>250</b> is used to synchronously display information, such as videos, pictures, and documents that are displayed in the first display <b>110</b>. The size of the second display <b>250</b> is greater than that of the first display <b>110</b>, thus, the information displayed in the first display <b>110</b> is enlarged when being view from the second display <b>250</b>. Furthermore, the docking station <b>20</b> includes a pair of speakers (not shown). The speakers are used to synchronously play sound signals from the electronic device <b>10</b>. The docking station <b>20</b> also includes a stand <b>290</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for supporting the docking station <b>20</b> on a supporting surface (not shown), such as, a table.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The docking station <b>20</b> can be a single electronic device capable of operating independently when the electronic device <b>10</b> is detached, and the interface mechanism <b>230</b> acts as an interface port for electrically connecting a peripheral device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The main body <b>210</b> includes a front cover <b>211</b>, a rear cover <b>212</b> opposite to the front cover <b>211</b>, and four sidewalls (hereinafter, a first sidewall <b>213</b>, a second sidewall <b>214</b>, a third sidewall <b>215</b> opposite to the first sidewall <b>213</b>, and a fourth sidewall <b>216</b> opposite to the second sidewall <b>214</b>). The front cover <b>211</b>, the rear cover <b>212</b>, and the sidewalls cooperatively define an accommodating space (not shown) for receiving the second display <b>250</b>, the speakers, and other components. The front cover <b>211</b> defines a substantially rectangular opening <b>2110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The second display <b>250</b> is exposed out of the main body <b>210</b> via the opening <b>2110</b>. The first sidewall <b>213</b> recesses toward the third sidewall <b>215</b> to define a receiving space <b>220</b>. The receiving space <b>220</b> is adjacent to the second sidewall <b>216</b> and is used for receiving the connector mechanism <b>230</b> when the connector mechanism <b>230</b> is in a closed position relative to the main body <b>210</b>. The joint of the first and second sidewalls <b>213</b>, <b>216</b> defines a notch <b>217</b> communicating with the receiving space <b>220</b>. Two axis holes <b>218</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) are respectively defined at opposite sides of the notch <b>218</b>. The first sidewall <b>213</b> further defines a recess <b>222</b> communicating with the receiving space <b>220</b>. The recess <b>222</b> extends longitudinally in a direction opposite to the notch <b>217</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the connector mechanism <b>230</b> includes a base <b>232</b> rotatably coupled to the main body <b>210</b>, a shaft <b>233</b> fixed to an end of the base <b>232</b>. An interface member <b>234</b> rotatably coupled to the base <b>232</b>, a supporting member <b>236</b> rotatably coupled to the base <b>232</b>, and a transmitting portion <b>237</b> for connecting the interface member <b>234</b> with the supporting member <b>236</b>. The connector mechanism <b>230</b> is capable of rotating from a closed position allowing the connector to be received in the receiving space <b>220</b> to an open position allowing the interface <b>234</b> to be exposed to the outside. When the connector mechanism <b>230</b> rotates to the open position, the interface member <b>234</b> and the supporting member <b>236</b> rotate relative to the base <b>232</b> and are unfolded to support and electrically connect the electronic device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The base <b>232</b> is rotatable to the main body <b>210</b> by the shaft <b>233</b> rotatably received in the axis holes <b>218</b>. A first stand <b>231</b> and a pair of second stands <b>235</b> are arranged on the base <b>232</b> in a triangle. A protrusion <b>239</b> protrudes from an end of the base <b>232</b>. The protrusion <b>239</b> defines a through hole (not labeled) for receiving the axis shaft <b>233</b>. The other end of the base <b>232</b> opposite to the protrusion <b>239</b> defines a recess toward the protrusion <b>239</b> providing a receiving portion <b>241</b>. The receiving portion <b>241</b> corresponds to the recess <b>222</b> when the base <b>232</b> is received in the receiving space <b>220</b>. The receiving portion <b>241</b> is used for receiving the latching mechanism <b>270</b>. A surface of the base <b>232</b> opposite to the first and second stands <b>231</b>, <b>235</b> defines elongated hole <b>242</b>. The elongated hole <b>242</b> communicates with the receiving portion <b>241</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The interface member <b>234</b> is rotatably coupled to the base <b>232</b> and is foldable. The interface member <b>234</b> is rotatable around a first axis A, and matches with the socket of the electronic device <b>10</b>. The interface member <b>234</b> may be USB port, HDMI (High Definition Multimedia) port and is inserted into the socket of the electronic device <b>10</b>, such that the electronic device <b>10</b> is electrically connected to the docking station <b>20</b>. The interface member <b>234</b> is further electrically connected to the second display <b>250</b>, the speakers, and other electronic component of the docking station <b>20</b>, such that the electronic device <b>10</b> is electrically connected to the second display <b>250</b> and the speakers.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The supporting member <b>236</b> is substantially rectangular. The supporting member <b>236</b> is rotatably coupled to the base <b>232</b> and is foldable. The supporting member <b>236</b> is rotatable around a second axis B parallel to the first axis A. An end of the supporting member <b>236</b> coupled to the base <b>232</b> defines a cutout <b>2362</b>. The cutout <b>2362</b> receives the interface member <b>234</b>.
