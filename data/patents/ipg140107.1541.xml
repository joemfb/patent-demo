<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to scroll-type pumps and, more particularly, to devices and methods for isolation of the bearings and other lubricated components of such pumps from a working volume where compression and pumping of the fluid takes place.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Scroll-type devices are well known in the field of vacuum pumps and compressors. In a scroll device, a movable spiral blade orbits with respect to a fixed spiral blade within a housing. The movable spiral blade is connected to an eccentric drive mechanism. The configuration of the scroll blades and their relative motion traps one or more volumes or &#x201c;pockets&#x201d; of a gas between the blades and moves the gas through the device. Most applications apply rotary power to pump the gas through the device. Other applications include expanders, which operate in reverse from compressors and extract power from the expansion of a pressurized gas.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A scroll pump includes stationary and orbiting scroll elements, and a drive mechanism. The stationary and orbiting scroll elements each include a scroll plate and a spiral scroll blade extending from the scroll plate. The scroll blades are intermeshed together to define interblade pockets. The drive mechanism produces orbiting motion of the orbiting scroll element relative to the stationary scroll element so as to cause the interblade pockets to move toward the pump outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For proper function of the scroll pump, it is necessary to maintain a fixed angular relation, or synchronization, between the two scroll elements. Scroll pumps typically utilize one or more devices for synchronizing the intermeshed scroll blades. Each synchronizing device is coupled, directly or indirectly, between the stationary and orbiting scroll elements and is required to permit orbiting movement while preventing relative rotation of the scroll elements. In one prior art approach, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 801,182 issued Oct. 3, 1905, three crank mechanisms are connected between the orbiting and stationary scroll elements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Oil-lubricated scroll devices are widely used as refrigerant compressors. Oil-lubricated scroll pumps have not been widely adopted for use as vacuum pumps, mainly because the cost of manufacturing a scroll pump is significantly higher than a comparably-sized, oil-lubricated vane pump. In cases where oil contamination is unacceptable, dry scroll pumps are used. Normally these pumps contain multiple rolling element bearings which require lubrication. One approach to lubrication is to use a low-vapor-pressure synthetic grease. However, some degree of contamination can still occur when the bearings are located within the vacuum space of the pump. In addition, the lubricating performance of such greases is generally inferior, and their cost higher, than equivalent petroleum greases.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, methods have been devised to isolate the bearings from the pumping mechanism while still permitting the relative orbital motion of the fixed and moving scroll elements. U.S. Pat. No. 5,951,268, issued Sep. 14, 1999, describes the use of a flexible metal bellows for isolation of the running gear of a scroll pump, also relying on the bellows for synchronization of the scroll elements. The torsional load on the bellows due to its function in synchronization poses a risk of failure due to metal fatigue. U.S. Pat. No. 7,261,528, issued Aug. 28, 2007 to assignee of the present invention, describes the use of a rectangular flexible metal element for synchronization as well as to take axial loads, while using a bellows, rotatably mounted, for isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Prior art use of tubular bellows for isolation requires that the bellows be of sufficient length to reduce the stresses in the bellows material below the fatigue life limit for the material. Increased bellows length increases the length of the pump, which may be unacceptable in many applications. Consequently, improved methods of isolating the running gear of a scroll pump from the vacuum space are needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the invention, scroll pumping apparatus is provided. The scroll pumping apparatus comprises: a first scroll element and a second scroll element; a drive mechanism operatively coupled to the second scroll element for producing orbiting motion of the second scroll element relative to the first scroll element, the drive mechanism having an axis of rotation; and an isolation element to isolate a first volume and a second volume in the scroll pumping apparatus, the isolation element including a first resilient annular member coupled, directly or indirectly, to the first scroll element, a second resilient annular member coupled, directly or indirectly, to the second scroll element, and a tubular member coupled between the first and second annular members.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Isolation of the bearings and other contamination-generating components from the working volume of the pump is provided by an isolation element including two substantially annular members, joined by a tubular member. In the operation of the scroll pump, the annular members deflect to accommodate the lateral displacement of the orbiting scroll element with respect to the fixed scroll element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, one or both ends of the isolation element is rotatably mounted to a respective mating component, and synchronization is provided by one or more separate synchronization devices. Thus the isolation element is not subjected to torsional stress.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, one or both of the annular members may be convoluted in a pattern of concentric circular convolutions to provide flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the annular members of the isolation element may be joined by a short tubular bellows to provide additional flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, at least one of the annular members may include an elastomeric disk, of constant or non-constant section, to provide the desired flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, at least one of the annular members may include a dome-shaped element to provide the desired flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, both ends of the isolation element may be non-rotatably mounted, one end directly or indirectly coupled to the orbiting scroll element, and the other end directly or indirectly coupled to the pump housing or fixed scroll element, thus providing synchronization between the two scroll elements. In this case, although the isolation element is exposed to torsional stress, the complexity of the pump can be reduced as separate synchronization devices are not required.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a second aspect of the invention, a method is provided for operating scroll pumping apparatus of the type comprising a first scroll element and a second scroll element. The method comprises producing orbiting motion of the second scroll element relative to the first scroll element with respect to an axis of rotation; and isolating, using an isolation element, a first volume and a second volume in the scroll pumping apparatus during orbiting motion, the isolation element including a first resilient annular member coupled, directly or indirectly, to the first scroll element, a second resilient annular member coupled, directly or indirectly, to the second scroll element, and a tubular member coupled between the first and second annular members.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a third aspect of the invention, scroll pumping apparatus comprises a scroll set having an inlet and an outlet, the scroll set comprising a stationary scroll element including a stationary scroll blade and an orbiting scroll element including an orbiting scroll blade, wherein the stationary and orbiting scroll blades are intermeshed together to define one or more interblade pockets; a drive mechanism operatively coupled to the orbiting scroll element for producing orbiting motion of the orbiting scroll blade relative to the stationary scroll blade so as to cause the one or more interblade pockets to move toward the outlet, the drive mechanism having an axis of rotation; and an isolation element to isolate a first volume and a second volume in the scroll pumping apparatus, the isolation element including a first resilient annular member coupled, directly or indirectly, to the stationary scroll element, a second resilient annular member coupled, directly or indirectly, to the orbiting scroll element, and a tubular member coupled between the first and second annular members.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A scroll pump in accordance with the prior art is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A gas, typically air, is evacuated from a vacuum chamber or other equipment (not shown) connected to an inlet of the pump. A pump body includes a fixed scroll element <b>1</b> and a pump housing <b>6</b>. The pump includes an outlet <b>13</b> for exhaust of the gas being pumped.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The scroll pump includes a set of intermeshed, spiral-shaped scroll blades. The fixed scroll element <b>1</b> includes a stationary scroll blade <b>11</b> extending from a stationary scroll plate <b>12</b>. An orbiting scroll element <b>2</b> includes an orbiting scroll blade <b>21</b> extending from an orbiting scroll plate <b>22</b>. Scroll blades <b>11</b> and <b>21</b> extend axially toward each other and are intermeshed together to form interblade pockets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>. Tip seals <b>4</b>, located in grooves at the tips of the scroll blades, provide sealing between the scroll blades. Orbiting motion of scroll blade <b>21</b> relative to scroll blade <b>11</b> produces a scroll-type pumping action of the gas entering the interblade pockets <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> between the scroll blades.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A drive mechanism for the scroll pump includes a motor (not shown) coupled through a crankshaft <b>5</b> to orbiting scroll element <b>2</b>. An end <b>51</b> of crankshaft <b>5</b> has an eccentric configuration with respect to the main part of crankshaft <b>5</b> and is mounted to orbiting scroll element <b>2</b> through an orbiting plate bearing set <b>23</b>. Crankshaft <b>5</b> is mounted to pump housing <b>6</b> through main bearings <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>. When the motor is energized, crankshaft <b>5</b> rotates in main bearings <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>. The eccentric configuration of crankshaft end <b>51</b> produces orbiting motion of scroll blade <b>21</b> relative to scroll blade <b>11</b>, thereby pumping gas from the inlet to outlet <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The scroll pump may include a bellows assembly <b>7</b> coupled between a stationary component of the vacuum pump and the orbiting scroll element <b>2</b> so as to isolate a first volume <b>8</b> inside bellows assembly <b>7</b> and a second volume <b>9</b> outside bellows assembly <b>7</b>. In this prior art scroll pump, the bellows assembly <b>7</b> has a fixed connection at each end. Thus, any tendency of the orbiting scroll element <b>2</b> to rotate about its own center is inhibited by the torsional stiffness of bellows assembly <b>7</b>. Bellows assembly <b>7</b> is sealed to the stationary and moving components by seals (not shown). The bearings required to drive the pump are isolated from second volume <b>9</b> by bellows assembly <b>7</b>. Thus the vacuum space of second volume <b>9</b> is not contaminated by grease or oil as long as bellows assembly <b>7</b> and its end seals remain intact.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another scroll pump in accordance with the prior art is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this case, bellows assembly <b>7</b> is mounted to orbiting scroll element <b>2</b> by a non-rotatable connection (not shown in detail). Bellows assembly <b>7</b> is mounted to the pump housing <b>6</b> by a rotatable connection including ring <b>71</b> and seal <b>72</b>. The bellows assembly being thus rotatably mounted, does not inhibit rotation of the orbiting scroll element about the pump axis.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Two supports <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> are mounted to orbiting scroll element <b>2</b>. Two more supports (not shown) are mounted to a stationary component of the pump housing <b>6</b>, located at 90 degrees from the two supports <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> mounted to the orbiting scroll element <b>2</b>. A substantially rectangular strip <b>10</b> is connected to supports <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> by clamping plate <b>101</b> and screws <b>102</b>. Similarly, strip <b>10</b> is connected to the other two supports on the pump housing by clamping plates and screws (not shown). As described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,261,528, flexible strip <b>10</b> thus resists the tendency of orbiting scroll element <b>2</b> to rotate about its own axis.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional diagram of a scroll pump in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Isolation between volumes <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> is provided by an isolation element <b>11</b>. Isolation element <b>11</b> has a fixed connection to orbiting scroll element <b>2</b>, and a seal is formed using sealing elements in accordance with standard practice. Isolation element <b>11</b> is mounted to pump housing <b>6</b> with a rotatable joint including a ring <b>111</b> and a seal <b>112</b>. The design of the fixed and rotatable connections of isolation element <b>11</b> to orbiting scroll element <b>2</b> and housing <b>6</b> is a matter of existing practice and is not relevant to the invention. It will be understood that a variety of seal designs can be employed within the scope of the invention. It will be understood that the rotatable joint may be made from isolation element <b>11</b> to orbiting scroll element <b>2</b>, and the fixed joint to housing <b>6</b>, within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Flexible band <b>10</b> is used for synchronization in the same way as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It will be understood that other synchronization devices may be used within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Volume <b>8</b> inside the isolation element <b>11</b>, containing the bearings and rotating components of the pump, is separated from volume <b>9</b> outside the isolation element <b>11</b>, containing the vacuum space and the gas being pumped. The bearings required to drive the pump are isolated from volume <b>9</b> by isolation element <b>11</b>. Thus, contamination of the vacuum space by grease or oil cannot occur as long as isolation element <b>11</b> and its end seals remain intact.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional diagram of another scroll pump in accordance with embodiments of the invention. In this case, isolation element <b>11</b> is mounted in a non-rotatable fashion to both of orbiting scroll element <b>2</b> and pump housing <b>6</b>. Thus, any tendency of the orbiting scroll element <b>2</b> to rotate about its center is resisted by the torsional stiffness of isolation element <b>11</b>. Isolation element <b>11</b> is sealed to the stationary and moving components by seals (not shown). The bearings required to drive the pump are isolated from volume <b>9</b> by isolation element <b>11</b>. Thus contamination of the vacuum space by grease or oil cannot occur as long as isolation element <b>11</b> and its end seals remain intact. In this embodiment, additional synchronization devices are not required.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective cross-sectional view of an isolation element <b>120</b> in accordance with embodiments of the invention.

In applying the isolation element <b>120</b> to the scroll pump of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at least one end of the isolation element <b>120</b> is rotatably mounted to the housing or the orbiting scroll element. The other end may have a fixed connection to the housing or the orbiting scroll element, or may be rotatably mounted. In the scroll pump of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, both ends of the isolation element have a fixed connection, one connection to the housing and one connection to the orbiting scroll element. Sealing and fixing of the ends of the isolation element to the fixed and moving components of the pump are effected by standard sealing and fixing methods. Details of such fixing and sealing methods are known to those skilled in the art.</p>
