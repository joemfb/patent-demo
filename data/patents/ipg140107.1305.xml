<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The invention is based on a hydraulic unit for regulating the brake pressure in a vehicle brake system. Hydraulic units of such a type are the core component of an anti-lock vehicle brake system, of a drive slip vehicle brake system or of a vehicle brake system which regulates driving stability. The invention proposes a particularly advantageous arrangement of the required recesses in a housing block of a hydraulic unit. On account of the arrangement, the housing block can be reduced in terms of its dimensions, and can be produced with a lower weight and more simply in terms of production. For this purpose, according to the invention, the pressure fluid connection from one of the ports of the master brake cylinder to the suction side of one of the pump elements extends through the valve receptacle of the switching valve.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 35 USC 371 application of PCT/EP 2008/058449 filed on Jul. 1, 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention is based on a hydraulic regulating the brake pressure in a vehicle brake system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For safety reasons, recent models of motor vehicles are as a rule equipped with a vehicle brake system that has anti-lock, traction control, and/or vehicle control programs. The key element of such vehicle brake systems is a hydraulic unit disposed in the vehicle. The hydraulic unit is able to regulate the brake pressure at one or more wheels of the vehicle automatically as needed, with the aid of an electronic control unit, and thereby to stabilize the vehicle. The control unit to that end evaluates signals of sensors in the vehicle and triggers hydraulic components disposed on the hydraulic unit electronically accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the prior art, a vehicle brake system with driving stability control is well known. See the brochure published by Robert Bosch GmbH, entitled &#x201c;<i>Fahrstabilisierungssysteme</i>&#x201d; [Driving Stability Systems], page 90, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which appeared in the &#x201c;<i>Gelbe Reihe, Ausgabe </i>2004&#x201d; [&#x201c;Yellow Series, 2004 Edition&#x201d;], ISBN 3-7782-2026-8. To aid in understanding the invention, the circuit diagram disclosed there is appended as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and will now be described briefly:</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The known vehicle brake system includes a driver-actuated master cylinder <b>10</b> for generating a brake force by muscle power. Connected to the master cylinder <b>10</b> are two separate brake circuits <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, each with two wheel brakes <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>; <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. For individual-wheel regulation of the brake pressure, there is a hydraulic unit <b>24</b>. It is connected between the master cylinder <b>10</b> and the wheel brakes <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> and has different hydraulic components. Each wheel brake is preceded by a respective inlet valve <b>26</b> and followed by a respective outlet valve <b>28</b>. The inlet valves <b>26</b> control a brake pressure buildup and the outlet valves <b>28</b> control a brake pressure reduction at the associated wheel brakes <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>. One pump <b>32</b> per brake circuit, which can be driven by an electric motor <b>30</b>, is capable of aspirating brake fluid out of the associated wheel brake <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> via one of the outlet valves <b>28</b> for brake fluid reduction and pumping it into the brake circuit <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. To enable making a fast brake pressure buildup, a low-pressure reservoir <b>34</b> is connected between the outlet valves <b>28</b> and the pump <b>32</b> of one brake circuit <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Between the pump <b>32</b> and the low-pressure reservoir <b>34</b>, there is a check valve <b>36</b> that closes in the direction from the pump <b>32</b> to one of the wheel brakes <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>. This valve prevents the underpressure on the intake side of the pump <b>32</b> from being propagated into one of the wheel brakes <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each brake circuit <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> furthermore has a high-pressure on-off valve <b>38</b> and a reversing valve <b>40</b>. The high-pressure on-off valve <b>38</b> makes it possible for the pump <b>32</b>, as needed, to aspirate necessary additional brake fluid directly from the master cylinder <b>10</b>. The reversing valve <b>40</b>, in the event of its actuation, can block a pressure fluid connection from the wheel brakes <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>; <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> of a brake circuit <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> with the master cylinder <b>10</b>. This is necessary in case brake pressure at one of the wheel brakes <b>16</b>-<b>22</b> is supposed to be automatically built up regardless of what the driver is asking for. This situation occurs during a traction control operation and/or driving stability control operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, check valves <b>42</b> are provided for controlling bypass conduits around the inlet valves <b>26</b> and the reversing valves <b>40</b>. Thus a reduction of brake pressure is made possible even if the inlet valves <b>26</b> are closed, and a buildup of brake pressure is made possible if the reversing valves <b>40</b> are closed, or in other words during a traction control or driving stability control operation that is taking place. Line connections are also embodied on the hydraulic unit <b>24</b> in order to put the aforementioned components <b>26</b>-<b>42</b> into hydraulic contact with one another. These line connections are represented in the schematic illustration by straight connecting lines.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention to be described below is based on embodying this known hydraulic circuit diagram in an especially space-saving way that is easy to achieve in the production of a housing block of a hydraulic unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The object of the invention is to propose a hydraulic unit which with regard to its outside dimensions is especially compact and whose housing block can be made more economically because of reduced mechanical machining effort and expense.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Because of its small dimensions, a hydraulic unit of the invention has a lower weight. Moreover, the proposed hydraulic unit makes highly dynamic brake pressure regulating operations possible, because the hydraulic line connections are especially short and have only few changes of course.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a housing block <b>50</b> of a hydraulic unit <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) known from the prior art. This housing block <b>50</b> is formed by a solid metal plate, which is provided with many recesses by means of metal-cutting postmachining. A front side <b>52</b> of the housing block <b>50</b> is graduated at a right angle a single time over its entire width. A resultant step <b>54</b> divides the housing block <b>50</b> into a thicker part, located toward the top in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and by comparison a recessed, thinner part, disposed in the lower part of the drawing. A back side <b>56</b>, opposite the front side <b>52</b>, and a left and right side <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> and a top and a bottom side <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> of the housing block <b>50</b> are formed by plane-parallel faces.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the lower part of the housing block <b>50</b>, there is a first recess <b>66</b>, which is intended for receiving a drive element, not shown. This first recess <b>66</b> is stepped multiple times from the outside inward in its diameter and ends in blind borelike fashion in the interior of the housing block <b>50</b>. For actuating the drive element, an electric motor, also not shown, can be secured from the outside to the lower part of the front side <b>52</b>. A supply to this electric motor is effected via contact elements, which can be passed through a through bore <b>68</b> above the recess <b>66</b> for the drive element to the back side <b>56</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>. This back side <b>56</b> serves the purpose of securing an electronic control unit (not shown), to which the contact elements can be connected, so that the electric motor is triggerable as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Two pump elements are driven to a reciprocating stroke motion by the drive element. These pump elements are disposed on the housing block <b>50</b> in pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. These pump receptacles are formed by stepped bores, which begin at the two sides <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> of the housing block <b>50</b> and discharge into the recess <b>66</b> for the drive element. These pump bores <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> extend horizontally and coaxially to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Two recesses discharge in the upper part of the housing block <b>50</b>, toward the front side <b>52</b>. They form the hydraulic connections <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of the hydraulic unit for the two brake circuits of an external master cylinder (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), for independent action on two brake circuits. Further hydraulic connections <b>78</b> are located on the top side <b>62</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>. These connections <b>78</b> are provided for hydraulic contacting of the wheel brakes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; <b>16</b>-<b>22</b>) of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Opposite the connections <b>78</b> of the wheel brakes, there are two recesses <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> for low-pressure reservoirs on the bottom side <b>64</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>. Each of the low-pressure reservoirs is assigned to one of the brake circuits (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>). Typically, known spring-loaded piston reservoirs are used as the low-pressure reservoirs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Many identical valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>106</b> begin at the back side <b>56</b> of the housing block <b>50</b> and all end in blind borelike fashion in the interior of the housing block <b>50</b>. These valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>106</b> are intended for receiving the valve part of various kinds of solenoid valves (not shown). Coils of these solenoid valves are received in the electronic control unit and surround the portions of the valve parts that protrude past the back side <b>56</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>, once the control unit is mounted on that back side <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>106</b> are disposed in rows. There are in all four horizontally extending rows R<b>1</b>-R<b>4</b> of valve receptacles, and the rows are oriented parallel to one another and extend at different levels of the housing block <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first row R<b>1</b> oriented toward the top side <b>62</b> of the housing block <b>50</b> includes four valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>90</b>, which are intended for receiving the inlet valves. Located below this first row R<b>1</b> are the four valve receptacles <b>92</b>-<b>98</b> for the outlet valves, in a second row R<b>2</b>. The inlet and outlet valves are each associated in pairs with one of the wheel brakes. They serve, in the known manner, the purpose of pressure regulation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A third row R<b>3</b> of valve receptacles is partly concealed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. This row includes only two valve receptacles <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, which are intended for the disposition of the high-pressure on-off valves of the vehicle brake system. Each brake circuit is equipped with one such high-pressure on-off valve. The high-pressure on-off valves control a hydraulic connection from the master cylinder (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; <b>10</b>) to the intake side of the pump elements in the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. A fourth row R<b>4</b>, oriented toward the bottom side <b>64</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>, likewise includes two valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, specifically for the so-called reversing valves of the vehicle brake system. Each of these is again present only once per brake circuit. These two valve receptacles are located closer to the sides <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> of the housing block <b>50</b> than the valve receptacles <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of the high-pressure on-off valves of the third row R<b>3</b>, which are located closer to the center of the housing block <b>50</b>. The reversing valves as needed block an existing pressure fluid connection from the wheel brakes to the master cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The above-described elements <b>70</b>-<b>106</b>, with the exception of the recess <b>66</b> and through bore <b>68</b> for the drive element and for the contact elements of the electric motor, communicate hydraulically with one another through conduits that carry pressure fluid. For technical production reasons, these pressure fluid conduits are each oriented perpendicular to one of the outsides of the housing block <b>50</b> and thus may optionally meet at a right angle to one another in the interior of the housing block <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Two inlet valve conduits <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, each beginning at a respective side <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>, connect two side-by-side valve receptacles <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>; <b>88</b>, <b>90</b>, respectively, for the inlet valves. The two inlet valve conduits <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are embodied as blind bores. They extend coaxially to one another in the horizontal direction and after their production are closed from the outside in pressure-fluid-tight fashion. As a rule, balls in the region of the orifice are press-fitted in for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Two outlet valve conduits <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, which likewise begin at the respective sides <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> of the housing block <b>50</b> and are embodied as horizontally extending blind bores, extend parallel and offset toward the back side <b>56</b> of the housing block <b>50</b> to the inlet valve conduits <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and each connect two of the valve receptacles <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>; <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> of the outlet valves with one another. These outlet valve conduits <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are likewise closed from the outside after their production.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Two vertical conduits <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> begin near the sides <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> from the top side <b>62</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>. They each intersect one of the inlet valve conduits <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and each penetrate one of the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and end each in one of the valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the reversing valves. These vertical conduits <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are likewise closed from outside in a subsequent operation.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A first vertically extended connection conduit <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> extends from the bottom of each recess <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> for a low-pressure reservoir. This connection conduit penetrates the valve receptacle <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of the high-pressure on-off valves and ends in one of the cross conduits <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, which begin at the connections <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> for a brake circuit of the master cylinder. Each connection conduit <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> is put into contact with one of the valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the reversing valves by a horizontal bore <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> that is to be closed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Moreover, there are hydraulic connections <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> from the valve receptacles <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of the high-pressure on-off valves to the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. These hydraulic connections are shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, since they are hidden by the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One second connection conduit each <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, beginning at the bottom of a respective one of the recesses <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> for a low-pressure reservoir, established a direct pressure fluid connection between the recesses <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> and one of the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. Further connection conduits <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> connect the recesses <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> of a low-pressure reservoir directly with one of the two valve receptacles <b>94</b>; <b>96</b> of the outlet valves.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Finally, each two valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>90</b>; <b>92</b>-<b>98</b>, located one above the other, for an inlet valve and for an outlet valve are put into hydraulic contact with a respective connection <b>78</b> of a wheel brake. This purpose is served by coupling conduits <b>146</b>-<b>152</b>, which begin at the bottom of the connections <b>78</b> of the wheel brakes and end in one of the valve receptacles <b>92</b>-<b>98</b> of the outlet valves. In all, four such coupling conduits <b>146</b>-<b>152</b> are embodied on the housing block <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a vehicle brake system in accordance with the hydraulic circuit diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each brake circuit can be divided into a so-called intake region and a system region. The intake region includes all the hydraulic components and pressure fluid connections that are to be associated with the intake side of an associated pump, while the system region includes all the components and pressure fluid connections that are disposed on the compression side of the associated pump. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the recesses included in the intake region of a brake circuit are emphasized by a greater thickness of the lines representing them. The intake region of a brake circuit includes the respective connections <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of the master cylinder, the valve receptacle <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of the high-pressure on-off valve, and the pressure fluid conduits <b>122</b>, <b>126</b> and connection <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the prior art described, this intake region leads from a connection <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of the master cylinder directly to a valve receptacle <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of a high-pressure on-off valve and from there directly onward to a pump receptacle <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and to one of the recesses <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> of a low-pressure reservoir. The valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the reversing valves are located on the far side of that intake region. They are each connected, by means of horizontal bores <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> to be produced separately, to the intake region and are moreover supplied with pressure fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Because of this arrangement, however, the establishment of a flow is prevented when the reversing valve is closed and the high-pressure on-off valve is open, in the region around the valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the reversing valves.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by comparison shows an advantageous disposition according to the invention of the recesses on a housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032;. This housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032; can now be embodied in parallelepiped fashion with pairs of plane-parallel, ungraduated outer sides. Its outside dimensions are markedly smaller than those of the housing block <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Consequently, the proposed housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032; has a lesser weight. Moreover, its production requires markedly less time, since the production of the recesses necessitates fewer metal-cutting machining operations. In the ensuing description, the same reference numerals have been used for those recesses that correspond functionally to those of the housing block <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The recess <b>66</b> for the drive element, the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, the connections <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> for the master cylinder, and the connections <b>78</b> for the wheel brakes, as well as the recesses <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> for the low-pressure reservoirs are located in the same relative positions as in the prior art of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, so that repetition in this respect is unnecessary. The essential distinction of this housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032; over that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is in the disposition and hydraulic contacting of the valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>106</b> on the back side <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">These valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>106</b> are again disposed in four parallel rows R<b>1</b>-R<b>4</b>, extending horizontally at different levels on the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032;. However, the first row R<b>1</b>, oriented toward the top side <b>62</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032;, now includes only the two valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the reversing valves of a dual-circuit vehicle brake system.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Below it is a second row R<b>2</b> with a total of four valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>90</b>. These are staggered relative to the valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the first row R<b>1</b>. These valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>90</b> receive the inlet valves of the vehicle brake system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A third row R<b>3</b>, again comprising only two valve receptacles <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, is disposed slightly below the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> of this housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032;. These valve receptacles <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> are intended for receiving the high-pressure on-off valves. With their inner end, they intersect the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> and as a result establish a pressure fluid connection, controllable by the high-pressure on-off valves, with the pump elements disposed in the pump receptacles. The valve receptacles <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> are staggered relative to the valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>90</b> of the second row R<b>2</b> and are located perpendicularly below the valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the first row R<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fourth row R<b>4</b>, again comprising four valve receptacles <b>92</b>-<b>98</b>, which receive the outlet valves of the vehicle brake system, are located oriented toward the bottom side <b>64</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032;. The valve receptacles <b>92</b>-<b>98</b> of the fourth row R<b>4</b> and those of the second row R<b>2</b> are located vertically one below the other.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The line connections for the hydraulic coupling of the receptacles, for the hydraulic components are made in this exemplary embodiment as well by means of bores extending perpendicular to one of the outer sides of the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032;, so that they may optionally intersect at a right angle in the interior of the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Two horizontally extending cross conduits <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> that are coaxial with one another begin at the two sides <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032; and end in the two valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the reversing valves. Spaced apart below are two parallel-extending inlet valve bores <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. These again begin at the two sides <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032; and each connect the respective two valve receptacles <b>84</b>, <b>86</b>; <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> of the inlet valves of one brake circuit with one another. The inlet valve bores <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> are embodied as blind bores and end in the respective inner valve receptacle <b>86</b>; <b>88</b>. Both the two cross conduits <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> and the two inlet valve bores <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> are closed from the outside after their production.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For the production of a hydraulic connection of the cross conduits <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> with the inlet valve bores <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, vertical conduits <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> are provided. They are located close to the sides <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032; and begin at the top side <b>62</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032;. They discharge into a respective one of the pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. On their way there, the vertical conduits <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> intersect both one of the cross conduits <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> and one of the inlet valve conduits <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. The vertical conduits <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> are likewise closed from the outside after their production.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A total of four blind bores <b>212</b>-<b>218</b> extend again in the vertical direction, but relative to the above-described vertical conduits <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> they extend in a plane that is offset toward the back side <b>56</b> of the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032;. These blind bores each begin at the bottom of the connections <b>78</b> of the wheel brakes; they then penetrate the valve receptacles <b>84</b>-<b>90</b> of the inlet valves, and end in the valve receptacles <b>92</b>-<b>98</b> of the outlet valves.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The valve receptacles <b>92</b>-<b>98</b> of the outlet valves of the wheel brakes are coupled, via short, vertically extending cross conduits <b>220</b>-<b>226</b>, with one of the recesses <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> for a low-pressure reservoir on the bottom side <b>64</b> of the housing block <b>50</b><i>r</i>. Besides the cross conduits <b>220</b>-<b>226</b>, a respective third vertical connecting conduit <b>228</b>, <b>230</b> extends from the bottom of the recess <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> of a low-pressure reservoir along a straight and vertical course to the valve receptacle <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of one of the high-pressure on-off valves.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Two vertical bores <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, made from the top side <b>62</b> into the housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032; and closed from the outside after their production, intersect one of the connections <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of the master cylinder, and each penetrate one of the valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the reversing valves and end in the one of the valve receptacles <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of the high-pressure on-off valves. Moreover, each of the vertical bores <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> effects a connection with the respective pump receptacles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If in this exemplary embodiment the intake regions of the two pumps are looked at (characterized by a widened line thickness of the applicable recesses), it can be seen that the pressure fluid connections from one of the connections <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of the master cylinder to one of the valve receptacles <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> of the high-pressure on-off valves extend through one of the valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the reversing valves. The effect of this is such that with the reversing valve closed and the high-pressure on-off valve open, flows of brake fluid that occur also cause flows in the regions of the valve receptacles <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the reversing valves. This fundamental distinction from the subject of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> makes a housing block <b>50</b>&#x2032; possible that has more-compact outer dimensions, a lower weight, and simpler metal-cutting machining.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The foregoing relates to the preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, it being understood that other variants and embodiments thereof are possible within the spirit and scope of the invention, the latter being defined by the appended claims.</p>
