<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0109344, filed on Oct. 25, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to data transmission between integrated circuit chips.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Integrated circuit chips are often not stand-alone chips but chips that operate in dependence to other neighboring chips. For example, memory chips such as DRAM and Flash memories exchange data with a memory controller, and a CPU exchanges data with various chips on a mother board. With the development of technology, progressively higher data transmission rate is desired. However, as the transmission frequency of data increases, a data-eye for recognizing data may be gradually reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an example, when a data packet is successively transmitted, a data-eye for data transferred at the initial stage among data of the data packet is smaller than that of subsequent data due to noise or the like. For example, when data of a data packet including <b>100</b> data are successively transmitted, a data-eye for three data transferred at the initial stage is smaller than a data-eye for subsequent <b>97</b> data. In this case, data recognition may not be properly performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment of the present invention is directed to an integrated chip capable of preventing a data recognition error caused by reduction in data-eye of data transferred at the initial stage among data which are successively transferred, and a system having the same.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention includes a first chip <b>100</b>, a second chip <b>200</b>, a data channel DATA CHANNEL, and a strobe channel STROBE CHANNEL.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first and second chips <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> refer to integrated circuits (ICs) exchanging data through the data channel DATA CHANNEL. The first and second chips <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> may include any ICs such as CPU, GPU, DRAM, flash memory, and memory controller, which transmit and receive data.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Through the data channel DATA CHANNEL, the first and second chips <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> exchange data with each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates one data channel DATA CHANNEL, but the system may include a plurality of data channels. For example, 32 data channels may be provided between a graphic DRAM and a GPU, and eight data channels may be provided between a flash memory and a flash controller.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Through the strobe channel STROBE CHANNEL, a signal to strobe data transmitted to the data channel DATA CHANNEL is transmitted. The signal to strobe data may include a system clock signal, and a dedicated signal to strobe data may be used in addition to the system clock signal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Hereinafter, the term &#x201c;data packet&#x201d; is used to refer to a bundle of data successively transferred through the data channel DATA CHANNEL. During a program/read operation of a flash memory, about 500 bits of data are successively transferred to one data channel DATA CHANNEL. In this case, the 500 bits of data form one data packet. Furthermore, in the case of DRAM operating at a burst length (BL) of eight, eight data bits are successively transferred to one data channel DATA CHANNEL in response to one read command, and (number of successively-applied read commands)*eight data bits are successively transferred in response to the successively-applied read commands. In this case, (number of successively-applied read commands)*eight corresponds to the number of data bits forming one data packet.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above in the background, when data are transferred through the data channel DATA CHANNEL, the data-eye for data (e.g., a time window for detecting data) transferred at the initial stage is reduced more than the data-eye of subsequent data. In order to address such a feature, data may be transferred at a low rate during the initial period and transferred at a high rate after the initial period, when transferred through the data channel.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are flow charts showing data transmission methods in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, some data bits D<b>00</b> to D<b>03</b> among data bits D<b>00</b> to D<b>09</b> of a data packet may be transmitted at a low frequency of 400 Mhz during the initial period of data packet transmission at step S<b>210</b>_A, and data bits D<b>04</b> to D<b>99</b> may be transmitted at a high frequency of 500 Mhz after the initial period. Furthermore, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, some data bits D<b>00</b> to D<b>03</b> among data bits D<b>00</b> to D<b>99</b> of a data packet may be transmitted at a frequency that gradually increases from 400 Mhz to 500 Mhz during the initial period (for example, first to five cycles) of data packet transmission at step S<b>210</b>_B, and data bits D<b>04</b> to D<b>99</b> may be transmitted at a high frequency of 500 Mhz after the initial period.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> or <b>2</b>B in which the data transmission rate of the initial period is set differently from the data transmission rate after the initial period may be used in both of the first and second chips <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> or used in any one of the first and second chips <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, a case in which 100 data bits form a data packet and four data bits are transferred during the initial period has been taken as an example. Furthermore, the low frequency was set to 400 Mhz, and the high frequency was set to 500 Mhz. However, this is exemplary only, and the numbers may be changed according to design needs.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The length of the initial period may be set according to a period of a data-eye designed to avoid malfunctions when a data packet is transmitted. For example, when 100 data bits are transmitted, the size of a data-eye may be reduced for two data bits transmitted at the initial stage. In this case, the length of the initial period may be set to a period where two data bits are transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, a difference between the high frequency and the low frequency may be set based on a difference between the size of the data-eye of data transmitted during the initial period and the size of the data-eye of data transmitted after the initial period. For example, when the data-eye of the data transmitted during the initial period is smaller by 20% than the data-eye of the data transmitted after the initial period, the difference between the high frequency and the low frequency may be set to 20%.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The second chip <b>200</b> includes an internal circuit <b>910</b>, a data output circuit <b>920</b>, a data input circuit <b>930</b>, and a strobe input circuit <b>950</b>. The second chip <b>200</b> uses the strobe signal STROBE received from the first chip <b>100</b> through the strobe input circuit <b>950</b> during data input/output operation. Here, the second chip <b>200</b> does not generate a strobe signal, and both of the data output circuit <b>920</b> and the data input circuit <b>910</b> use the strobe signal STROBE transferred from the first chip <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, some data of a data packet are transmitted at a low frequency during the initial period of the transmission period of the data packet, and the other data of the data packet are transmitted at a high frequency after the initial period. Therefore, an error of the initial period may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Furthermore, since a problem occurring in the initial period of the data transmission may be solved, data may be transmitted at a higher rate after the initial period. As a result, the transmission rate may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">While the present invention has been described with respect to the specific embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
