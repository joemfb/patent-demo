<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an image processing apparatus and an image processing method, more particularly, to an image processing apparatus, an image processing method, and a program that are configured to be suitably used in switching three-dimensional moving images allowing stereoscopic viewing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the emergence of television receivers capable of displaying three-dimensional moving images (hereafter referred to as 3D video) that allows stereoscopic viewing, it is expected for 3D video images to be used for not only the content in particular genres such as movies but also the content in various other genres as television programs, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the process of producing a television program for example, an editing task for switching from video A to video B is executed frequently. This holds true with the process of creating content based on 3D video and a switcher (an edit instruction apparatus) suitable for the switching between three-dimensional images for example is proposed (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 8-321992 below for example).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Now, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, there is shown three methods of switching from video A to video B. To be more specific, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a method of instantaneously switching (instantaneous switching) from video A to video B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a method (wiping) of switching sequentially from one end of video A to video B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows a method (mixing, fade-in or fade-out) of switching from video A to video B by gradually lowering the luminance of video and gradually raising the luminance of video B.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In switching 3D video images, any of the methods shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref> may be used. However, this may causes problems that are never observed with two-dimensional video images.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To be more specific, in the case where 3D video A is switched to 3D video B by the wipe processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a video halfway in switching may occur if the area of 3D video A and the area of 3D video B exist together as with the center video shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a state in which a video halfway in switching is seen from the extension of the vertical axis of that screen. It should be noted that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the distance between the cross-hatched pentagons on the screen is indicative of the parallax of 3D video A and the distance between the triangles on the screen is indicative of the parallax of 3D video B. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, setting the depth obtained by the parallax of 3D video A occupying the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> toward the viewer from the screen and the depth obtained by the parallax of 3D video B occupying the left side of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> from the viewer into the screen may increase the difference between the depths of a subject existing on the screen. If this happens, the increased difference not only gives the viewer looking at the video the sense of abnormalcy but also fatigues the eyes of the viewer, eventually making the 3D video hard to view.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It should be noted that the instantaneous switching shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and the mixing switching shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> are known to provide a video that is not hard to view as compared with the wiping switching shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the present invention addresses the above-identified and other problems associated with related-art methods and apparatuses and solves the addressed problems by providing an image processing apparatus and an image processing method that are configured to switch 3D video images without giving the viewer the sense of abnormalcy with the video and burdening the eyes of the viewer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In carrying out the invention and according to one embodiment thereof, there is provided an image processing apparatus for editing a 3D (Three Dimensional) video. This image processing apparatus has switching means for switching a video to be used as an editing result from a first 3D video to a second 3D video by any one of a plurality of switching methods; parallax measuring means for measuring a parallax in a 3D video to compute a depth of the 3D video on the basis of a measured parallax; comparing means for comparing a difference between a first depth computed on the first 3D video and a second depth computed on the second 3D video that is different from the first 3D video with a predetermined threshold; and restricting means for restricting an operation of the switching means in accordance with a comparison result obtained by the comparing means.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The two or more of switching methods includes at least wiping and, if the difference between the first depth and the second depth is found to be equal to or higher than the predetermined threshold, then the restricting means controls the switching means to restrict the switching from the first 3D video to the second 3D video by the wiping.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above-mentioned image processing apparatus can further have holding means for holding the first 3D video and the second 3D video as still images, wherein</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">the switching means uses the still image held in the holding means for a video to be used as an edited result during a period in which the first 3D video is switched to the second 3D image.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The above-mentioned two or more switching methods include at least wiping, instantaneous switching, and mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">If the difference between the first depth and the second depth is found to be equal to or higher than the predetermined threshold, then the restricting means controls the switching means to execute switching from the first 3D video to the second 3D video by a switching method other than the wiping.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In carrying out the invention and according to another embodiment thereof, there is provided an image processing method for an image processing apparatus for editing a 3D video. This method has the steps of: switching a video to be used as an editing result from a first 3D video to a second 3D video by any one of a plurality of switching methods; measuring a parallax in a 3D video to compute a depth of the 3D video on the basis of a measured parallax; comparing a difference between a first depth computed on the first 3D video and a second depth computed on the second 3D video that is different from the first 3D video with a predetermined threshold; and restricting an operation of the switching step in accordance with a comparison result obtained in the comparing step.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment of the present invention, the parallaxes of 3D videos are measured. On the basis of the measured parallaxes, depths of the 3D videos are computed. Then, a difference between the computed depths of the first 3D video and the second 3D video is compared with a predetermined threshold.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This invention will be described in further detail by way of best modes (hereafter referred to as embodiments) thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">1. Embodiments</heading>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">[Exemplary Configuration of a 3D Video Editing Apparatus]</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown an exemplary configuration of a 3D video editing apparatus practiced as one embodiment of the invention. This 3D video editing apparatus <b>10</b> is configured by an operation input block <b>11</b>, a control block <b>12</b>, switchers <b>13</b>L and <b>13</b>R, and a 3D video processing block <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The operation input block <b>11</b> generates an operation signal corresponding to a user operation done and outputs the generated operation signal to the control block <b>12</b>. The control block <b>12</b> outputs a control signal on the basis of the supplied operation signal to control each of the component blocks of the 3D video editing apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Under the control of the control signal supplied from the control block <b>12</b> on the basis of user's selecting operation, the switchers <b>13</b>L and <b>13</b>R select a maximum of two video sources from among entered M (<b>9</b> for example) types of video sources (may include not only 3D video sources but also 2D video sources) and outputs the selected video sources to the 3D video processing block <b>14</b>. Further, the switchers <b>13</b>L and <b>13</b>R selects one of M entered video sources, selects two or more types to synthesize the selected video sources, and switches between the selections, thereby outputting a resultant video as edited content to the subsequent stage. It should be noted that the video for the left eye of a video source is entered in the switcher <b>13</b>L and the video for the right eye corresponding to the left-eye video entered in the switcher <b>13</b>L is entered in the switcher <b>13</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The 3D video processing block <b>14</b> measures the parallaxes of the left-eye video entered from the switcher <b>13</b>L and the corresponding right-eye video entered from the switcher <b>13</b>R and, on the basis of a resultant measurement, adjusts the parallaxes of the left-eye video and the right-eye video. Further, the 3D video processing block <b>14</b> holds the videos for the left eye and the right eye and outputs these videos as still images. Then, the 3D video processing block <b>14</b> outputs the processed video as the video source to be entered in the switcher <b>13</b>L or the switcher <b>13</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary external configuration of the operation input block <b>11</b>. The operation input block <b>11</b> is arranged with a matrix switch <b>21</b>, a switching method select switch <b>22</b>, a fader lever <b>23</b>, and an auto fade switch <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The matrix switch <b>21</b> is made up of horizontal M&#xd7;vertical N switches arranged in a matrix. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, M=9 and N=5 amounting to a total of 45 switches.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The horizontal direction of the matrix switch <b>21</b> is related with M types of video sources that are entered in the switcher <b>13</b>L and the switcher <b>13</b>R. In this figure, from the left, VTR<b>1</b> video source, VTR<b>2</b> video source, CAM<b>1</b> video source, CAM<b>2</b> video source, Main video source, Sub video source, Fig video source, 3DBOX<b>1</b> video source, and 3DBOX<b>2</b> video source, in this sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The vertical direction of the matrix switch <b>21</b> is related with N types of image selections. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, selection as Key<b>1</b>, selection as Key<b>2</b>, selection as Out<b>1</b>, selection as Out<b>2</b>, and selection as Out<b>3</b> are related in this sequence. In what follows, the description will be made with the video (the first video) before switching in content being Out<b>1</b> and the video (the second video) after switching being Out<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be noted that M switches on each row (in the horizontal direction) can be turned on only one at a time. For example, when the switch second to the left end on the top row is turned on, the video source of VTR<b>2</b> is selected as the first key video (Key<b>1</b>). For example, when the switch third from the left end on the third row from top is turned on, the video source of CAM<b>1</b> is selected as the first output video (Out<b>1</b>). Further, for example, when the switch fourth from the left end on the fourth row from top is selected, the video source of CAM<b>2</b> is selected as the second output video (Out<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The switching method select switch <b>22</b> is used to select a switching method for switching the first output video in display to the second output video, for example. Every time the switching method select switch <b>22</b> is turned on, the switching methods are changed from instantaneous switching to wiping to mixing to instantaneous switching, and so on, for example. It should be noted that the switching method select switch <b>22</b> may be configured by three switches to which instantaneous switching, wiping, and mixing are assigned. Alternatively, two or more variations (digital special effect wiping for example) to wiping may be arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The fader lever <b>23</b> controls the switching timing of switching the first output video in display to the second output video and is slid up and down for control. A state in which the fader lever <b>23</b> is set to the topmost position is representative of switching start time (the fader value=0%). A state in which the fader lever <b>23</b> is set to the bottom position is representative of switching end time (the fader value=100%). Sliding the fader lever <b>23</b> at a desired speed, the user can control the switching speed as desired. It should be noted that various controls may be arranged to allow the user to controls the details of switching operations.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The auto fade switch <b>24</b> is used to automatically slide the fader lever <b>23</b> at a predetermined speed. Turning on the auto fade switch <b>24</b> allows the first output video in display to be automatically switched to the second video output at a predetermined speed without user's operating the fader lever <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary configuration of the switcher <b>13</b>L. The switcher <b>13</b>L is made up of an auxiliary output block <b>31</b> and an input selection block <b>32</b>. It should be noted that the switcher <b>13</b>R is configured in substantially the same manner as the switcher <b>13</b>L, so that the description of the switcher <b>13</b>R is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The auxiliary output block <b>31</b> is configured by M (hereafter described as M=9) types of SDI input lines <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>41</b>-<b>9</b>, auxiliary output select bus <b>42</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>42</b>-<b>2</b>, and video manipulation units (V Proc) <b>43</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>43</b>-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The SDI input lines <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>41</b>-<b>9</b> are entered with video sources VTR<b>1</b>, VTR<b>2</b>, CAM<b>1</b>, CAM<b>2</b>, Main, Sub, Fig, 3DBOX<b>1</b>, and 3DBOX<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, respectively. It should be noted that the SDI input lines <b>41</b>-<b>8</b> and <b>41</b>-<b>9</b> are entered with the results obtained by processing two types of video sources by the 3D video processing block <b>14</b> among the video sources entered in the SDI input lines <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>41</b>-<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The auxiliary output select bus <b>42</b>-<b>1</b> outputs one of the seven types (for the left eye) of video sources entered in the SDI input lines <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>41</b>-<b>7</b> to the video manipulation unit <b>43</b>-<b>1</b> under the control of the control block <b>12</b>. The auxiliary output select bus <b>42</b>-<b>2</b> outputs one of the seven types (for the left eye) of video sources entered in the SDI input lines <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>41</b>-<b>7</b> to the video manipulation unit <b>43</b>-<b>2</b> under the control of the control block <b>12</b>. The video manipulation unit <b>43</b>-<b>1</b> executes predetermined video manipulation processing on the video source from the auxiliary output select bus <b>42</b>-<b>1</b> and outputs the processed video source to the 3D video processing block <b>14</b>. The video manipulation unit <b>43</b>-<b>2</b> executes predetermined video manipulation processing on the video source from the auxiliary output select bus <b>42</b>-<b>2</b> and outputs the processed video source to the 3D video processing block <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The input selection block <b>32</b> is made up of manipulation buses <b>44</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>44</b>-<b>2</b>, input buses <b>45</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>45</b>-<b>2</b>, a reserved input bus <b>46</b>, a key image manipulation unit <b>47</b>, video manipulation units <b>48</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>48</b>-<b>3</b>, and a synthesizing unit <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The manipulation buses <b>44</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>44</b>-<b>2</b> output one of the nine types of video sources entered in the SDI input lines <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>41</b>-<b>9</b> to the key image manipulation unit <b>47</b> under the control of the control block <b>12</b>. The input bus <b>45</b>-<b>1</b> outputs one of the nine types of video sources entered in the SDI input lines <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>41</b>-<b>9</b> to the video manipulation unit <b>48</b>-<b>1</b> as the first video before switching content to be outputted as a result of the editing by the 3D video editing apparatus <b>10</b>. The input bus <b>45</b>-<b>2</b> outputs one of the nine types of video sources entered in the SDI input lines <b>41</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>41</b>-<b>9</b> to the video manipulation unit <b>48</b>-<b>2</b> as the second video before switching content to be outputted as a result of the editing by the 3D video editing apparatus <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The key image manipulation unit <b>47</b> executes predetermined manipulation processing with the video source entered from the manipulation buses <b>44</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>44</b>-<b>2</b> as a key image and outputs a resultant video to the auxiliary output select buses <b>42</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>42</b>-<b>2</b> and the synthesizing unit <b>49</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Under the control of the synthesizing unit <b>49</b>, the synthesizing unit <b>49</b> selects videos entered from the key image manipulation unit <b>47</b> and manipulation buses <b>44</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>44</b>-<b>3</b> and synthesizes the selected videos, thereby generating the video of content that is outputted from the output line as an editing result. In addition, the synthesizing unit <b>49</b> executes switching processing for switching from the first video entered from the manipulation bus <b>44</b>-<b>1</b> to the second video entered from the manipulation bus <b>44</b>-<b>2</b> as the video of content to be outputted from the output line as an editing result. Details of this processing will be described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exemplary configuration of the 3D video processing block <b>14</b>. The 3D video processing block <b>14</b> is configured by a parallax measuring unit <b>51</b>, a comparison unit <b>52</b>, frame memories <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>53</b>-<b>4</b>, and an image processing unit <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The parallax measuring unit <b>51</b> measures parallaxes of the left-eye video source entered from the switcher <b>13</b>L via the input line INL<b>1</b> and the right-eye video source entered from the switcher <b>13</b>R via the input line INR<b>1</b>. In addition, the parallax measuring unit <b>51</b> computes a depth (a first depth) obtained from the measured parallax and outputs the obtained depth to the comparison unit <b>52</b>. It should be noted that, in order to make distinction between the case where the depth is in front of the screen (toward the viewer) and the case where the depth is in the back of the screen, the depth in front of the screen is indicated by a negative value and the depth in the back of the screen is indicated by a positive value, for example. Because the parallax and the depths are not obviously uniform all over the screen, maximum values, minimum values, or mode values are used for parallax and depth values.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The parallax measuring unit <b>51</b> also measures parallaxes of a left-eye video source entered from the switcher <b>13</b>L via input line INL<b>2</b> and a right-eye video source entered from the switcher <b>13</b>R via input line INR<b>2</b> corresponding to the left-eye video source. In addition, the parallax measuring unit <b>51</b> computes a depth (a second depth) obtained by the measured parallax and outputs the obtained depth to the comparison unit <b>52</b>. It should be noted that the measurement of the parallaxes and the computation of the depths may be executed by applying existing techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, the parallax measuring unit <b>51</b> outputs the video source with the parallax measured to the frame memories <b>53</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>53</b>-<b>4</b>.</p>

<p id="h-0007" num="0000">[Description of Operation 1]</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The following describes an operation of the 3D video editing apparatus <b>10</b>, in which, of the video sources to be entered in the 3D video editing apparatus <b>10</b>, the video source of CAM<b>1</b> is used for the content to be outputted and then the CAM<b>1</b> video source is switched to the CAM<b>2</b> video source, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">First, in order to set the CAM<b>1</b> video source to the video before switching (the first video), the user turns on the third switch from the left end on the third row from top of the matrix switch <b>21</b> of the operation input block <b>11</b>. Also, in order to specify the CAM<b>2</b> video source as the video after switching (the second video) in advance, the user turns on the fourth switch from the left end on the fourth row from top of the matrix switch <b>21</b>. Also, the user selects one of the switching methods by operating the switching method select switch <b>22</b> of the operation input block <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Under the control of the control block <b>12</b> in response to the user operation done on the matrix switch <b>21</b>, the left-eye video source of CAM<b>1</b> entered in the SDI input line <b>41</b>-<b>3</b> is selected on the input bus <b>45</b>-<b>1</b> of the switcher <b>13</b>L to be entered in the synthesizing unit <b>49</b> via the video manipulation unit <b>48</b>-<b>1</b>. Also, the left-eye video source of CAM<b>2</b> entered in the SDI input line <b>41</b>-<b>4</b> is selected on the input bus <b>45</b>-<b>2</b> and the selected video source is entered in the synthesizing unit <b>49</b> via the video manipulation unit <b>48</b>-<b>2</b>. Then, because it is currently before video switching, the left-eye video source of CAM<b>1</b> is outputted from the synthesizing unit <b>49</b>.

However, in the switching period (the period from fader values 0% to 100%), the left-eye video source of CAM<b>1</b> coming via the 3D video processing block <b>14</b> entered in the SDI input line <b>41</b>-<b>8</b> is selected on input bus <b>45</b>-<b>1</b> of the switcher <b>13</b>L and the left-eye video source coming via the 3D video processing block <b>14</b> entered in the SDI input line <b>41</b>-<b>9</b> is selected on the input bus <b>45</b>-<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, it is also practicable to output still images during a switching period and, in resuming the use of moving images entered later, perform mixing effects (fade-in and fade-out) over the still image stored in the frame memory <b>53</b> and then the moving image in a predetermined duration (for 30 frames for example), thereby executing the switching that further reduces the sense of abnormalcy felt by the viewer.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In step S<b>3</b>, the parallax measuring unit <b>51</b> of the 3D video processing block <b>14</b> measures a parallax of the first video (in this example, the video source of CAM<b>1</b>) to compute a first depth based on the obtained parallax, outputting the computed depth to the comparison unit <b>52</b>. In step S<b>4</b>, the parallax measuring unit <b>51</b> measures a parallax of a second video (in this example, the video source of CAM<b>2</b>) to compute a second depth based the obtained parallax, outputting the computed depth to the comparison unit <b>52</b>.</p>

If this difference is found to be not equal to or higher than the predetermined threshold (or less than the predetermined threshold), then the procedure goes to step S<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In step S<b>6</b>, the control block <b>12</b> notifies the synthesizing unit <b>49</b> of the permission of the switching method selected by the user (in this example, wiping).

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It should be noted that, if the difference between the first video depth and the second video depth is found to be equal to or higher than the predetermined threshold, then the procedure goes to step S<b>7</b>. In step S<b>7</b>, the control block <b>12</b> notifies the synthesizing unit <b>49</b> of that the selected method (wiping in this example) selected by the user is not enabled. Consequently, the synthesizing unit <b>49</b> will not execute the switching if the fader lever <b>23</b> is slid or the auto fade switch <b>24</b> is pressed by the user. Namely, the switching based on wiping is disabled. However, it is also practicable to execute switching by another switching method, such as instantaneous switching, than wiping, rather than disabling the switching itself.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this case, it is practicable to provide means allowing the user to recognize the currently set switching method by reflecting the change of switching methods onto the state of the switching method select switch <b>22</b> of the operation input block <b>11</b>. To be more specific, each switching method is indicated by the blinking, for example, of the switching method select switch <b>22</b> of the operation input block <b>11</b> for the recognition of each switching method. Further, if switching is made to another switching method than wiping, it is practicable to notify the user of the change with an alarm through a separately arranged buzzer or indicator, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">It should be noted that, if the switching has started and the switching is still on during a switching period, the suppression of a new switching operation is preferred. If a new switching is made while the last switching is still on, the user may be notified of such a situation with an alarm through an indicator, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">If the selected switching method is found not to be wiping (namely, found to be instantaneous switching or mixing) in step S<b>2</b>, then the procedure goes to step S<b>6</b>.</p>

Thus, the description of the permission decision processing has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As described above and according to the 3D video editing apparatus <b>10</b>, 3D video switching can be realized by instantaneous switching, wiping, or mixing, so that the expression and added value of the content to be outputted can be increased. It should be noted however that, if wiping is selected by the user as a switching method but the difference between the first video depth and the second video depth is equal to or higher than a predetermined threshold, the switching based on wiping is disabled, so that the sense of abnormalcy and the burden on the eyes of the viewer who has seen the video in the switching can be mitigated.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">It should be noted that, in the above-mentioned example, wiping is used for the switching method; in the case of special effects in which the areas of two videos are separated from each other on the screen, substantially the same processing as described above is applied. This holds true with the use of a digital special effects apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Because the measurement of parallax can be always executed, whether or not wiping is always enabled may be always indicated on an indicator that is arranged on the operator means.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The above-mentioned sequence of processing operations may be executed by software as well as hardware.

At the same time, the parallax measuring unit <b>51</b> measures the parallax of the second video source to compute the second depth based on the measured parallax, outputting the computed depth to the parallax adjusting unit <b>54</b>. The parallax adjusting unit <b>54</b> reads the parallax adjustment section parameter from the memory <b>53</b> and supplies this parameter to the control block <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In step S<b>5</b>, the control block <b>12</b> determines whether it is currently in the first adjustment section or the second adjustment section on the basis of the current fader value and the parallax adjustment section parameter. If it is found to be currently in the first adjustment section or the second adjustment section, then the procedure goes to step S<b>6</b>. If it is found not to be currently in the first adjustment section or the second adjustment section, namely, it is currently in the wiping section, then the procedure goes to step S<b>10</b> by skipping step S<b>6</b> through step S<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In step S<b>6</b>, the control block <b>12</b> determines on the basis of the current fader value and the parallax adjustment section parameter whether to currently adjust the parallax of the first video source or not. If the parallax of the first video source is found to be adjusted, then the procedure goes to step S<b>7</b>. In step S<b>7</b>, the control block <b>12</b> computes a parallax adjustment value indicative of the amount of adjustment of the first video source on the basis of the current fader value and the parallax adjustment section parameter, thereby supplying a computed parallax adjustment value to the parallax adjusting unit <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">If the parallax of the first video source is found not to be adjusted in step S<b>6</b>, then the procedure goes to step S<b>8</b> by skipping step S<b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In step S<b>8</b>, the control block <b>12</b> determines on the basis of the current fader value and the parallax adjustment section parameter whether to currently adjust the parallax of the second video source or not. If the parallax of the second video source is found to be adjusted, then the processing goes to step S<b>9</b>. In step S<b>9</b>, the control block <b>12</b> computes a parallax adjustment value indicative of the amount of adjustment of the second video source on the basis of the current fader value and the parallax adjustment section parameter, thereby supplying a computed parallax adjustment value to the parallax adjusting unit <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">If the parallax of the first video source is found not to be adjusted in step S<b>8</b>, then the procedure goes to step S<b>10</b> by skipping step S<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In step S<b>10</b>, the parallax adjusting unit <b>54</b> adjusts the parallax of the first video source in accordance with the amount of adjustment supplied from the control block <b>12</b> and outputs the adjusted parallax to the subsequent stage. At the same time, the parallax adjusting unit <b>54</b> adjusts the parallax of the second video source in accordance with the amount of adjustment supplied from the control block <b>12</b> and outputs the adjusted parallax to the subsequent stage. It should be noted that, if the amount of parallax adjustment is not supplied via step S<b>6</b> and step S<b>8</b>, then the parallax is not adjusted. If transition is made from the step S<b>5</b> to step S<b>10</b>, namely, if it is currently in the wiping period, then the parallax is adjusted by maintaining the parallax adjustment amount supplied so far.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In step S<b>11</b>, the control block <b>12</b> computes a current display ratio (a ratio with which the screen is occupied) between the first video source and the second video source on the basis of the wiping section obtained by the parallax adjustment section parameter and the current fader value, supplying the computed display ratio to the synthesizing units <b>49</b> of the switcher <b>13</b>L and the switcher <b>13</b>R. In step S<b>12</b>, the synthesizing units <b>49</b> synthesize the first video and the second video in accordance with the supplied display ratio, outputting the synthesized video to the subsequent stage.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In step S<b>13</b>, the control block <b>12</b> determines on the basis of the current fader value whether the switching has been completed or not (the fader value is 100% or not). If the switching is found not completed, then the procedure is returned to step S<b>1</b> to repeat the above-mentioned processing therefrom. If the switching is found completed in step S<b>13</b>, then this switching processing ended.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">It should be noted that, if the selected switching method is found not to be wiping, namely, the selected switching is instantaneous switching or mixing, then the procedure goes to step S<b>14</b>. In this case, the parallaxes of the first and second video sources are not adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In step S<b>14</b>, the control block <b>12</b> computes a current mixing ratio between the first video source and the second video source on the basis of the current fader value and supplies the computed mixing ratio to the synthesizing units <b>49</b> of the switcher <b>13</b>L and the switcher <b>13</b>R. The synthesizing units <b>49</b> synthesize the first video source and the second video source in accordance with the supplied mixing ratio, outputting the synthesized video to the subsequent stage.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In step S<b>15</b>, the control block <b>12</b> determines on the basis of the current fader value whether the switching has been completed or not (the fader value is 100% or not). If the switching is found not completed, then the procedure is returned to step S<b>1</b> to repeat the above-mentioned processing therefrom until the switching is found completed. If the switching is found completed, then this switching processing ended.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">According to the switching processing described above, when switching from the first video source to the second video source by wiping, the parallax of the first video source and the parallax of the second video source are matched with each other in the wiping period in which both the first video and the second video exist at the same time. This configuration mitigates the sense of abnormalcy or the burden to the eyes of the viewer who see the video being switched.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In addition, the adjustment of the parallaxes of the first and second video sources is executed in relation with user controllable fader values, thereby allowing the switching in match with user's intention.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">[Variation 1]</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">With the first and second videos, various objects may exist on the screens of these videos, so that the depths have different distances. To be more specific, if the parallax adjustment is executed as described above, differences in depth based on parallax are actually caused also in the wiping section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In order to solve this problem, the distance of the depth of at least one of the first and second video sources may be compressed to match the distances of both depths at the time the parallaxes of the first and second video sources are adjusted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. This compression eliminates the sense of abnormalcy felt by the viewer at video switching.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">[Variation 2]</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the switching processing described above, parallax adjustment is executed only for the switching based on wiping. It is also practicable to execute parallax adjustment at the time of switching based on mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows an example of parallax adjustment in which the first video source is switched to the second video source on the basis of mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In the case of mixing, it is not necessary to match the depth of the first video source with the depth of the second video source like the wiping processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. To be more specific, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the depth of the second video source is maintained constant in the initial stage of fader values, the depth of the first video source is gradually brought to the depth of the second video source, and the depth of the second video source is gradually returned to the original value in the end stage of fader values.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the case of mixing, the parallax adjustment described above further smoothes the switching from the first video source to the second video source.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">It should be noted that the embodiments of the present invention are applicable to systems of broadcasting stations that live broadcast the video taken by a camera immediately after the taking as well as editing systems for editing the video stored in VTRs for example and storing the edited video in VTRs as complete programs.</p>
