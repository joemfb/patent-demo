<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method for controlling a steam power plant having a generator and a turbine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Steam power plants contribute decisively to the stabilization of voltage and frequency both in interlinked networks and in island networks. In order to meet these stabilization requirements, the control strategies of steam power plants must fulfill the highest possible demands. The control strategies, in this context, are especially important in the event of network accidents and rapid load changes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">If, for example, the rotation of the generator deviates sharply from the nominal value and the machine runs the risk of slips or the shafting of the generator and turbine is put at risk by rotational overspeed, the entire steam power plant has to be decoupled in a directed manner from the associated network and run down to its own requirements so that it is available again as quickly as possible for the network configuration. After such load shedding, the power at the terminals of the generator is reduced in a short time to low values. So that the shafting is not accelerated excessively due to such a diminution in the actual power of the generator, valves of the associated turbine have to be shut quickly. After load shedding, the electrical power of the terminals of the generator generally remains at a low value for a lengthy period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">By contrast, the accident referred to below as a short circuit interruption is a usually 3-pole network short circuit in the vicinity of the power plant which lasts for only a few 100 ms. In the event of such a network accident, the power at the terminals of the generator is briefly equal to zero on account of the voltage collapse mentioned. Insofar as the short circuit can be extinguished within a fault clear-up time of at least 150 ms, the generator will continue to feed active power and reactive power into the network in order to stabilize frequency and voltage. Hence, if the short circuit is present for 150 ms or a shorter time, the shafting should not slip nor should the associated turbine be run down. In many steam power plants, the possible fault clear-up time is even markedly shorter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The control of a steam power plant must react to both accidents, the problem being that the power shedding and the short circuit interruption cannot be distinguished at the commencement of each of these, since, in both cases, the power at the terminals of the generator falls. Furthermore, there is the problem that, although, in the case of short circuit interruption, the electrical power returns after the fault clear-up, whereupon the turbine would have to continue to be operated, nevertheless, as time goes on, the electrical power often swings through its zero passage, and therefore, if predefined power limit values are undershot, movement controllers detect an accident once again. With each accident detection, particularly in known steam power plants, the power of the associated turbine is reduced in that associated valves are shut quickly. On account of said swing of the generator active power about the zero point after a short circuit interruption, such rapid valve motion of the steam turbine may experience a frequent successive response. As a result, the turbine power and therefore the feed of active power into the network are greatly reduced for a disproportionately long time of several seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If this problem arises in several steam power plants, it leads to unacceptable load flow and frequency problems. In the event of faults of this kind, the steam power plants must ensure the frequency and voltage stability of the network within a time range of a few 100 ms.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object on which the invention is based is to provide a method for controlling a steam power plant having a generator and a turbine, in which the abovementioned problems are as far as possible avoided and, in particular, voltage and frequency stability in the associated network is ensured both during load shedding and during a short circuit interruption.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object is achieved, according to the invention, by means of a method for controlling a steam power plant having a generator and a turbine, as claimed in the claims. Furthermore, the object is achieved by means of a device for controlling a steam power plant, as claimed in the claims. Advantageous developments of the invention are described in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method according to the invention for regulating a steam power plant having a generator and a turbine comprises the steps: provision of a first signal which indicates a diminution in the actual power of the generator, generation of a second signal which indicates a short circuit interruption, as a function of the first signal, resetting of the second signal after a predetermined first time span and blocking of the second signal for a predetermined second time span, stopping and subsequent starting of the turbine as a function of the second signal, generation of a third signal which indicates load shedding, as a function of the first signal, and permanent stopping of the turbine as a function of the third signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The solution according to the invention is based on the recognition that, in the event of a short circuit interruption, although the frequent response and asymmetric floating time of the valves of the associated turbine when rapid motion is triggered in the opening and the closing direction are to be avoided as far as possible because the power of the turbine is thereby gradually run down, nevertheless, even in the event of a short circuit interruption, a once-only switching of rapid motion should not be prevented because such rapid motion leads to a cutback of the turbine torque, this having a damping action upon the network swing which otherwise arises.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">On the basis of this, the solution according to the invention follows a path whereby, in both accidents mentioned (that is to say, both during a short circuit interruption and during load shedding), a signal is generated which first leads to the stopping of the turbine. In the wording of the independent claim, this signal is the second signal which is generated as a function of or simultaneously with a first signal which indicates a diminution in the actual power of the generator. In other words, the turbine of the steam power plant according to the invention is therefore stopped or reduced in power (which, as a rule, takes place by means of rapid valve motion), as soon as an associated signal indicates an appreciable diminution in the actual power of the generator. Furthermore, in the method according to the invention, after this stopping of the turbine, the latter is started again. During this stopping and starting, a check is made by the control according to the invention of the associated steam power plant, to ascertain whether further criteria for load shedding are present. Insofar as load shedding is detected and an associated third signal is generated, only then is a permanent stopping of the turbine triggered as a function of this signal which is the third signal in the wording of the independent claim. In other words, in the method according to the invention, both during the short circuit interruption and during load shedding the turbine is first basically stopped, and only as time goes on is a check carried out as to whether a distinction can be made between a short circuit interruption and load shedding. During this period of time, the turbine is put into the starting mode again as a precaution, so that it is fully started as soon as the short circuit interruption has been detected and the load shedding situation has in fact not been detected.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, it is important in the method according to the invention that the second signal which indicates a short circuit interruption is reset and subsequently blocked. This ensures that this second signal cannot indicate a short circuit interruption once again when the generator active power swings about the zero point in the following period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other words, by means of the method according to the invention, a distinction can be made between load shedding and a short circuit interruption in that a second signal, as it is referred to, always triggers a brief cutback of the associated turbine, that is to say the desired power of the generator is briefly set at zero. Only a third signal triggers a permanent cutback of the associated turbine, the desired power of the generator then being set permanently at zero. This third signal is generated independently of the second signal and forms the distinguishing signal in order to distinguish the initially assumed short circuit interruption from load shedding.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a first advantageous development of the method according to the invention, the first signal is provided when the actual power of the generator has diminished abruptly by the amount of a predetermined value or the actual power of the generator is higher than a predetermined negative value and the actual power of the generator has become lower than double its own requirements and also the reference between a desired power and the actual power of the generator has become higher than double its own requirements. In other words, the first signal, which indicates a diminution in the actual power of the generator, is generated when the generator power diminishes in the form of jumps, this jumping diminution preferably amounting to at least 70%. To check for power jumps, the power signal is first preferably filtered by means of a DT1 element. The following link is coupled in the form of an OR operation to this condition: the generator power is compared with a predetermined negative value, in particular &#x2212;2%. If the generator power is higher than this value, the generator is not operating in the motor mode, the powers of which are higher than this nominal power. A check is made, furthermore, as to whether the actual power of the generator has become lower than double its own requirements. As a third condition, a check is made as to whether the difference between the power desired value and power actual value is higher or lower than double its own requirements. A lowering of the actual power can thus be detected. The three conditions mentioned above are in this case linked to a logical AND. The signal is therefore generated when all these conditions are fulfilled or the generator power has changed abruptly by the amount of said predetermined value.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a second advantageous development of the method according to the invention, the predetermined first time span amounts to between 100 ms and 200 ms, in particular to 150 ms. The predetermined first time span serves for fixing how long the second signal remains set and therefore a short circuit interruption is indicated. This second predetermined time span is advantageously dimensioned such that the associated turbine can be stopped or its valves can be closed quickly, that is to say rapid motion can be triggered. At the same time, this predetermined first time span is selected such that the turbine is put into the starting mode again quickly in order to assist frequency and voltage stability in the network by feeding active and reactive power by means of the generator. Starting itself entails a certain delay, the result of which is that the turbine can be permanently stopped sufficiently quickly within the framework of the following load shedding check.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a third advantageous development of the method according to the invention, the predetermined second time span amounts to between 4 s and 10 s, in particular to 7 s. The predetermined second time span serves for blocking the second signal and for preventing the situation where, after a short circuit interruption is detected by a swing of the generator active power above the zero point, short circuit interruption detection experiences a frequent successive response. The predetermined second time span is in this case advantageously selected in such a way that the mechanical torque and consequently the electrical power of the generator return again more quickly than this selected second time span.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a fourth advantageous development of the method according to the invention, the generation of the third signal which indicates load shedding takes place as a function of the first signal and of a predetermined third time span. Thus, once again, the first signal is the trigger for the signal indicating load shedding, and it is additionally ascertained whether this first signal is present permanently during a predetermined third time span. Load shedding is therefore present when the actual power of the generator is greatly diminished for a longer period of time, in fact this predetermined third time span. In the event of a short circuit interruption, by contrast, a power close to zero is generally present for only a few 100 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Especially preferably, the predetermined third time span is selected to have a value of between 1.5 s and 2.5 s, in particular of 2 s. The result of this time span is that it can be ascertained reliably whether load shedding is present or, for example, there is only a swing of electrical power about the mechanical power after a short circuit interruption. Furthermore, the time span is selected in such a way that the associated turbine is permanently stopped sufficiently early. In this case, in particular, care must be taken to ensure that, after a renewed starting of the turbine after the setting of the short circuit interruption signal, this starting is controlled by means of an associated regulation of the rotational speed of the turbine. With the lapse of the electrical power of the generator, the drive train of the turbine is accelerated sharply in such a way that the rotational speed control of the latter intervenes sufficiently and overspeeding of the turbine is prevented. The result of this also is that the turbine, which commences actual starting again after approximately 1.5 s after stopping, does not overspeed in the event of permanent stopping after 2 s, and, at most, a very brief slip of the generator takes place. After load shedding, therefore, the shafting accelerates and takes up the excess power of the turbine which it can no longer discharge to the network. The rotational speed of the turbine rises above the nominal value (for example, to a value up to 5% above nominal value). Thereupon, the rotational speed controller critically determines the manipulated variable for opening the associated valves of the turbine. The valves consequently remain shut, even when the signal for starting the turbine as a function of the second signal is already present again. Subsequently, where appropriate, the signal for the permanent stopping of the turbine occurs so that the valves still remain closed, overall, during this period of time and the turbine torque is run at zero, as required, until the rotational speed of the turbine lies below the desired value.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a sixth advantageous development of the method according to the invention, the generation of the third signal which indicates load shedding takes place as a function of a load switch for the generator. The load switch of the generator indicates whether the generator should feed any electrical power at all into the network. However, such a load switch is not reliably co-actuated in the event of any load shedding, and therefore, for this reason, the abovementioned conditions are additionally taken into account in order to detect load shedding reliably.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a circuit arrangement or a device <b>10</b> for controlling a steam power plant, not illustrated in any more detail, having a generator <b>12</b> and a turbine <b>14</b>. The device <b>10</b> comprises as essential elements a PEL signal line <b>16</b> and a PSW signal line <b>18</b> which lead from the generator <b>12</b> to a means <b>20</b> for providing a first signal. This means <b>20</b> is configured as a control or regulating arrangement in which, overall, six switching elements <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>f </i>are formed. In this case, the actual power (PEL) of the generator <b>12</b> is transferred via the PEL signal line <b>16</b> to the switching element <b>20</b><i>a </i>which checks whether the actual power has fallen abruptly by the amount of a predetermined value GPLSP. Thus, in the present case, in particular, a jumping diminution of greater than 70% is checked. For checking for such power jumps, the power signal PEL is first filtered by means of a DT1 element.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the switching element <b>20</b><i>b</i>, it is derived from the input signal PEL whether the actual power of the generator <b>12</b> is higher than a specific negative value GPNEG. In the present case, in particular, the generator power is compared with the value GPNEG=&#x2212;2%. It is thereby checked whether the generator <b>12</b> is operating in motor mode with powers higher than &#x2212;2% of the nominal power.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the switching element <b>20</b><i>c</i>, a check is made as to whether the actual power PEL of the generator <b>12</b> is lower than double its own requirements GP2EB.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A fall of the actual power to less than double its own requirements is thus detected.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">By means of the switching element <b>20</b><i>d</i>, the difference between the power desired value and the power actual value is determined by means of the input signals actual power PEL and desired power PSW of the generator <b>12</b> and is compared with the value 2&#xd7; own requirements. A fall of the actual power is thus detected.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The results of the switching elements <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>d </i>are linked to one another via the switching element <b>20</b><i>e</i>, the latter forming an AND link. The result of this linkage is linked by means of the switching element <b>20</b><i>f </i>to the result of the switching element <b>20</b><i>a</i>, these linkages in the switching element <b>20</b><i>f </i>being an OR link. Thus, by the means <b>20</b> for providing a first signal, a signal S<b>1</b> is generated which indicates whether there is a diminution of the actual power PEL of the generator <b>12</b>. This signal S<b>1</b> is supplied to a means <b>22</b> for generating a second signal KU. This signal KU is considered as a signal which basically indicates a short circuit interruption, specifically as a function of the first signal S<b>1</b>. After a predetermined first time span TKU of 150 ins in the present case, the second signal KU generated is reset and is subsequently blocked for a predetermined second time span CSPKU of 7 s in the present case. This takes place by a means <b>24</b> for resetting and blocking the second signal KU, this means being configured with an RS flipflop and with an associated set signal. The signal is held for the time span of CSPKU and is sent to the reset input of the flipflop. This connection has the effect that the KU signal is present for a maximum of 150 ms and thereafter can be present again only after 7 s at the earliest. The KU signal is transferred via a KU signal line <b>26</b> to the turbine <b>14</b> where a means, not illustrated, in the form of a controller is provided for stopping and starting the turbine <b>14</b>. This controller causes a temporary cutoff of the power desired value PSW of the turbine <b>14</b> on the basis of the brief KU signal.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the signal S<b>1</b> is conducted to a means <b>28</b> for generating a third signal LAW, this third signal LAW being formed when the first signal S<b>1</b> is present for longer than a predetermined third time span TLAW, 2 s in the present case. The signal LAW is in this case conducted via a LAW signal line <b>30</b> to the turbine <b>14</b> where a means, not illustrated, for the permanent stopping of the turbine as a function of the LAW signal <b>30</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the associated method flow for controlling a steam power plant having the generator <b>12</b>, the turbine <b>14</b> and the device <b>10</b>. The method comprises a step <b>34</b> in which the first signal S<b>1</b> is provided which indicates a diminution in the actual power PEL of the generator <b>12</b>. This signal is either NO or 0, in which case there is a return to the input of step <b>34</b>, or the signal S<b>1</b> is 1 or YES, in which case a further step <b>36</b> for generating the second signal KU first takes place. As explained above, the signal KU indicates basically a short circuit interruption or it is assumed that such a short circuit interruption could occur. In the following step <b>38</b>, the second signal KU is then reset after a predetermined first time span TKU and subsequently the predetermined second time span TSPKU is blocked. In this case, a loop is run through which leads back to step <b>36</b>. At the same time, the signal generated in this way and then reset and blocked is supplied to a step <b>40</b> in which the turbine <b>14</b> stops and is subsequently started again. The path from step <b>40</b> subsequently leads back to step <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Furthermore, in a step <b>42</b>, simultaneously with steps <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>40</b>, a check is made by means of the positive signal S<b>1</b> as to whether the signal S<b>1</b> is permanently present for only the third time span TLAW of 2 s in the present case. In cases not so, the method returns to the step <b>34</b>. But if this is so, the associated third signal LAW is set to YES or 1 and, in a step <b>44</b>, the turbine <b>14</b> is stopped permanently.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, various profiles of signals and measurement values of the generator <b>12</b> and of the turbine <b>14</b> are plotted against time. In this case, a method for controlling a steam power plant according to the prior art is illustrated, a first curve <b>46</b> showing the profile of the mechanical torque of the turbine <b>14</b>. It can be seen how this mechanical torque falls on account of a sudden diminution in the actual power of the generator and subsequently rises at least slightly again because of the presence of a short circuit interruption. The curves <b>48</b> and <b>50</b> show the associated profile of the electrical torque of the generator <b>12</b> and of the active power of the generator <b>12</b>. This active power corresponds to the actual power PEL. It can be seen that both the electrical torque and the active power begin to oscillate on account of the short circuit interruption and have a frequent zero passage. The curve <b>52</b> shows the associated profile or curve of the first signal S<b>1</b> consequently arising according to the prior art. This signal is generated as a result of the short circuit interruption itself and thereafter, frequently, because of the run through of the zero passage. The result of this is that, on account of the signal S<b>1</b>, the associated turbine <b>14</b> is stopped frequently (see the three circle markings on the curve <b>46</b>) and a sharp reduction and deceleration of the power of the turbine thereby occur. Finally, associated curves <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> also show the rotor displacement angle in &#xb0; and a slip of the generator <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate how the profile of such and similar curves varies when the solution according to the invention comes into effect. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates by the curve <b>58</b> how the mechanical torque behaves over time when a short circuit interruption is ascertained by means of the method according to the invention and the associated device. It can be seen clearly that there is no frequent stopping or triggering of rapid motion.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">While curves <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> show the associated electrical torque and the associated active power of the generator <b>12</b>, curve <b>64</b> illustrates that, in the procedure according to the invention, a comparatively short KU signal is generated once only. As explained above, this is reset and subsequently blocked in such a way that a renewed triggering of rapid motion cannot occur. Accordingly, this procedure leads to a very closely contemporaneous restarting of the associated turbine <b>14</b> with a correspondingly different rotor displacement angle (see curve <b>66</b>) and with a somewhat different slip behavior (see curve <b>68</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates how the steam power plant according to the invention behaves when load shedding occurs. A curve <b>70</b> in this case shows the active power of the generator and a curve <b>72</b> of the associated desired power (PSW). A curve <b>74</b> shows the behavior of an associated turbine controller, and it can be seen that this turbine controller, after a short interruption, restarts the associated turbine <b>14</b>, but limits its rotational speed. Curves <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> illustrate the associated profile of the medium pressure of the valve for the turbine <b>14</b> and of the fresh steam pressure of the valve for the turbine <b>14</b>. It can be seen here that, with the lapse of mechanical torque, the valves are closed by means of the turbine controller and are subsequently also kept closed in a directed manner for 1.5 s by the turbine controller. A curve <b>80</b> shows the associated abovementioned first signal and its profile. It can be seen that this signal is constant from the lapse of the mechanical torque. Finally, a curve <b>82</b> shows the profile of the associated abovementioned second signal (KU) which is generated briefly, then reset and subsequently blocked. A curve <b>84</b> shows the profile of an abovementioned third signal (LAW) which is generated in such a way that the first signal (see curve <b>80</b>) is present continuously. By means of this third signal <b>84</b>, the turbine <b>14</b> is correspondingly stopped permanently, and this can be seen again from the profile of curve <b>74</b> (turbine controller). A curve <b>86</b> shows the profile</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">of the mechanical torque on the turbine, and it can be seen how this mechanical torque falls on account of the lapse of the mechanical torque of the generator <b>12</b>. With the fall of the mechanical torque, the turbine <b>14</b> is at the same time accelerated, since there is a considerable amount of flywheel mass, even though the associated valves are kept closed (see curves <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>). With this acceleration of the turbine <b>14</b>, a curve <b>88</b> is formed which represents the profile of the deviation in rotational speed. It can be seen at the same time that this acceleration takes place to a limited extent such that overspeeding of the turbine <b>14</b> cannot occur.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the invention, therefore, the rapid motion of the valves in the turbine <b>14</b> is triggered by the signal KU and this triggering takes place only once for the reasons mentioned. If, after a predefined time, the signal which has caused the generation of the signal KU continuously to be present, the signal LAW is generated and the valves remain closed until the rotation speed of the turbine has fallen as far as possible, and the mechanical torque can thereafter be increased safely to its own requirements. This delay phase protects the generator <b>12</b> against rotational overspeed and generally lasts for longer than 10 s.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It can be concluded from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> that a frequent triggering of rapid motion in the event of a straightforward short circuit interruption cannot, according to the invention, take place. When the short circuit occurs, the turbine torque is run down and rises again after 1.5 s. The electrical torque (curve <b>60</b>), the slip (curve <b>68</b>) and the rotor displacement angle (curve <b>66</b>) of the generator <b>12</b> show the known behavior of a steam power plant in the event of a 3-pole network short circuit. The rotor displacement angle (curve <b>66</b>) swings about the zero value, which means that the generator <b>12</b> has not yet begun to slip. In the event of load shedding to its own requirements, an ordered rundown of the turbine <b>14</b> is not impaired because the actual frequent triggering of the KU signal is locked out or blocked according to the invention. Instead, first, the signal KU triggers rapid motion even in the event of load shedding.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thereafter, admittedly, the turbine <b>14</b> is actually started again, with the result that its shafting is accelerated and takes up the excess power of the turbine <b>14</b>, since the turbine <b>14</b> can no longer discharge power to the network via the generator. The rotational speed of the shafting rises by up to 5% above the nominal value (see curve <b>88</b>). In this case, the rotational speed controller (see curve <b>74</b>) critically determines the manipulated variable for opening the valves of the turbine <b>14</b>. As a result, the valves remain shut and the turbine torque is run to zero, as required, until the rotational speed lies below the desired value. After a time span TLAW has elapsed, the signal LAW is set and remains for 5 s in the present case. The result of this is that the turbine is stopped permanently for this period of time.</p>
