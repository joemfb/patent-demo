<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a diaphragm for electro-acoustic transducers used in various acoustic instruments, and to a film for use for it.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the popularization of small electronics (for example, mobile telephone, PDA, laptop computer, DVD, liquid-crystal TV, digital still camera, mobile music machinery, etc.), there is an increasing demand for small-sized electro-acoustic transducers, such as small-sized speakers (generally called microspeakers), small-sized receivers and further microphones, earphones and others used in those electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a diaphragm for speakers is required to have a low density so as to maintain the acoustic radiation sound pressure level, to have high rigidity for inhibiting strain so as to increase the allowable input resistance, and additionally to have a large specific modulus of elasticity so as to broaden the reproduction frequency band region, and to have a large internal loss for suppressing the divided vibration of the diaphragm so as to flatten the frequency characteristics. In use near a speaker driving source, voice coil, or in use in in-vehicle speakers, the diaphragm may be exposed to high temperature for a long period of time, and therefore it must have heat resistance fully bearable to such use conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, with the recent background of mobile or ubiquitous society or music source digitalization, various small electronics are made to have higher function and higher performance. Even in the speakers to be used in these, for example, in the speakers in mobile telephones, the input-output resistance level required for the diaphragm is being improved to be at least from 0.5 to 0.6 W or so (at present, the uppermost limit is 1.2 W or so) for high-output models, as compared with popular models with 0.3 W or so. At present, there are many types of models with from 0.6 to 0.8 W or so, and the ratio of models with more than 1.0 W is low.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Regarding diaphragms for speakers, for example, Patent References JP-A-60-139099, JP-A-59-63897, and JP-A-2002-291092 disclose a diaphragm for speakers, formed of a film of an aromatic polysulfone resin, concretely a polyether sulfone resin. These patent references disclose that when a film of a polyether sulfone resin is used, the formability, the heat resistance and the acoustic characteristics of the diaphragm for speakers are excellent. However, the diaphragm for speakers described in these patent references is problematic in that its durability in high-output operation is insufficient and the diaphragm may be often cracked or broken. In these patent references, nothing is described or investigated relating to the structure of an aromatic polysulfone resin, in particular to a diaphragm for speakers formed of a film of an aromatic polysulfone resin having a specific repetitive unit and the durability thereof in high-output operation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent JP-A-58-222699 discloses a diaphragm for speakers, formed of an aromatic polyether ketone resin, concretely a polyether-ether ketone resin. This patent reference says that the modulus of elasticity of the film of a polyether-ether ketone resin is 30,000 kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>(about 3000 MPa) and is high, and therefore the film is excellent in high-pitched tone reproduction. However, this patent reference has no description of microspeakers and low-pitched tone reproduction with microspeakers, or has neither description nor investigation of the durability in high-output operation of a diaphragm formed of a mixture of an aromatic polyether ketone resin and any other resin and of the formability of the diaphragm.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, as a diaphragm for speakers excellent in the durability in high-output operation, used is a biaxially-stretched thermally-fixed film of a polyethylene naphthalate resin (PEN) film or a polyphenylene sulfide resin (PPS) film. However, these films are crystalline and their rigidity is too high, and therefore, their minimum resonance frequency (f<sub>0</sub>: f zero) is high and their acoustic characteristics are insufficient, for example, their low-pitched tone reproducibility is poor, and in particular, are problematic in that their formability into diaphragms (by press forming or vacuum forming) and their forming cycle are inferior to amorphous resins (polyetherimide, etc.) having a high glass transition temperature (Tg).</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In general, with the increase in the concentration of the biphenyl or biphenylene group in the polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A), the characteristics such as the impact resistance of the polymer may be better.

When the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the resin is not lower than the above-mentioned lowermost limit, then it is favorable since the diaphragm may have sufficient heat resistance even when used near a speaker driving source, voice coil or in in-vehicle speakers.

When the crystal melting peak temperature is not lower than 260&#xb0; C., then the heat resistance of the diaphragm for electro-acoustic transducers of the present invention may be improved, and, for example, the heat resistance in the reflow step may be secured. On the other hand, when the crystal melting peak temperature is not higher than 380&#xb0; C., then it is favorable since, for example, ordinary equipment may be used in melt forming into films and the films may be worked at relatively low temperatures (the uppermost temperature of 430&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, the crystal melting peak temperature (Tm) of the crystalline resin (B) and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A) are preferably in a relation of Tg&#x3c;Tm, but more preferably, Tm is higher by at least 30&#xb0; C. than Tg. When the relation is satisfied, the film may be prevented from drawing down even though there occurs a film temperature distribution within a temperature range not lower than the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A) while the film is worked into a diaphragm by hot-press forming, and in addition, the stress-strain curve in the working temperature range may be improved, and as a result, diaphragms of good thickness accuracy may be fabricated.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present invention, the blend ratio by mass of the above-mentioned polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A) to the crystalline resin (B) is preferably polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A)/crystalline resin (B)=(95 to 50)/(5 to 50). The blend ratio by mass falling within the range is favorable since, in general, when the resin composition is formed into a diaphragm by thermal press forming and the like in order that the amorphous resin, polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A) forms the matrix (sea) of the film, the workability and the working cycle are good, and in addition, the adhesiveness to voice coils and housings with various adhesives (e.g., UV-curable adhesives such as acrylic or epoxy adhesives or solvent-diluting type adhesives) and organic solvents is also good. Further, the crystalline resin (B) improves the heat resistance and the solvent resistance, and when the resin composition is formed into a diaphragm by thermal press forming and the like, the stress-strain curve within the working temperature range may also be improved and, as a result, diaphragms of good thickness accuracy and good deep drawability may be favorably fabricated. From these, in the present invention, the blend ratio by mass of the polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A) to the crystalline resin (B) is, as (A)/(B), preferably (95 to 55)/(5 to 45), more preferably (90 to 60)/(10 to 40); and even more preferably (A)/(B) is (85 to 65)/(15 to 35).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For the above-mentioned diaphragm for electro-acoustic transducers, preferably used is the film that contains, as the main ingredients, the above-mentioned polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A) and the crystalline resin (B); and, if desired, any other resin may be mixed in the resin composition to constitute the film in an amount of at most 30% by mass, preferably at most 20% by mass.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The other resin may include polyurethane resin, polysulfone resin, polyether sulfone resin, polyarylate resin, polycarbonate resin, modified polyphenylene ether resin, polyetherimide resin, thermoplastic polyimide resin, liquid-crystal polymer and thermoplastic elastomer and the like; but in the present invention, from the viewpoint of the compatibility with the main ingredient resin and the processability in film formation, preferably used are polysulfone resin and polyetherimide resin. One or more such other additional resins may be used herein, either singly or as suitably combined.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, filler and various additives, for example, heat stabilizer, UV absorbent, light stabilizer, nucleating agent, colorant, lubricant and flame retardant may be suitably incorporated in the resin composition to constitute the polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin-containing film.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The film for use in forming the diaphragm for electro-acoustic transducers of the present invention and its production methods are described below. First, for the film formation method, any known method is employable, including, for example, an extrusion casting method with a T-die, a calendering method or a flow casting method. An extrusion casting method with a T-die is favorably employed from the viewpoint of the film producibility. The forming temperature in the extrusion casting method with a T-die may be suitably controlled depending on the flow characteristics and the film formability of the composition to be used, but may be generally from approximately 300&#xb0; C. to 430&#xb0; C. Any of single-screw extruders, twin-screw extruders, kneaders and mixers and the like generally used may be used herein. Preferred are twin-screw extruders and more preferred are co-rotating twin-screw extruders from the viewpoint of the uniform dispersibility of the mixed resin composition and of the stability of the properties of the obtained film.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For the diaphragm for electro-acoustic transducers, especially for the diaphragm for speakers, the mean thickness may be from 5 to 150 &#x3bc;m, generally from approximately 8 to 100 &#x3bc;m. The film thickness accuracy (%) ([(film thickness&#x2212;mean thickness)/(mean thickness)]&#xd7;100) has some influence on the acoustic properties such as the reproduction frequency band region and the frequency characteristics, and is therefore preferably within &#xb1;10%, more preferably within &#xb1;8%, even more preferably within &#xb1;5%. Preferably, the film formation is so controlled that the anisotropy of the physical properties of the film in the machine direction (MD) from the extruder and in the transverse direction (TD) is as small as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also preferably, the tensile modulus of elasticity of the film is from 1000 MPa to less than 3000 MPa. When the tensile modulus of elasticity is at least 1000 MPa, then the film is favorably tough (stiff) enough for use as diaphragms for electro-acoustic transducers; while, on the other hand, when the tensile modulus of elasticity is less than 3000 MPa, then it is also favorable since, for example for diaphragms for microspeakers, even though the film having a thickness of from 20 to 40 &#x3bc;m and having excellent handlability and durability in high-output operation is used, its minimum resonance frequency (f<sub>0</sub>: f zero) is sufficiently low, and the low-pitched tone reproducibility is secured to attain good sound quality. From these, in the present invention, the above-mentioned tensile modulus of elasticity is more preferably from 1000 MPa to less than 2500 MPa, even more preferably from 2000 MPa to less than 2500 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this, for example, the polyethylene naphthalate resin (PEN) film has a tensile modulus of elasticity of 6000 MPa or so, and therefore, for diaphragms for microspeakers for mobile telephones and the like, the film must be considerably thinned for reducing its minimum resonance frequency (f<sub>0</sub>: f zero), and influence on the handling thereof and also during the process of working into diaphragms due to static electricity becomes large.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus obtained, the film is further worked into diaphragms for electro-acoustic transducers. In this, a diaphragm for speakers is described as one example. The working method is not specifically defined. Taking its glass transition temperature and softening temperature into consideration, the film may be heated and worked into a dome shape or a cone shape by press forming or vacuum forming. The shape of the diaphragm is not specifically defined and may be any desired one. Any of circular, elliptical or oval shapes may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The film obtained in the present invention has a relative low tensile modulus of elasticity, and therefore, especially when it is used for diaphragms for small-sized electro-acoustic transducers, then it is favorable since it may secure a low-pitched tone reproduction range and for good sound quality. Regarding the size of the diaphragm, its maximum diameter may be favorably at most 25 mm, preferably at most 20 mm and its lowermost limit may be generally 5 mm or so from the viewpoint of reducing the size and the weight of the diaphragm. The maximum diameter means the diameter of the diaphragm that is circular, and means the major diameter of the diaphragm that is elliptical or oval.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present invention, as so described in the above, the shape of the diaphragm is not specifically defined and may be any desired one, and any of circular, elliptical or oval shapes may be selected. For example, in case where the diaphragm is desired to have deep drawability for the recess for holding a voice coil, as in Japanese patents JP-A-5-30592 and 11-146487, it is desirable that the film to be used has a tensile elongation at break within the film-working temperature range of at least 100%, preferably at least 200%, more preferably at least 300%. The uppermost limit may be generally 600% or so. In this, the film having a tensile elongation at break of at least 300% is especially favorable since it may be stably worked into various shapes of diaphragms with little trouble of breakage.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The surface of the diaphragm may be suitably worked to have a groove with a V-shaped cross-sectional profile, referred to as a tangential edge. In this case, the mean thickness of the film is preferably at most 40 &#x3bc;m, more preferably from 20 to 38 &#x3bc;m. This is because the film thickness could be sufficiently secured and therefore the film handlability is good and the film workability per hour in press forming and the like and the working accuracy (shape reproducibility) are readily improved. In addition, for controlling the workability and the dust repellency and also the acoustic characteristics of the diaphragm, the surface of the film or the shaped diaphragm may be further coated with an antistatic agent or various elastomer (e.g., urethane-type, silicone-type, hydrocarbon-type or fluorine-containing elastomer or the like), or may be coated with metal by vapor deposition or sputtering, or may be suitably processed for coloring (black, white or others). Further, the diaphragm may be suitably laminated with a metal such as aluminium or with any other film, or may be hybridized with a nonwoven fabric.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The diaphragm for electro-acoustic transducers of the present invention is, when used as a diaphragm for speakers, for example, excellent in the durability in high-output operation. For example, ordinary models of mobile telephones have an output resistance level of 0.3 W or so; but the diaphragm of the present invention is applicable to high-output models with an output resistance level of from approximately 0.6 to 1.0 W. In addition, since polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin is generally an amorphous highly heat-resistant resin, the film that contains the polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A), and further the film that contains the polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A) and the crystalline resin (B), especially the film that contains the above resin (A) or the resin (A) and the resin (B) as the main ingredients are excellent in the basic acoustic characteristics as diaphragms for speakers, especially as diaphragms for microspeakers, and in addition, excellent in the heat resistance and the formability at the working into diaphragms.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As in the above, the diaphragm for electro-acoustic transducers of the present invention is favorably used as diaphragms for speakers from the viewpoint of the heat resistance, the acoustic characteristics and the durability in high-output operation thereof; and regarding the application range of the diaphragm for electro-acoustic transducers of the present invention, it is applicable to all electro-acoustic transducers including speakers and in addition, receivers, microphones and earphones. In particular, the diaphragm is favorable for microspeakers of mobile telephones.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">From Table 2, it is confirmed that the diaphragms for speakers formed of the film containing, as the main ingredients, the polybiphenyl ether sulfone resin (A) and the crystalline resin (B) of the present invention have good formability and are excellent in the durability in high-output operation, and in addition, the tensile elongation at break thereof within the processing temperature range (200&#xb0; C.) is large, and, for example, they are also excellent in the deep drawability (Examples 3 to 5). The tensile elongation at break at 200&#xb0; C. of the film of PPSU alone was 285.2%. On the other hand, it is confirmed that the diaphragms for speakers formed of the film of a conventional polyether sulfone resin not having a biphenyl bond (Comparative Example 1) or the film containing the resin and PEEK (Comparative Example 2) are excellent in the formability but their durability in high-output operation is insufficient. The miscibility between PES and PEEK is inferior to the miscibility between PPSU and PEEK, and therefore it is confirmed that, in Comparative Example 2, even though PEEK was mixed in the composition, the durability of the diaphragm was rather lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The diaphragm for electro-acoustic transducers of the present invention is excellent in the formability and the durability in high-output operation, and is therefore usable as diaphragms for speakers used in various small electronics (for example, mobile telephone, PDA, laptop computer, DVD, liquid-crystal TV, digital still camera, mobile music machinery, etc.), and also in electro-acoustic transducers such as receivers, microphones and earphones.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Having described preferred embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes and modifications may be effected therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
