<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention is to provide a printing apparatus capable of correctly detecting an origin of a conveying roller for conveying a print medium at the time of its rotation with a simple configuration that does not accompany an increase of cost. For this purpose, the printing apparatus is equipped with a lock mechanism (a lock link lever) for stopping rotation of the conveying roller at a predetermined rotational position and saves a count value of a rotation amount of the conveying roller when the conveying roller is locked by the lock mechanism concerned as origin information. After this, driving of the conveying roller is controlled based on the saved origin information and a phase of rotation of the conveying roller obtained from the count value of the conveying roller.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to conveyance control of a print medium. Especially, the present invention relates to a configuration for detecting an origin or phase of a conveying roller at the time of its rotation and a method for the same in a configuration of conveying the print medium using the conveying roller.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In printing apparatuses in recent years, there is increased printing use of printing photographic images not only on plain papers but also on special purpose papers. In particular, in the ink jet printing apparatus, a trend of a decreased size of an ink drop has progressed and it has become possible to output an image comparative to or better than silver salt photographs with high resolution. With realization of such high resolution of images, higher precision of paper conveyance is also being advanced and there have been proposed a lot of methods whereby the conveying roller such that a metallic shaft is coated with grinding stone is used and methods for controlling conveyance of such a conveying roller with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2006-240055 discloses a configuration where a code wheel is provided on the same axis of the conveying roller and slits formed on its circumferential part at equal intervals are detected by an encoder sensor fixed in the apparatus. According to this, a technology of performing drive control of a DC motor for rotating the conveying roller depending on a cycle at which the slits are detected, etc., is disclosed. Then, according to the same document, a method includes acquiring an origin of the conveying roller by having provided a pattern for rotation phase detection, separately from the slits on the code wheel, and detecting the pattern concerned with another sensor in order to correct a conveyance error resulting from eccentricity of the conveying roller.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a sectional view for explaining an installation state of the code wheel and the sensors. A film-like code wheel <b>2002</b> shares a rotation axis with a conveying roller <b>2001</b> and is disposed around its circumference in a spreading manner. Slits <b>2002</b><i>a </i>that are arranged at equal intervals and are used for detection of positional precision and a belt-like pattern <b>2002</b><i>b </i>used for phase detection of roller rotation are printed on the code wheel <b>2002</b>. An encoder sensor <b>2003</b> is installed at a position where the slits <b>2002</b><i>a </i>pass with rotation of the code wheel <b>2002</b>, and detects a rotation amount of the code wheel <b>2002</b>, i.e., the conveying roller <b>2001</b>. On the other hand, an edge sensor <b>2004</b> detects the edge of the pattern <b>2002</b><i>b </i>that moves with the rotation of the code wheel <b>2002</b>, and the printing apparatus is configured to be able to set the origin of the roller rotation using this detected timing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a diagram showing another example of a configuration for detecting the origin of the conveying roller. In this example, a sensed part <b>2102</b> is attached to a part of the conveying roller <b>2101</b>, and moves in a circle with rotation of the conveying roller <b>2101</b>. A photo-interrupter <b>2103</b> is being fixed at a position where the sensed part <b>2102</b> in the apparatus passes and can detect the origin of the conveying roller <b>2101</b> from a timing at which the sensed part <b>2102</b> intercepts the photo-interrupter <b>2103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, in order to perform the conveyance control in a high-precision state while correcting the conveyance error resulting from the eccentricity of the conveying roller, a mechanism for detecting the origin of the conveying roller also becomes necessary, apart from the mechanism for detecting the rotation amount of the conveying roller.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, since the above-mentioned conventional configuration requires some electronic device elements, such a photo-interrupter for phase detection, and cable wiring for this newly, a cost of the apparatus cannot avoid increasing.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Hereafter, the best forms for carrying out the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a mechanical unit of a printing apparatus in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(A) Conveying Unit</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A conveying unit has a configuration that a pressure plate <b>21</b> on which print medium is loaded, a feed roller <b>28</b> for feeding the print medium P one sheet by one sheet, a separation roller for separating the print medium (not illustrated), a return lever for returning the print medium to its loading position (not illustrated), etc. are attached on a conveying unit base <b>20</b>. A movable side guide <b>23</b> is provided to the pressure plate <b>21</b> in a movable manner and regulates the loading position of the print medium. The pressure plate <b>21</b> is pivotable about a rotation axis connected to the conveying unit base <b>20</b> and is energized in a direction of the feed roller <b>28</b> by an unillustrated pressure plate spring. The feed roller <b>28</b> has a rod-like shape whose cross section is a circular arc and feeds a print medium into the inside of the apparatus by rotating itself while keeping contact with a surface of the print medium. The print medium bumps against a nip part that is composed of the feed roller <b>28</b> and the separation roller, and is divided by this nip part; and only the print medium at the highest position is further conveyed into the inside. A torque of a feed motor <b>99</b> is obtained by a process in which a driving force of the feed motor <b>99</b> acting as feed driving means is transferred thereto through a drive transferring gear, a planetary gear, etc. The driving force of the feed motor <b>99</b> is also transferred to the cleaning unit that will be described later.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(B) Conveying Unit</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Main elements of the conveying unit are attached to a metallic plate chassis <b>11</b> that is bent and raised and chassis <b>97</b>, <b>98</b> of mold molding. The print medium sent to the conveying unit is guided by a paper guide and a pinch roller holder <b>30</b> that are arranged at specified positions of an inlet port, and is held between a roller pair consisting of a conveying roller <b>36</b> and a pinch roller <b>37</b>. The conveying roller <b>36</b> has a structure of a metallic shaft with minute particles of a ceramic coated thereon, and metallic portions at both ends thereof are supported by bearing parts fixed to the chassis <b>11</b>. A plurality of pinch rollers <b>37</b> each of which is energized to press the surface of the conveying roller <b>36</b> by a pinch roller spring <b>31</b> are held by the pinch roller holder <b>30</b>, and the each pinch roller <b>37</b> abuts against the surface of the conveying roller <b>36</b> and is driven by this.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are a sectional view and a perspective view for explaining in detail a conveying mechanism including the conveying unit in the printing apparatus of this embodiment. The torque of the conveying roller <b>36</b> is acquired by a process in which a driving force of a conveying motor <b>35</b> made up of a DC motor is transferred to a pulley gear <b>361</b> provided on the axis of the conveying roller <b>36</b> through a timing belt <b>39</b>. On the same axis of the conveying roller <b>36</b>, a code wheel <b>362</b> on which slits are formed with a pitch of 150 to 360 lpi is directly linked to it. Then, a conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> is fixed at a position in the figure of the chassis <b>11</b> so as to read the number of times of passing of the slits on the code wheel <b>362</b> and its timing.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> again, when the roller pair consisting of the conveying roller <b>36</b> and the pinch roller <b>37</b> is rotated by the conveying motor <b>35</b>, the print medium being held by this roller pair is conveyed in the inside of the apparatus. The pinch roller holder <b>30</b> is equipped with an edge sensor for detecting a top end and a rear end of the print medium and for positioning it. By detection with the edge sensor, the print medium is positioned on a platen <b>34</b> that is attached to the chassis <b>11</b> and is located in a printing unit.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(C) Carriage Unit</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">On the print medium supported by the platen <b>34</b> from below in a downstream side of the conveying roller <b>36</b>, an image based on print information is printed by a printing head <b>7</b> mounted on a carriage <b>50</b> that passes over an upper side of the print medium.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The carriage <b>50</b> carries the printing head <b>7</b> and an ink tank <b>71</b> for supplying ink to this, and is movable in the X direction of the figure. The printing head <b>7</b> of this embodiment is constructed so that a voltage pulse may be impressed to a heater provided at a position corresponding to the individual discharge port, and the ink may be discharged from the individual discharge port using pressure change produced by growth or contraction of an air bubble in generated film boiling. However, such a discharge method does not limit the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The carriage <b>50</b> is supported by a carriage rail <b>52</b> that is extended in a direction at right angles to the conveyance direction of the print medium and an upper guide rail <b>111</b> and is guided thereby with respect to its movement direction. The carriage rail <b>52</b> is attached to the chassis <b>11</b>, and the upper guide rail <b>111</b> is formed to be integral with the chassis <b>11</b>. Furthermore, the upper guide rail <b>111</b> holds the end of the carriage <b>50</b>, and also plays the role of maintaining a gap between the discharge port plane of the printing head <b>7</b> and the print medium.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The moving force of the carriage <b>50</b> is a driving force of a motor <b>54</b> attached to the chassis <b>11</b> which is supplied thereto through an idle pulley <b>542</b> and a timing belt <b>541</b> that is provided to the idle pulley <b>542</b> in a tensioned state and supported by it. A cord strip <b>561</b> in which markings were formed with a pitch of 150 to 300 lpi is provided in a tensioned state in a direction parallel to the timing belt <b>541</b>, and an unillustrated encoder sensor mounted on the carriage <b>50</b> detects the markings during movement of the carriage <b>50</b>. Thereby, a current position of the carriage <b>50</b> can be detected. A flexible cable <b>57</b> electrically connects a carriage board on the carriage <b>50</b> on which the encoder sensor, etc. is provided with an electric board <b>91</b> fixed in the apparatus while following reciprocation of the carriage <b>50</b>. A printing signal with which the printing head <b>7</b> performs printing is transferred thereto from the electric board <b>91</b> through the flexible cable <b>57</b> and the carriage board. According to this printing signal, individual heaters of the printing head <b>7</b> that is during movement are driven, and dots are printed on the print medium on the platen <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(D) Discharging Unit</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The torque of a discharging roller <b>40</b> is obtained by a process where the torque of the conveying roller <b>36</b> is transferred to a discharging roller gear <b>404</b> directly linked to the discharging roller <b>40</b> from the gear part of the pulley gear <b>361</b> directly linked to the conveying roller <b>36</b> through an idler gear <b>45</b>. Referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> again, a discharging code wheel <b>402</b> is installed on the axis of the discharging roller <b>40</b>, and a rotation amount of the discharging roller <b>40</b> is detected by a discharging roller encoder <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A plurality of spurs are attached to a spur holder <b>43</b>, and these spurs are pressed toward the discharging roller <b>40</b> by spur springs each of which is a coil spring provided in a rod-like shape. The print medium on which an image was formed by the printing head <b>7</b> is conveyed while being held between the discharging roller <b>40</b> and a plurality of nips of these spurs, and is discharged.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">(E) Cleaning Unit</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A cleaning unit <b>60</b> consists of a pump for cleaning the printing head <b>7</b>, a cap for suppressing drying out of the printing head <b>7</b>, a blade for cleaning the discharge port plane of the printing head <b>7</b>, etc. A main driving force of the cleaning unit is obtained by a force being transferred from the feed motor <b>99</b> being already explained. The cleaning unit <b>60</b> performs a suction operation of sucking unnecessary ink etc. from the printing head <b>7</b> by acting a pump with a cap adhered to the printing head <b>7</b>, a blade operation of cleaning a face surface of the printing head <b>7</b> by moving a blade, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Below, a characteristic configuration of this embodiment will be explained in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> are diagrams for explaining a mechanism for detecting an origin in the conveying roller <b>36</b> of this embodiment, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the pulley gear <b>361</b> on the conveying roller <b>36</b> when being observed from its front side, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the same when being observed from its reverse side. A lock ring <b>4001</b> is attached to the pulley gear <b>361</b>, has a circumferential part <b>4001</b><i>a </i>and a concave part <b>4001</b><i>b</i>, and rotates integrally with the conveying roller <b>36</b>. By a stopping lever <b>4002</b> rotating about the rotation center <b>4002</b><i>a</i>, it can stop the lock ring <b>4001</b> by bumping the lock part <b>4002</b><i>b </i>against the concave part <b>4001</b><i>b </i>of the lock ring <b>4001</b>. A lock link lever <b>4003</b> is a lever for pressing and pulling up the stopping lever <b>4002</b>, and a pressing force and a pulling up force between the lock link lever <b>4003</b> and the stopping lever <b>4002</b> is generated by a stopping lever spring <b>4004</b>. The force Ftg for turning the lock link lever <b>4003</b> is generated by the carriage <b>50</b> moving to a lock position that is opposite to the home position and is outside the scan area of printing (a left end part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram showing a state of the carriage <b>50</b> in the printing apparatus of this embodiment when being observed from its reverse side, which is opposite to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A protrusion part <b>50</b><i>a </i>is attached to the reverse side of the carriage <b>50</b>. When the carriage <b>50</b> moves to the lock position, the protrusion part <b>50</b><i>a </i>abuts against a slope <b>4003</b><i>a </i>of the lock link lever <b>4003</b>. When a predetermined force Fcr is added to the slope <b>4003</b><i>a </i>of the lock link lever <b>4003</b> by such abutment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> again, a force Ftg that makes the lock link lever <b>4003</b> turn in a direction of an arrow of the figure will occur.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref> are sectional views for concretely explaining steps where a locking function acts through the mechanism explained by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a diagram showing a state where the carriage <b>50</b> is not located at the lock position. Since the lock link lever <b>4003</b> is not pressed, the lock ring <b>4001</b> and the lock ring lever <b>4002</b> are isolated from each other. If during the printing operation, the conveying roller <b>36</b> and the lock ring <b>4001</b> are rotating intermittently in a CW direction of the figure for conveying the print medium.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows a state where the carriage <b>50</b> moves to the lock position, and the lock link lever <b>4003</b> is pressed by the protrusion part <b>50</b><i>a</i>, a mechanical trigger being given to it. Occurrence of Ftg makes the lock link lever <b>4003</b> turn, and the stopping lever <b>4002</b> abuts against the circumferential part <b>4001</b><i>a </i>of the lock ring <b>4001</b> by a thrust of the stopping lever spring <b>4004</b>. At this time, the stopping lever <b>4002</b> is configured to be able to make a stroke into the lock link lever <b>4003</b> even when the stopping lever <b>4002</b> is given a pressure from the circumferential part <b>4001</b><i>a </i>of the lock ring. Therefore, damage by collision between the protrusion part <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the carriage <b>50</b> and the lock link lever <b>4003</b> does not occur. Moreover, with a procedure where the stopping lever <b>4002</b> and the lock link lever <b>4003</b> are constructed in advance with separate parts in this way, a stroke amount of the lock link lever <b>4003</b> and a swing amount of the lock link lever <b>4003</b> can be set up separately, respectively. As a result, it is possible to secure the stroke amount that does not depend on tolerances of these parts, just by which the stopping lever <b>4002</b> can penetrate positively into the concave part <b>4001</b><i>b </i>of the lock ring.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> is a diagram showing a state where the conveying roller <b>36</b> is further rotated starting from the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, and the rotation is locked by the lock ring <b>4001</b>. When the lock ring <b>4001</b> further rotates in the CW direction with the stopping lever <b>4002</b> being abutted against the circumferential part <b>4001</b><i>a </i>of the lock ring <b>4001</b>, a locking part of the stopping lever <b>4002</b> will enter into the concave part <b>4001</b><i>b </i>of the lock ring <b>4001</b>. Then, the locking part inhibits the rotation of the lock ring <b>4001</b> in the CW direction after this. That is, the lock ring <b>4001</b> and the conveying roller <b>36</b> are locked so as not to rotate. Incidentally, at this time, since the lock ring <b>4001</b> is being fixed to the pulley gear <b>361</b> for transferring a driving force from the conveying motor <b>35</b>, no torque occurs between the conveying roller <b>36</b> and the pulley gear <b>361</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Such a locked state (stopping state) occurs only at one determined position among positions when the conveying roller <b>36</b> makes one rotation. Therefore, the position at which the conveying roller was locked (stopped) in this way can be assigned as the origin of the phase of the conveying roller.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Incidentally, it is preferable that the rotation direction of the conveying roller when the locked state is detected is a direction in which the print medium during printing is conveyed (the CW direction), as explained above. Moreover, in the locked state, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the resultant force F resulting from a driving force Fdrive of the conveying roller <b>36</b>, and a lock reaction force Flock from the stopping lever <b>4002</b>, and an angular moment Mlock of the lock ring <b>4001</b> occurs. In doing this, in order to positively install the conveying roller <b>36</b> in the bearing so that reproducibility of conveyance may be secured, it is preferable that individual components are arranged so that the resultant force F may exert in a direction of a bearing <b>8001</b> that supports the shaft of the conveying roller <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the above, the lock ring <b>4001</b> also bears a function of preventing coming-off of the timing belt <b>39</b>, and was explained as of a separate configuration from the pulley gear <b>361</b> in a mold configuration. However, in the case where there is no possibility that the timing belt <b>39</b> may come off, and in the case where the apparatus is configured so that the conveying roller <b>36</b> is driven through gears, the lock ring <b>4001</b> and the pulley gear <b>361</b> may be a monolithic part. Anyway, the constituent components are required to be configured so that the driving force of the conveying motor <b>35</b> and the reaction force when the conveying roller <b>36</b> is locked may not bring about a shift of rotation phase between the conveying roller <b>36</b> and the pulley gear <b>361</b>, or between the conveying roller <b>36</b> and the code wheel <b>362</b>, or the like. At this time, it is also useful to set up an upper limit to the drive voltage and a pulse width to the conveying motor <b>35</b>, or to set up an upper limit to the torque in order to prevent damages to parts.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this embodiment, the state where rotation of the conveying roller <b>36</b> is locked (stopped) is determined, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, by a state where the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> becomes not to detect the slits on the code wheel <b>362</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> are diagrams each showing a timing at which the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> detects the slits of the code wheel <b>362</b> with respect to a time axis t shown as a horizontal axis. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows a state where the conveying roller <b>36</b> is rotating at a predetermined speed. Here, a state where seven slits Sn to Sn+6 are detected within a predetermined time is shown. Since the slits are formed in the code wheel <b>362</b> at regular intervals, when the conveying roller <b>36</b> is rotating at a constant speed, the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> detects the slits at such fixed time intervals. On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows a state where the rotation of the conveying roller <b>36</b> is being locked on the way. Here, after the slits up to Sn+3 were detected, it becomes that even after the predetermined time has lapsed, the slits after them is not detected. At the timing when this situation occurs, a control unit of the printing apparatus can determine that the conveying roller <b>36</b> falls in the locked state.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">To be concrete, in the case where the number of detected slits is less than or equal to 10 within a predetermined time of, for example, about 200 ms, it may be determined that the locked state occurs. Moreover, a state may be determined to be the locked state, for example, when the next slit cannot be detected within a predetermined time after the timing when one slit was detected. With such a configuration of this embodiment, it is possible to positively detect an origin position of the conveying roller by using an existing encoder that is constructed with high resolution, without installing a new electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a block diagram for explaining a configuration of control of the printing apparatus of this embodiment. The CPU <b>501</b> controls the mechanisms in the apparatus through a controller <b>502</b> according to various programs stored in ROM <b>504</b>. In doing this, RAM <b>503</b> is used as a work area at the time of saving various pieces of data primarily or performing a processing. The CPU <b>501</b> performs image processing for converting image data to a printing signal that can be printed by the printing apparatus for the image data received from a host device connected to the outside. Then, the CPU <b>501</b> drives a various motor <b>506</b> through a motor driver <b>507</b> and drives the printing head <b>7</b> through a printing head driver <b>509</b> to form an image on the print medium. In the figure, the motor <b>506</b> and motor driver <b>507</b> show collectively the conveying motor <b>35</b>, the carriage motor <b>54</b>, the feed motor <b>99</b>, and their respective drivers that were described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Electrically writable EEPROM <b>508</b> stores set-up values at a factory and data to be updated, and this data is used as control parameters by the controller <b>502</b> and the CPU <b>501</b>. A sensor <b>505</b> collectively shows the temperature sensors and encoder sensors being set up in various locations in the apparatus, and the above-mentioned conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> is one of them. The CPU <b>501</b> overwrites count information that was obtained by the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> in detecting the slits to ring buffer of the RAM <b>503</b> on an as-needed basis. When the origin is detected, the origin information is stored in another area of the RAM <b>503</b> or in the EEPROM.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flowchart for explaining steps of the processing that the CPU <b>501</b> performs in detecting the origin of the conveying roller <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the origin detection processing is started, the CPU <b>501</b> moves the carriage <b>50</b> to the lock position by driving the carriage motor <b>54</b> at Step S<b>1201</b>. Thereby, the protrusion part <b>50</b><i>a </i>mounted on the carriage <b>50</b> bumps against the slope <b>4003</b><i>a </i>of the lock link lever, the lock link lever <b>4003</b> turns, and the stopping lever <b>4002</b> abuts against the circumferential part <b>4001</b><i>a </i>of the lock ring <b>4001</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the continuing Step S<b>1202</b>, the CPU <b>501</b> rotates the conveying roller <b>36</b> in a direction of conveying the print medium (the CW direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) by driving the conveying motor <b>35</b>. At this time, detection of the slits of the conveying roller encoder sensor is also performed simultaneously. If the CPU <b>501</b> detects the locked state of the conveying roller <b>36</b> by the count information of the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b>, the CPU <b>501</b> halts the driving of the conveying motor <b>35</b> and stops the conveying roller <b>36</b> (Step S<b>1203</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In Step S<b>1204</b>, the CPU <b>501</b> stores a rotational position at which the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> detected the locked state in the RAM <b>503</b> or the EEPROM <b>508</b> as the origin information.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">After this, the CPU <b>501</b> evacuates the carriage <b>50</b> from the lock position at Step S<b>1205</b>. Furthermore, the CPU <b>501</b> makes the conveying roller <b>36</b> rotate by a predetermined amount in a CCW direction by driving the conveying motor <b>35</b> in a direction opposite to the normal direction at Step S<b>1206</b>. Thereby, the concave part <b>4002</b><i>b </i>of the lock ring gets isolated from the stopping lever <b>4002</b>. By the above-mentioned way, this processing is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A value that the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> counts for one rotation of the conveying roller <b>36</b> is a known fixed value, and this serves as one cycle when the phase is managed. Therefore, in printing operations after the origin detection processing explained above was performed, the phase of the conveying roller <b>36</b> can always be grasped from a count value that the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> detects after that, on the basis of the origin information stored at Step S<b>1204</b>. That is, the CPU <b>501</b> can convey the print medium in the high precision state, while correcting a conveyance error resulting from eccentricity of the conveying roller by using the rotation amount and the phase of the conveying roller obtained from the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Incidentally, in the above, although the embodiment was explained to be configured so that the rotational position at which the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> detected the locked state was stored as the original information, the count value that is stored and upgraded at the timing at which this locked state is detected may be reset to zero. If the follow is modified in this way, the phase control after that can be performed in a state where the count value 0 is assumed as the original.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Note that the phase control after the processing of origin detection that was described above can be correctly performed during a time when the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> is operating. However, if the hard power-off is once done, the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> will become not to operate, and the information in the RAM will be erased; therefore, the origin information and the count values will be lost. Therefore, at the time of returning from the hard power-off, the printing apparatus of this embodiment shall newly re-acquire the origin information by performing a series of origin detection processing steps as shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Moreover, even when the apparatus is in a state of hard power-on, if an emphasis is placed on power saving and extension of life of the encoder, there may be a case where the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> is not operated at the time of soft power-off or at the time of absence of the printing operation. In such a case, the series of origin detection processing steps as shown by the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> may be performed each time the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> returns to the operation. Moreover, in the case where there is a less fear that the conveying roller <b>36</b> is rotated by an external force during stoppage of the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b>, it is also effective to, just before stopping the operation of the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b>, store the phase and the origin information at that time.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Furthermore, there is a case where it can be determined that the phase control of the conveying roller <b>36</b> is not needed to be performed depending on a kind of image data, a kind of the print medium, etc. In such a case, the above-mentioned origin detection processing may be performed at timing when the printing operation that needs the phase control of the conveying roller <b>36</b> is first performed after the soft power-on was done.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this embodiment explained above, as explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the locking function is such that the concave part <b>4001</b><i>b </i>is provided in the lock ring <b>4001</b> and a top end of the stopping lever <b>4002</b> protrudes into this, but a shape of the lock ring is not limited to this. For example, the same function can be realized by providing a protrusion part in a part of the circumferential part of the lock ring <b>4001</b> and configuring the protrusion part so that a top end of the stopping lever <b>4002</b> abuts against its side face <b>4001</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, although in the above, the embodiment was explained to be configured so that an event that the rotation of the conveying roller <b>36</b> is locked is detected using the information of the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b>, the present invention is not limited to such a configuration. For example, in the case where a rotation ratio of the conveying roller <b>36</b> and the discharging roller <b>40</b> is 1:1, it is also possible to detect that the conveying roller <b>36</b> is in the locked state using the information of the discharging roller encoder <b>403</b>. Moreover, it is also possible to detect the locked state of the discharging roller <b>40</b> by providing a mechanism for locking the roller on the discharging roller <b>40</b> side, using the information of the conveying roller encoder sensor <b>363</b> and the information of the discharging roller encoder <b>403</b>. Similarly, gears used for transferring of the driving force, for example, the idler gear <b>45</b>, may be considered as an object to be locked (stopped), and means for detecting the rotation amount of one of these gears may be provided separately.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As explained in the foregoing, according to this embodiment, it is possible to acquire the origin of the conveying roller with high precision by assembling an existing encoder sensor that is constructed with high resolution and several pieces of cheap mechanical parts, without installing a new electronic device and cable wiring for this.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Also in this embodiment, the printing apparatus explained by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref> shall be used. However, in this embodiment, a paper spacing switching mechanism provided on the reverse side of the carriage <b>50</b> in advance is also used as means for pressing the lock link lever <b>4003</b>. This paper spacing switching mechanism is a mechanism that is provided to the carriage in order to adjust a distance between the discharge port plane of the printing head <b>7</b> and the print medium depending on a kind of the print medium.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref> are diagrams for explaining the paper spacing switching mechanism of this embodiment, when the carriage <b>50</b> is observed from its reverse side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14C</figref> are diagrams of a slide bearing <b>1301</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref> when being observed from a carriage side.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The slide bearing <b>1301</b> is an axial component that slides on the carriage rail <b>52</b> when the carriage <b>50</b> moves. A paper spacing switching slider <b>1302</b> slides in a direction A-B of the figure, being held by the carriage <b>50</b> and the slide bearing, whereby it changes a distance between the carriage <b>50</b> and the slide bearing <b>1301</b>, i.e., a height of the carriage <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> show a state of a narrow paper spacing (normal position) with the position used for printing on a plain paper or photographic special paper. If the carriage <b>50</b> is moved in the direction A from this state, since a protrusion part <b>1302</b><i>a </i>attached to the paper spacing switching slider <b>1302</b> is held down by an obstacle, only the carriage <b>50</b> and the slide bearing <b>1301</b> move in the direction A. That is, a relative position in the horizontal direction between the paper spacing switching slider <b>1302</b> and the slide bearing <b>1301</b> displaces, and a relative position in the height direction also changes by the mutual slopes. As a result, the carriage mounted on the paper spacing switching slider <b>2302</b> rises. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> show a state where the carriage <b>50</b> has risen in this way by one step to be located at a position where the paper spacing is wide that is for printing on a thick paper, etc. (a thick paper position). Moreover, if the carriage <b>50</b> is further moved in the direction A by the same method, the carriage <b>50</b> will further rise by one more step. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> and the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> show a state where the carriage <b>50</b> further rises by one more step and is located at a position where the paper spacing is the widest (a maximum position), which is at the time of printing a disk such as CD-R. Incidentally, if in a state where the protrusion part <b>1302</b><i>a </i>is held down by the obstacle, the carriage <b>50</b> is moved in the direction <b>3</b>, the carriage <b>50</b> can be returned to an original position. The printing apparatus of this embodiment is configured to be able to adjust the paper spacing distance in three stages according to a kind of the print medium by using thus mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15C</figref> are diagrams each showing a relation of the slide bearing <b>1301</b> and the lock mechanism of the conveying roller when the carriage has moved to the lock position in the case where the paper spacing is at the normal position, at the thick paper position, and at the maximum position, respectively. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, even if the carriage <b>50</b> has moved to the lock position in the state of the normal position or the thick paper position, the protrusion part <b>1302</b><i>a </i>keeps to be isolated from the lock link lever <b>4003</b>; therefore, the lock link lever <b>4003</b> will not turn. That is, a function as trigger means has become invalid. On the other hand, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15C</figref>, in the case where the paper spacing is at the maximum position, when the carriage <b>50</b> has moved to the lock position, the protrusion part <b>1302</b><i>a </i>abuts against the slope <b>4003</b><i>a </i>of the lock link lever <b>4003</b>; therefore, the lock link lever <b>4003</b> turns in the CW direction. That is, a function as the trigger means is kept valid. Incidentally, the apparatus is designed so that a force of turning the lock link lever <b>4003</b> may be sufficiently smaller that the slide force of the paper spacing switching slider <b>1302</b> in order that the paper spacing switching slider <b>1302</b> would not be shifted in turning the lock link lever <b>4003</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> are diagrams for explaining a paper spacing position and a movement area of the carriage <b>50</b> in this embodiment. In the case where the print medium is of the fixed size, such as the plain paper, the photographic special paper, or the thick paper, in order to perform printing on the whole area of the print medium in its width direction, the carriage does reciprocation in a range indicated by an arrow of a solid line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>. That is, the carriage <b>50</b> moves also to the lock position during the printing operation. However, since the paper spacing position is either the normal position or the thick paper position at this time, even when the carriage <b>50</b> reaches the lock position, the protrusion part <b>1302</b><i>a </i>dose not abut against the slope <b>4003</b><i>a </i>of the lock link lever <b>4003</b>, and consequently the lock link lever <b>4003</b> does not turn.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the case where the print medium is CD-R, the carriage only needs to move in a range indicated by an arrow of a solid line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> and does not move to the lock position for printing operation. That is, there is no possibility that the conveying roller <b>36</b> may be locked in the midst of performing the printing operation to CD-R. On the other hand, in acquiring the origin information of the conveying roller <b>36</b>, the paper spacing is set to the maximum position and the carriage <b>50</b> is moved to the lock position indicated by an arrow of a broken line.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a flowchart for explaining steps of the processing that the CPU <b>501</b> performs in detecting the origin of the conveying roller <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In this embodiment, when the origin detection processing is started, first the paper spacing distance is set to the maximum position at step S<b>1801</b>. This may be done by the CPU <b>501</b> automatically or the user may be requested to do so. At the continuing Step S<b>1802</b>, the carriage <b>50</b> moves to the lock position by driving the carriage motor <b>54</b>. Since the paper spacing is being set to the maximum position, at timing when the carriage <b>50</b> reaches the lock position, the protrusion part <b>1302</b><i>a </i>abuts against the slope <b>4003</b><i>a </i>of the lock link lever <b>4003</b>, which makes the lock link lever <b>4003</b> turn. Hereafter, the steps of Step S<b>1803</b> to Step S<b>1807</b> are the same as those of the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> explained in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In order not to lock the conveying roller <b>36</b> in the midst of a printing operation, it is needed that the lock link lever <b>4003</b> and the trigger means on the carriage <b>50</b> abutting against this abut against each other outside the movement area where the carriage <b>50</b> is in the printing operation. That is, in the case where the protrusion part <b>50</b><i>a </i>fixed on the reverse side of the carriage <b>50</b> is used as the trigger means like the first embodiment, an area that is the movement area necessary for the operation of printing on a fixed size print medium added with a width of the lock position is required as a moveable area of the carriage <b>50</b>. As a result, in the printing apparatus of the first embodiment, the width larger than the width shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> by an addition of the width of the lock position becomes necessary, which leads to a larger size of the apparatus compared to this embodiment. In the printing apparatus of this embodiment, the lock position of the printing apparatus is included in a usual printing area when the printing area is wide, and becomes as the lock position only when the printing area width is narrow. By this fact, the origin information of the conveying roller can be acquired without incurring enlargement of the printing apparatus, contrary to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Incidentally, with the above-mentioned configuration, if the printing operation is done on the print medium of the fixed size with the paper spacing of the maximum position, it will become unable to divide the normal printing operation and the origin acquisition operation. However, even in the case like this, if the stroke area of the slider that realizes the same paper spacing may be further widened and the area is brought into correspondence with two positions of the paper spacing switching slider <b>1303</b>, the above-mentioned problem can be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> show the configuration of realizing two stage paper spacing, and are diagrams for explaining a configuration in which the stroke area at the large-paper-spacing position is brought into correspondence with the two positions of the paper spacing switching slider <b>1303</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> is a diagram showing a positional relation of the paper spacing switching slider <b>1303</b> and the slide bearing <b>1301</b> in the case where the paper spacing is wide and the normal printing operation is performed. On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> is a diagram showing a positional relation of the paper spacing switching slider <b>1303</b> and the slide bearing <b>1301</b> at the time of acquiring the origin information. Although the paper spacing is in a wide state in either state, the printing apparatus is configured as follows: in the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, when the carriage <b>50</b> moves to the lock position, the protrusion part does not abut against the lock link lever; and in the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the protrusion part abuts against the lock link lever so as to lock the conveying roller.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described in the foregoing, according to this embodiment, the printing apparatus is configured so that the protrusion part mounted on the paper spacing switching slider can be used as the trigger means for locking the conveying roller, and the function of the trigger means can be switched to be valid or invalid by the paper spacing switching slider. Thereby, the same effect as that of the first embodiment can be realized, without incurring enlargement of the printing apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Also in this embodiment, the printing apparatus explained by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref> shall be used. However, in this embodiment, the conveying roller is locked by using a trigger component driven by the feed motor. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the printing apparatus of this embodiment is configured so that the feed roller <b>28</b> may rotate in a direction of feeding the print medium by the feed motor <b>99</b> making a positive rotation and subsequently the pressure plate <b>21</b> may rise. By this series of operations, one sheet of paper that is at the highest position among a plurality of print medium is fed into the inside of the apparatus. Thus, what is necessary in order to prevent the pressure plate <b>21</b> from going up until the feed roller <b>28</b> makes the predetermined forward rotation amount is just to provide the well-known drive delay mechanism and to secure an insensitive rotation amount. Note that in a state where the pressure plate <b>21</b> has not risen in this mechanism, as during waiting of print medium feeding, if the feed motor <b>99</b> rotates by a fixed amount in whichever direction, positive direction or reverse direction, the feed roller <b>28</b> does not contact with the print medium and the print medium does not move. In this embodiment, the trigger component is made to operate using the normal and reverse rotations of a predetermined amount by the feed roller <b>28</b> in a state where the pressure plate <b>21</b> does not rise, in this way, and the origin of the conveying roller <b>36</b> is acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref> are sectional views for explaining steps in which the locking function in the printing apparatus of this embodiment acts. The trigger component <b>1901</b> is jointed to the feed roller <b>28</b> by means of friction rotational joint (torque limiter joint) and is configured so that it may rotate to a position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> when the feed roller <b>28</b> rotates in a forward direction and may rotate to a position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> when the feed roller <b>28</b> rotates in a reverse direction. When acquiring the origin, if the feed roller <b>28</b> is rotated in the reverse direction by a predetermined amount in a state where the pressure plate <b>21</b> is lowered, a trigger component <b>1901</b> rotates in the CW direction. When the trigger component is rotated to a predetermined rotary position (the lock position), the lever part <b>1901</b><i>a </i>of the trigger component <b>1901</b> abuts against the protrusion part <b>4003</b><i>a </i>provided in the lock link lever <b>4003</b> and pushes this in the downward direction, which makes the lock link lever <b>4003</b> turn. If the conveying roller <b>36</b><i>a </i>is made to rotate in the CW direction in this state, the stopping lever <b>4002</b> of the lock link lever <b>4003</b> enters into the concave part <b>4002</b><i>a </i>of the lock ring <b>4001</b> by the same mechanism of the above-mentioned embodiment, the conveying roller <b>36</b><i>a </i>is locked (stopped), and thereby the origin information can be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">After that, if the trigger component <b>1901</b> is set back to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> by making the feed roller <b>28</b> rotate in the forward direction, and subsequently the conveying roller <b>36</b> is made to rotate in the CCW direction, the locked state is canceled by an applied force of the stopping lever spring <b>4004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As described in the foregoing, according to this embodiment, it is possible to acquire the origin of the conveying roller with high precision by preparing the trigger means that is jointed to the feed roller <b>28</b> by means of friction rotational joint, without installing a new electronic device and cable wiring for this.</p>
