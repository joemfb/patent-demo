<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention is directed to a lubricant composition that is comprised of a continuous phase and a discontinuous phase. More specifically, this invention is directed to a two phase lubricant composition having a continuous phase of at least one Group II, III, IV or GTL base stock, optionally a low viscosity Group V base stock, and a discontinuous phase of at least one high viscosity ester having no ether linkages.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A particular class of lubricant composition can be characterized as liquid lubricants having at least two distinct liquid phases. Often, these types of lubricants are considered as dispersions, although they are also referred to as emulsions. These types of lubricants are readily identified as having a relatively small quantity of the discontinuous phase, which is comprised of an oil type component and dispersed throughout the continuous oil base oil phase. Since an oil type composition is dispersed through another oil type composition, these lubricants are also referred to as oil-in-oil emulsions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Oil-in-oil emulsions can provide substantial wear protection, yet be lower in viscosity relative to standard mineral oil type blended lubricants. Such lubricants can be useful in many applications and are desirable for their superior properties related to low viscosities, improved film thickness, and better lubricating performance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,972,275, Forbus, discloses an oil-in-oil emulsion type of lubricant composition. The particular lubricant composition has a continuous phase of a carrier fluid comprised of polyalphaolefins and alkylated aromatics, and a discontinuous phase of a higher viscosity fluid. The carrier fluid and the high viscosity fluid are substantially immiscible and together form a relatively stable emulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Two phase lubricants such as oil-in-oil emulsions have very good potential for numerous commercial applications. However, additional improvements in overall lubricant quality and performance are desired. Additional wear protection and lower drag are examples of qualities in which improvements are being sought.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This invention provides a lubricant composition that is comprised of a continuous phase and a discontinuous phase, i.e., a two phase lubricant composition, that has enhanced performance. In particular, the lubricant composition of this invention provides additional wear protection relative to comparable lubricants.

Preferably, the continuous phase base oil comprises not greater than 5 wt % of a Group V base stock, base on total weight of the continuous phase base oil.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the ester composition has, independently, a viscosity greater than 100 cSt at 100&#xb0; C.</p>

Preferably, the lubricant composition has a discontinuous phase has not greater than 10 wt. % ester having ether linkages, based on total independent weight of the discontinuous phase.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the ester composition is comprised of adipate ester. Alternatively, the ester composition is comprised of complex ester.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0020">The lubricant composition optionally comprises one or more additive components. For example, the lubricant composition can comprise at least one nitrogen-containing olefin polymer dispersant or stabilizing agent. These types of components can be present in the lubricant composition in an amount of from 0.001 wt. % to 2 wt. %, based on total weight of the lubricating composition.</p>

Alternatively, the at least one nitrogen-containing olefin polymer dispersant or stabilizing agent is an olefin copolymer containing at least one dispersing group selected from the group consisting of alkyl amine, aryl amine, amide, a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group and an ester group.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">The lubricant can also include as an optional component at least antiwear agent in an amount of from 0.001 wt. % to 2 wt. %, based on total weight of the lubricating composition. For example, the antiwear agent can be an organic phosphate. A particular example of an the antiwear agent is triaryl phosphate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">The lubricant is typically low in sulfur. For example, the continuous phase base oil has, independently, a sulfur content of not greater than 0.05 wt %, based on total weight of the continuous phase base oil.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">This invention provides a lubricant composition that is comprised of a continuous phase and a discontinuous phase, i.e., a two phase lubricant composition. The continuous phase can also be referred to as a dispersion medium, and the discontinuous phase as a dispersed phase. The discontinuous or dispersed phase can be considered as particles or droplets, with the droplets being dispersed throughout the continuous phase.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">The continuous phase and the discontinuous phase of the lubricant of this invention are oil or oil type compositions that are essentially insoluble in one another. The continuous phase can be any of a variety of relatively low viscosity oils, whereas the discontinuous phase is comprised of droplets of relatively high viscosity ester.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0035">The lubricant composition is comprised of a continuous phase base oil that is comprised of a low viscosity Group II, III, IV or GTL base stock, or a blend of at least two the Group II, III, IV and GTL base stocks, optionally including a low viscosity Group V base stock, with the continuous phase base oil having, independently, a viscosity of from 1 to 100 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. The lubricant composition is further comprised of a discontinuous phase that is comprised of an ester composition having a mean average droplet size of from 0.01 microns to 20 microns, in which the ester composition is comprised of at least one ester compound having no ether linkages.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0036">The lubricant composition of this invention provides a high degree of wear protection for a variety of high pressure mechanical equipment. The lubricant is generally lower in viscosity relative to comparable single as well as dual phase lubricants. Due to the lower overall viscosity, machinery that is operated with the lubricant will experience less viscous drag. This means that the lubricant can provide a high degree of wear protection at lower energy consumption relative to comparable lubricants.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Continuous Phase Base Oil</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">a. Group II, III, IV or GTL Base Stock</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">The lubricant composition of this invention comprises a continuous phase base oil of relatively low viscosity. The continuous phase base oil is comprised of a Group II, III, IV or Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) base stock or a blend of at least two of the Group II, III, IV or GTL base stocks. The terms &#x201c;base oil&#x201d; and &#x201c;base stock&#x201d; as referred to herein are to be considered consistent with the definitions as also stated in APPENDIX E&#x2014;API BASE OIL INTERCHANGEABILITY GUIDELINES FOR PASSENGER CAR MOTOR OILS AND DIESEL ENGINE OILS, July 2009 Version. According to Appendix E, base oil is the base stock or blend of base stocks used in an API-licensed oil. Base stock is a lubricant component that is produced by a single manufacturer to the same specifications (independent of feed source or manufacturer's location); that meets the same manufacturer's specification; and that is identified by a unique formula, product identification number, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">The continuous phase base oil has, independently, a viscosity of from 1 cSt to 100 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. The term independently means that the viscosity of the continuous phase base oil is determined after blending all of the individual base stocks together that comprise the continuous base oil phase, and prior to blending with the discontinuous phase base oil of relatively higher viscosity. Preferably, the continuous phase base oil has, independently, a viscosity of not greater than 80 cSt at 100&#xb0; C., alternatively, not greater than 50 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. or not greater than 30 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. Exemplary ranges include from 1 cSt to 80 cSt at 100&#xb0; C., from 2 cSt to 60 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. and from 4 cSt to 50 cSt at 100&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">In an embodiment, the continuous phase base oil has, independently, a sulfur content of not greater than 0.05 wt %, based on total weight of the continuous phase base oil.

<p id="p-0045" num="0050">In one embodiment of the invention, the polyolefin base oil component of this invention has a M<sub>w </sub>(weight average molecular weight) of about 200,000 or less, preferably from about 250 to 150,000, alternatively from about 280 to 100,000, or from about 300 to about 75,000 g/mol.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">The polyolefin base oil component of this invention can have a molecular weight distribution (MWD) of greater than 1. MWD is defined as the ratio of weight-averaged MW to number-averaged MW (M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>), which is preferably determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene standards, as described in <i>Principles of Polymer Systems</i>, Fourth Edition, Ferdinand Rodrigues, Chapter 6, McGraw-Hill Book. An example of GPC solvent is HPLC Grade tetrahydrofuran, uninhibited, with the procedure being carried out at a column temperature of 30&#xb0; C., a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and a sample concentration of 1 wt %, with a Column Set being a Phenogel 500 A, Linear, 10E6A. In one embodiment, the MWD is less than 5, preferably less than 4, preferably less than 3, preferably less than 2.5, preferably less than 2. Alternatively, polyolefin base oil component has a M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n </sub>of from 1 to 3.5, alternatively from 1 to 2.5.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">In one embodiment, the polyolefin base oil component has an unimodal M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n </sub>determined by GPC. In another embodiment, the polyolefin base oil component has a multi-modal molecular weight distribution, where the MWD can be greater than 5. In another aspect, the polyolefin base oil component has a shoulder peak either before or after, or both before and after the major unimodal distribution. In this case, the MWD can be broad (&#x3e;5) or narrow (&#x3c;5 or &#x3c;3 or &#x3c;2), depending on the amount and size of the shoulder.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">For many applications when superior shear stability, thermal stability or thermal/oxidative stability is preferred, it is preferable to have the polyolefins made with the narrowest possible MWD. PAO fluids with different viscosities, but made from the same feeds or catalysts, usually have different MWDs. In other words, MWDs of PAO fluids are dependent on fluid viscosity. Usually, lower viscosity fluids have narrower MWDs (smaller MWD value) and higher viscosity fluids have broader MWDs (larger MWD value). For a polyolefin base oil component with 100&#xb0; C. KV of less than 100 cSt, or not greater than 80 cSt, or not greater than 50 cSt, or not greater than 30 cSt, the MWD of is preferably less than 2.5, alternatively less than 2.3.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">M<sub>w </sub>and M<sub>n </sub>are also preferably measured by GPC method using a column for medium- to low-molecular weight polymers. Preferably the GPC method is carried out with tetrahydrofuran as solvent and polystyrene as calibration standard, as described above for MWD determination.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the polyolefin base oil component has a pour point of less than 25&#xb0; C.

<p id="p-0051" num="0056">Preferably, the polyolefin base oil component has a peak melting point (T<sub>m</sub>) of 0&#xb0; C. or less, and preferably have no measurable T<sub>m</sub>. &#x201c;No measurable T<sub>m</sub>&#x201d; is defined to be when there is no clear melting as observed by heat absorption in the DSC heating cycle measurement. Usually the amount of heat absorption is less than 20 J/g. It is preferred to have the heat release of less than 10 J/g, preferred less than 5 J/g, more preferred less than 1 J/g. Usually, it is preferred to have lower melting temperature, preferably below 0&#xb0; C., more preferably below &#x2212;10&#xb0; C., more preferably below &#x2212;20&#xb0; C., more preferably below &#x2212;30&#xb0; C., more preferably below &#x2212;40&#xb0; C., most preferably no clear melting peak in DSC.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">Peak melting point (T<sub>m</sub>), crystallization temperature (T<sub>c</sub>), heat of fusion and degree of crystallinity (also referred to as % crystallinity) can be determined using the following procedure. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) data is obtained using a TA Instruments model 2920 machine. Samples weighing approximately 7-10 mg are sealed in aluminum sample pans. The DSC data can be recorded by first cooling the sample to &#x2212;100&#xb0; C., and then gradually heating to 30&#xb0; C. at a rate of 10&#xb0; C./minute. The sample can be kept at 30&#xb0; C. for 5 minutes before a second cooling-heating cycle is applied. Both the first and second cycle thermal events should be recorded. Areas under the curves are preferably measured and used to determine the heat of fusion and the degree of crystallinity. Additional details of such procedure is described in US Patent Pub. No. 2009/0036725.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">In one embodiment of the invention, the polyolefin base oil component is preferred to have no appreciable cold crystallization in DSC measurement. During the heating cycle for the DSC method as described above, the PAO may crystallize if it has any crystallizable fraction. This cold crystallization can be observed on the DSC curve as a distinct region of heat release. The extent of the crystallization can be measured by the amount of heat release. Higher amount of heat release at lower temperature means higher degree of poor low temperature product. The cold crystallization is usually less desirable, as it may mean that the fluid may have very poor low temperature properties&#x2014;not suitable for high performance application. It is preferred to have less than 20 j/g of heat release for this type of cold crystallization, preferred less than 10 j/g, less than 5 j/g and less than 1 j/g, most preferably to have no observable heat release due to cold crystallization during DSC heating cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">In another preferred embodiment, the polyolefin base oil component will have a viscosity index (VI) of greater than 60, preferably greater than 100, more preferably greater than 120, preferably at least 150. VI is determined according to ASTM Method D 2270-93 [1998]. VI of a fluid is usually dependent on the viscosity, feed composition and method of preparation. Higher viscosity fluid of the same feed composition usually has higher VI. The typical VI range for fluids made from C<sub>3 </sub>or C<sub>4 </sub>or C<sub>5 </sub>linear alpha-olefin (LAO) will typically be from 65 to 250. Typical VI range for fluids made from C<sub>6 </sub>or C<sub>7 </sub>will be from 100 to 300, depending on fluid viscosity. Typical VI range for fluids made from C<sub>8 </sub>to C<sub>14 </sub>LAO, such as 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene or 1-undecene or 1-dodecene, 1-tetra-decene, are from 120 to &#x3e;450, depending on viscosity. More specifically, the VI range for fluids made from 1-decene or 1-decene equivalent feeds are from about 100 to about 500, preferably from about 120 to about 400. Two or three or more alpha-olefins can be used as feeds, such as combination of C<sub>3</sub>+C<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>+C<sub>14</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>+C<sub>16</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>+C<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>+C<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>+C<sub>18</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>+C<sub>16</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>+C<sub>4</sub>+C<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>+C<sub>4</sub>+C<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>+C<sub>10</sub>+C<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>+C<sub>10</sub>+C<sub>14</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>+C<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>+C<sub>12</sub>+C<sub>14</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>+C<sub>6</sub>+C<sub>10</sub>+C<sub>14</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>+C<sub>6</sub>+C<sub>8</sub>+C<sub>10</sub>+C<sub>12</sub>+C<sub>14</sub>+C<sub>16</sub>+C<sub>18</sub>, etc. The product VI depends on the fluid viscosity and also on the choice of feed olefin composition. For the most demanding lubricant applications, it is better to use fluids with higher VI.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060">In another embodiment, it is preferable that the PAO base oil does not contain a significant amount of very light fraction. These light fractions contribute to high volatility, unstable viscosity, poor oxidative and thermal stability. They are usually removed in the final product. It is generally preferable to have less than 5 wt % of the polyolefin base oil with C<sub>20 </sub>or lower carbon numbers, more preferably less than 10 wt % of the polyolefin base oil with C<sub>24 </sub>or lower carbon numbers or more preferably less than 15 wt % of the polyolefin base oil with C<sub>26 </sub>or lower carbon numbers. It is preferable to have less than 3 wt % of the polyolefin base oil with C<sub>20 </sub>or lower carbon numbers, more preferably less than 5 wt % of the polyolefin base oil with C<sub>24 </sub>or lower carbon numbers or more preferably less than 8 wt % of the polyolefin base oil with C<sub>26 </sub>or lower carbon numbers. It is preferable to have less than 2 wt % of the polyolefin base oil with C<sub>20 </sub>or lower carbon numbers, more preferably less than 3 wt % of the polyolefin base oil with C<sub>24 </sub>or lower carbon numbers or more preferably less than 5 wt % of the polyolefin base oil with C<sub>26 </sub>or lower carbon numbers. Also, the lower the amount of any of these light hydrocarbons, the better the fluid property of the polyolefin base oil as can be determined by Noack volatility testing (ASTM D5800).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0061">In another embodiment, it is preferable that the PAO base oil does not contain a significant amount of a high molecular weight fraction. Such PAOs can be made by removing the high MW fraction or by using preferred metallocene catalysts (referred to as mPAO). Preferably, the PAO has not more than 5.0 wt % of polymer having a molecular weight of greater than 45,000 Daltons. Additionally or alternately, the amount of the PAO that has a molecular weight greater than 45,000 Daltons is not more than 1.5 wt %, or not more than 0.10 wt %. Additionally or alternately, the amount of the PAO that has a molecular weight greater than 60,000 Daltons is not more than 0.5 wt %, or not more than 0.20 wt %, or not more than 0.1 wt %. The mass fractions at molecular weights of 45,000 and 60,000 can be determined by GPC, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">In general, Noack volatility is a strong function of fluid viscosity. Lower viscosity fluid usually has higher volatility and higher viscosity fluid has lower volatility. Preferably, the polyolefin base oil has a Noack volatility of less than 30 wt %, preferably less than 25 wt %, preferably less than 10 wt %, preferably less than 5 wt %, preferably less than 1 wt %, and preferably less than 0.5 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063">In another embodiment, the polyolefin base oil has a dielectric constant of 3 or less, usually 2.5 or less (1 kHz at 23&#xb0; C., as determined by ASTM D 924).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">In another embodiment, the polyolefin base oil can have a specific gravity of 0.6 to 0.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably 0.7 to 0.88 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">In another embodiment, the PAO's produced directly from the oligomerization or polymerization process are unsaturated olefins. The amount of unsaturation can be quantitatively measured by bromine number measurement according to the ASTM D 1159, or by proton or carbon-13 NMR. Proton NMR spectroscopic analysis can also differentiate and quantify the types of olefinic unsaturation: vinylidene, 1,2-disubstituted, trisubstituted, or vinyl. Carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy can confirm the olefin distribution calculated from the proton spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">Both proton and carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy can quantify the extent of short chain branching (SCB) in the olefin oligomer, although carbon-13 NMR can provide greater specificity with respect to branch lengths. In the proton spectrum, the SCB branch methyl resonances fall in the 1.05-0.7 ppm range. SCBs of sufficiently different length will give methyl peaks that are distinct enough to be integrated separately or deconvoluted to provide a branch length distribution. The remaining methylene and methine signals resonate in the 3.0-1.05 ppm range. In order to relate the integrals to CH, CH<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>3 </sub>concentrations, each integral must be corrected for the proton multiplicity. The methyl integral is divided by three to derive the number of methyl groups; the remaining aliphatic integral is assumed to comprise one CH signal for each methyl group, with the remaining integral as CH<sub>2 </sub>signal. The ratio of CH<sub>3</sub>/(CH+CH<sub>2</sub>+CH<sub>3</sub>) gives the methyl group concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">Similar logic applies to the carbon-13 NMR analysis, with the exception that no proton multiplicity corrections need be made. Furthermore, the enhanced spectral/structural resolution of <sup>13</sup>C NMR vis a vis <sup>1</sup>H NMR allows differentiation of ions according to branch lengths. Typically, the methyl resonances can be integrated separately to give branch concentrations for methyls (20.5-15 ppm), propyls (15-14.3 ppm), butyl-and-longer branches (14.3-13.9 ppm), and ethyls (13.9-7 ppm).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">Olefin analysis is readily performed by proton NMR, with the olefinic signal between 5.9 and 4.7 ppm subdivided according to the alkyl substitution pattern of the olefin. Vinyl group CH protons resonate between 5.9-5.7 ppm, and the vinyl CH<sub>2 </sub>protons between 5.3 and 4.85 ppm. 1,2-disubstituted olefinic protons resonate in the 5.5-5.3 ppm range. The trisubstituted olefin peaks overlap the vinyl CH<sub>2 </sub>peaks in the 5.3-4.85 ppm region; the vinyl contributions to this region are removed by subtraction based on twice the vinyl CH integral. The 1,1-disubstituted- or vinylidene-olefins resonate in the 4.85-4.6 ppm region. The olefinic resonances, once corrected for the proton multiplicities can be normalized to give a mole-percentage olefin distribution, or compared to the multiplicity-corrected aliphatic region (as was described above for the methyl analysis) to give fractional concentrations (e.g. olefins per 100 carbons).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">Generally, the amount of unsaturation strongly depends on fluid viscosity or fluid molecular weight. Lower viscosity fluid has higher degree of unsaturation and higher bromine number. Higher viscosity fluid has lower degree of unsaturation and lower bromine number. If a large amount of hydrogen or high hydrogen pressure is applied during the polymerization step, the bromine number can be lower than without the hydrogen presence. Typically, for PAO produced from 1-decene or other suitable LAOS, the as-synthesized PAO will have bromine number of from 80 to less than 1, but greater than 0, preferably from about 40 to about 0.01, preferably from about 20 to about 0.5, depending on fluid viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">GTL base stocks include base stocks derived from one or many possible types of GTL processes. The GTL process generally refers to a chemical conversion of natural gas, mostly methane, into synthesis gas (mainly CO and hydrogen). Alternatively, solid coal can also be converted into synthesis gas of mainly CO and hydrogen. The synthesis gas is then converted into mostly linear paraffins by Fishcher-Tropsch process. The linear paraffins have wide molecular size distributions. The high molecular weight linear paraffinic fraction of C<sub>25 </sub>and higher can be isolated by distillation or fractionation and then subjected to hydro-isomerization by different catalysts into lubricant base stocks. This GTL base stock has kinematic viscosity @100&#xb0; C. (KV100) of 3 to 20 or 30 cSt in certain embodiments. The GTL base stocks and/or base oil may be used as such or in combination with other hydrodewaxed or hydroisomerized, catalytic or solvent dewaxed lube base stock.</p>

<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Methods of Making</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0153">The lubricant composition of this invention can be prepared by any method suitable for producing stable emulsions. As one example, the lubricant composition can be prepared by heating the low viscosity continuous phase base oil and the high viscosity discontinuous phase ester together to a temperature where they dissolve with agitation followed by cooling the mixture. A protocol for producing the lubricants can include the steps of combining lower viscosity and higher viscosity materials, heating the resulting mixture with simultaneous agitation to a temperature at which the fluids substantially dissolve. Heating can be at a temperature of from 20&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C., preferably from 30&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C., until the materials are substantially dissolved. The dissolved fluids are then cooled to a temperature at which the fluids separate into a continuous phase and a discontinuous phase. Cooling will involve a reduction in temperature from the heating temperature of at least 20&#xb0; C., preferably at least 30&#xb0; C., and preferably not below 0&#xb0; C. or below 10&#xb0; C. The formation of a continuous phase and a discontinuous phase at the cooling temperature can be referred to as an emulsion as well as a dispersion.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0154">Microfluidization steps can be incorporated into the process for making the lubricant composition. Microfluidization can be carried out by any suitable microfluidizer for producing either emulsions or dispersions, and that is capable of reducing mean particle size of the discontinuous phase material. The primary forces for microfluidization are:

        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0156">b. impact, involving collision of the particles processed with solid elements of the microfluidizer, and collision between the particles being processed; and</li>
        <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0157">c. cavitation, involving an increased change in velocity with a decreased change in pressure, and turbulent flow. An additional force can be attributed to attrition, i.e., grinding by friction.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0158">M-110 series laboratory scale microfluidizers available from Microfluidics&#x2122;, Newton, Mass., can be used according to this invention. These microfluidizers contain an air motor connected to a hydraulic pump, which circulates the process fluid, i.e., the cooled emulsion or dispersion. The fluid is propelled at high pressures (up to 23,000 psi) through a chamber that has fixed microchannels for focusing the fluid stream and accelerating it to a high velocity. Within the chamber the fluid is subjected to intense shear, impact and cavitation, all of which contribute to particle size reduction. After processing, the fluid stream is passed through a heat exchanger coil, and the fluid can be collected or recirculated through the machine. The heat exchanger and chamber can be externally cooled with a refrigerated circulating water bath.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0159">Solvent displacement emulsification steps can also be incorporated into the process for making the lubricant composition. A &#x201c;displacing solvent&#x201d; can be defined as any solvent or mixture of solvents that has at least some miscibility with the discontinuous phase ester composition so that the discontinuous phase ester is replaced with the solvent when the discontinuous phase composition is contacted with continuous phase base oil. Preferably, the displacing solvent is a low viscosity ester of the type described in the Group V optional component above.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0169">The gear box input shaft torque can be measured using an in-line torquemeter. Two types of experiments are preferably run. In the first the temperature is allowed to equilibrate to demonstrate heat lost thru oil churning. In the second the temperature is fixed and energy required to turn the gears at fixed rpm levels measured. Data can be collected electronically and analyzed for power loss for the different lubricants tested. Thus, one aspect of this invention is directed to a method for reducing energy consumption in operating machinery. The method comprises adding the lubricating composition of this invention to the machine and operating the machinery.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0170">The shear stability, viscosity, and other properties of the blended lubricating composition allows the machinery to employ lower operating temperatures, which leads to lower energy consumption and lower energy costs. The lower operating temperature also leads to less degradation of the machinery and seals due to heat, and thus provides a longer machine life and longer seal life.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0182">Emulsions (2) through (5) contain 0.05 wt % Hitec 5777. In those prepared by Process 1, the Hitec 5777 is dissolved in the non-polar, SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6, phase. In those prepared by Process 2, it is dissolved in the polar, high viscosity Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester phase. The location of the Hitec 5777 strongly affects its ability to stabilize the emulsions as demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Emulsions (2) and (3) have the same composition, but are prepared by Process 1 and 2, respectively. The droplet size and light transmittance of Emulsion (2) are significantly lower than those of Emulsion (3). The Hitec 5777 is better able to stabilize the emulsions when it is in the non-polar, SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 phase. Emulsions (4) and (5) have the same composition, and have been prepared by Process 1 and 2, respectively. Again, the droplet size and light transmittance of Emulsion (4) prepared by Process 1 are significantly lower than those of Emulsion (5) prepared by Process 2. Process 1 is preferred. It has been shown previously that the presence of Durad 90 in the polar Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester phase has beneficial effect on Hitec 5777 stabilization of Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester emulsions. Emulsion (4) is by far the most stable emulsion.</p>

<p id="p-0159" num="0183">Emulsions of 0.5 wt % Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester in SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 with and without stabilizing agent were prepared by microfluidization (4XMF) and solvent displacement emulsification (SDE) techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0184">The microfluidized emulsion without surfactant was prepared as follows. Esterex&#x2122; derived A51 Complex Ester was used with a viscosity of 186 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. and density was 1.05 g/cc at 15.4&#xb0; C. SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 was obtained from ExxonMobil Chemical Company. Its viscosity was 5.8 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. and density was 0.827 g/cc at 15.4&#xb0; C. A 0.5 wt % dispersion of Complex Ester in SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 was prepared by weighing 2.0 g of Complex Ester and 398 g of SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 into a 1000 ml glass beaker. A 3 inch magnetic stirbar was placed in the bottom of the beaker and the sample was mixed at a setting of 5 on a Corning Model PC/620 Stirrer/Hot Plate as it was heated to 65&#xb0; C. and held at 65&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. The heat and stirring were then turned off and the sample was allowed to cool to room temperature. The median volume based droplet size of the resulting emulsion was determined to be 52.6 microns with a Horiba LA910 Light Scattering Particle Size Analyzer. The sample was then passed through a lab scale model 110T microfluidizer four times at 12,000 psi. The median droplet size was reduced to 2.20 microns. The microfluidized emulsions with stabilizing agent were prepared by the same procedure. One contained 0.05 wt % of a high nitrogen polyisobutylene succinic anhydride polyamine (PIBSA-PAM) dispersant, predissolved in SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6. The other contained 0.05 wt % Afton Hitec 5777, a low nitrogen containing amine grafted olefin copolymer, predissolved in the SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6. The median droplet size of the initial and microfluidized emulsions stabilized with PIBSA-PAM were 40.3 and 1.36 microns, respectively. The median droplet size of the initial and microfluidized emulsions stabilized with Hitec 5777 were 23.8 (check) and 2.10 microns, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0185">The solvent displacement emulsion without stabilizing agent was made with a low viscosity ester diluent by the following procedure. A stock solution of 10 wt % of Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester was prepared in ExxonMobil Chemical Company low viscosity adipate ester diluent. The viscosity of the adipate ester was 5.2 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. and density was 0.91 at 15.4&#xb0; C. 95.0 g of ExxonMobil Chemical Company SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 was weighed into a 400 ml beaker. A 2.5 inch magnetic stirrer was placed on the bottom of the beaker. The solution was stirred at a setting of 4 on a Corning Stir\Hotplate (approximately 175 RPM). 6 ml (5.0 grams) of the Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester solution was added in a dropwise manner into the stirred SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 through an 18 guage syringe needle positioned above the surface of the emulsion at a point halfway between the center of the vortex and the edge of the beaker. The addition rate of the Esterex&#x2122; solution with a syringe pump was 0.9 ml/min. The temperature of the SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 was 22.5&#xb0; C. The median droplet size of the resulting emulsion measured with a Horiba LA910 Light Scattering Particle Size Analyzer was 2.36 microns. The solvent displacement emulsion with stabilizing agent was made by a similar procedure. 0.05 wt % Afton Hitec 5777 was dissolved in SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 prior to addition of the Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester solution. The Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester solution contained an additional additive, Chemtura Durad 90 antiwear agent. The composition of the diluent solution was 10 wt % Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester, 9 wt % Durad 90 and 81 wt % of the diluent. 5.0 grams of the diluent solution was added in a dropwise manner at 0.9 ml/min to 95.0 grams of stirred SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 solution containing Hitec 5777. The composition of the resulting emulsion was 0.5 wt % Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester, 0.05 wt % Hitec 5777 and 0.45 wt % Durad 90 in SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6. The median droplet size of the resulting emulsion was 1.37 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0186">All five emulsions were subjected to the following dynamic stability test. 100 ml of emulsion was added to a 250 ml glass beaker. A 2 inch magnetic stirbar was placed in the bottom of the beaker and the emulsion was stirred with a Corning Stir\Hotplate at a setting of 5 corresponding to 225 rpm for 30 minutes. The median droplet size of the emulsions was measured before and after the treatment and the results appear in Table 1 below. As can be seen from the table, the emulsions without stabilizing agent increased significantly in droplet size after 30 minutes of stirring while those with stabilizing agents remained close to their initial droplet size. This was true for emulsions prepared by both the microfluidization and solvent displacement techniques. Stabilizing agents can effectively reduce coalescence of oil-in-oil emulsion lubricants.</p>

<p id="p-0164" num="0188">The EHL performance of microfluidized Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester emulsions in PAO, having a viscosity of 8 cSt at 100&#xb0; C., stabilized with PIBSA-PAM and Hitec 5777 was compared to that of an unstabilized emulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0189">Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester having a viscosity of 186 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. and density was 1.05 g/cc at room temperature. PAO, having a viscosity of 8 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. (PAO-8), was obtained from ExxonMobil Chemical Company. Its viscosity was 7.9 cSt at 100&#xb0; C. and density was 0.833 g/cc at 15.4&#xb0; C. A 0.5 wt % dispersion of Complex Ester in PAO-8 was prepared by weighing 2.0 g of Complex Ester and 398 g of PAO-8 into a 1000 ml glass beaker. A 3 inch magnetic stirbar was placed in the bottom of the beaker and the sample was mixed at a setting of 5 on a Corning Model PC/620 Stirrer/Hot Plate corresponding to 225 RPM as it was heated to 65&#xb0; C. and held at 65&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. The heat and stirring were then turned off and the sample was allowed to cool to room temperature. The median droplet size of the resulting emulsion was determined to be 54.1 microns in a Horiba LA910 Particle Size Analyzer. The sample was then passed through a lab scale model 110T microfluidizer four times at 12,000 psi. The median droplet size was reduced to 1.72 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0190">Two additional emulsions were prepared in a similar manner. A microfluidized emulsion of 0.5 wt % Complex Ester in PAO-8 was prepared containing 0.05 wt % of PIBSA-PAM, dispersant. The median droplet size of the emulsion following microfluidization was 0.80 microns. The other emulsion contained 0.2 g (0.05 wt %) Hitec 5777 in addition to 2.0 g Complex Ester in PAO-8 and the median droplet size of the emulsion following microfluidization was 1.8 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0191">The EHL film thickness of the emulsions was measured in a PCS Instruments EHL Ultra Thin Film Measurement System at 80&#xb0; C. and 20 Newtons of load. The measurement was made with a rotating glass disc and (driven) steel ball at speeds from 1.3 to 0.018 m/s and 0% slide/roll ratio. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The film thickness of the emulsion with 0.05 wt % PIBSA-PAM is much lower than that of the emulsion with no stabilizing agent and the emulsion stabilized with Hitec 5777. It is concluded that Hitec 5777 is a preferred stabilizing agent for emulsions of Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester because it does not itnterfere with EHL performance. Low nitrogen may be an important feature of effective stabilizing agents. Hitec 5777 contains 0.08 wt % nitrogen in comparison to 2 wt % in PIBSA-PAM.</p>

<heading id="h-0027" level="1">Synergistic Effect of Antiwear Additive on Stabilization of Esterex&#x2122; A51 Derived Complex Ester Emulsion with Hitec 5777</heading>
<p id="p-0168" num="0192">Three emulsions were prepared by the solvent displacement technique described in Example 5. One contained 0.5 wt % Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester in SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6. Another contained 0.5 wt % Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester and 0.05 wt % Hitec 5777 in SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6. The third contained 0.5 wt % Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex Ester, 0.05 wt % Hitec 5777 and 0.45 wt % Durad 90 in PAO-6. A preblend of Durad 90 and Esterex&#x2122; A51 derived Complex ester in diluent was used to prepare the third emulsion as described in Example 5. The droplet size and percent lamp transmittance was measured over time with a Horiba LA910 Particle Size Analyzer to determine the stability of the emulsions. The results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> reveal a rapid increase in droplet size and lamp transmittance for the emulsion without stabilizing additives. As droplets coalesce they tend to settle out of suspension due to the density difference between the polar and non-polar phase. The percent of transmitted light is a roughly linear measure of suspended phase concentration. Addition of Hitec 5777 to the second emulsion had a strong stabilizing effect. However, the small increase in droplet size resulted in settling loss of the emulsified phase over time as indicated by the strong increase light transmittance after 54 days. The emulsion containing Hitex 5777 in the SpectraSyn&#x2122; 6 and Durad 90 in the Complex Ester phase was by far the most stable. Droplet size and light transmittance remained nearly constant over the 54 day test period. It is concluded that there is a synegistic effect of the presence of Durad 90 antiwear agent in the Complex Ester phase on stabilization of these emulsions with Hitec 5777.</p>
