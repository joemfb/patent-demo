<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a bridgeless power factor correction (PFC) circuit for a critical continuous current mode and a controlling method thereof, which can be employed to solve the controlling problem of the critical CCM of the PFC circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the conventional boost PFC circuits, the loss of rectifying bridge becomes one of the main losses of the switching power supply. Since the requirements on the power supply efficiency are more and more critical, the bridgeless boost topology deriving from the conventional boost PFC circuit has gradually become the focus of the R&#x26;D. The bridgeless boost omits the rectifying bridge in the front stage of the boost PFC circuit; decreases the loss of a diode; and increases the efficiency. And the H-bridge circuit belongs to one kind of bridgeless boost topologies suitable for the medium power and large power applications (please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bridgeless circuit receives the input voltage Vin, generates the output voltage Vo, and includes diodes D<b>1</b>-D<b>4</b>, switches Q<b>1</b>-Q<b>2</b>, inductor L and an output capacitor C<sub>B</sub>. The bridgeless circuit can be used as a power factor correction (PFC) circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the applications for the medium and small power occasions, the conventional boost PFC topology as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is widely applied due to its simple configuration, better stability and smaller switch stress. Under the critical continuous current mode (or continuous conductive mode, CCM), the current of the inductor L is decreased to zero before the switch S<b>1</b> e.g. MOSFET is turned on. Since the current flowing through the rectifying diode (D<b>6</b>) is also zero, there is no reverse recovery loss of the rectifying diode, and the efficiency in this mode is high. The PFC circuit will adjust the amplitudes of the inductor current (the triangle waves in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to make the average current of the inductor (the average input current in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) be a sinusoidal wave.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the conventional boost PFC circuit and a method of sensing and measuring the voltage of the auxiliary winding N<sub>AUX </sub>of the boost inductor L is usually employed to judge the zero-crossing timing of the inductor current so as to realize the critical CCM controlling thereof. The polarity of the auxiliary winding is reversed to the polarity of the inductor. The voltage of the auxiliary winding is negative and is proportional to the amplitude of rectified AC voltage when the switch S<b>1</b> is turned on. The voltage of the auxiliary winding is positive and is proportional to a difference between the output voltage and the rectified AC voltage amplitude when S<b>1</b> is turned off. The output parasitic capacitance of S<b>1</b> is resonant with the boost inductor when the inductor current reaches zero. Then the voltage of the auxiliary winding decreases due to the resonance. A signal for turning on S<b>1</b> generates when the voltage of the auxiliary winding is lower than a threshold voltage (e.g. a voltage set up by the IC FAN7592) so as to realize the critical CCM controlling. This kind of method can be employed by many ICs, e.g., L6561, FAN7528, NCP1606, UCC38050 etc. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the PFC circuit receives an input voltage Vin, generates an output voltage Vo, and includes diodes D<b>1</b>-D<b>6</b>, resistors R<b>1</b>-R<b>6</b> and R<sub>ZCD</sub>, switch S<b>1</b>, IC FAN7529 (having terminals MOT, COMP, GND, CS, INV, ZCD and V<sub>CC</sub>), inductor L<b>1</b>, auxiliary winding N<sub>AUX </sub>and capacitors C<b>1</b>-C<b>2</b> and Co, wherein GND is the grounded terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>4</b>(<i>b</i>) are schematic circuit diagrams showing the operating status of the H-bridge circuit during the positive half-cycle and the negative half-cycle of the input voltage Vin respectively. The elements included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>4</b>(<i>b</i>) are the same as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. L, D<b>1</b>, D<b>4</b>, Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b> and C<sub>B </sub>form a boost circuit when the input voltage is in its positive half-cycle. The current flows through L, Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> and then returns when Q<b>1</b> turns on. While the current flows through L, D<b>1</b>, C<sub>B</sub>, and D<b>4</b> and then returns when Q<b>1</b> turns off. L, D<b>2</b>, Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>, D<b>3</b> and C<sub>B </sub>form another boost circuit when the input voltage is in its negative half-cycle. During the negative half-cycle, the current flows through L, Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> and then returns when Q<b>2</b> turns on, while the current flows through L, D<b>3</b>, C<sub>B </sub>and D<b>2</b> and then returns when Q<b>2</b> turns off. The currents flow through L, Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are in reverse directions when they are in the positive and the negative half-cycles. Due to that D<b>3</b> and D<b>4</b> clamp the AC power source Vin to the output capacitor C<sub>B </sub>of the boost circuit, the common mode noise, which is the same as the conventional boost PFC circuit, could be obtained. Since the current flows through only two semiconductor elements during a switch period, the conduction loss is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of an H-bridge circuit operating under the critical CCM via employing current transformers (CT). Except for a portion which is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it further includes an RS flip-flop, a comparator, an error amplifier (EA) and two CTs CT<b>1</b>-CT<b>2</b>. Since the H-bridge circuit has different current loops during the positive and negative half-cycles of the input voltage, the two CTs CT<b>1</b>-CT<b>2</b> must be used to sample the inductor current to turn on the switches when the inductor current is zero so as to realize the critical CCM controlling. The turn-off timing of the switches (Q<b>1</b> or Q<b>2</b>) is determined by the ramp signal and the output signal Vcomp of the error amplifier EA.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the waveforms of the controlling signals of the circuit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which includes the inductor current (signal), CT signal, the ramp signal, Q<b>1</b> driving (signal) and Q<b>2</b> driving (signal). Because the inductor current signal is sampled through the CT, its amplitude is varied according to the high/low of the input AC voltage and the light/heavy of the output load. The inductor current signal is easy to be interfered by the noise when the amplitude of inductor current is quite small such that the turn-on of the switch produces error implementation and the zero-current switching (ZCS) condition is lost. When the input voltage is quite high, the descending slope of the inductor current is smooth. And because the measuring threshold value is quite small, the switch is turned on before the inductor current decreases to zero, which will increase the turn-on loss.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Keeping the drawbacks of the prior arts in mind, and employing experiments and research full-heartily and persistently, the applicants finally conceived a bridgeless power factor correction circuit for a critical CCM and a controlling method thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for measuring an auxiliary winding of an inductor to realize the measurement of the zero-crossing of the inductor current so as to control the H-bridge circuit to work under the critical CCM. This controlling method does not require to measure the inductor current, could obtain the signal of the zero-crossing of the inductor current irrelevant to the AC input voltage and the output load, and causes the MOSFETs to be turned on accurately, the switching on loss to be decreased, no reverse recovery loss of the boost rectifying diode, and the higher efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a schematic circuit diagram of an H-bridge circuit employing an auxiliary winding to realize the critical CCM controlling according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention. A sensing circuit comprises the auxiliary winding L<b>1</b> of the inductor L reverse coupled with the inductor L, which generates a sensing voltage Vaux<b>1</b>. Since L<b>1</b> is reverse coupled with L, the voltage sensed by the auxiliary winding L<b>1</b>, Vaux<b>1</b>, has an opposite polarity with the voltage of the inductor L, V<sub>L</sub>. A signal processing circuit comprises resistors R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b> and R<b>3</b>, diodes D<b>5</b> and D<b>6</b>, switches Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b>. And the signal processing circuit receives the sensing voltage and generating an inductor current measuring signal so as to control the switch Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. In the positive half-cycle of the input voltage Vin, Q<b>3</b> is on, which allows the terminal B of the auxiliary winding L<b>1</b> being grounded via R<b>2</b> and Q<b>3</b>. In the negative half-cycle of the input voltage, Q<b>4</b> is on, which allows the terminal A of the auxiliary winding L<b>1</b> being grounded via R<b>1</b> and Q<b>4</b>. The measuring signal V<sub>ZCD </sub>is sent into a control circuit e.g. an IC (e.g., any of the ZCD terminals of L6561, FAN7528, NCP1606, UCC38050 etc, which is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or the set terminal of the RS flip-flop shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to make the switches Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> turn on under the zero current condition.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is the waveforms of the circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, i<sub>L </sub>is the current on the inductor L; V<sub>GS </sub>is the gate driving signal of the switches Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>; V<sub>AUX1 </sub>is the voltage of the auxiliary winding L<b>1</b>; V<sub>ZCD </sub>is a zero-crossing measuring signal of the inductor current; and V<sub>DS </sub>is the voltage between the drain and the source of the MOSFET Q<b>1</b>.</p>

The analyses of the stages of the circuit when the input voltage is in the negative half-cycle are the similar to those of the stages of the circuit when the input voltage is in the positive half-cycle. And during the positive half-cycle, Q<b>3</b> is constantly on.</p>

Two MOSFETs Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are turned on simultaneously, thus the current flows through L, Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. During this stage, the inductor current is linearly increased from 0. The voltage on the inductor L is Vin, the sensed voltage Vaux<b>1</b> of the auxiliary winding L<b>1</b> is &#x2212;nVin (n is the turns ratio of the auxiliary winding L<b>1</b> and the inductor L). Since Vaux<b>1</b> is a negative voltage, the parasitic diode of Q<b>4</b>, R<b>2</b> and R<b>1</b> form a loop via Q<b>3</b>; diodes D<b>5</b> and D<b>6</b> are turned off since Vaux<b>2</b>=0, and since V<sub>ZCD </sub>connects GND only through R<b>3</b>, thus V<sub>ZCD</sub>=0.

And the corresponding waveforms are shown in the t<b>2</b>-t<b>3</b> stage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The rectifying diodes D<b>1</b> and D<b>4</b> are turned off naturally after the current of the inductor L decreases to zero, and there is no generation of the reverse recovery current. The parasitic capacitor C<sub>OSS1 </sub>of Q<b>1</b> discharges and is resonant with the inductor L through Vin (the parasitic capacitor of Q<b>2</b> is C<sub>OSS2</sub>). The sensed voltage Vaux<b>1</b> is resonantly decreased at that stage, and Vaux<b>1</b> reaches a predetermined value at the end of that stage&#x2014;the timing t<b>3</b>. Since Vaux<b>1</b> is a positive voltage, Q<b>3</b>, R<b>2</b>, L<b>1</b>, R<b>1</b>, D<b>5</b> and R<b>3</b> form a loop, and Q<b>4</b> and D<b>6</b> are turned off. Due to the existing of the measuring terminal capacitor (the capacitor connected between V<sub>ZCD </sub>and ground which is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>c</i>) and the capacitor may be a parasitic capacitor), the voltage value of the measuring signal V<sub>ZCD </sub>is still larger than the threshold Vth required by conducting the MOSFETs Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>d</i>) shows the fourth stage of the circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>; the corresponding waveforms are shown in the t<b>3</b>-t<b>4</b> stage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The parasitic capacitor C<sub>OSS1 </sub>of Q<b>1</b> is resonant with the inductor L through Vin continuously. The current path is the same as the previous stage. The sensed voltage Vaux<b>1</b> of the auxiliary winding L<b>1</b> becomes a negative value, the voltage value is lower than the measuring threshold value required by turning-on the MOSFETs Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. After a delay time of RC/2 (wherein R is the resistance value of the resistors R<b>3</b>, and C is the capacitance value of the portion of V<sub>ZCD</sub>), the MOSFETs Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are turned on, and the four stages of the positive half-cycle are ended.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sensed signal obtained via the voltages on the auxiliary winding of the inductor has a higher noise margin such that the MOSFET implementations are accurate and the turn-on losses are decreased. Besides, comparing with the signal obtained by using the two CTs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the signal obtained by the circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> has a stable amplitude value, and is irrelevant to the load. However, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the gate driving signals of Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> are derived from the measurements of the phase of the input voltage so that the complexity of the circuit is thus increased.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a schematic circuit diagram of an H-bridge circuit employing two auxiliary windings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> of the inductor L to realize the critical CCM control according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the sensing circuit comprises two auxiliary windings L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> reverse coupled with the inductor L which generates two sensing voltages&#x2014;Vaux<b>1</b> sensed by the auxiliary winding L<b>1</b> and Vaux<b>2</b> sensed by the auxiliary winding L<b>2</b>. The signal processing circuit comprises two identical networks formed by resistors R<b>1</b>, capacitor C<b>1</b> and resistor R<b>2</b>, capacitor C<b>2</b>, and two diodes D<b>5</b> and D<b>6</b>. Vaux<b>1</b> and Vaux<b>2</b> are respectively filtered by the two networks, and then are combined or summed up through the two diodes D<b>5</b> and D<b>6</b> to generate the measuring signal V<sub>ZCD </sub>on R<b>3</b> and Q<b>3</b>. And a delaying circuit comprising D<b>7</b>, C<b>3</b> and R<b>4</b> receives a driving signal of Q<b>1</b>, V<sub>Q1</sub>, and generates a delayed control signal V<sub>Q1-1 </sub>to control Q<b>3</b>. The delayed signal has almost the same rising edge with the driving signal of Q<b>1</b> while its falling edge falls behind that of the driving signal of Q<b>2</b>. Comparing with the aforementioned first preferred embodiment, the second preferred embodiment does not require measuring the phase of the input voltage. Thus the electronic circuit is simpler.</p>
