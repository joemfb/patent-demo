<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention is related to computer-readable memory, and in particular, but not exclusively, to an apparatus, method, and manufacture for a staggered start of flash memories in a memory module.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various types of electronic memory have been developed in recent years. Some exemplary memory types are electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) and electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM). EEPROM is easily erasable but lacks density in storage capacity, where as EPROM is inexpensive and denser but is not easily erased. &#x201c;Flash&#x201d; EEPROM, or Flash memory, combines the advantages of these two memory types. This type of memory is used in many electronic products, from large electronics like cars, industrial control systems, and etc. to small portable electronics such as laptop computers, portable music players, cell phones, and etc.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Flash memory is generally constructed of many memory cells where a single bit is held within each memory cell. Yet a more recent technology known as MirrorBit&#x2122; Flash memory doubles the density of conventional Flash memory by storing two physically distinct bits on opposite sides of a memory cell. The reading or writing of a bit occurs independently of the bit on the opposite side of the cell. A memory cell is constructed of bit lines formed in a semiconductor substrate. An oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) dielectric layer is formed over the top of the substrate and bit lines. The nitride serves as the charge storage layer between two insulating layers. Word lines are then formed over the top of the ONO layer perpendicular to the bit lines. Applying a voltage to the word line, acting as a control gate, along with an applied voltage to the bit line allows for the reading or writing of data from or to that location in the memory cell array. MirrorBit&#x2122; Flash memory may be applied to different architectures of flash memory, including NOR flash and NAND flash.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Briefly stated, a method, apparatus, and manufacture for memory device startup is provided. Flash memory devices are configured such that, upon the power supply voltage reaching a pre-determined level, each flash memory is arranged to load the random access memory with instructions for the flash memory, and then execute a first portion of the instructions for the flash memory. After executing the first portion of the instructions for the flash memory, each separate subset of the flash memories waits for a separate, distinct delay period. For each flash memory, after the delay period expires for that flash memory, the flash memory executes a second portion of the instructions for the flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of system <b>190</b> with K*N instances of electronic device <b>100</b>. System <b>190</b> includes processing element <b>112</b>, system bus <b>122</b>, power supply <b>139</b>, and devices <b>100</b>. Processing element <b>112</b> is in communication with each of the devices <b>100</b> via system bus <b>122</b>. Power supply <b>139</b> is arranged to provide supply voltage VCC, which may be provided to processing element <b>112</b> and to each of the devices <b>100</b> via system bus <b>122</b>. Processing element <b>112</b> may include one or more processing elements. In some embodiments, processing element <b>112</b> may be a microcontroller or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">K*N devices <b>100</b> comprise memory devices, such as flash memory devices. The flash memory devices may be organized into one or more memory modules. In some embodiments, each memory module is a dual inline memory module (DIMM), or the like. In the case of flash memory devices, the amount of power used by the K*N devices <b>100</b> during start-up may cause the VCC supply voltage for one or more portions of K*N devices <b>100</b> to drop. As a result, because the VCC voltage is below the nominal operating VCC voltage for K*N devices <b>100</b>, one or more errors in reading or writing data can occur during the start up process. In order to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of such errors, some embodiments of system <b>190</b> provide for a staggered start-up that occurs in stages. That is, rather than starting up K*N devices <b>100</b> simultaneously, system <b>190</b> can manage the start-up process so that only N of K*N devices are started up at one time. The number of devices (N) being started up simultaneously can be pre-defined, random, or determined dynamically based on the number and types of devices to be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although in general system <b>190</b> was illustrated and discussed above as having K sub-sets, where each sub-sets have an equal number of elements N, the number of elements in each sub-set are not equal in all embodiments. For example, some sub-sets of devices <b>100</b> may have more devices <b>100</b> or less devices <b>100</b> than other sub-sets of devices <b>100</b>. Each of the devices <b>100</b> is arranged to be powered by a power supply voltage VCC.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, each device <b>100</b> is a flash memory device that includes a random access memory (RAM) (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In some embodiments, each device <b>100</b> is a flash memory device where all of the flash memory devices <b>100</b> are powered by a single VCC power supply <b>139</b>. In some embodiments, devices <b>100</b> includes K sub-sets, which are each configured such that upon the power supply voltage VCC reaching a pre-determined level, each device <b>100</b> is arranged load the RAM with instructions for the device <b>100</b>, execute a first portion of the instructions for the device <b>100</b>, and after executing the first portion of the instructions for the device <b>100</b>, employing a countdown timer to wait for a particular delay period after executing the first portion of the instructions for the flash memory. Each of the K sub-sets has a different delay period. For example, a first sub-set of devices <b>100</b> may wait for a first delay period after executing the first portion of the instructions, and a second subset of devices <b>100</b> may wait for a second delay period after executing the first portion of the instructions, where the second delay period is different from the first delay period. In some embodiments, other subsets of devices <b>100</b>, if there are other subsets, may each have still different delay periods. Each device <b>100</b>, after waiting for the delay period for that subset, executes a second portion of the instructions for the device <b>100</b>. In this way, the start-up of subsets of devices <b>100</b> are staggered relative to other subsets of devices <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a memory environment in which embodiments of the invention may be employed. Not all the components illustrated in the figures may be required to practice the invention, and variations in the arrangement and type of the components may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. For example, although some embodiments of the invention described in the context of a MirrorBit&#x2122; NOR flash memory, the fabrication described herein may be employed in manufacturing other types of microelectronic memories or devices such as other various types of flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown, memory <b>200</b> includes arrayed memory <b>210</b> and memory controller <b>230</b>. Memory controller <b>230</b> is arranged to communicate addressing data and program data over signal path <b>206</b>. For example, signal path <b>206</b> can provide 8, 16, or more I/O lines of data. Signal path <b>206</b> may be an embodiment of a portion of system bus <b>122</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in some embodiments. Memory controller <b>230</b> is also configured to access arrayed memory <b>210</b> over signal path <b>203</b>.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Controller component <b>236</b> is arranged to coordinate memory accesses such as reading, writing, and erasing; and other operations of memory <b>200</b>.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, memory <b>200</b> is a flash-based memory including flash-based memory cells, such as flash-based NOR cells, NAND cells, or hybrids of the two. In some embodiments, memory <b>200</b> is a MirrorBit&#x2122; flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of memory device <b>300</b>, which may be employed as an embodiment of memory device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Memory device <b>300</b> includes memory array <b>302</b> and individual memory cells <b>303</b> located within memory array <b>302</b>. Memory cells <b>303</b> are arranged in N+1 rows and M+1 columns in memory array <b>302</b>. In one embodiment, each row of memory array <b>302</b> is accessed by two of the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BLN. Each column of memory array <b>302</b> is accessed by one of word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLM. Accordingly, each of memory cells <b>303</b> can be accessed by activating the corresponding bit lines and a corresponding word line of the cell. In one embodiment, each column of memory array <b>302</b> defines a data word. If N+1 has a value of 8, for example, the cells in each column of memory array <b>302</b> define a byte of data.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Memory cells <b>303</b> may be flash memory cells which store bits in different ways in different embodiments. In various embodiments, a single cell may store one or more bits. For example, some memory cells are single cell devices, some memory cells are dual cells devices, and in some embodiments, more than one distinct level of threshold voltage may be used to represent more than one bit per cells, as discussed in greater detail below. In some embodiments, flash memory stores information in an array of memory cells made from floating-gate transistors. In, for example, a NOR gate flash, the transistors resemble a standard metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (&#x201c;MOSFET&#x201d;) except that the transistor has two gates, a floating gate and a control gate, instead of one. On top is the control gate (&#x201c;CG&#x201d;), as in other metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors, but below this there is a floating gate (&#x201c;FG&#x201d;) insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel. Because the FG is electrically isolated by an insulating layer, any electrons placed on it are trapped there and, under normal conditions, will not discharge for many years. When the FG holds a charge, it screens (partially cancels) the electric field from the CG, which modifies the threshold voltage (&#x201c;V<sub>T</sub>&#x201d;) of the cell. The threshold voltage of a MOSFET is usually defined as the gate voltage where an inversion layer forms at the interface between the insulating layer (oxide) and the substrate (body) of the transistor. During read-out, a voltage is applied to the CG, and the MOSFET channel will become conducting or remain insulating, depending on the V<sub>T </sub>of the cell, which is in turn controlled by the charge on the FG. The current flow through the MOSFET channel is sensed which permits a determination of the voltage threshold for the device, which in turn provides information about the binary data stored within the device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a single cell device, each control gate of a transistor stores a single charge amount that represents the stored information. In its default or &#x201c;un-programmed&#x201d; state, it is logically equivalent to a binary &#x201c;1&#x201d; value, because current will flow through the channel under application of an appropriate voltage to the control gate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a dual cell device, each control gate stores two charge amounts that represent the stored information. That is, two physically distinct quantities of charge are stored on opposite sides of the floating gate. Reading or writing data on one side of the floating gate occurs independently of the data that is stored on the opposite side of the floating gate. In this technology, the FG is split into two mirrored or complementary parts, each of which is formulated for storing independent information. Each dual cell, like a traditional cell, has a gate with a source and a drain. However, in the dual cell the connections to the source and drain may be reversed in operation to permit the storage of the two bits. Each of the memory cells is comprised of multi-layers. A charge-trapping dielectric layer is formed over a semiconductor substrate. The charge-trapping dielectric layer can generally be composed of three separate layers: a first insulating layer, a charge-trapping layer, and a second insulating layer. Word-lines are formed over the charge-trapping dielectric layer substantially perpendicular to the bit lines. Programming circuitry controls two bits per cell by applying a signal to the word-line which acts as a control gate, and changing bit line connections such that one bit is stored by the source and drain being connected in one arrangement and the complementary bit is stored by the source and drain being connected in another arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a single-level cell (&#x201c;SLC&#x201d;) device, each cell stores only one bit of information, either the cell is &#x201c;un-programmed&#x201d; (has a &#x201c;1&#x201d; value) or &#x201c;programmed&#x201d; (has a &#x201c;0&#x201d; value). There also exist multi-level cell (&#x201c;MLC&#x201d;) devices that can store more than one bit per cell by choosing between multiple levels of electrical charge to apply to the floating gates of its cells. In these devices, the amount of current flow is sensed (rather than simply its presence or absence), to determine more precisely the level of charge on the FG.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As one example, a dual cell device may also be a MLC device that stores four-bits-per-cell so that one transistor equates to 16 different states. This enables greater capacity, smaller die sizes and lower costs for the flash devices.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Memory device <b>300</b> further includes controller <b>336</b>, decoder <b>381</b>, and decoder <b>382</b>. Decoder <b>381</b> and decoder <b>382</b> can each receive address bus information from controller <b>336</b> and can utilize such information to facilitate accessing or selecting the desired memory cell(s) (e.g., memory location(s)) associated with the command, and to provide the needed voltages to the bit lines (decoder <b>381</b>) and the word lines (decoder <b>382</b>) according to timing that is controlled by controller <b>336</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Decoder <b>381</b> may also include a sector decoder in some embodiments. As such, decoder <b>309</b> may be arranged to facilitate accessing or selection particular column or grouping of columns within memory device <b>300</b>. For example, a grouping of columns may define a sector, and another grouping of columns may define another sector. In another embodiment, portion <b>301</b> may include an array decoder for to a particular memory array <b>304</b>. In addition, embodiments of array decoders can be configured to work separately or in conjunction with a sector decoder.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Memory controller <b>336</b> is also configured to control the activation and de-activation of individual word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLM for reading, writing, and/or erasing to memory array <b>302</b>. For example, memory controller <b>310</b> can provide a select signal to decoder <b>382</b> to select one of the columns WL<b>1</b> to WLM to activate that column. Further, memory controller <b>336</b> can provide a select signal to decoder <b>381</b> for selecting particular rows BL<b>0</b> to BLN (or sector) to be written to or read from.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In operation, core polysilicon line <b>441</b> and source/drain regions <b>442</b><i>a </i>and <b>442</b><i>b </i>are configured to provide electrical potential(s) to memory cell <b>440</b> for trapping charge at charge trapping component <b>446</b>. A bit is &#x201c;programmed&#x201d; when it is trapping a charge and &#x201c;unprogrammed&#x201d; when it is not trapping charge. To trap charge, charge trapping component <b>446</b> employs tunneling layer <b>447</b>, charge trapping layer <b>448</b>, and dielectric layer <b>449</b>. In general, tunneling layer <b>447</b> provides a tunneling barrier, charge trapping layer <b>448</b> is a layer that is configured to store charge, and dielectric layer <b>449</b> electrically isolates charge trapping layer <b>448</b> from core polysilicon line <b>441</b>.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Modern semiconductor devices are typically created as integrated circuits manufactured on the surface of a substrate of semiconductor material, which is typically a wafer formed by slicing a single crystal ingot growth by a Czochralski process. Various devices are formed on the wafer using a series of steps that include deposition, removal processes (such as etching), patterning, and doping. Few steps or many hundreds of such steps may be used in various designs. The patterning steps may be performed by photolithography or other lithographic methods. For example, the wafer may be coated with a photoresist, which is exposed with a device that transmits light through a photomask, exposing portions of the wafer not blocked by the photomask to light. The exposed regions are removed so that the photoresist remains only in areas that were not exposed to light. This allows a layer to be etched according to the pattern on the photomask. After the devices have been formed on the wafer, various back-end processing and packaging is performed, including properly interconnecting the devices and bringing metal lines to the chip edge for attachment to wires.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A designer creates the device design in accordance with a set of design rules provided by the fabricator, and creates a series of design files based on the design, which may be stored in a machine-readable medium. Various design tools may be used by the designer in creating the design, simulating the design, and checking the design for layout rules violations. When completed, the design files are provided to the fabricator, which are used to generate photomasks for use in the fabricating the device. The design files may be communicated in different ways, including over a network.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a flow chart of an embodiment of a process (<b>580</b>). Process <b>500</b> happens to each flash memory device in a group of flash memory devices when VCC reaches a pre-determined value, at which point the process begins at a start block.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The process then moves to block <b>582</b>, wherein in each flash memory (e.g. <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), a RAM (e.g., RAM <b>237</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the flash memory is loaded with instructions. The process then advances to block <b>584</b>, where each flash memory executes a first portion of instructions. The process then proceeds to block <b>586</b>, where each subset of flash memory devices waits for a particular delay, where the delay of each subset is distinct from the delay of each other subset of flash memory devices. Waiting for the delay is accomplished by employing a countdown timer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The process then moves to block <b>588</b>, where each flash memory, upon completion of waiting the delay, executes a second portion of the instructions. Because each subset has a different delay, the start-ups of the various subsets of flash memories are staggered relative to each other. The process then advances to a start block, where other processing is resumed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one particular, specific embodiment, the staggered start is accomplished as follows. The following embodiment in no way limits the invention; rather, the purpose is to describe a particular embodiment in detail without in any way limiting the invention to the details of the particular embodiments described.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, a server device, which may be an embodiment of system <b>190</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, includes a controller chip (which may be an embodiment of processing element <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and 16 DIMMs all powering off of the same motherboard. Each DIMM includes <b>144</b> flash memory devices (which may be embodiments of devices <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and/or memory device <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The controller chip and each of flash memory devices receive VCC from the motherboard. When the server device is powered on, power supply voltage VCC ramps upward. When VCC reaches the power on reset (POR) trip point, roughly 1.55 Volts in some embodiments, each of the flash memory devices receives a jump start command, causing it to load instructions from its ROM (e.g., <b>238</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) onto the SRAM (e.g., <b>237</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the flash memory device and begins executing the instructions loaded from ROM. As these instructions are executed by each device, the instructions cause the device to enter into a test mode in which data is read from the trim sector of the flash memory and written directly to SRAM. The trim sector is a portion of the arrayed memory (e.g., <b>210</b>) that is not accessible by normal addressing, and is used for operation of the flash memory, which includes the initial conditions that the flash memory was tested under, including the erase verify point and the program verify point. It may also include redundancy data, such as a map of which sectors are good and which sectors are bad</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">While in test mode, each flash memory executes code loaded from the trim sector. The code instructs the flash memory to look up a value which represents a number of wait states for the flash memory to wait before resuming execution. In some embodiments, each DIMM has nine columns, 0 through 8, and the value is the column number of the flash memory looking up the value, from 0 to 8. Each wait state may be a certain interval of time, such as 128 microseconds. Accordingly, for example, the flash memories in the first column, column <b>0</b>, have no delay, the flash memories on column <b>1</b> have 128 microseconds of delay, the flash memories column <b>2</b> have 256 microseconds of delay, and so forth. Each flash memory employs a countdown counter for the delay in which the flash memory delays for the appropriate number of clock cycles. When the countdown timer expires, execution of the code in the SRAM resumes. The flash memory does not fully come up until the execution of the code that occurs until the SRAM resumes, after the delay. After the delay, the flash memory executes all the way up and is powered cleanly.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, staggering the start of the flash memory devices in this manner (where all of the flash memory devices are powered from a single power supply voltage) may reduce overall noise levels and keep peak current demand down during power-up conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although a particular embodiment is discussed above, many variations are within the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, in some embodiments, rather than having a fixed delay based on column number, each subset of flash memory devices may use a random delay.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Embodiments of the memory device can be incorporated into any of a variety of components and/or systems, including for example, a processor and other components or systems of such components. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows one embodiment of system <b>690</b>, which may incorporate memory <b>620</b>, which is an embodiment of memory device <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In some embodiments, processor <b>692</b> is an embodiment of processing element <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

In another embodiment, memory <b>620</b> may be permanently connected to the components or a portion of the components of system <b>690</b>.</p>
