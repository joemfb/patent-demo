<heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes have been shown to play a causal role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, which currently account for a considerable proportion of morbidity in Western society. Further, one human disease, termed &#x201c;Syndrome X&#x201d; or &#x201c;Metabolic Syndrome&#x201d;, is manifested by defective glucose metabolism (insulin resistance), elevated blood pressure (hypertension), and a blood lipid imbalance (dyslipidemia). See e.g. Reaven, 1993<i>, Annu. Rev. Med. </i>44:121-131.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The evidence linking elevated serum cholesterol to coronary heart disease is overwhelming. Circulating cholesterol is carried by plasma lipoproteins, which are particles of complex lipid and protein composition that transport lipids in the blood. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) are the major cholesterol-carrier proteins. LDL is believed to be responsible for the delivery of cholesterol from the liver, where it is synthesized or obtained from dietary sources, to extrahepatic tissues in the body. The term &#x201c;reverse cholesterol transport&#x201d; describes the transport of cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to the liver, where it is catabolized and eliminated. It is believed that plasma HDL particles play a major role in the reverse transport process, acting as scavengers of tissue cholesterol. HDL is also responsible for the removal of non-cholesterol lipid, oxidized cholesterol and other oxidized products from the bloodstream.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Atherosclerosis, for example, is a slowly progressive disease characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol within the arterial wall. Compelling evidence supports the belief that lipids deposited in atherosclerotic lesions are derived primarily from plasma apolipoprotein B (apo B)-containing lipoproteins, which include chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and LDL. The apo B-containing lipoprotein, and in particular LDL, has popularly become known as the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; cholesterol. In contrast, HDL serum levels correlate inversely with coronary heart disease. Indeed, high serum levels of HDL are regarded as a negative risk factor. It is hypothesized that high levels of plasma HDL are not only protective against coronary artery disease, but may actually induce regression of atherosclerotic plaque (e.g., see Badimon et al., 1992, <i>Circulation </i>86:(Suppl. III)86-94; Dansky and Fisher, 1999<i>, Circulation </i>100:1762 3.). Thus, HDL has popularly become known as the &#x201c;good&#x201d; cholesterol.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">2.1 Cholesterol Transport</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The fat-transport system can be divided into two pathways: an exogenous one for cholesterol and triglycerides absorbed from the intestine and an endogenous one for cholesterol and triglycerides entering the bloodstream from the liver and other non-hepatic tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the exogenous pathway, dietary fats are packaged into lipoprotein particles called chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream and deliver their triglycerides to adipose tissue for storage and to muscle for oxidation to supply energy. The remnant of the chylomicron, which contains cholesteryl esters, is removed from the circulation by a specific receptor found only on liver cells. This cholesterol then becomes available again for cellular metabolism or for recycling to extrahepatic tissues as plasma lipoproteins.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the endogenous pathway, the liver secretes a large, very-low-density lipoprotein particle (VLDL) into the bloodstream. The core of VLDL consists mostly of triglycerides synthesized in the liver, with a smaller amount of cholesteryl esters either synthesized in the liver or recycled from chylomicrons. Two predominant proteins are displayed on the surface of VLDL, apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100) and apolipoprotein E (apo E), although other apolipoproteins are present, such as apolipoprotein CIII (apo CIII) and apolipoprotein CII (apo CII). When VLDL reaches the capillaries of adipose tissue or of muscle, its triglyceride is extracted. This results in the formation of a new kind of particle called intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) or VLDL remnant, decreased in size and enriched in cholesteryl esters relative to a VLDL, but retaining its two apoproteins.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In human beings, about half of the IDL particles are removed from the circulation quickly, generally within two to six hours of their formation. This is because IDL particles bind tightly to liver cells, which extract IDL cholesterol to make new VLDL and bile acids. The IDL not taken up by the liver is catabolized by the hepatic lipase, an enzyme bound to the proteoglycan on liver cells. Apo E dissociates from IDL as it is transformed to LDL. Apo B-100 is the sole protein of LDL.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Primarily, the liver takes up and degrades circulating cholesterol to bile acids, which are the end products of cholesterol metabolism. The uptake of cholesterol-containing particles is mediated by LDL receptors, which are present in high concentrations on hepatocytes. The LDL receptor binds both apo E and apo B-100 and is responsible for binding and removing both IDL and LDL from the circulation. In addition, remnant receptors are responsible for clearing chylomicrons and VLDL remnants (i.e., IDL). However, the affinity of apo E for the LDL receptor is greater than that of apo B-100. As a result, the LDL particles have a much longer circulating life span than IDL particles; LDL circulates for an average of two and a half days before binding to the LDL receptors in the liver and other tissues. High serum levels of LDL, the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; cholesterol, are positively associated with coronary heart disease. For example, in atherosclerosis, cholesterol derived from circulating LDL accumulates in the walls of arteries. This accumulation forms bulky plaques that inhibit the flow of blood until a clot eventually forms, obstructing an artery and causing a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Ultimately, the amount of intracellular cholesterol liberated from the LDL controls cellular cholesterol metabolism. The accumulation of cellular cholesterol derived from VLDL and LDL controls three processes. First, it reduces the ability of the cell to make its own cholesterol by turning off the synthesis of HMGCoA reductase, a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Second, the incoming LDL-derived cholesterol promotes storage of cholesterol by the action of cholesterol acyltransferase (&#x201c;ACAT&#x201d;), the cellular enzyme that converts cholesterol into cholesteryl esters that are deposited in storage droplets. Third, the accumulation of cholesterol within the cell drives a feedback mechanism that inhibits cellular synthesis of new LDL receptors. Cells, therefore, adjust their complement of LDL receptors so that enough cholesterol is brought in to meet their metabolic needs, without overloading (for a review, see Brown &#x26; Goldstein, in <i>The Pharmacological Basis Of Therapeutics, </i>8th Ed., Goodman &#x26; Gilman, Pergamon Press, New York, 1990, Ch. 36, pp. 874-896).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">High levels of apo B-containing lipoproteins can be trapped in the subendothelial space of an artery and undergo oxidation. The oxidized lipoprotein is recognized by scavenger receptors on macrophages. Binding of oxidized lipoprotein to the scavenger receptors can enrich the macrophages with cholesterol and cholesteryl esters independently of the LDL receptor. Macrophages can also produce cholesteryl esters by the action of ACAT. LDL can also be complexed to a high molecular weight glycoprotein called apolipoprotein(a), also known as apo(a), through a disulfide bridge. The LDL-apo(a) complex is known as Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a). Elevated levels of Lp(a) are detrimental, having been associated with atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, cerebral infarction, and restenosis following angioplasty.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">2.2 Reverse Cholesterol Transport</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Peripheral (non-hepatic) cells predominantly obtain their cholesterol from a combination of local synthesis and uptake of preformed sterol from VLDL and LDL. Cells expressing scavenger receptors, such as macrophages and smooth muscle cells, can also obtain cholesterol from oxidized apo B-containing lipoproteins. In contrast, reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the pathway by which peripheral cell cholesterol can be returned to the liver for recycling to extrahepatic tissues, hepatic storage, or excretion into the intestine in bile. The RCT pathway represents the only means of eliminating cholesterol from most extrahepatic tissues and is crucial to the maintenance of the structure and function of most cells in the body.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The enzyme in blood involved in the RCT pathway, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), converts cell-derived cholesterol to cholesteryl esters, which are sequestered in HDL destined for removal. LCAT is produced mainly in the liver and circulates in plasma associated with the HDL fraction. Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and another lipid transfer protein, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), contribute to further remodeling the circulating HDL population (see for example Bruce et al., 1998, <i>Annu. Rev. Nutr. </i>18:297 330). PLTP supplies lecithin to HDL, and CETP can move cholesteryl esters made by LCAT to other lipoproteins, particularly apoB-containing lipoproteins, such as VLDL. HDL triglycerides can be catabolized by the extracellular hepatic triglyceride lipase, and lipoprotein cholesterol is removed by the liver via several mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each HDL particle contains at least one molecule, and usually two to four molecules, of apolipoprotein A I (apo A I). Apo A I is synthesized by the liver and small intestine as preproapolipoprotein, which is secreted as a proprotein that is rapidly cleaved to generate a mature polypeptide having 243 amino acid residues. Apo A I consists mainly of a 22 amino acid repeating segment, spaced with helix-breaking proline residues. Apo A I forms three types of stable structures with lipids: small, lipid-poor complexes referred to as pre-beta-1 HDL; flattened discoidal particles, referred to as pre-beta-2 HDL, which contain only polar lipids (e.g., phospholipid and cholesterol); and spherical particles containing both polar and nonpolar lipids, referred to as spherical or mature HDL (HDL3 and HDL2). Most HDL in the circulating population contains both apo A I and apo A II, a second major HDL protein. This apo A I- and apo A II-containing fraction is referred to herein as the AI/AII-HDL fraction of HDL. But the fraction of HDL containing only apo A I, referred to herein as the AI HDL fraction, appears to be more effective in RCT. Certain epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that the AI-HDL fraction is antiartherogenic (Parra et al., 1992<i>, Arterioscler. Thromb. </i>12:701-707; Decossin et al., 1997, <i>Eur. J. Clin. Invest. </i>27:299-307).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Although the mechanism for cholesterol transfer from the cell surface is unknown, it is believed that the lipid-poor complex, pre-beta-1 HDL, is the preferred acceptor for cholesterol transferred from peripheral tissue involved in RCT. Cholesterol newly transferred to pre-beta-1 HDL from the cell surface rapidly appears in the discoidal pre-beta-2 HDL. PLTP may increase the rate of disc formation (Lagrost et al., 1996, <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>271:19058-19065), but data indicating a role for PLTP in RCT is lacking. LCAT reacts preferentially with discoidal and spherical HDL, transferring the 2-acyl group of lecithin or phosphatidylethanolamine to the free hydroxyl residue of fatty alcohols, particularly cholesterol, to generate cholesteryl esters (retained in the HDL) and lysolecithin. The LCAT reaction requires an apolipoprotein such as apo A I or apo A-N as an activator. ApoA-I is one of the natural cofactors for LCAT. The conversion of cholesterol to its HDL-sequestered ester prevents re-entry of cholesterol into the cell, resulting in the ultimate removal of cellular cholesterol. Cholesteryl esters in the mature HDL particles of the AI-HDL fraction are removed by the liver and processed into bile more effectively than those derived from the AI/AII-HDL fraction. This may be due, in part, to the more effective binding of AI-HDL to the hepatocyte membrane. Several HDL receptors have been identified, the most well characterized of which is the scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR BI) (Acton et al., 1996, <i>Science </i>271:518-520). The SR-BI is expressed most abundantly in steroidogenic tissues (e.g., the adrenals), and in the liver (Landshulz et al., 1996, <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>98:984-995; Rigotti et al., 1996, <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>271:33545-33549). Other proposed HDL receptors include HB1 and HB2 (Hidaka and Fidge, 1992, <i>Biochem J. </i>15:161 7; Kurata et al., 1998, <i>J. Atherosclerosis and Thrombosis </i>4:112 7).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">While there is a consensus that CETP is involved in the metabolism of VLDL- and LDL-derived lipids, its role in RCT remains controversial. However, changes in CETP activity or its acceptors, VLDL and LDL, play a role in &#x201c;remodeling&#x201d; the HDL population. For example, in the absence of CETP, the HDL becomes enlarged particles that are poorly removed from the circulation (for reviews on RCT and HDL, See Fielding &#x26; Fielding, 1995, <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>36:211-228; Barrans et al., 1996, <i>Biochem. Biophys. Acta. </i>1300:73-85; Hirano et al., 1997, <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. </i>17:1053-1059).</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">2.3 Reverse Transport of Other Lipids</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">HDL is not only involved in the reverse transport of cholesterol, but also plays a role in the reverse transport of other lipids, i.e., the transport of lipids from cells, organs, and tissues to the liver for catabolism and excretion. Such lipids include sphingomyelin, oxidized lipids, and lysophophatidylcholine. For example, Robins and Fasulo (1997, <i>J. Clin. Invest. </i>99:380 384) have shown that HDL stimulates the transport of plant sterol by the liver into bile secretions.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">2.4 Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Pathway</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Peroxisome proliferators are a structurally diverse group of compounds that, when administered to rodents, elicit dramatic increases in the size and number of hepatic and renal peroxisomes, as well as concomitant increases in the capacity of peroxisomes to metabolize fatty acids via increased expression of the enzymes required for the &#x3b2;-oxidation cycle (Lazarow and Fujiki, 1985, <i>Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. </i>1:489 530; Vamecq and Draye, 1989<i>, Essays Biochem. </i>24:1115 225; and Nelali et al., 1988, <i>Cancer Res. </i>48:5316 5324). Chemicals included in this group are the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs, herbicides, and phthalate plasticizers (Reddy and Lalwani, 1983, <i>Crit. Rev. Toxicol. </i>12:1 58). Peroxisome proliferation can also be elicited by dietary or physiological factors, such as a high fat diet and cold acclimatization.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Insight into the mechanism whereby peroxisome proliferators exert their pleiotropic effects was provided by the identification of a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily activated by these chemicals (Isseman and Green, 1990, <i>Nature </i>347:645 650). This receptor, termed peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#x3b1; (PPAR&#x3b1;), was subsequently shown to be activated by a variety of medium and long chain fatty acids. PPAR&#x3b1; activates transcription by binding to DNA sequence elements, termed peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPRE), in the form of a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). RXR is activated by 9-cis retinoic acid (see Kliewer et al., 1992, <i>Nature </i>358:771 774; Gearing et al., 1993, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:1440 1444, Keller et al., 1993, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>90:2160 2164; Heyman et al., 1992, <i>Cell </i>68:397 406, and Levin et al., 1992, <i>Nature </i>355:359 361). Since the discovery of PPAR&#x3b1;, additional isoforms of PPAR have been identified, e.g., PPAR&#x3b2;, PPAR&#x3b3; and PPAR&#x3b4;, which have similar functions and are similarly regulated.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">PPARs have been identified in the enhancers of a number of gene-encoding proteins that regulate lipid metabolism. These proteins include the three enzymes required for peroxisomal &#x3b2;-oxidation of fatty acids; apolipoprotein A-I; medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in mitochondrial &#x3b2;-oxidation; and aP2, a lipid binding protein expressed exclusively in adipocytes (reviewed in Keller and Whali, 1993, <i>TEM, </i>4:291 296; see also Staels and Auwerx, 1998, <i>Atherosclerosis </i>137 Suppl:S19 23). The nature of the PPAR target genes coupled with the activation of PPARs by fatty acids and hypolipidemic drugs suggests a physiological role for the PPARs in lipid homeostasis.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Pioglitazone, an antidiabetic compound of the thiazolidinedione class, was reported to stimulate expression of a chimeric gene containing the enhancer/promoter of the lipid binding protein aP2 upstream of the chloroamphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene (Harris and Kletzien, 1994, <i>Mol. Pharmacol. </i>45:439 445). Deletion analysis led to the identification of an approximately 30 bp region accounting for pioglitazone responsiveness. In an independent study, this 30 bp fragment was shown to contain a PPRE (Tontonoz et al., 1994, <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>22:5628 5634). Taken together, these studies suggested the possibility that the thiazolidinediones modulate gene expression at the transcriptional level through interactions with a PPAR and reinforce the concept of the interrelatedness of glucose and lipid metabolism.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">2.5 Current Cholesterol Management Therapies</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the past two decades or so, the segregation of cholesterolemic compounds into HDL and LDL regulators and recognition of the desirability of decreasing blood levels of the latter has led to the development of a number of drugs. However, many of these drugs have undesirable side effects and/or are contraindicated in certain patients, particularly when administered in combination with other drugs.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Bile-acid-binding resins are a class of drugs that interrupt the recycling of bile acids from the intestine to the liver. Examples of bile-acid-binding resins are cholestyramine (QUESTRAN LIGHT, Bristol-Myers Squibb), and colestipol hydrochloride (COLESTID, Pharmacia &#x26; Upjohn Company). When taken orally, these positively charged resins bind to negatively charged bile acids in the intestine. Because the resins cannot be absorbed from the intestine, they are excreted, carrying the bile acids with them. The use of such resins, however, at best only lowers serum cholesterol levels by about 20%. Moreover, their use is associated with gastrointestinal side-effects, including constipation and certain vitamin deficiencies. Moreover, since the resins bind to drugs, other oral medications must be taken at least one hour before or four to six hours subsequent to ingestion of the resin, complicating heart patients' drug regimens.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The statins are inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis. Sometimes, the statins are used in combination therapy with bile-acid-binding resins. Lovastatin (MEVACOR, Merck &#x26; Co., Inc.), a natural product derived from a strain of Aspergillus; pravastatin (PRAVACHOL, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.); and atorvastatin (LIPITOR, Warner Lambert) block cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting HMGCoA reductase, the key enzyme involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Lovastatin significantly reduces serum cholesterol and LDL-serum levels. However, serum HDL levels are only slightly increased following lovastatin administration. The mechanism of the LDL-lowering effect may involve both reduction of VLDL concentration and induction of cellular expression of LDL-receptor, leading to reduced production and/or increased catabolism of LDL. Side effects, including liver and kidney dysfunction are associated with the use of these drugs.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Nicotinic acid, also known as niacin, is a water-soluble vitamin B-complex used as a dietary supplement and antihyperlipidemic agent. Niacin diminishes the production of VLDL and is effective at lowering LDL. It is used in combination with bile-acid-binding resins. Niacin can increase HDL when administered at therapeutically effective doses; however, its usefulness is limited by serious side effects.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Fibrates are a class of lipid-lowering drugs used to treat various forms of hyperlipidemia, elevated serum triglycerides, which may also be associated with hypercholesterolemia. Fibrates appear to reduce the VLDL fraction and modestly increase HDL; however, the effects of these drugs on serum cholesterol is variable. In the United States, fibrates have been approved for use as antilipidemic drugs, but have not received approval as hypercholesterolemia agents. For example, clofibrate (ATROMID-S, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories) is an antilipidemic agent that acts to lower serum triglycerides by reducing the VLDL fraction. Although ATROMID-S may reduce serum cholesterol levels in certain patient subpopulations, the biochemical response to the drug is variable, and is not always possible to predict which patients will obtain favorable results. ATROMID-S has not been shown to be effective for prevention of coronary heart disease. The chemically and pharmacologically related drug, gemfibrozil (LOPID, Parke-Davis), is a lipid regulating agent which moderately decreases serum triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol. LOPED also increases HDL cholesterol, particularly the HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions, as well as both the AI/AII-HDL fractions. However, the lipid response to LOPID is heterogeneous, especially among different patient populations. Moreover, while prevention of coronary heart disease was observed in male patients between the ages of 40 and 55 without history or symptoms of existing coronary heart disease, it is not clear to what extent these findings can be extrapolated to other patient populations (e.g., women, older and younger males). Indeed, no efficacy was observed in patients with established coronary heart disease. Serious side-effects are associated with the use of fibrates, including toxicity; malignancy, particularly malignancy of gastrointestinal cancer; gallbladder disease; and an increased incidence in non-coronary mortality. These drugs are not indicated for the treatment of patients with high LDL or low HDL as their only lipid abnormality.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Oral estrogen replacement therapy may be considered for moderate hypercholesterolemia in post-menopausal women. However, increases in HDL may be accompanied with an increase in triglycerides. Estrogen treatment is, of course, limited to a specific patient population, postmenopausal women, and is associated with serious side effects, including induction of malignant neoplasms; gall bladder disease; thromboembolic disease; hepatic adenoma; elevated blood pressure; glucose intolerance; and hypercalcemia.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Long chain carboxylic acids, particularly long chain &#x3b1;,&#x3c9;-dicarboxylic acids with distinctive substitution patterns, and their simple derivatives and salts, have been disclosed for treating atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes (See, e.g., Bisgaier et al., 1998, <i>J. Lipid Res. </i>39:17-30, and references cited therein; International Patent Publication WO 98/30530; U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,344; International Patent Publication WO 99/00116; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,344). However, some of these compounds, for example the &#x3b1;,&#x3c9;-dicarboxylic acids substituted at their &#x3b1;,&#x3b1;&#x2032;-carbons (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,946), while having serum triglyceride and serum cholesterol-lowering activities, have no value for treatment of obesity and hypercholesterolemia (U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,344).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,344 discloses &#x3b2;,&#x3b2;,&#x3b2;&#x2032;,&#x3b2;&#x2032;-tetrasubstituted-&#x3b1;,&#x3c9;-alkanedioic acids that are optionally substituted at their &#x3b1;,&#x3b1;,&#x3b1;&#x2032;,&#x3b1;&#x2032;-positions, and alleges that they are useful for treating obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. According to this reference, both triglycerides and cholesterol are lowered significantly by compounds such as 3,3,14,14-tetramethylhexadecane-1,16-dioic acid. U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,344 further discloses that the &#x3b2;,&#x3b2;,&#x3b2;&#x2032;,&#x3b2;&#x2032;-tetramethyl-alkanediols of U.S. Pat. No. 3,930,024 also are not useful for treating hypercholesterolemia or obesity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Other compounds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,896. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,756,544, &#x3b1;,&#x3c9;-dicarboxylic acid-terminated dialkane ethers are disclosed to have activity in lowering certain plasma lipids, including Lp(a), triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, in animals, and elevating others, such as HDL-cholesterol. The compounds are also stated to increase insulin sensitivity. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,613,593, phosphates of dolichol, a polyprenol isolated from swine liver, are stated to be useful in regenerating liver tissue, and in treating hyperuricuria, hyperlipemia, diabetes, and hepatic diseases in general.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">U.S. Pat. No. 4,287,200 discloses azolidinedione derivatives with anti-diabetic, hypolipidemic, and anti-hypertensive properties. However, the administration of these compounds to patients can produce side effects such as bone marrow depression, and both liver and cardiac cytotoxicity. Further, the compounds disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,287,200 stimulate weight gain in obese patients.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is clear that none of the commercially available cholesterol management drugs has a general utility in regulating lipid, lipoprotein, insulin and glucose levels in the blood. Thus, compounds that have one or more of these utilities are clearly needed. Further, there is a clear need to develop safer drugs that are efficacious at lowering serum cholesterol, increasing HDL serum levels, preventing coronary heart disease, and/or treating existing disease such as atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes, and other diseases that are affected by lipid metabolism and/or lipid levels. There is also a clear need to develop drugs that may be used with other lipid-altering treatment regimens in a synergistic manner. There is still a further need to provide useful therapeutic agents whose solubility and Hydrophile/Lipophile Balance (HLB) can be readily varied.</p>

<p id="p-0191" num="0239">In a specific embodiment, a composition of the invention further comprises one or more chemotherapeutic agents and/or is administered concurrently with radiation therapy. In another specific embodiment, chemotherapy or radiation therapy is administered prior or subsequent to administration of a present composition, preferably at least an hour, five hours, 12 hours, a day, a week, a month, more preferably several months (e.g., up to three months), subsequent to administration of a composition of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0240">In other embodiments, the invention provides methods for treating or preventing cancer, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention and a chemotherapeutic agent. In one embodiment the chemotherapeutic agent is that with which treatment of the cancer has not been found to be refractory. In another embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent is that with which the treatment of cancer has been found to be refractory. The Compounds of the Invention can be administered to an animal that has also undergone surgery as treatment for the cancer.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0241">In one embodiment, the additional method of treatment is radiation therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0242">In a specific embodiment, the Compound of the Invention is administered concurrently with the chemotherapeutic agent or with radiation therapy. In another specific embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent or radiation therapy is administered prior or subsequent to administration of a Compound of the Invention, preferably at least an hour, five hours, 12 hours, a day, a week, a month, more preferably several months (e.g., up to three months), prior or subsequent to administration of a Compound of the Invention.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0243">A chemotherapeutic agent can be administered over a series of sessions, any one or a combination of the chemotherapeutic agents listed in Table 3 can be administered. With respect to radiation, any radiation therapy protocol can be used depending upon the type of cancer to be treated. For example, but not by way of limitation, x-ray radiation can be administered; in particular, high-energy megavoltage (radiation of greater that 1 MeV energy) can be used for deep tumors, and electron beam and orthovoltage x-ray radiation can be used for skin cancers. Gamma-ray emitting radioisotopes, such as radioactive isotopes of radium, cobalt and other elements, can also be administered.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0244">Additionally, the invention provides methods of treatment of cancer with a Compound of the Invention as an alternative to chemotherapy or radiation therapy where the chemotherapy or the radiation therapy has proven or can prove too toxic, e.g., results in unacceptable or unbearable side effects, for the subject being treated. The animal being treated can, optionally, be treated with another cancer treatment such as surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy, depending on which treatment is found to be acceptable or bearable.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0245">The Compounds of the Invention can also be used in an in vitro or ex vivo fashion, such as for the treatment of certain cancers, including, but not limited to leukemias and lymphomas, such treatment involving autologous stem cell transplants. This can involve a multi-step process in which the animal's autologous hematopoietic stem cells are harvested and purged of all cancer cells, the patient's remaining bone-marrow cell population is then eradicated via the administration of a high dose of a Compound of the Invention with or without accompanying high dose radiation therapy, and the stem cell graft is infused back into the animal. Supportive care is then provided while bone marrow function is restored and the animal recovers.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">5.4 Surgical Uses</heading>
<p id="p-0198" num="0246">Cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis often require surgical procedures such as angioplasty. Angioplasty is often accompanied by the placement of a reinforcing a metallic tube shaped structure known as a &#x201c;stent&#x201d; into a damaged coronary artery. For more serious conditions, open heart surgery such as coronary bypass surgery may be required. These surgical procedures entail using invasive surgical devices and/or implants, and are associated with a high risk of restenosis and thrombosis. Accordingly, the compounds and compositions of the invention may be used as coatings on surgical devices (e.g., catheters) and implants (e.g., stents) to reduce the risk of restenosis and thrombosis associated with invasive procedures used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

Orally administered compositions may contain one or more optionally agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions may be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compounds and compositions of the invention. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard vehicles such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Such vehicles are preferably of pharmaceutical grade.</p>

<p id="p-0261" num="0309">In a number of different experiments, illustrative compounds of the invention are administered daily at a dose of up to 100 mg/kg to chow fed obese female Zucker rats for fourteen days in the morning by oral gavage in 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose/0.2% Tween 20 or 20% ethanol/80% polyethylene glycol (dosing vehicles). Animals are weighed daily. Animals are allowed free access to rodent chow and water throughout the study except on days of blood sampling where food is restricted for six hours prior to blood sampling. Blood glucose is determined after the 6 hour fast in the afternoon without anesthesia from a tail vein. Serum is also prepared from pretreatment blood samples subsequently obtained from the orbital venous plexus (with O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2 </sub>anesthesia) and following the fourteenth dose at sacrifice from the heart following O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2 </sub>anesthesia. Serums are assayed for lipoprotein cholesterol profiles, triglycerides, total cholesterol, Non-HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, the ratio of HDL cholesterol to that of Non-HDL cholesterol, insulin, non-esterified fatty acids, and beta-hydroxy butyric acid. The percent body weight gain and the ratio of liver to body weight is also determined. These are shown as absolute values or as a percent change of the pretreatment values in Table 1.</p>

<heading id="h-0064" level="1">7.2 Effects of Illustrative Compounds of the Invention on the in Vitro Lipid Synthesis in Isolated Hepatocytes</heading>
<p id="p-0264" num="0312">Compounds were tested for inhibition of lipid synthesis in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg). Rat hepatocytes were isolated essentially as described by the method of Seglen (Seglen, P. O. Hepatocyte suspensions and cultures as tools in experimental carcinogenesis. <i>J. Toxicol. Environ. Health </i>1979, 5, 551-560). Hepatocytes were suspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium containing 25 mM D-glucose, 14 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-glutamine, 5 mM leucine, 5 mM alanine, 10 mM lactate, 1 mM pyruvate, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 17.4 mM non-essential amino acids, 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 nM insulin and 20 &#x3bc;g/mL gentamycin) and plated at a density of 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>on collagen-coated 96-well plates. Four hours after plating, media was replaced with the same media without serum. Cells were grown overnight to allow formation of monolayer cultures. Lipid synthesis incubation conditions were initially assessed to ensure the linearity of [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate incorporation into hepatocyte lipids for up to 4 hours. Hepatocyte lipid synthesis inhibitory activity was assessed during incubations in the presence of 0.25 &#x3bc;Ci [1-<sup>14</sup>C]-acetate/well (final radiospecific activity in assay is 1 Ci/mol) and 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 or 300 &#x3bc;M of compounds for 4 hours. At the end of the 4-hour incubation period, medium was discarded and cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline and stored frozen prior to analysis. To determine total lipid synthesis, 170 &#x3bc;l of MicroScint-E&#xae; and 50 &#x3bc;l water was added to each well to extract and partition the lipid soluble products to the upper organic phase containing the scintillant. Lipid radioactivity was assessed by scintillation spectroscopy in a Packard TopCount NXT. Lipid synthesis rates were used to determine the IC<sub>50</sub>s of the compounds that are presented in Table 2.</p>
