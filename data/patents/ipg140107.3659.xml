<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a position information acquisition apparatus which transmits position information to an imaging apparatus in order to add position information to image data, and a method of controlling the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A digital camera has recently been known that can add position information at the time of photographing to acquired image data using a position information acquisition unit such as a global positioning system (GPS) as discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 7-64169. Furthermore, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-159048 discusses a configuration in which a position information acquisition unit and a digital camera are separated from each other. Yet further, the position information acquisition unit and the digital camera in the cited documents transmit and receive position information by wireless communication.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the foregoing technology, the digital camera and the position information acquisition unit need to perform wireless communications even in situations where the position information acquisition unit is not able to acquire position information. The reason is that the digital camera needs to check by the wireless communication whether the position information acquisition unit has successfully acquired position data. This gives rise to a problem that such wireless communication consume power uselessly when it is not needed to acquire position information from the position information acquisition unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to reducing useless power consumption related to communications between an imaging apparatus and a position information acquisition apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the present invention, a position information acquisition apparatus capable of wireless communication with an imaging apparatus, the position information acquisition apparatus includes a position information acquisition unit configured to acquire position information that indicates a position of the position information acquisition apparatus, a reception unit configured to receive a request for the position information from the imaging apparatus; a position information transmission unit configured to transmit by the wireless communication the position information acquired by the position information acquisition unit in response to a request for position information from the imaging apparatus, a determination unit configured to determine whether position information can be acquired by the position information acquisition unit; and a signal transmission unit configured to transmit a signal to the imaging apparatus by the wireless communication if the determination unit determines that position information cannot be acquired, the signal inhibiting a request for the position information.</p>

The wireless communication system of the wireless communication reception unit <b>256</b> and the wireless communication transmission unit <b>257</b> may employ infrared communication, Bluetooth, wireless LAN, and other wireless communication systems.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The wireless communication reception unit <b>256</b> and the wireless communication transmission unit <b>257</b> may be composed of a single piece of hardware, or may be composed of a plurality of pieces of hardware. An operation unit <b>258</b> includes a mode dial <b>259</b> and a release switch <b>261</b>. The mode dial <b>259</b> is used to select modes such as still image recording, moving image recording, and playback. The release switch <b>261</b> is used to instruct the image capture unit <b>255</b> to make an image capture operation (i.e. it may be a &#x201c;shutter release button&#x201d;. The operation unit <b>258</b> may include other operation members.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A display unit <b>260</b> displays images obtained by the image capture unit <b>255</b>, as well as various notifications and operation menus. A memory <b>266</b> is a volatile memory. The memory <b>266</b> is used to store various data temporarily. A recording medium <b>263</b> is a nonvolatile memory. The recording medium <b>263</b> may be a removable storage medium such as a memory card, and the camera unit <b>251</b> may have a flash memory built-in. The recording medium <b>263</b> includes an image memory <b>264</b> which is intended for image data, and a position information memory <b>265</b> which is intended for position information. The two memories <b>264</b> and <b>265</b> need not be physically divided, and have only to be managed so that the CPU <b>252</b> can distinguish image data from position information.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, processing operations of the GPS unit <b>201</b> and the camera unit <b>251</b> according to the present exemplary embodiment will be described below. Initially, the operation of the GPS unit <b>201</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The operation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is implemented by the CPU <b>202</b> of the GPS unit <b>201</b> controlling various components according to a program.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In step S<b>101</b>, a user initially turns the power ON. In step S<b>102</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> starts positioning using the positioning unit <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In step S<b>103</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> determines whether position information is successfully acquired by the positioning unit <b>203</b>. If position information is determined not to be acquired (No in step S<b>103</b>), then the CPU <b>202</b> proceeds to step S<b>104</b>. In step S<b>104</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> transmits an addition inhibition signal from the wireless communication transmission unit <b>208</b> to the camera unit <b>251</b>. The addition inhibition signal is a control signal for requesting the camera unit <b>251</b> not to add position information, e.g. to the position information memory <b>265</b>. As will be described later, the camera unit <b>251</b> receiving the addition inhibition signal suspends its own wireless communication transmission function.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In step S<b>105</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> turns OFF the wireless communication reception function of the wireless communication reception unit <b>207</b>. Specifically, the CPU <b>202</b> turns OFF or reduces the power supply to the wireless communication reception unit <b>207</b> through the power supply control unit <b>206</b>. This can reduce the power consumption of the wireless communication reception unit <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Next, description will be given for the case where position information is determined to be acquired (Yes in step S<b>103</b>). In such a case, the CPU <b>202</b> proceeds to step S<b>106</b>. In step S<b>106</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> of the GPS unit <b>201</b> determines whether there is a change in the position information. Specifically, the CPU <b>202</b> compares previously-acquired position information recorded in the memory <b>210</b> with the currently-acquired position information by the comparator <b>209</b>. The CPU <b>202</b> then determines whether the currently-acquired position information is changed by more than a predetermined value with respect to the previously-acquired position information. If the position information is determined not to be changed by more than the predetermined value (No in step S<b>106</b>), the CPU <b>202</b> proceeds to step S<b>107</b>. If the position information is determined to be changed by more than the predetermined value (Yes in step S<b>106</b>), the CPU <b>202</b> proceeds to step S<b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In step S<b>107</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> transmits a request inhibition signal from the wireless communication transmission unit <b>208</b> to the camera unit <b>251</b>. The request inhibition signal is a control signal for requesting the camera unit <b>251</b> not to request position information from the GPS unit <b>201</b>. As will be described later, the camera unit <b>251</b> receiving the request inhibition signal suspends its own wireless communication transmission function. In step S<b>108</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> then turns OFF the wireless communication reception function of the wireless communication reception unit <b>207</b>. This can reduce the power consumption of the wireless communication reception unit <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">If the position information is determined to be changed by more than the predetermined value (Yes in step S<b>106</b>), then in step S<b>109</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> transmits a request permission signal from the wireless communication transmission unit <b>208</b> to the camera unit <b>251</b>. The request permission signal is a control signal for permitting the camera unit <b>251</b> to request position information from the GPS unit <b>201</b>. The inhibition on the request of position information imposed by the request inhibition signal is released by the request permission signal.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In step S<b>110</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> then records the position information acquired in step S<b>102</b> into the memory <b>210</b>. The memory <b>210</b> is overwritten with the position information that is the last acquired, i.e., the latest position information. In step S<b>111</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> then determines whether a position information acquisition request is received from the camera unit <b>251</b>. If the position information acquisition request is determined not to be received from the camera unit <b>251</b> (No in step S<b>111</b>), the processing returns to step S<b>102</b>. If a position information acquisition request is determined to be received from the camera unit <b>251</b> (Yes in step S<b>111</b>), the processing proceeds to step S<b>112</b>. In step S<b>112</b>, the CPU <b>202</b> transmits the position information recorded in the memory <b>210</b> to the camera unit <b>251</b>. In such a way, the GPS unit <b>201</b> transmits position information in response to a request from the camera unit <b>251</b>. After the operation of step S<b>111</b> or S<b>112</b>, the processing returns to step S<b>102</b> and the GPS unit <b>201</b> starts acquiring new position information.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, the operation of the camera unit <b>251</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The operation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is implemented by the CPU <b>252</b> of the camera unit <b>251</b> controlling various components according to a program. The camera unit <b>251</b> can receive the addition inhibition signal, request inhibition signal, and request permission signal in parallel with the procedure even in the middle of the flow.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In step S<b>151</b>, the user turns the power ON. In step S<b>152</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> checks for the reception of a signal from the GPS unit <b>201</b>, and determines whether position information can be added to image data. If the addition inhibition signal is or has been received from the GPS unit <b>201</b> (No in step S<b>152</b>), then the CPU <b>252</b> determines that position information cannot be added, and the processing proceeds to step S<b>153</b>. If the addition inhibition signal is not or has not been received from the GPS unit <b>201</b> (Yes in step S<b>152</b>), then the CPU <b>252</b> determines that position information can be added, and the processing proceeds to step S<b>157</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step S<b>153</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> displays a message on the display unit <b>260</b> to notify the user that position information cannot be added to images. In step S<b>154</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> then turns OFF the wireless communication transmission function of the wireless communication transmission unit <b>257</b>. Specifically, the CPU <b>252</b> turns OFF or reduces the power supply to the wireless communication transmission unit <b>257</b> through the power supply control unit <b>254</b>. This inhibits the digital camera <b>100</b> from transmitting a position information acquisition request to the GPS unit <b>201</b>, whereby the power consumption of the wireless communication transmission unit <b>257</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step S<b>155</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> then determines whether the release switch <b>261</b> is pressed. If the release switch <b>261</b> is determined not to be pressed (No in step S<b>155</b>), the CPU <b>252</b> returns to step S<b>152</b>. If the release switch <b>261</b> is determined to be pressed (Yes in step S<b>155</b>), the CPU <b>252</b> proceeds to step S<b>166</b>. In step S<b>166</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> captures an image of a subject and acquires image data by the image capture unit <b>255</b>. In step S<b>156</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> stores the image data into the image memory <b>264</b> without adding position information. The reason is due to the reception of the addition inhibition signal from the GPS unit <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If it is determined that position information is determined to be able to be added (Yes in step S<b>152</b>), i.e., if the addition inhibition signal is not received from the GPS unit <b>201</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> proceeds to step S<b>157</b>. In step S<b>157</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> determines whether position information can be requested. If the request inhibition signal is received from the GPS unit <b>201</b> (No in step S<b>157</b>), the CPU <b>252</b> determines that position information cannot be requested, and the processing proceeds to step S<b>158</b>. If the request inhibition signal is not received from the GPS unit <b>201</b> (Yes in step S<b>157</b>), the CPU <b>252</b> determines that position information can be requested, and the processing proceeds to step S<b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step S<b>158</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> turns OFF the wireless communication transmission function of the wireless communication transmission unit <b>257</b>. This inhibits the digital camera <b>100</b> from transmitting a position information acquisition request to the GPS unit <b>201</b>, whereby the power consumption of the wireless communication transmission unit <b>257</b> can be reduced. In step S<b>159</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> then determines whether the release switch <b>261</b> is pressed. If the release switch <b>261</b> is determined not to be pressed (No in step S<b>159</b>), the processing returns to step S<b>152</b>. If the release switch <b>261</b> is determined to be pressed (Yes in step S<b>159</b>), the CPU <b>252</b> proceeds to step S<b>167</b>. In step S<b>167</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> captures an image of a subject and acquires image data by using the image capture unit <b>255</b>. In step S<b>160</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> adds previously-acquired position information stored in the position information memory <b>265</b> to the acquired image data, and stores the resulting image data into the image memory <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step S<b>161</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> supplies power to the wireless communication transmission unit <b>257</b> through the power supply control unit <b>254</b>. The CPU <b>252</b> then transmits a position information acquisition request from the wireless communication transmission unit <b>257</b> to the GPS unit <b>201</b>. In step S<b>162</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> acquires position information from the GPS unit <b>201</b> through the wireless communication reception unit <b>256</b>. In step S<b>163</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> records the acquired position information into the position information memory <b>265</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step S<b>164</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> then determines whether the release switch <b>261</b> is pressed. If the release switch <b>261</b> is determined not to be pressed (No in step S<b>164</b>), the processing returns to step S<b>152</b>. If the release switch <b>261</b> is determined to be pressed (Yes in step S<b>164</b>), the processing proceeds to step S<b>168</b>. In step S<b>168</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> captures an image of a subject and acquires image data by the image capture unit <b>255</b>. In step S<b>165</b>, the CPU <b>252</b> then adds the position information recorded in the position information memory <b>265</b> in step S<b>163</b> to the image data, and stores the resulting image data into the image memory <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As has been described above, in the present exemplary embodiment, the GPS unit <b>201</b> determines how the camera unit <b>251</b> should operate, and transmits control signals. If the GPS unit <b>201</b> determines that position information cannot be acquired, the GPS unit <b>201</b> transmits the addition inhibition signal to the camera unit <b>251</b>, and turns OFF the reception function of the GPS unit <b>201</b> and the transmission function of the camera unit <b>251</b>. If the GPS unit <b>201</b> determines that position information is not changed, the GPS unit <b>201</b> transmits the request inhibition signal to the camera unit <b>251</b>, and turns OFF the reception function of the GPS unit <b>201</b> and the transmission function of the camera unit <b>251</b>. This can reduce useless wireless communications when position information need not be transmitted from the GPS unit <b>201</b> to the camera unit <b>251</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A second exemplary embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a GPS unit <b>201</b> which is the position information acquisition apparatus according to the second exemplary embodiment. The same components as those of the GPS unit <b>201</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be designated by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will be omitted here. A difference from the first exemplary embodiment lies in the provision of a battery level detection unit <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The second exemplary embodiment is an example of preventing the camera unit <b>251</b> from making a useless position information acquisition request when the GPS unit <b>201</b> runs out of battery and becomes unable to transmit position information to the camera unit <b>251</b>. The battery level detection unit <b>211</b> detects the remaining battery level of the GPS unit <b>201</b>. A threshold level is set to a battery level such that the addition inhibition signal can be transmitted at least once. If the detected battery level exceeds the threshold level, the GPS unit <b>201</b> transmits the addition inhibition signal to the camera unit <b>251</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Suppose that the GPS unit <b>201</b> subsequently runs out of battery and becomes unable to acquire position information. Even in such a case, according to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the camera unit <b>251</b> determines in step S<b>152</b> that position information cannot be added. This can reduce inquiries to the GPS unit <b>201</b> that is low in battery level.</p>
