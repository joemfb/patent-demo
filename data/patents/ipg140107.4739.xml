<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the invention relate to microphone devices and methods for packaging the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, relatively small-sized acoustic transducer components are configured for surface mounting on a carrier board, such as a printed circuit board, to establish electrical contact between the acoustic transducer component and electronic circuitry disposed on the carrier board. The acoustic transducer component is provided with a sound port, typically in the form of a hole, for allowing passage of sound pressure between the exterior of the component and an acoustic transducer disposed inside the acoustic transducer component.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventionally, the sound port is provided either as a top-port or a bottom-port. In a top-port configuration, the transducer component or package has electrodes or solder-pads disposed on a bottom surface abutting the carrier board and the sound port is disposed on a top surface. Conversely, in a bottom-port configuration, the sound port is disposed on the bottom surface with the electrodes or solder-pads positioned around the sound port opening. Thus, a bottom-port package has the sound port on the same side as the package leads, whereas a top-port package has the sound port on a different, typically opposite, side from the package leads. The acoustic transducer component of a bottom-port design is typically mounted on a carrier board with a hole aligned with the sound port opening to allow passage of sound pressure between the exterior of the component and the acoustic transducer inside the acoustic transducer component.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typically, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) microphone devices are configured with a bottom-port to aid in providing a sufficiently large back volume behind a moveable member of the acoustic transducer. Condenser microphones or electret condenser microphones (ECMs) have a different construction and are typically configured with a top-port to allow a sufficiently large back volume.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The construction of the product using the acoustic transducer (e.g., a mobile phone) can dictate use of either the MEMS devices or the ECM devices, depending upon whether the mounting area is better suited to bottom-port or top-port mounting. However, since the two types of microphone devices have different properties and qualities, in certain implementations, such as those demanding a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio, it may not be desirable for the structure of the product incorporating the microphone package to dictate the type of the acoustic transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Conventionally, an acoustic transducer component or package comprises an acoustic transducer and a housing that includes lid and a rigid substrate with first and second surfaces opposite each other. The housing has an exterior top surface, and the rigid substrate is disposed with its second surface as an exterior bottom surface of the housing. Electrical terminals are disposed on the second surface of the rigid substrate. The acoustic transducer component is also denoted a microphone package.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Examples of acoustic transducer components or packages are disclosed, e.g., in US Patent Publication No. 2010/0090295 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,202,552. There is a need for improved microphone packages, and methods of forming the same.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Packages and methods of packaging microphone devices are disclosed herein. In one aspect, a component assembly comprises an acoustic transducer component or package with a housing and an acoustic transducer disposed therein. The housing includes a rigid substrate with first and second surfaces opposite each other. The housing has an exterior top surface, and the rigid substrate is disposed with its second surface as an exterior bottom surface of the housing. Electrical terminals are disposed on the second surface of the rigid substrate. The component assembly further comprises a flexible substrate having a first portion and a second portion and being flexible at least between the first and second portion, each portion with opposing sides. The flexible substrate is folded around the acoustic transducer component with its first portion overlaying and attached to the exterior top surface and its second portion at least partially overlaying and attached to the exterior bottom surface, and the flexible substrate is provided with electrically conductive traces exposed on the side of the first portion that faces away from the housing and connecting to at least one of the electrical terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Consequently, a more versatile utilization of the acoustic transducer component, which may be a conventional acoustic transducer, is achieved. For example, acoustic transducer components configured for top-mount and provided with a flexible substrate in a component assembly can be used in a bottom-mount configuration. Likewise, components configured for bottom-mount can be used for top-mount configurations. Effectively, flexible substrates can be employed for converting top-mount packages, which may have already been designed or produced, into bottom-mount packages, and vice versa. Thus, more versatile utilization is possible without alteration of the construction of the acoustic transducer component.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Since it is thereby possible to use the component assembly with a top-port transducer component as a bottom-port component, and vice versa, the previous design lock-in to use one of the two types can be overcome. Thus, the use of a top-port type microphone, which is typically an electret condenser microphone, or bottom-port type microphone, which is typically a MEMS device, can be decided from its respective and different properties and qualities.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The flexible substrate can be made from one or more film layers and comprises one or more conductive layers with electrically conductive traces. The flexible substrate, at least between the first and second portion, has a much lower modulus than the rigid substrate. For instance, but not limited thereto, the flexible substrate may have a Young's modulus of 5 GPa whereas the rigid substrate may have a Young's modulus of 25 GPa. The flexible substrate may be flexible in its full length or, alternatively, relatively rigid at the first and second portions while relatively flexible between the first and second portions, where it is folded. At the portion where the flexible substrate is flexible it may bend with a radius of curvature that is, for instance, less than about 5 mm. However, in certain implementations, the radius of curvature can be smaller, for example, less than about 1 mm, or more particularly, less than about 0.6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The acoustic transducer component is also denoted as a microphone package. The housing of the acoustic transducer component can include a rigid substrate and a package lid, which may be in the form of a can or box and which at its bottom side is closed by the rigid substrate. The package lid may be made from a metal, an alloy or plastic material coated by a metal or alloy layer to provide a Faraday casing for protection against electromagnetic interference (EMI). The skilled artisan will appreciate that structures and methods disclosed herein can be applied to many other types of package housing (e.g., ceramic). In one implementation, the lid includes an intermediate printed circuit board (PCB) over the package substrate, with a hole therethrough to define the package cavity, and an upper PCB disposed over the intermediate PCB including over the hole. The intermediate PCB can operate as the walls of the lid and the upper PCB can operate at the top of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The acoustic transducer may be a microphone of the MEMS or condenser or electret condenser or piezo type, but is not limited thereto. For example, the acoustic transducer may be a pressure sensor or a loudspeaker.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electrical terminals of the acoustic transducer component may be configured with solder pads, which can be soldered to electrical terminals or pads on a carrier board using any suitable technique, such as by using a surface mounting technology (SMT).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The electrically conductive traces connect at predefined locations (e.g., by means of solder pads) to the electrical terminals of the acoustic transducer such that electrical connection is established. Additionally, the electrically conductive traces are exposed at predefined locations (e.g. by means of solder pads) to aid in mounting the component assembly to a carrier board.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first portion of the flexible substrate can be attached to the exterior top surface of the acoustic transducer component in any suitable way, such as by means of an adhesive. The second portion of the flexible substrate can be attached to the exterior bottom surface of the acoustic transducer component by soldering at solder pads disposed on the abutting surfaces and/or by applying an adhesive or using any other suitable technique. The adhesive may be, for example, a conductive adhesive disposed on the pads or a non-conductive adhesive disposed between at least some of the pads. A combination of solder paste and a non-conductive adhesive may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The component assembly may be a relatively small-sized component assembly for use in mobile electronic products such as mobile telephones, smart phones, lap-top or tablet computers, cameras or other devices. In some embodiments the component assembly is smaller than 13 mm&#xd7;13 mm&#xd7;13 mm or smaller than 5 mm&#xd7;4 mm&#xd7;2 mm or smaller than 4 mm&#xd7;3 mm&#xd7;1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments the component assembly has a sound port extending through its housing for passage of sound pressure between the exterior of the component assembly and the acoustic transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The sound port is also denoted an environmental hole and may have, for example, a circular or square-shaped opening at the external surface of the housing, though other shapes are possible. The sound port may be in the form of a hole or a channel. The sound port allows acoustic energy or pressure or pressure changes to interact between the acoustic transducer inside the housing and the atmosphere outside the housing. For example, the sound port can allow ingress of acoustic energy or pressure changes for a microphone, or egress of acoustic energy or pressure changes for a speaker. For a top-port device the sound port extends through the top surface of the housing, or a surface other than that on which the package leads are formed, whereas for a bottom-port device the sound port extends through the rigid substrate that forms the bottom side of the housing, or the same surface as that one which the package leads are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments the component assembly has a sound port with an opening through its housing and a hole through the flexible substrate, where the opening of the sound port and the hole through the flexible substrate are aligned with each other for transmitting a sound pressure between the exterior of the component assembly and the acoustic transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For a bottom port device, this configuration allows the second portion of the flexible substrate to overlay the entire bottom surface of the acoustic transducer component or a substantial portion thereof, which can aid in improving the structural support of the acoustic transducer component. For example, overlaying the second portion of the flexible substrate over a substantial portion of the bottom surface of the acoustic transducer can allow the second portion of the flexible substrate to provide a sufficiently large and thus stable support for carrying the component assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The opening of the sound port may have a size substantially similar to the hole in the flexible substrate. Alternatively, the opening of the sound port may be larger or smaller than the hole in the flexible substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments an electrically conductive trace runs between a first side of the first portion and the opposing side of the second portion of the flexible substrate, and the trace is routed through a vertical interconnect access (VIA).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As used herein, VIA is a vertical electrical connection between different layers of conductors in a printed circuit board design. VIAs can be pads with plated holes that provide electrical connections between traces on different layers of the board.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Including a VIA in the first portion of the flexible substrate can aid in providing electrical connectivity in the component assembly. For example, a pair of pads can be provided with one pad disposed on the first portion of the flexible substrate and the other pad disposed on the second portion of the flexible substrate. The pair of pads can be on opposing sides of the flexible substrate, and can be connected by a trace and a VIA, thereby avoiding any need to twist the flexible substrate to make the proper electrical connections.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments the component assembly comprises a semiconductor die disposed in the housing on the first surface of the rigid substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In certain implementations, the semiconductor die can be electrically shielded by the housing of the component assembly. Additionally, connections, which can be in the form of wire bonding, between the transducer element and the semiconductor die can be relatively short to aid in reducing stray capacitances that can cause signal loss.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments the component assembly comprises a semiconductor die disposed on the portion of the flexible substrate that overlays the exterior bottom surface and is therefore outside the housing. The semiconductor die is disposed on a side of the flexible substrate opposite the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Configuring the semiconductor die in this configuration can improve flexibility in application of the component assembly. In some embodiments the semiconductor die disposed on the flexible substrate is electrically connected to a semiconductor die disposed in the housing to allow communication between the dies.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments the semiconductor die on the flexible substrate (outside the housing) is encapsulated in a glob top.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The glob top provides protection of the semiconductor die against moisture and mechanical impact. Also, in certain implementations, the glob top protects wire bonds that may connect the semiconductor die to pads and/or traces within the flexible substrate. The glob top may comprise a resin material such as an epoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A metal shield enclosing the semiconductor die in a Faraday casing may be enclosed in the glob top, which can aid in providing EMI shielding of the semiconductor die.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments the component assembly comprises a first semiconductor die disposed in the housing on the first surface of the rigid substrate, and a second semiconductor die disposed on the portion of the flexible substrate that overlays the exterior bottom surface of the housing on a side of the flexible substrate opposite the housing. In certain implementations, the first semiconductor die comprises a circuit that is configured to process analog signals and the second semiconductor die is configured to process digital signals, and the first and second semiconductor dies are electrically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Disposing the first and second semiconductor dies in this configuration can improve signal quality. For example, the digital circuit can be placed at a greater distance from the analog circuit and the digital circuit can be positioned exterior to the housing where the analog circuit is disposed, thereby improving signal-to-noise ratio by reducing the effect of digital signal coupling on the analog circuitry. The semiconductor die disposed on the flexible substrate is electrically connected to the semiconductor die disposed in the housing to allow communication between them.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments the circuit configured to process analog signals comprises a preamplifier coupled to receive an electrical signal from the acoustic transducer and to provide an analog output signal. The circuit configured to process digital signals can comprise an analog-to-digital (A-to-D) converter coupled to receive the analog output signal and to provide a digital output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments the semiconductor die comprises a circuit with an analog portion configured to process analog signals and a digital portion configured to process digital signals, and the electrical terminals disposed on the second surface of the rigid substrate comprises a first terminal electrically connected to the analog portion and a second terminal electrically connected to the digital portion.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some implementations, the electrical terminals disposed on the second surface of the rigid substrate are configured to provide separate ground connections for analog and digital systems. Thus, a ground system for analog signals and a ground system for digital signals can be provided. Providing ground systems in this manner can aid in reducing noise, thereby improving signal-to-noise performance of the microphone device. The ground systems can be separately electrically accessible on the second surface of the rigid substrate. For example, in some implementations each ground system can be accessed using a different electrodes or pads disposed on the first portion of the flexible substrate on a side of the flexible substrate opposite the housing. Although each ground system can be electrically isolated, in some embodiments the digital and analog ground systems are interconnected within the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments a first ring-shaped electrode or pad is disposed on the second surface of the rigid substrate, and the first ring-shaped electrode encircles a second ring-shaped electrode or pad. The digital ground system can be electrically connected to the second electrode or pad and the analog ground system can be electrically connected to the first electrode or pad, or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments the electrical terminals disposed on the second surface of the rigid surface further comprise a third terminal, and the electrically conductive paths or traces on the flexible substrate connect to and expose the third terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the digital ground system is provided as the only ground system on a pad on the first portion of the flexible substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments the second portion of the flexible substrate has a smaller area than the second surface of the rigid substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thereby the second portion of the flexible substrate overlays only a smaller portion of the second surface of the rigid substrate and exposes a free portion of the second surface of the rigid structure. Consequently, the second portion of the flexible substrate does not occupy the entire second surface of the rigid substrate, thereby permitting one or more external electronic components to be disposed on the free portion of the second surface.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments the electrical terminals disposed on the second surface of the rigid surface further comprise a fourth electrical terminal that is electrically connected to the semiconductor die within the housing. The fourth electrical terminal is exposed on the free portion or the portion of the second surface of the rigid substrate that is not covered by the flexible substrate, and at least one electrical component outside the housing is electrically connected to the fourth terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Accordingly, in some implementations the rigid substrate can carry components on both sides. For example, one or more components can be disposed on the first side of the rigid substrate facing the interior of the housing, and one or more components can be disposed on the second or opposite side that serves as the exterior bottom surface of the housing. This allows arrangement of a circuit with one portion within the housing and another portion outside the housing. For example, the at least one component connected to the fourth terminals can be mounted when the housing has been manufactured, i.e., when it is closed and sealed. The component can be a component whose value can be varied or the component can be selected from among a set of components with different values to adapt the performance of the circuit on the semiconductor die to predefined specifications based on measurements of the circuit within the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments the fourth terminal is connected to the semiconductor die within the housing through the rigid substrate, such as by using a VIA.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments a fifth electrical terminal is electrically connected to the semiconductor die within the housing and is exposed on the portion of the flexible substrate that overlays the exterior bottom surface on the side of the flexible substrate opposite the housing, and at least one electrical component is electrically connected to the fifth terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Accordingly, in some implementations, a circuit for a transducer device is provided with one portion in the housing and another portion outside the housing. This is convenient since the at least one component connected to the fifth terminal can be mounted when the housing has been manufactured, i.e., when it is closed and sealed. The component can then be selected from among a set of components with different values to adapt the performance of the circuit on the semiconductor die within the housing to predefined specifications based on measurements of the circuit. Alternatively, the component can be a variable component, such as a trimmable resistor, that can have a value that is selected based on measurements of the circuit. In some implementations, the component is used to control microphone sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments the fifth terminal is connected to the semiconductor die within the housing through the rigid substrate and through the flexible substrate using, for example, a VIA.</p>
