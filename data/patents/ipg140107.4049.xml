<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) on Patent Application No. 2010-156651 filed in Japan on Jul. 9, 2010, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display operation device for giving an instruction to electronic equipment and, more specifically, to a display device receiving a user instruction using a user interface (UI) component such as a software button as a trigger of some process, as well as to an image processing apparatus having such a display operation device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As one type of image processing apparatuses as electronic equipment, image forming apparatuses (typically, copy machines) are introduced to many places of business (companies and offices). A main function of an image forming apparatus is to form an image on a sheet of recording paper. Therefore, it is often the case that the image forming apparatus has a printer function, a copy function and the like. The image forming apparatuses are often connected to a network, to allow use by a plurality of users. A multifunction peripheral (MFP) has been known as one type of such image forming apparatuses. An MFP has a scanner function, and has a plurality of basic operational modes such as a copy mode, a facsimile mode (hereinafter &#x201c;facsimile&#x201d; may also be denoted as FAX or fax), and a network-supported printer mode. It is expected that the scanner function will be used more frequently in the future in such image forming apparatuses. In the copy mode and facsimile mode also, it is possible to read an image using the scanner function and to set functions such as duplex (two-sided) printing, collective printing (such as 2-in-1 by which two pages of an original document are printed on one sheet, or 4-in-1 by which four pages of an original document are printed on one sheet), and enlargement or reduction of size.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When using such an image forming apparatus, by way of example, the user makes the following operations. First, the user has image data read by the image forming apparatus in the scanner mode. Thereafter, the user inputs various instructions through an operation panel, and performs image processing (such as collection). Then, the user gives an instruction to start a final processing of the image (printing to a sheet of paper, transmission by facsimile, and saving as a file). A screen image allowing setting of functions in various operational modes, for example, is displayed on the operation panel. Therefore, it is possible for the user to easily set various functions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, a touch-panel display comes to be increasingly used as such an operation panel. A touch-panel display includes a liquid crystal panel (display panel) and a touch-panel stacked on the liquid crystal panel. Typically, items (software buttons) allowing selection of an operational mode of the image forming apparatus are displayed on the touch-panel display. Viewing the display, the user presses a position where a desired item is displayed, on the touch-panel display. For the user, it seems as if he/she has pressed a software button. Information related to which position has been pressed is transmitted to a computer controlling the image forming apparatus, and what operation is to be carried out is determined in accordance with the position, by a program running on the computer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The touch-panel display provides both the display function and the operation function. It is advantageous in that it occupies a smaller area for installation than a display unit and an operation unit provided separately, it allows various and many manners of display, and it provides various and many functions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">By way of example, when an MFP having a touch-panel display as such as an operation panel is in the copy mode, a copy start key (button) is displayed on the display as an initial screen image. If the copy start key is pressed, using this as a trigger, the MFP automatically reads a document placed on an automatic document reader and forms a copy on a sheet of recording paper.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">After the start of copying, the user may want to stop copying by some reason. For this purpose, it is a general practice to display a copy stop key together with the copy start key, allowing the user to stop copying by pressing the copy stop key once the copying operation is started. However, this hinders efficient use of the area of touch-panel display. Considering the fact that MFPs come to have various and many functions, many pieces of information must be displayed on the display, and such pieces of information must be displayed in an easily viewable and easily understandable manner. Therefore, the area of touch-panel display should not be wasted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to solve such a problem, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Application No. 59-58457 (hereinafter referred to as '457 Reference) discloses a technique of using one switch both as a copy start switch and a copy stop switch. Specifically, '457 Reference discloses a technique in which during a copy operation, the copy start key is used as a copy stop key. In the device disclosed in this reference, either one of two indications &#x201c;START&#x201d; and &#x201c;STOP&#x201d; lights up on a hardware key. The indication corresponding to the usable function lights up on the key.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other main functions of the MFP include a document reading function, used in copying and facsimile transmission. Similar problem as described above occurs when the MFP reads documents. Further, it is often the case that, at the time of document reading, after a document is read by the MFP, the user wishes to have an additional document read. It is not efficient to provide a key dedicated for additional document reading. Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2005-64944 (hereinafter referred to as '944 Reference) discloses a technique in which the initially displayed read start button is displayed as an additional read start button. Specifically, the characters displayed on the button are changed from &#x201c;read start&#x201d; to &#x201c;additional read start.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The technique described in '457 Reference and the technique described in '944 Reference are based on similar ideas of allocating different functions to one key or button (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;button or the like&#x201d;) and switching the functions to be used. These are good techniques that allow advantageous use of the display area.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">These techniques, however, still have room for improvement. Specifically, in both techniques, it is difficult to understand the function allocated to the button or the like, until the user reads the characters displayed on the button or the like. Particularly, in '457 Reference, one key has opposite functions of &#x201c;start&#x201d; and &#x201c;stop,&#x201d; while in '944 Reference, one key has similar functions of &#x201c;read start&#x201d; and &#x201c;additional read start&#x201d;. Therefore, when different functions are allocated to one button, it is difficult to recognize whether the functions are similar to or very much different from each other. Such a problem arises not only on software buttons but also on general UI components (for example, pull-down menu, combo boxes, tabs, table cells or icons, texts or images used in place of software buttons) used as a trigger of a task on a display-operation panel.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, it is preferable to provide a display operation device that allows intuitive recognition as to whether functions allocated to a UI component displayed on the display-operation penal are similar functions or different functions, as well as to provide an image forming apparatus provided with such a display operation device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a display operation device, including: a display-integrated operation panel having a display screen; a first UI component display device displaying a first user interface (UI) component image on the display screen; a process activating device, responsive to a user operation of the first UI component displayed on the display screen by the first UI component display device, for activating a process associated with the first UI component; a second UI component display device, responsive to activation of the process associated with the first UI component by the process activating device, for displaying a second UI component in place of the first UI component on the display screen; and a process stopping device, responsive to a user operation of the second UI component displayed on the display screen by the second UI component display device, for stopping execution of the process. Part of the second UI component is displayed in a color complementary to a display color of a part of the first UI component, or a color analogous to the complementary color, or a color same as but having different tone from the complementary color.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When the user operates the first UI component, the process associated with the component is activated. At the same time, the second UI component display device displays the second UI component in place of the first UI component. If the second UI component is operated, execution of the activated process is stopped. Display color of a part of the second UI component is a complementary color, or a color analogous to the complementary color, or the same complementary color of different tone, of the display color of a part of the first UI component. Since the display colors are very different, the user can easily and intuitively understand that the process started by operating the first UI component is stopped by operating the second UI component. As a result, a display that allows intuitive understanding as to whether the functions of UI component displayed on the display-operation panel are similar functions or different functions can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the display operation device further includes: a third UI component display device, responsive to end of the process, for displaying a third UI component in place of the second UI component; and a process resuming device, responsive to a user operation of the third UI component displayed on the display screen by the third UI component display device, for resuming the process. Part of the third UI component is displayed in a color analogous to or the same as but having different tone from display color of the part of the first UI component.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the process activated by operating the first UI component ends, the third UI component is displayed. If the third UI component is operated, the process executed by operating the first UI component is resumed by the process resuming device, and the similar process can be executed in an additional manner. Since the display color of a part of the third UI component and the display color of a part of the first UI component are analogous or the same color of different tone, the user can easily and intuitively understand that the functions are similar.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The part of the second UI component may be a background portion of the second UI component, or a character portion formed in the second UI component.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the display operation device further includes a fourth UI component display device for displaying a fourth UI component at a position different from the first UI component on the display screen; and a device, responsive to a user operation of the fourth UI component displayed on the display screen by the fourth UI component display device, for controlling the first UI component such that the first UI component is displayed in place of the second and third UI components.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">By operating the fourth UI component, the initial state in which the first UI component is displayed is resumed. Since the first UI component is displayed, the user can easily understand the initial state is resumed and a new process can be started.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the display operation device is used connected to an image forming apparatus for forming a document image read by the document reading device on a sheet of recording paper. The display operation device further includes a device, responsive to a user operation of the fourth UI component displayed on the display screen by the fourth UI component display device, for controlling the image forming apparatus such that a process for forming an image of the document read by the document reading device on a sheet of recording paper is started.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The second UI component may be displayed at the same position, in the same size and in the same shape as the first UI component. Then, the part of the first UI component and the part of the second UI component may be portions that match if the first and second UI components were superposed. The part of the first UI component may be a background portion of the first UI component, or it may be a character portion formed in the first UI component.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a second aspect, the present invention provides an image forming apparatus, including: any of the display operation devices described above; a document reading device, connected to the display operation device, for reading a document and converting it to image data, in accordance with an instruction from the display operation device; and an image forming unit, connected to the display operation device and to the document reading device, for storing image data output from the document reading device and, in response to an output instruction from the display operation device, for forming an image of the image data on a sheet of recording paper.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a third aspect, the present invention provides a computer program causing, when executed by a computer connected to a display-integrated operation panel having a display screen, the computer to operate as: a first UI component display device for displaying an image of a first user interface (UI) component on the display screen; a process activating device, responsive to a user operation of the first UI component displayed on the display screen by the first UI component display device, for activating a process associated with the first UI component; a second UI component display device, responsive to activation of the process associated with the first UI component by the process activating device, for displaying a second UI component in place of the first UI component on the display screen; and a process stopping device, responsive to a user operation of the second UI component displayed on the display screen by the second UI component display device, for stopping execution of the process. Part of the second UI component is displayed in a color complementary to a display color of a part of the first UI component, or a color analogous to the complementary color, or a color same as but having different tone from the complementary color.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, according to the present invention, when the first UI component displayed on the display-operation panel is operated, a certain process is activated, and the second UI component is displayed in place of the first UI component. If the newly displayed second UI component is operated, the activated process is stopped. When the certain process ends, the third UI component is displayed, and if the third UI component is operated, the process started by the operation of the first UI component can be resumed. Display colors of a part of the first UI component and a part of the second UI components are complementary colors, or analogous to the complementary colors, or the complementary colors of different tones, to each other. Therefore, it can easily and intuitively be understood that functions allocated to the components are very different. On the other hand, the first and third UI components have analogous colors or the same color of different tones. Therefore, it can easily be understood that functions allocated to these components are of the same type. As a result, a display operation device that allows intuitive understanding as to whether the functions of the UI component displayed on the display operation panel are similar functions or different functions can be provided and, further, an image forming apparatus having such a display operation device can be provided.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present embodiment is characterized in that a button displayed when execution of a task such as document reading, facsimile transmission of a document or copying is instructed has its color changed in accordance with a change of the function.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present embodiment, if a button used as a trigger for executing a certain function serves as a button for another function similar to the certain function, the button color is changed to an analogous but not the same color as the original color. When the button is to be used as a button for a very much different function, the button color is changed to a color much different from the original color. Since the button color is changed in such a manner, the user can easily and intuitively determine whether the button function is similar to or different from the original function of the button.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Such a process is executed in any of the copy mode, mail mode, FAX mode and the document filing mode. In any of these modes, the manner of determining the color of button display is essentially the same.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the following, first, the configuration of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> will be briefly described mainly with reference to the copy mode. Thereafter, the display transition at the time of document reading, in the facsimile mode and the copy mode will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the copy mode, mainly document reading unit <b>102</b> and image forming unit <b>104</b> operate.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, a document placed on a platen is read by document reading unit <b>102</b> as image data. The image data is subjected to various image processing operations, and the resulting image data is output to image forming unit <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Image forming unit <b>104</b> is for printing an image of the document represented by the image data on a recording medium (in most cases, on a sheet of recording paper). Image forming unit <b>104</b> includes a photoreceptor drum <b>222</b>, a charger <b>224</b>, a laser scanning unit (hereinafter denoted as LSU) <b>226</b>, a developer <b>228</b>, a transfer device <b>230</b>, a cleaning device <b>232</b>, a fixing device <b>234</b> and a neutralizer, not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In image forming unit <b>104</b>, a main feeding path <b>236</b> and a reverse feeding path <b>238</b> are provided, and a sheet of recording paper fed from paper feed unit <b>106</b> is fed along main feeding path <b>236</b>. Paper feed unit <b>106</b> draws out sheets of recording paper stacked on a paper feed cassette <b>240</b> or on a manual feed tray <b>242</b> one by one, and feeds the sheet of paper to main feeding path <b>236</b> of image forming unit <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the sheet of recording paper is fed along main feeding path <b>236</b> of image forming unit <b>104</b>, the sheet passes between photoreceptor drum <b>222</b> and transfer device <b>230</b>, and further passes through fixing device <b>234</b>, whereby printing is done on the sheet of recording paper.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Photoreceptor drum <b>222</b> rotates in one direction, and its surface is cleaned by cleaning device <b>232</b> and the neutralizer and, thereafter, uniformly charged by charger <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">LSU <b>226</b> modulates the laser beam based on the image data to be printed, and repeatedly scans the surface of photoreceptor drum <b>222</b> with the modulated laser beam in a main scanning direction, whereby an electrostatic latent image is formed on the surface of photoreceptor drum <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Developer <b>228</b> develops the electrostatic latent image by supplying toner to the surface of photoreceptor drum <b>222</b>, and thus, a toner image is formed on the surface of photoreceptor drum <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Transfer device <b>230</b> transfers the toner image on the surface of photoreceptor drum <b>222</b> to the sheet of recording paper passing between transfer device <b>230</b> and the photoreceptor drum <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Fixing device <b>234</b> includes a heating roller <b>248</b> for heating the sheet of recording paper and a pressure roller <b>250</b> for pressing the sheet of recording paper. As the sheet of recording paper is heated by heating roller <b>248</b> and pressed by pressure roller <b>250</b>, the toner image that has been transferred to the sheet of recording paper is fixed on the sheet. A heater is heated by electric power supplied to fixing device <b>234</b> and controlled such that temperature of heating roller <b>248</b> attains to an appropriate temperature for fixing. When operational mode is changed to the energy saving mode, power supply to the heater is, for example, stopped or reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At a position of connection between main feeding path <b>236</b> and reverse feeding path <b>238</b>, a separation pawl <b>244</b> is arranged. When printing is done only on one side of the sheet of recording paper, separation pawl <b>244</b> is so positioned that the sheet of recording paper fed from fixing device <b>234</b> is guided to paper discharge tray <b>246</b> or a paper discharge unit <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When printing is done on both sides of the sheet of recording paper, separation pawl <b>244</b> is turned to a prescribed direction, so that the sheet of recording paper is guided to reverse feeding path <b>238</b>. The sheet of recording paper passes through reverse feeding path <b>238</b>, turned upside-down and again fed to main feeding path <b>236</b>, and while it is again fed along main feeding path <b>236</b>, printing is done on its rear surface, and thereafter the sheet is guided to paper discharge tray <b>246</b> or to paper discharge unit <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The sheet of recording paper printed in the above-described manner is guided to paper discharge tray <b>246</b> or to paper discharge unit <b>108</b>, and discharged to paper discharge tray <b>246</b> or to any of paper discharge trays <b>110</b> of paper discharge unit <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Paper discharge unit <b>108</b> may perform a process of sorting a plurality of printed sheets of paper to be output to different discharge trays <b>110</b>, a process of punching each sheet of recording paper or a process of stapling the sheets of recording paper.

By comparing the display position of the selection button and the position where the touch-panel <b>134</b> is pressed using a program, selection of an operational mode, setting of a function, and instruction of an operation of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> become possible. In addition to such a touch operation (command input operation based on the position of pressing by the user), image forming apparatus <b>100</b> also allows gesture operation (command input operation based on trajectory of operation by the user) as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Pilot lamp <b>142</b> of display operation unit <b>140</b> is, for example, an LED (Light Emitting Diode). It is turned on/off (/flickered) under the control of CPU <b>300</b>. When the user presses power key <b>144</b> provided separate from a main power switch, image forming apparatus <b>100</b> makes a transition from a standby mode (in which, for example, only the FAX receiving operation is possible with the main power on) to a normal mode, and pilot lamp <b>142</b> is turned and kept on. If a predetermined time passes without any user operation, or if the user presses energy-saving key <b>146</b>, image forming apparatus <b>100</b> makes a transition from the normal mode to the energy saving mode, and pilot lamp <b>142</b> flickers. Further, if the user presses energy-saving key <b>146</b> in the energy saving mode, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> makes a transition from the energy saving mode to the normal mode. Home key <b>148</b> is a hardware key for returning the display of display <b>130</b> to the initial state (home screen image).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Image forming apparatus <b>100</b> in accordance with the present embodiment includes the four operational modes (copy mode, facsimile mode, document filing mode and mail mode) as described above.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">[Layout of Copy Basic Screen Image]</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a basic layout in the copy mode operation (referred to as a &#x201c;copy basic screen image&#x201d;) <b>510</b> on display <b>130</b>. The copy basic screen image <b>510</b> is first displayed when the copy mode is selected. One characteristic of the present embodiment is that, basically, preview is possible in all screen images including the copy basic screen image. Similar image preview can be selected at the time of facsimile transmission, image transmission by mail or image filing. In any of these operational modes, basic screen image configuration related to preview display is the same. Therefore, in the following, only the copy basic screen image will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, let us consider display <b>130</b> of landscape layout (for example, width of 1024 pixels&#xd7;length of 600 pixels). System area <b>400</b> is arranged at the uppermost portion, and preview area <b>480</b> is arranged at the center, of the screen image. On the left side of preview area <b>480</b>, function selecting area <b>410</b> for setting a function and confirming the contents of function is arranged. On the upper right side of preview area <b>480</b>, an area referred to as an action panel area (herein after referred to as &#x201c;action panel area <b>482</b>&#x201d;) is arranged. On a lower right side of preview area <b>480</b>, task trigger area <b>484</b> is arranged. These areas have their sizes changed in accordance with the preview display modes, as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">On system area <b>400</b>, the current state of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is displayed and, in addition, the title of operational mode that is being operated and status/state of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> are displayed. By way of example, on system area <b>400</b>, an operational mode name, an interruption key, a log-in user name, status of a currently processed job, state of use of an internal memory, time and the like are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">On function selecting area <b>410</b>, a function selection menu (icons, buttons, setting items screen image, and a function list screen image) to be operated by the user for setting each function, switching display and confirming setting, is displayed. These are for setting conditions of data conversion and conditions at the time of executing a task, on the image data of the document. On function selecting area <b>410</b>, a group of functional icons <b>512</b> and a group of texts <b>514</b> describing the function of each functional icon are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In preview area <b>480</b>, an image of expected document output (finished form) is displayed. Every time the user designates the manner of finish, the image displayed on preview area <b>480</b> changes. At the time of reading, the read document image is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Preview area <b>480</b> includes a group of preview change buttons at a lower portion, for changing display style of preview area <b>480</b>. The group of preview change buttons includes: a rotation button for rotating the preview by a desired angle; a zoom bar for enlarging/reducing the preview image; a document display mode button <b>452</b> instructing change to a document display mode, as will be described later; a finish preview button <b>454</b> instructing a change to a finish preview screen image; and a fit-to-screen button <b>456</b> instructing a change to the fit-to-screen mode. At an upper right portion of preview area <b>480</b>, an image edition button <b>468</b> is arranged, for instructing a change to an image edition mode allowing edition of documents.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">If the number of pages of document images to be displayed on preview area <b>480</b> is large, a page selection button (page number input button, page feed button, page return button, single page display button, plural page display button and the like), not shown, is displayed. When the document image displayed on preview area <b>480</b> is flicked, the document page can be fed forward or backward. If the document image displayed on preview area <b>480</b> is large, a scroll bar that can be touch-operated or gesture-operated is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">On action panel area <b>482</b>, pieces of information related to assistance, guidance and suggestion related to the operation are displayed. If, for instance, a user selects a specific function, on action panel area <b>482</b>, functions related to the selected function may be displayed. Other functions related to the same object of the selected function may be displayed. Further, functions selected in the past by the user or a user of a group to which the user belongs in relation to the selected function may be displayed as &#x201c;recommended functions.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">On the left side of action panel area <b>482</b>, an action panel reducing button <b>486</b> is displayed, which is operated by the user when action panel area <b>482</b> is to be displayed in reduced size. When action panel reducing button <b>486</b> is pressed, action panel area <b>482</b> is reduced in size and displayed in the form of buttons on the right side of the screen image. When the button is pressed, action panel area <b>482</b> is again displayed in the enlarged size. Specifically, the user can reduce or enlarge the action panel area <b>482</b> by pressing the button. Accordingly, the preview area <b>480</b> is enlarged or reduced. Confirmation of preview image and confirmation of operation hints can be done easily in accordance with the user's intention.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In task trigger area <b>484</b>, items (software buttons as one type of UI components) as triggers for starting certain processes of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> are displayed. These items are displayed when all settings are completed in a certain operational mode and image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is ready to operate actually. By way of example, on task trigger area <b>484</b>, a read start button, a monochrome copy start button, a color copy start button and a clear-all button (CA) are displayed. The read start button is a button for starting a process for once reading a document and providing a preview in copying or FAX transmission. The monochrome copy start button is a button for starting a process for reading a document and immediately forming a monochrome image thereof on a sheet of recording paper, or for starting the process of forming a monochrome image on a sheet of recording paper based on once read image. The color copy start button is similarly a button for starting the process of immediately forming a color image of the document, or for starting the process of forming a color image on a sheet of recording paper based on once read image. The clear-all button is a button for clearing all pieces of input information. When the clear-all button is pressed at the time of document reading, all documents that have been read are cleared, and the screen image returns to the copy initial screen image.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the present embodiment, when a button alternately takes two functions, the button color is changed depending on whether the functions are similar to or different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, using a color circle <b>530</b>, the manner of determining button color will be described. In color circle <b>530</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, hue is divided into twenty (<b>20</b>) blocks of color <b>540</b>, . . . , <b>578</b>. Each block represents one hue. In color circle <b>530</b>, colors opposite to each other with the center of the circle positioned in-between are complementary colors. By way of example, color <b>540</b> and color <b>560</b> are complementary to each other. In color circle <b>530</b>, colors that are complementary colors to each other are denoted by hatchings in line symmetry. In color circle <b>530</b>, colors adjacent to each other (for example, colors <b>540</b> and <b>542</b>, colors <b>540</b> and <b>578</b>) are referred to as analogous colors.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Color circle <b>530</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes colors arranged divided into 20 blocks. It is noted that the number of blocks forming the color circle is not limited to 20 but may be 8, 40 or others, and the manner of division is not fixed. Originally, the color circle arranges hues that change continuously on a circle, and division into blocks is not absolutely necessary. Therefore, definition of an analogous color poses a problem. In the present embodiment, colors commonly encompassed in a sector arc formed by a certain central angle &#x3b1; of the color circle as defined, for example, by lines <b>580</b> and <b>582</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> will be referred to as analogous colors. Specific manner is as follows. It is difficult to determine the central angle &#x3b1; in a single and uniform way, since it defines the range of analogous colors and whether the colors are analogous depends on one's sense. Here, for a certain color on the color circle, a color included in a sector arc having the central angle of &#x3b1;=45&#xb0;, as represented by mutually intersecting lines <b>580</b> and <b>582</b> will be referred to as an analogous color to the certain color. Outside this range, it is difficult to feel the color is analogous. Considering such a definition, it may be desirable not to limit a complementary color of a certain color to the strict complementary color, but to include a color that is positioned opposite to the certain color on the continuous color circle (that is, the strict complementary color) and the analogous color thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the present embodiment, if a button alternately assumes two functions, the button color is changed to mutually analogous colors if the functions are similar to each other, and the button color is changed to mutually complementary colors or colors analogous to the complementary color if the functions are different. In the following, transition of button display colors will be described specifically with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, at the time of document reading, the display on task trigger area <b>484</b> changes in the following manner. With reference to the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, on task trigger area <b>484</b>, read start button <b>600</b>, clear-all button <b>602</b>, monochrome copy start button <b>604</b> and color copy start button <b>606</b> are displayed as described above. These are displayed at positions different from each other and not overlapping with each other. Based on the color circle <b>530</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the colors of respective buttons are as follows. The background portion of read start button <b>600</b> is color <b>574</b>; the background portion of clear-all button <b>602</b> is yellow (before the start of reading, clear-all button <b>602</b> is not usable and, therefore, it is grayed out); the background portion of monochrome copy start button <b>604</b> is color <b>540</b>; and the background portion of color copy start button <b>606</b> is color <b>548</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Assume, for example, that the user pressed read start button <b>600</b> for reading a document. During reading, the task trigger area <b>484</b> is as shown at the center of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Specifically, read start button <b>600</b> is changed to read stop key <b>610</b>. Read stop key <b>610</b> and read start button <b>600</b> are displayed at the same position in the same size and same shape. Therefore, when these two were superposed, background portions of these would be substantially superposed. The function of read stop key is to stop reading. Therefore, the function of read stop key <b>610</b> is just the opposite of the function of read start button <b>600</b>. The background of read stop key <b>610</b> is displayed in color <b>554</b>, which is complementary to the display color <b>574</b> of the background of read start button <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">When reading ends, an additional read key <b>612</b> is displayed in place of read stop key <b>610</b>. The function of additional read key <b>612</b> is to read a document image in addition to the document read immediately before, and to save the images as continuous document images. This function may be regarded as a function of resuming the process of which execution is started by pressing read start button <b>600</b>, once the process is completed. These functions are similar to each other. Therefore, additional read key <b>612</b> is displayed in color <b>576</b>, which is different from but analogous to the color <b>574</b> of read start button <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As described above, if the function of a button displayed at the same position in the same shape is changed to a function of opposite nature, the button comes to be displayed in a color very much different from the original color, and if the function is changed to a similar function, the button is displayed not in the same color but in an analogous color. As a result, the user can easily and intuitively know how the function of the button has been changed (whether it is changed to a different function or to a similar function).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows display transitions of task trigger area <b>484</b> at the time of facsimile transmission. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, at the start of facsimile transmission, on task trigger area, read start button <b>600</b>, clear-all button <b>602</b> and transmission start button <b>620</b> are displayed. In the present embodiment, transmission start button <b>620</b> is displayed in color <b>544</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, clear-all button <b>602</b> is grayed out.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When the user operates transmission start button <b>620</b>, facsimile transmission starts. Here, as shown at the center of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, read start button <b>600</b> becomes inoperable and grayed-out. Further, in place of transmission start button <b>620</b>, a transmission stop button <b>622</b> is displayed at the same position and in the same shape. Transmission stop button <b>622</b> is to stop transmission, and it has a function opposite to the function of transmission start button <b>620</b>. Therefore, in the present embodiment, transmission stop button <b>622</b> is displayed in color <b>564</b>, which is a complementary color to color <b>544</b> of transmission start button <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When facsimile transmission ends, read start button <b>600</b> is again becomes operable. Further, in place of transmission stop button <b>622</b>, an additional transmission button <b>624</b> is displayed at the same position and in the same shape. Additional transmission button <b>624</b> is a button operated when an additional document is to be transmitted to the same destination as the immediately preceding facsimile transmission. Specifically, the function of additional transmission button <b>624</b> is different from but similar to the function of transmission start button. Therefore, in the present embodiment, additional transmission button <b>624</b> is displayed in color <b>546</b>, which is analogous to the display color <b>544</b> of transmission start button <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, at the start of copying, on task trigger area <b>484</b>, read start button <b>600</b>, clear-all button <b>602</b>, monochrome copy start button <b>604</b> and color copy start button <b>606</b> are displayed. Here, when the user operates monochrome copy start button <b>604</b>, a copy stop button <b>630</b> is displayed in place of (superposing) monochrome copy start button <b>604</b> and color copy start button <b>606</b>. When the copy is completed, an additional monochrome copy start button <b>632</b> and an additional color copy start button <b>634</b> are displayed. Here, copy stop button <b>630</b> is displayed in color <b>560</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), which is a complementary color of display color <b>540</b> of copy start button <b>604</b>, additional monochrome copy start button <b>632</b> is displayed in color <b>578</b>, which is an analogous color of monochrome copy start button <b>604</b>, and additional color copy start button <b>634</b> is displayed in color <b>548</b>, which is an analogous color of color copy start button <b>606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The display transition of task trigger area <b>484</b> at the time of copying is not limited to the example above. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the copy ends, an additional copy button <b>640</b> may be displayed at the same position and in the same shape as copy stop button <b>630</b>, in place of additional monochrome copy start button <b>632</b> and additional color copy start button <b>634</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Here, additional copy button <b>640</b> has a function that, when operated, an additional copy is taken in the same copy mode as the initially pressed button (monochrome copy start button <b>604</b> or color copy start button <b>606</b>). It is noted, however, that the display color of this button is, in the present embodiment, a color analogous to the color of initially operated button. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, additional copy button <b>640</b> is displayed in color <b>578</b> (or <b>542</b>) analogous to the monochrome copy start button <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The same applies when the additional copy is limited to the same mode (monochrome or color) as the function of initially pressed button. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in place of additional copy button <b>640</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a monochrome additional copy button <b>650</b> is displayed. Different from additional copy button <b>640</b>, monochrome additional copy button <b>650</b> is to make an additional copy in black and white. In the same example, if color copy start button <b>606</b> is operated, the display color of copy stop key <b>660</b> is set to a complementary color to the display color of copy start button <b>606</b>, and the display color of additional color copy start button <b>662</b> displayed after the completion of copying is set to an analogous color to the display color of color copy start button <b>606</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As described above, when a certain button is replaced by a button having a very different function displayed at the same position, the button is displayed in a very much different color. When the certain button is replaced by a button having a similar function, the button is displayed in an analogous color. By such an approach, it becomes possible to easily and intuitively understand whether the function of the button displayed at the same position is different from or similar to the button displayed previously.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">&#x3c;Reading and Copy Process&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The display transitions of task trigger area <b>484</b> described above are realized by a program executed by a CPU, not shown, in UI control device <b>180</b> of display <b>130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the following, as an example of such a program, the control structure of a program for document reading and copy processing, of which display transitions are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The program is started when the user operates read start button (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) on task trigger area <b>484</b>. Before the user operation, the display of task trigger area <b>484</b> is as shown on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the program starts at step <b>700</b>, and includes step <b>700</b> of detecting a document in a tray of a document reading device, a step <b>702</b> executed if the detection of any document failed, of requesting the user to place a document on the tray and to return the control to step <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">If a document is detected at step <b>700</b>, the control proceeds to step <b>704</b>. At step <b>704</b>, as shown at the center of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, read stop key <b>610</b> is displayed in place of read start button <b>600</b>. Read stop key <b>610</b> is displayed at the same position, in the same shape and in the same size as read start button <b>600</b>. It is noted that it is displayed in a color complementary to the display color of read start button <b>600</b>, as described above. Further, at step <b>704</b>, the display of clear-all button <b>602</b> is changed from grayed-out state to the normal display, indicating that clear-all button is active. Monochrome copy start button <b>604</b> and color copy start button <b>606</b> are also in an active display state.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Thereafter, at step <b>706</b>, reading of one page of the document is executed. At this time, UI control device <b>180</b> sends a signal indicating that reading of document has been instructed, to CPU <b>300</b>. In response to the signal, CPU <b>300</b> operates document reading unit <b>102</b>, to start reading of the document. At step <b>708</b>, the read image is stored in HDD <b>302</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Thereafter, whether or not an operation to stop reading has been made is determined. Specifically, whether read stop key <b>610</b> shown at the center of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> has been pressed or not is determined. If the determination is positive, the control proceeds to step <b>718</b>. At step <b>718</b>, a document reading interruption process takes place, and the control returns to step <b>700</b>. The document reading interruption process is a process to have the overall condition of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> returned to the state immediately before the instruction of document reading (or additional reading of document) was made the last time. After step <b>718</b>, the control proceeds to step <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">If the determination at step <b>710</b> is negative, the control proceeds to step <b>712</b>. At step <b>712</b>, whether or not the CA key has been operated is determined.
