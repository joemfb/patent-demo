<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With recent increase in integration of semiconductor devices, transfer patterns for use in photolithography of a semiconductor process have rapidly become finer. In the next generation, microfabrication at 70 to 45 nm, further, microfabrication at 32 nm or less is to be demanded. Accordingly, for example, to meet the demand for microfabrication at 32 nm or less, an exposure apparatus is expected to be developed, where an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light generation system generating EUV light of a wavelength of approximately 13 nm is combined with a reduction projection reflective optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are mainly three types of EUV light generation systems, namely, a laser produced plasma (LPP) type system using plasma produced by applying a laser beam onto a target, a discharge produced plasma (DPP) type system using plasma produced by discharge, and a synchrotron radiation type system using orbital radiation.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A regenerative amplifier, a laser apparatus, and an EUV light generation system according to a first embodiment of this disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the schematic configuration of an EUV light generation system <b>1</b> of the first embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the schematic configuration of a laser apparatus <b>100</b> of the first embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the schematic configuration of a regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the EUV light generation system <b>1</b> of the first embodiment may include a semiconductor laser <b>10</b>, a semiconductor laser controller <b>18</b>, a regenerative amplifier <b>20</b>, a pre-amplifier PA, high-reflection (HR) mirrors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b>, a relay optical system R<b>1</b>, a main amplifier MA, a relay optical system R<b>2</b>, a high-reflection (HR) mirror M<b>3</b>, an off-axis paraboloidal mirror M<b>4</b>, and an EUV chamber <b>40</b>. The semiconductor laser <b>10</b> may output a pulsed laser beam in a single-longitudinal mode or in a multi-longitudinal mode. The semiconductor laser controller <b>18</b> may control the oscillation wavelength of the semiconductor laser <b>10</b> and the pulse shape (including the pulse width) of a seed beam to be outputted from the semiconductor laser <b>10</b>. The regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may amplify the seed beam outputted from the semiconductor laser <b>10</b>. The pre-amplifier PA may further amplify the amplified pulsed laser beam (hereinafter referred to as regenerative amplified pulsed laser beam). The HR mirrors M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> may guide the pulsed laser beam outputted from the pre-amplifier PA (hereinafter referred to as amplified pulsed laser beam) to the main amplifier MA. The relay optical system R<b>1</b> may increase the diameter of the amplified pulsed laser beam entering the main amplifier MA such that the diameter substantially coincides with the width of a slab amplifier in the main amplifier MA. The main amplifier MA may further amplify the amplified pulsed laser beam, of which the diameter has been increased. The relay optical system R<b>2</b> may collimate the amplified pulsed laser beam which has been amplified by the main amplifier MA. The HR mirror M<b>3</b> may guide the collimated amplified pulsed laser beam to the off-axis paraboloidal mirror M<b>4</b>. The off-axis paraboloidal mirror M<b>4</b> may reflect the collimated amplified pulsed laser beam such that the amplified pulsed laser beam is focused at a point in a predetermined region (plasma generation region P<b>1</b>) inside the EUV chamber <b>40</b>. The EUV chamber <b>40</b> may include a target supply unit (not illustrated) for supplying, to the plasma generation region P<b>1</b> where the amplified pulsed laser beam is focused, a droplet or a solid target serving as a source for generating EUV light.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The semiconductor laser <b>10</b> may include a semiconductor device <b>11</b>, a rear optical module <b>12</b>, an output coupling mirror <b>13</b>, a longitudinal-mode control actuator <b>14</b>, a longitudinal-mode controller <b>15</b>, and a current control actuator <b>16</b>. The semiconductor laser <b>10</b> may output a pulsed laser beam of a wavelength corresponding to an amplification line of the pre-amplifier PA and the main amplifier MA. The semiconductor laser <b>10</b> may oscillate a pulsed laser beam of a wavelength corresponding to one or more amplification lines of a CO<sub>2</sub>-gas gain medium C<b>20</b> to be used as a gain medium in the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b>, the pre-amplifier PA, and the main amplifier MA provided downstream of the semiconductor laser <b>10</b>. Such a semiconductor device may, for example, be configured of a quantum cascade laser (QCL).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The output coupling mirror <b>13</b> may be provided to a front side (also referred to as a beam lead-out side) of the semiconductor device <b>11</b>, and the rear optical module <b>12</b> may be provided to a rear side of the semiconductor device <b>11</b>. An optical resonator is configured of the output coupling mirror <b>13</b> and the rear optical module <b>12</b> which are arranged with the semiconductor device <b>11</b> being disposed therebetween. The longitudinal-mode controller <b>15</b> may drive the longitudinal-mode control actuator <b>14</b> in accordance with an oscillation wavelength signal S<b>1</b> outputted from the semiconductor laser controller <b>18</b> so as to move at least one of the output coupling mirror <b>13</b> and the rear optical module <b>12</b>, whereby the length of the optical resonator may be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The current control actuator <b>16</b> may control the waveform and the current (hereinafter simply referred to as current waveform) of a current signal to be inputted to the semiconductor device <b>11</b> in accordance with an oscillation pulse shape signal S<b>2</b> and a control signal S<b>3</b> outputted from the semiconductor laser controller <b>18</b>. The semiconductor device <b>11</b> may oscillate a pulsed laser beam in accordance with the current waveform controlled by the current control actuator <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">By thus using, in a master oscillator, the semiconductor device <b>11</b> of which the current can easily be controlled, the intensity and the pulse width of a pulsed laser beam outputted from the master oscillator can be controlled by the current waveform. Thus, a pulsed laser beam having desired intensity and a desired pulse width can be obtained easily. Particularly, the intensity, the pulse width, and so forth, of a pulsed laser beam outputted from the semiconductor laser <b>10</b> can be adjusted relatively freely by controlling the current control actuator <b>16</b> to adjust the current waveform inputted to the semiconductor device <b>11</b>. As a result, a pulsed laser beam having desired intensity and a desired pulse width can be obtained easily without changing the configuration of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, the configuration of the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> will be described below. The regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may include resonator mirrors <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, a slab amplifier <b>25</b>, a polarizer <b>24</b><i>a</i>, Pockels cells (EOM) <b>23</b><i>a </i>and <b>23</b><i>b</i>, and a quarter-wave plate <b>22</b>. Detailed functions and operation of the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> will be described later. The regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> can efficiently amplify a low-intensity pulsed laser (seed) beam outputted from the semiconductor device <b>11</b>. The pulsed laser beam amplified by the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may further be amplified by the pre-amplifier PA and the main amplifier MA. Then, the laser apparatus <b>100</b> may output a pulsed laser beam of such characteristics as follows. The pulsed laser beam has high pulse energy (approximately 50 to 200 mJ), a relatively short pulse width (10 to 100 ns), a high repetition rate (50 to 100 kHz), and a power of 10 to 20 kW. The pulsed laser beam outputted from the laser apparatus <b>100</b> may be reflected by the flat HR mirror M<b>3</b>, and be guided to the off-axis paraboloidal mirror M<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The EUV chamber <b>40</b> may include a window W<b>1</b> and an EUV collector mirror <b>41</b>, in addition to the above-mentioned target supply unit. The amplified pulsed laser beam reflected by the off-axis paraboloidal mirror M<b>4</b> may be introduced into the EUV chamber <b>40</b> through the window W<b>1</b>. The EUV collector mirror <b>41</b> may collect and reflect EUV light emitted from plasma generated in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b> such that the EUV light is focused at a predetermined point (intermediate focus P<b>2</b>) outside the EUV chamber <b>40</b>. The EUV collector mirror <b>41</b> may have a through-hole <b>41</b><i>a </i>through which the amplified pulsed laser beam passes, from the back side thereof, to travel toward the plasma generation region P<b>1</b>. The amplified pulsed laser beam may be reflected by the off-axis paraboloidal mirror M<b>4</b> and be focused, traveling through the window W<b>1</b> and the through-hole <b>41</b><i>a</i>, on a target supplied to the plasma generation region P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">EUV light with a desired wavelength to be used in an exposure apparatus may be emitted from the plasma generated as the target is irradiated with the amplified pulsed laser beam in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b>. As the target substance, tin (Sn) can be used, for example. In this case, Sn plasma may emit EUV light with a desired wavelength of approximately 13.5 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described above, the EUV light emitted from the plasma generated in the plasma generation region P<b>1</b> may be focused at the intermediate focus P<b>2</b> outside the EUV chamber <b>40</b>. An aperture <b>42</b> is positioned at the intermediate focus P<b>2</b>, for example. Thus, the EUV light focused at the intermediate focus P<b>2</b> may be introduced into the exposure apparatus (not shown) through the aperture <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the semiconductor laser <b>10</b>, the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b>, and an amplifier <b>30</b> which is configured of the pre-amplifier PA and the main amplifier MA shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may constitute the laser apparatus <b>100</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, a process in which an amplified pulsed laser beam is outputted in the first embodiment will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a seed beam LS outputted from the semiconductor laser <b>10</b> under the control of the semiconductor laser controller <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) may be guided into the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b>. The regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may be filled with a gain medium for amplifying the seed beam LS. As such gain medium, for example, a CO<sub>2</sub>-gas gain medium C<b>20</b> containing CO<sub>2 </sub>gas can be used. The seed beam LS having entered the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may be amplified by being reciprocated once or more times through the CO<sub>2</sub>-gas gain medium C<b>20</b> inside the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b>, and may then be outputted as a regenerative amplified pulsed laser beam L<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The regenerative amplified pulsed laser beam L<b>1</b> outputted from the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may be guided to the above-mentioned amplifier <b>30</b> configured of the pre-amplifier PA and the main amplifier MA (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the first embodiment, the regenerative amplified pulsed laser beam L<b>1</b> may be first amplified by the pre-amplifier PA, and may then be further amplified by the main amplifier MA (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). After that, the regenerative amplified pulsed laser beam L<b>1</b> having been amplified by the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may be outputted as an amplified pulsed laser beam L<b>2</b> from the amplifier <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The CO<sub>2</sub>-gas gain medium C<b>20</b> can be used as gain media in the pre-amplifier PA and in the main amplifier MA, as in the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b>. By using the same type of gain media in the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> and in the amplifier <b>30</b> disposed downstream thereof, one or more amplification lines of both the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> and the amplifier <b>30</b> can be made to coincide with each other. Thus, the pulsed laser beam can be amplified more efficiently. However, this disclosure is not limited thereto, and a regenerative amplifier and an amplifier filled with different gain media may also be combined.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The pulse width of a pulsed laser beam required of a driver laser in the LPP type system is relatively short, which is about 10 to 100 ns. Thus, the optical path length in the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may need to be increased so that a low-intensity, short-pulsed laser beam outputted from the semiconductor laser <b>10</b>, such as a QCL, with a predetermined pulse width can be amplified efficiently. For example, an optical path length L in the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> which is necessary to amplify a pulsed laser beam having a pulse width T is given by the following Expression (1):
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>L=T&#xd7;C </i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where C represents the light speed.
</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thus, for example, in order to amplify a pulsed laser beam having a pulse width T of 50 ns, the optical path length L of the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may need to be considerably long, such as 15 m (=3E<sup>8</sup>&#xd7;50&#xd7;10E<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>). Accordingly, in the first embodiment, a multipass optical path may be formed in the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b>, as will be described later. This allows a pulsed laser beam having a relatively short pulse width to be stably amplified while the size of the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> is not increased.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> of the first embodiment will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may include the quarter-wave plate <b>22</b>, the EOM <b>23</b><i>a </i>such as an electro-optic (EO) Pockels cell, the input-side polarizer <b>24</b><i>a</i>, the slab amplifier <b>25</b>, an output-side polarizer <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the EOM <b>23</b><i>b </i>such as an EO Pockels cell. These components may be arranged in that order from the resonator mirror <b>21</b><i>a </i>side on the optical path of the optical resonator configured of the resonator mirrors <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The quarter-wave plate <b>22</b> may delay one component of a pulsed laser beam (a seed beam LS to be amplified) incident thereon by 90 degrees in phase. The polarizer <b>24</b><i>a </i>may serve as a polarization beam splitter which reflects a beam incident thereon in a specific polarization state (S-polarized state in the first embodiment) and transmits a beam incident thereon in the other polarization state. The slab amplifier <b>25</b> may be filled with a CO<sub>2</sub>-gas gain medium C<b>20</b>. The polarizer <b>24</b><i>b </i>may serve as a polarization beam splitter which reflects a beam incident thereon in a specific polarization state (S-polarized state in the first embodiment) and transmits a beam incident thereon in the other polarization state. The polarizer <b>24</b><i>a</i>, the EOM <b>23</b><i>a</i>, and the quarter-wave plate <b>22</b> may, in cooperation, function as an input coupling unit for guiding the seed beam LS outputted from the semiconductor laser <b>10</b> into the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b>. The polarizer <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the EOM <b>23</b><i>b</i>, on the other hand, may, in cooperation, function as an output coupling unit for outputting a pulsed laser beam amplified by the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> as the regenerative amplified pulsed laser beam L<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> may also include a pair of concave high-reflection (HR) mirrors <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> arranged to form a multipass optical path along which the pulsed laser beam is reciprocated once or more times inside the slab amplifier <b>25</b>. That is, in the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b>, an optical path C<b>1</b> between the two resonator mirrors <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>may include a multipass C<b>2</b> formed by the concave HR mirrors <b>26</b> and <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, reflective surfaces of the concave HR mirrors <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are spherical-concave such that an image Ia of a pulsed laser beam at a certain point (first position), on the optical path C<b>1</b>, between the resonator mirror <b>21</b><i>a </i>and a pulsed-laser-beam input/output edge of the slab amplifier <b>25</b> (referred to as an incident optical image) is simply transferred as an image Ib of the pulsed laser beam at another certain point (second position), on the optical path C<b>1</b>, between the pulsed-laser-beam output/input edge of the slab amplifier <b>25</b> and the resonator mirror <b>21</b><i>b </i>(referred to as a transfer optical image). In other words, the concave HR mirrors <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> are spherical-concave such that the input-side optical image (incident optical image Ia) is simply transferred as the output-side optical image (transfer optical image Ib) through the multipass C<b>2</b> along which the pulsed laser beam is reciprocated inside the slab amplifier <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With this configuration, even when the optical path length (the length of the resonator formed by the resonator mirrors <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>) is increased by having a multipass (zigzag) optical path being formed, it is possible to prevent the beam axis of an entering pulsed laser beam and the exit position of an exiting pulsed laser beam from further deviating, dependent on the optical path length, due to the deviation of the beam axis of the entering pulsed laser beam. As a result, the laser beam can be amplified to desired intensity and to a desired pulse width, and the beam axis of the laser beam outputted from the regenerative amplifier <b>20</b> can be stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an incident optical image Ia of the pulsed laser beam at an intersection where the optical path C<b>1</b> meets a plane along the bottommost portion of the spherical-concave reflective surface of the concave HR mirror <b>27</b> to the incident side of the seed beam LS may be transferred as a transfer optical image Ib of the pulsed laser beam at an intersection where the optical path C<b>1</b> meets a plane along the bottommost portion of the spherical-concave reflective surface of the concave HR mirror <b>26</b> to the output side of the regenerative amplified pulsed laser beam L<b>1</b>. However, this disclosure is not limited to this case, and various modifications are possible.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">After that, the amplified pulsed laser beam may be outputted from the slab amplifier <b>25</b> at timing t<b>34</b>, and be reflected with high reflectivity by the polarizer <b>24</b><i>a. </i>With this, the pulsed laser beam having been subjected to multipass amplification between the resonator mirrors <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>may be outputted as the regenerative amplified pulsed laser beam L<b>1</b> from the regenerative amplifier <b>320</b> after timing t<b>35</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As described above, the pulsed laser beam having been introduced into the regenerative amplifier <b>320</b> may be subjected to multipass amplification by being reciprocated in the slab amplifier <b>25</b> while traveling between the resonator mirrors <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>constituting the optical resonator. The pulsed laser beam having been introduced into the regenerative amplifier <b>320</b> may be reciprocated between the resonator mirrors <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b </i>until it is amplified at least to desired intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As described above, in the third embodiment, an optical image (incident optical image Ia) on the input side of the multipass along which the pulsed laser beam is reciprocated inside the slab amplifier <b>25</b> may simply be transferred as an optical image (transfer optical image Ib) on the output side of the multipass. Thus, even when the optical path length is increased by having a multipass optical path being formed, it is possible to prevent the beam axis of an entering pulsed laser beam and the exit position of an exiting pulsed laser beam from further deviating, dependent on the optical path length, due to the deviation of the beam axis of the entering pulsed laser beam. As a result, the pulsed laser beam may be amplified stably, and the beam axis of the pulsed laser beam outputted from the regenerative amplifier <b>320</b> may be stabilized.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Modification</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The regenerative amplifier <b>320</b> of the third embodiment can, for example, be modified into a regenerative amplifier <b>320</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates the schematic configuration of the regenerative amplifier <b>320</b>A of the modification. In the regenerative amplifier <b>320</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a quarter-wave plate <b>22</b> may be provided right next to a resonator mirror <b>21</b><i>b</i>. Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the incident angle of the seed beam LS on the regenerative amplifier <b>320</b>A may not necessarily be perpendicular to an optical path C<b>41</b> in the regenerative amplifier <b>320</b>A, and may be inclined to the optical axis C<b>41</b>. Since other configurations are similar to those adopted in the above-described third embodiment, detailed descriptions thereof are omitted here.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Fourth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the above-described embodiments, a single semiconductor laser <b>10</b> which may oscillate in a single-longitudinal mode or in a multi-longitudinal mode has been used as the master oscillator. In a laser apparatus <b>400</b> according to a fourth embodiment, on the other hand, a semiconductor laser <b>10</b>A may be configured of a plurality of semiconductor devices, each of which nay oscillate in a single-longitudinal mode or in a multi-longitudinal mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates the schematic configuration of the laser apparatus <b>400</b> of the fourth embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the semiconductor laser <b>10</b>A may include semiconductor devices <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>11</b>-<b>3</b>, a resonator similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a controller, and so forth. Each of the semiconductor devices <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>11</b>-<b>3</b> can independently oscillate a laser beam with a predetermined wavelength, intensity, and pulse width. The semiconductor laser <b>10</b>A may further include a beam combiner <b>17</b> for combining seed beams LS<b>1</b> through LS<b>3</b> outputted from the semiconductor devices <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>11</b>-<b>3</b>, respectively. Thus, the seed beams are combined and the combined laser beam is amplified. Thus, a desired seed beam LS can be outputted and amplified, and an optimal laser condition for EUV light generation can easily be achieved even if a target or an irradiation condition is to be changed. Other configurations are similar to those adopted in any of the above-described embodiments; thus, detailed descriptions thereof are omitted here.</p>

This disclosure, however, is not limited thereto.
