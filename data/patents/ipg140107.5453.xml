<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to methods for updating an electronic calendar in a vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Business owners and their employers often use electronic calendars to keep track of scheduled appointments, enabling them to maintain organization of the business. These calendars may be local on a particular electronic device, such as on a personal computer, a laptop notebook, or a netbook, to name a few. In some cases, the electronic calendar may also be synched with other mobile devices such as, e.g., mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDA's), and/or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A method for updating an electronic calendar in a vehicle involves uploading an appointment to the electronic calendar, where the appointment includes a description of an event, a time block for the event, and a travel time preceding the time block.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Example(s) of the method disclosed herein enable a user to update an electronic calendar in a vehicle. The updated calendar includes one or more scheduled appointments, each having associated therewith pre- and post-event appointment information. The pre-event appointment information includes, for example, information pertaining to a corresponding scheduled appointment. As used herein, a &#x201c;scheduled appointment&#x201d; or an &#x201c;appointment&#x201d; is a date, a meeting, and/or an event that is arranged for in advance. In a non-limiting example, the pre-event appointment information includes a description of an event for which the appointment was scheduled, a time block for the event (i.e., a known or expected duration of the event), and a travel time preceding the time block (i.e., an anticipated amount of time that it will take to travel to the location at which the event is to occur). The scheduled appointment also has associated therewith an alert that, when triggered, advantageously reminds or otherwise notifies the user of the appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The post-event appointment information includes, for example, information pertaining to what happened after the starting time of the event. The post-event information includes at least one of i) an indication that a reminder alert was activated (which may be interpreted by one reviewing the calendar as a confirmation that the one or more of the vehicle occupants attended the scheduled appointment), or ii) an indication that the reminder alert was not activated (which may be interpreted by one reviewing the calendar as an indication that none of the vehicle occupants attended the scheduled appointment). For example, if the scheduled appointment is a dinner reservation at Restaurant X at 5:00 pm on Friday, and a reminder alert was not triggered, the post-event information uploaded to the calendar may indicate, in some form, that the vehicle occupant(s) did not attend the dinner at Restaurant X at 5:00 pm on Friday or that the vehicle occupant(s) may have attended the dinner at Restaurant X at a later time (e.g., at 5:30 pm).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The pre- and post-event appointment information that is uploaded to the electronic calendar may advantageously be used by an individual as a means for reminding the individual of up-coming appointments. For example, if Mr. X scheduled an appointment to stop at the grocery store on his way home from work on Monday, an alert may be triggered at some point along Mr. X's normal route home reminding him that he needs to stop at the grocery store. If the alert was activated, Mr. X's wife (who has authorized access to Mr. X's calendar) may review post-event information uploaded to the calendar indicating that the alert was triggered and that Mr. X did likely stop at the grocery store on the way home.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The pre- and post-event information may also advantageously be used in a similar manner by a fleet manager, supervisor, owner, or the like for tracking vehicles that are members of a fleet. The fleet manager may, for instance, review the pre- and post-event information uploaded to the electronic calendar of one or more drivers of particular vehicles to determine whether or not the drivers attended one or more of their scheduled appointments. The fleet manager may use the post-event information contained in the electronic calendars of the drivers to promote management and/or organization of the fleet, as well as to determine a habit of one or more drivers that tend to miss or otherwise skip certain scheduled appointments. When a calendar is designated for a specific vehicle rather than a specific driver, the fleet manager can track the vehicle's habits and then can link these habits to one or more drivers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is to be understood that, in some examples of the method disclosed herein, the term &#x201c;user&#x201d; refers to a vehicle owner, operator, and/or passenger, and such term may be used interchangeably with the term subscriber/service subscriber. In instances where the examples of the method described below involve a single person such as a vehicle owner, operator, or the like, the &#x201c;user&#x201d; may be referred to as an individual. It is further to be understood that the term &#x201c;user&#x201d; may, in other examples of the method, refer to a manager, supervisor, owner or other authoritative figure in a position to manage or otherwise control a vehicle fleet.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, the terms &#x201c;connect/connected/connection&#x201d; and/or the like are broadly defined herein to encompass a variety of divergent connected arrangements and assembly techniques. These arrangements and techniques include, but are not limited to (1) the direct communication between one component and another component with no intervening components therebetween; and (2) the communication of one component and another component with one or more components therebetween, provided that the one component being &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; the other component is somehow in operative communication with the other component (notwithstanding the presence of one or more additional components therebetween).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Also, the term &#x201c;communication&#x201d; is to be construed to include all forms of communication, including direct and indirect communication. As such, indirect communication may include communication between two components with additional component(s) located therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one non-limiting example of a system <b>10</b> for updating an electronic calendar in a vehicle is shown. The system <b>10</b> may include a vehicle <b>12</b> owned and/or operated by an individual, or may include a plurality of vehicles <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; that are members of a vehicle fleet. Each of the vehicles <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; includes a telematics unit <b>14</b>. The system <b>10</b> further includes a carrier/communication system <b>16</b> (including, but not limited to, one or more cell towers <b>18</b>, one or more base stations <b>19</b> and/or mobile switching centers (MSCs) <b>20</b>, one or more service providers (such as the service provider <b>90</b>)), one or more land networks <b>22</b>, and one or more telematics service call/data centers <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an example, the carrier/communication system <b>16</b> is a two-way radio frequency communication system, and may be configured with a web service supporting system-to-system communications (e.g., communications between the call center <b>24</b> and the service provider <b>90</b>). The carrier/communication system <b>16</b> may also or otherwise be configured with a front-end human-machine interface (HMI, e.g., a webpage) that a user may interact with, for example, to sign up for services, request services, change a service plan, record or enter an alert or prompt, or the like. In this instance, the carrier/communication system <b>16</b> would also include a host server <b>94</b> including suitable computer equipment (not shown) upon which information of a remotely accessible page <b>96</b> (e.g., a webpage, an Internet enabled program, or the like) resides/is stored. Further details of the remotely accessible page <b>96</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The overall architecture, setup and operation, as well as many of the individual components of the system <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are generally known in the art. Thus, the following paragraphs provide a brief overview of one example of the system <b>10</b>. It is to be understood, however, that additional components and/or other systems not shown here could employ the method(s) disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Vehicles <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; are mobile vehicles, such as motorcycles, cars, trucks, recreational vehicles (RV), boats, planes, etc., and are equipped with suitable hardware and software that enables them to communicate (e.g., transmit and/or receive voice and data communications) over the carrier/communication system <b>16</b>. It is to be understood that the vehicles <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; may also include additional components suitable for use in the telematics unit <b>14</b>. As mentioned above, the vehicles <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; may be individually owned, or may be owned by a business that uses a number of vehicles (i.e., a vehicle fleet) in operation in their ordinary course of business.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Some of the vehicle hardware <b>26</b> is shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, including the telematics unit <b>14</b> and other components that are operatively connected to the telematics unit <b>14</b>. While the vehicle hardware <b>26</b> is shown as being operatively disposed in the vehicle <b>12</b>, it is to be understood that each vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; has vehicle hardware <b>26</b> disposed therein as well. Examples of such other hardware <b>26</b> components include a microphone <b>28</b>, a speaker <b>30</b> and buttons, knobs, switches, keyboards, and/or controls <b>32</b>. Generally, these hardware <b>26</b> components enable a user to communicate with the telematics unit <b>14</b> and any other system <b>10</b> components in communication with the telematics unit <b>14</b>. It is to be understood that the vehicle <b>12</b> may also include additional components suitable for use in, or in connection with, the telematics unit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Operatively coupled to the telematics unit <b>14</b> is a network connection or vehicle bus <b>34</b>. Examples of suitable network connections include a controller area network (CAN), a media oriented system transfer (MOST), a local interconnection network (LIN), an Ethernet, and other appropriate connections such as those that conform with known ISO, SAE, and IEEE standards and specifications, to name a few. The vehicle bus <b>34</b> enables the vehicle <b>12</b> to send and receive signals from the telematics unit <b>14</b> to various units of equipment and systems both outside the vehicle <b>12</b> and within the vehicle <b>12</b> to perform various functions, such as unlocking a door, executing personal comfort settings, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The telematics unit <b>14</b> is an onboard vehicle dedicated communications device. The telematics unit <b>14</b> is linked to both the host server <b>94</b> and the call/data center <b>24</b>. The telematics unit <b>14</b> is capable of transmitting data to the host server <b>94</b> and is also capable of calling and transmitting data to the call/data center <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The telematics unit <b>14</b> provides a variety of services, both individually and through its communication with the call/data center <b>24</b>. The call/data center <b>24</b> includes at least one facility that is owned and operated by the telematics service provider. The telematics unit <b>14</b> generally includes an electronic processing device <b>36</b> operatively coupled to one or more types of electronic memory <b>38</b>, a cellular chipset/component <b>40</b>, a wireless modem <b>42</b>, a navigation unit containing a location detection (e.g., global positioning system (GPS)) chipset/component <b>44</b>, a real-time clock (RTC) <b>46</b>, a short-range wireless communication network <b>48</b> (e.g., a BLUETOOTH&#xae; unit), a dual antenna <b>50</b>, a recorder <b>91</b>, a text-to-speech unit <b>89</b>, and, in some instances, a speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>. In one example, the wireless modem <b>42</b> includes a computer program and/or set of software routines executing within processing device <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is to be understood that the telematics unit <b>14</b> may be implemented without one or more of the above listed components, such as, for example, the short-range wireless communication network <b>48</b>. It is to be further understood that telematics unit <b>14</b> may also include additional components and functionality as desired for a particular end use.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The electronic processing device <b>36</b> may be a micro controller, a controller, a microprocessor, a host processor, and/or a vehicle communications processor. In another example, electronic processing device <b>36</b> may be an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Alternatively, electronic processing device <b>36</b> may be a processor working in conjunction with a central processing unit (CPU) performing the function of a general-purpose processor. In an example, the processor <b>36</b> includes software having computer readable code for activating an alert, which is output to the vehicle occupant(s), in some form, as a reminder or notification of an up-coming appointment scheduled in the electronic calendar <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an example, the alert is a visual alert (such as a flashing light or a text message displayed on an in-vehicle display <b>80</b>), an audible alert (such as an audible message, a tone, a beep, and/or the like), both a visual and an audible alert, and/or any combination of HMI modalities (e.g., a haptic alert). The purpose of these alerts, upon activation thereof, is to notify the vehicle occupant(s) of an up-coming appointment, whereby details of the upcoming appointment may be retrieved by the vehicle occupant(s) upon accessing the calendar <b>98</b> resident on the server <b>94</b>. Access to the calendar <b>98</b> may be accomplished from inside the vehicle <b>12</b>, e.g., using a mobile device having Internet access capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As mentioned in one example, the alert may be a text-based message presented on the display <b>80</b> associated with the telematics unit <b>14</b>. This text-based message is referred to herein as a &#x201c;data alert&#x201d;, and is configured to place the vehicle occupants) on notice of an upcoming appointment and, in some cases, includes some or all of the pre-event appointment information (in the form of text) previously uploaded onto the calendar <b>98</b>. In an example, upon activating the data alert, the display <b>80</b> may output to the vehicle occupant(s), in text form, i) a notification of the appointment, ii) a description of the event, and iii) the duration of the event as scheduled in the calendar <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As mentioned in yet another example, the alert may be a voice-based or audible message that is output to the vehicle occupant(s) through the audio component <b>60</b>. The voice-based message is referred to herein as a &#x201c;voice alert&#x201d;, and may also include some or all of the pre-event appointment information previously uploaded to the calendar <b>98</b>. It is to be understood that the voice alert may be set in the telematics unit <b>14</b> by converting a data upload of the pre-event appointment information from the calendar <b>98</b> resident on the server <b>94</b> into an audible form (referred to herein as a voice upload) using the text-to-speech unit <b>89</b>. In a non-limiting example, the voice alert may include i) a voice notification of the appointment, and ii) at least the event description of the appointment from the voice upload.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The processor <b>36</b> may further include software having computer readable code for uploading a memo to the electronic calendar <b>98</b> at some predefined time after the scheduled appointment started. In an example, the memo will recite, in some form, that an alert was or was not activated. The memo may, e.g., be automatically generated by the processor <b>36</b>, and then uploaded onto the calendar <b>98</b> using the telematics unit <b>14</b> and the wireless communication system <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the location detection chipset/component <b>44</b> may include a Global Position System (GPS) receiver, a radio triangulation system, a dead reckoning position system, and/or combinations thereof. In particular, a GPS receiver provides accurate time and latitude and longitude coordinates of the vehicle <b>12</b> responsive to a GPS broadcast signal received from a GPS satellite constellation (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The cellular chipset/component <b>40</b> may be an analog, digital, dual-mode, dual-band, multi-mode and/or multi-band cellular phone. The cellular chipset-component <b>40</b> uses one or more prescribed frequencies in the 800 MHz analog band or in the 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1900 MHz and higher digital cellular bands. Any suitable protocol may be used, including digital transmission technologies such as TDMA (time division multiple access), CDMA (code division multiple access) and GSM (global system for mobile telecommunications). In some instances, the protocol may be short-range wireless communication technologies, such as BLUETOOTH&#xae;, dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), or Wi-Fi.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Also associated with electronic processing device <b>36</b> is the previously mentioned real time clock (RTC) <b>46</b>, which provides accurate date and time information to the telematics unit <b>14</b> hardware and software components that may require and/or request such date and time information. In an example, the RTC <b>46</b> may provide date and time information periodically, such as, for example, every ten milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As mentioned above, the vehicle <b>12</b> further includes the speech-to-text unit <b>88</b> operatively associated with the telematics unit <b>14</b>. The speech-to-text unit <b>88</b> includes speech recognition software and is in operative communication with a recorder <b>91</b> (described below). In one example, when a user wishes to record speech (such as to create or respond to a post-event memo), he/she presses an in-vehicle button to initiate the recorder <b>91</b>. In response to an in-vehicle prompt that the recorder <b>91</b> is recording (e.g., an audible beep or a blinking light), the user speaks, and the recorder <b>91</b> records the user's utterance(s). The recorded utterance(s) is/are then transmitted to the speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>, and the speech recognition software of the unit <b>88</b> is configured to convert the recorded utterance(s) into corresponding text. This text may be uploaded from the telematics unit <b>14</b> to the electronic calendar <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another example, the recorder <b>91</b> is a component of the telematics unit <b>14</b>, and the speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>&#x2032; is located at the call center <b>24</b> (as shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In these instances, the user may activate the recorder <b>91</b> as previously described, and when the recording is complete, the telematics unit <b>14</b> may be configured to initiate communication with the call center <b>24</b> to transfer the recording to the off-board speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>&#x2032;. A voice channel or packet data may be used to transmit the recorded data. Once the recording is transmitted to the speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>&#x2032;, the speech recognition software converts the recorded utterance(s) into corresponding text, and the text may be uploaded from the call/data center <b>24</b> to the electronic calendar <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an example, the telematics unit <b>14</b> also includes a text-to-speech unit <b>89</b> that converts the text of, e.g., pre-event information of a calendar appointment into an audible format. The text-to-speech unit <b>89</b> utilizes one or more data translation algorithms to translate or otherwise convert digital signals of the text (which is in the form of phonetic data) into an audible, human-understandable form. The audio form of the message may, for example, be played back to the user through speakers <b>30</b>&#x2032; of the audio component <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The telematics unit <b>14</b> provides numerous services alone or in conjunction with the call/data center <b>24</b>, some of which may not be listed herein, and is configured to fulfill one or more user or subscriber requests. Several examples of such services include, but are not limited to: turn-by-turn directions and other navigation-related services provided in conjunction with the GPS based chipset/component <b>44</b>; airbag deployment notification and other emergency or roadside assistance-related services provided in connection with various crash and or collision sensor interface modules <b>52</b> and sensors <b>54</b> located throughout the vehicle <b>12</b>; and infotainment-related services where music, Web pages, movies, television programs, videogames and/or other content is downloaded by an infotainment center <b>56</b> operatively connected to the telematics unit <b>14</b> via vehicle bus <b>34</b> and audio bus <b>58</b>. In one non-limiting example, downloaded content is stored (e.g., in memory <b>38</b>) for current or later playback.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Again, the above-listed services are by no means an exhaustive list of all the capabilities of telematics unit <b>14</b>, but are simply an illustration of some of the services that the telematics unit <b>14</b> is capable of offering. It is to be understood that when such services are obtained from the call/data center <b>24</b>, the telematics unit <b>14</b> is considered to be operating in a telematics service mode.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Vehicle communications generally utilize radio transmissions to establish a voice channel with carrier system <b>16</b> such that both voice and data transmissions may be sent and received over the voice channel. Vehicle communications are enabled via the cellular chipset/component <b>40</b> for voice communications and the wireless modem <b>42</b> for data transmission. In order to enable successful data transmission over the voice channel, wireless modem <b>42</b> applies some type of encoding or modulation to convert the digital data so that it can communicate through a vocoder or speech codec incorporated in the cellular chipset/component <b>40</b>. It is to be understood that any suitable encoding or modulation technique that provides an acceptable data rate and bit error may be used with the examples disclosed herein. Generally, dual mode antenna <b>50</b> services the location detection chipset/component <b>44</b> and the cellular chipset/component <b>40</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The call/data center <b>24</b> of the telematics service provider is designed to provide the vehicle hardware <b>26</b> with a number of different system back-end functions. According to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the call/data center <b>24</b> generally includes one or more switches <b>68</b>, servers <b>70</b>, databases <b>72</b>, live and/or automated advisors <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032;, processing equipment (or processor) <b>84</b>, as well as a variety of other telecommunication and computer equipment <b>74</b> that is known to those skilled in the art. The call/data center <b>24</b> may also include the speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>&#x2032; as mentioned above. These various telematics service provider components are coupled to one another via a network connection or bus <b>76</b>, such as one similar to the vehicle bus <b>34</b> previously described in connection with the vehicle hardware <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The processor <b>84</b>, which is often used in conjunction with the computer equipment <b>74</b>, is generally equipped with suitable software and/or programs enabling the processor <b>84</b> to accomplish a variety of call/data center <b>24</b> functions. The various operations of the call/data center <b>24</b> are carried out by one or more computers (e.g., computer equipment <b>74</b>) programmed to carry out some of the tasks of the method(s) disclosed herein. The computer equipment <b>74</b> (including computers) may include a network of servers (including server <b>70</b>) coupled to both locally stored and remote databases (e.g., database <b>72</b>) of any information processed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Switch <b>68</b>, which may be a private branch exchange (PBX) switch, routes incoming signals so that voice transmissions are usually sent to either the live advisor <b>62</b> or the automated response system <b>62</b>&#x2032;, and data transmissions are passed on to a modem or other piece of equipment (not shown) for demodulation and further signal processing. The modem preferably includes an encoder, as previously explained, and can be connected to various devices, such as the server <b>70</b> and database <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is to be appreciated that the call/data center <b>24</b> may be any central or remote facility, manned or unmanned, mobile or fixed, to or from which it is desirable to exchange voice and data communications. As such, the live advisor <b>62</b> may be physically present at the call/data center <b>24</b> or may be located remote from the call/data center <b>24</b> while communicating therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The communications network provider <b>90</b> generally owns and/or operates the carrier/communication system <b>16</b>. In an example, the communications network provider <b>90</b> is a cellular/wireless service provider (such as, for example, VERIZON WIRELESS&#xae;, AT&#x26;T&#xae;, SPRINT&#xae;, etc.). It is to be understood that, although the communications network provider <b>90</b> may have back-end equipment, employees, etc. located at the telematics service provider data/call center <b>24</b>, the telematics service provider is a separate and distinct entity from the network provider <b>90</b>. In an example, the equipment, employees, etc. of the communications network provider <b>90</b> are located remote from the data/call center <b>24</b>. The communications network provider <b>90</b> provides the user with telephone and/or Internet services, while the telematics service provider provides a variety of telematics-related services (such as, for example, those discussed hereinabove). It is to be understood that the communications network provider <b>90</b> may interact with the data/call center <b>24</b> to provide services to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">While not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is to be understood that in some instances, the telematics service provider operates the data center <b>24</b>, which receives voice or data calls, analyzes the request associated with the voice or data call, and transfers the call to an application specific call center (not shown). It is to be understood that the application specific call center may include all of the components of the data center <b>24</b>, but is a dedicated facility for addressing specific requests, needs, etc. Examples of the application specific call centers include emergency services call centers, navigation route call centers, in-vehicle function call centers, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The remotely accessible page <b>96</b> is a webpage set up and maintained by the communications network provider <b>90</b> or by a call center <b>24</b>, and the user may access the page <b>96</b> by, e.g., submitting an appropriate login and password. In an example, the remotely accessible page <b>96</b> enables a user or another authorized person to access the electronic calendar <b>98</b> for scheduling appointments, uploading pre-event appointment information associated with the appointments, and/or to view post-event appointment information of one or more past appointments. As will be described in further detail below, the user (such as an individual vehicle owner, a fleet manager and/or owner, etc.) signs up to utilize the remotely accessible page <b>96</b> to access/manage the electronic calendar <b>98</b>. Upon registering, the user is given an initial password and login ID, both of which may be customized by the user after the initial registration process is complete. An account is set up for the user, which may include a name and/or company name associated with the account, contact information, billing information, etc. The subscriber can enroll via one of several methods. As one example, the subscriber can enroll through a website associated with the remotely accessible page <b>96</b>, which may or may not be part of a more comprehensive website associated with the call/data center <b>24</b>. Another example involves placing a voice call to the call/data center <b>24</b>, and speaking with an advisor <b>62</b>. The advisor <b>62</b> may enroll the user through computer access to the subscriber's account information.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an example, the remotely accessible page <b>96</b> may include a homepage (not shown) including enrollment boxes, and login and ID boxes that enable the user (or the advisor <b>62</b>) to access his/her account. The homepage may also include convenient drop-down options for the user for easy access to the user's electronic calendar <b>98</b>. The remotely accessible page <b>96</b> may be available 24 hours per day and 7 days per week, which allows the user flexibility with updating his/her calendar <b>98</b> and a manager flexibility with tracking employee's calendars <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When a fleet manager, owner, supervisor, or the like signs up, he/she registers all of the vehicles in the fleet (such as the vehicles <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In an example, registering the vehicles <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; includes inputting vehicle ID numbers, the make and model of each vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033;, the region in which a respective vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; will be used, etc. In an example, the fleet owner may also register other users that are authorized to access the account (including the other users' names, ID numbers, etc.), as well as designate any desirable parameters for the calendar <b>98</b>. For example, one calendar <b>98</b> may be set up for an entire fleet and/or one calendar may be associated with each driver in the fleet and/or one calendar may be associated with a particular fleet vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; (regardless of who the driver is). As one example, the fleet owner may assign each member of his/her team a login and password so that each member can assess his/her individual calendar <b>98</b> without accessing another's calendar <b>98</b> or general account information. Each member of the fleet may then access his/her calendar <b>98</b> from one or more electronic devices (such as, e.g., a personal computer, a netbook, a laptop notebook, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, and/or the like). As another example, the fleet owner may assign each vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; a calendar <b>98</b>, and each member of his/her team a login and password so that each member can assess the vehicle calendars <b>98</b>. Each member of the fleet may access the calendars <b>98</b> from one or more electronic devices to determine which vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; he/she is assigned to on a particular day.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The call/data center <b>24</b> may also be given access to the calendar(s) <b>98</b> once the user (e.g., the individual, fleet owner, etc.) has i) subscribed for services associated with the call/data center <b>24</b>, and ii) has agreed that the call/data center <b>24</b> may have access. As an example, when a fleet owner signs up a plurality of vehicles (e.g., vehicles <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033;) for telematics related services through the call/data center <b>24</b>, each vehicle user in his/her fleet will have access to his/her own calendar <b>98</b> on the remotely accessible page <b>96</b>, and will be able to utilize one or more call/data centers <b>24</b> associated with the telematics related services. Furthermore, in this example, once the fleet account is set up with the call/data center <b>24</b>, the fleet owner can enable the call/data center(s) <b>24</b> to transmit data to each electronic calendar <b>98</b> that is registered with the fleet owner's particular account.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each individual who has subscribed to the remotely accessible page <b>96</b> has access to his/her online calendar <b>98</b>. The calendar <b>98</b> may be used to keep track of appointments A, B, and C (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), examples of which include personal appointments, sales calls, client meetings, etc. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, appointments (e.g., a client meeting A at 9:00 am on Tuesday (T/D, which stands for Tuesday/Dienstag (Tuesday in German)) the 5<sup>th</sup>; a sales meeting B at 9:00 am on Thursday (T/D, which stands for Thursday/Donnerstag (Thursday in German)) the 7<sup>th</sup>; and a lunch meeting at 11:30 am on Thursday (T/D) the 7<sup>th</sup>) have been logged into appropriate cells <b>100</b> of the calendar <b>98</b> via any computer or electronic device capable of supporting and running the remotely accessible page <b>96</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the appointments A, B, and C may be shown on a monthly basis (e.g., month &#x201c;M&#x201d; of year 2010). However, it is to be understood that yearly, weekly, and daily calendar pages may also be accessed/viewed. While the calendar is shown to represent English and German languages, the language used may be any language supported by the program running the electronic calendar <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is to be understood that the calendar <b>98</b> is created/managed/updated by a user accessing the webpage <b>96</b> (as mentioned above). The calendar <b>98</b> may also be updated when a memo (indicative of the activation or non-activation of an alert) is uploaded from the telematics unit <b>14</b> or the call center processor <b>84</b>. The calendar <b>98</b> and its associated information is stored in and is resident in the server <b>94</b>. The data entered into the calendar <b>98</b> may, in some instances, also be stored in the database <b>72</b> at the call/data center <b>24</b>, and is linked to the user's profile.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Examples of the method for updating an electronic calendar <b>98</b> will be described hereinbelow in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. In one example, the electronic calendar <b>98</b> of an individual (such as a vehicle owner) is updated. In this example, the individual is registered so that he/she can access and utilize the electronic calendar <b>98</b> through the webpage <b>96</b>, as described herein. For instance, the individual accesses his/her account by submitting an acceptable login and password on a homepage of the webpage <b>96</b>, which allows the individual to gain access to his/her electronic calendar <b>98</b> stored on the server <b>94</b>. Upon accessing the calendar <b>98</b>, the individual may update the calendar <b>98</b>, e.g., by removing currently-existing appointments from the calendar <b>98</b>, adding or scheduling new appointments to the calendar <b>98</b>, and/or changing one or more terms associated with pre-event appointment information pertaining to a particular pre-existing appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an example, the individual may remove a calendar appointment by selecting the appropriate appointment cell <b>100</b>, and deleting the appointment. Deleting may be accomplished, e.g., by selecting a delete function from a menu, pressing a delete key on a keyboard, or via any function provided within the HMI of the calendar <b>98</b>. When the appointment is removed, all of the terms associated with the appointment are removed, including the pre-event appointment information, trigger(s) for activating a reminder alert, personal preferences, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When a new calendar appointment is scheduled, the individual will select to create a new appointment via, e.g., a mouse click on an appropriate icon or menu choice, and will then input (as a data upload) all of the pre-event appointment information (e.g., event description, duration, etc.) pertaining to the new appointment. If, for example, the individual wishes to make a calendar appointment for a lunch date with an associate at 12:00 pm at Restaurant Z on Wednesday the 13<sup>th</sup>, he/she may, e.g., select to create a new appointment by clicking on the appropriate icon, e.g., which directs the individual to a new screen designed to create new appointments. The individual may then input a general description of the event (in this case, lunch with the associate at Restaurant Z), the time block for the event (e.g., from 12:00 pm until 1:30 pm), and a travel time preceding the time block (e.g., if it takes about 20 minutes to travel from the individual's location prior to the event (e.g., his/her place of business or residence) to the location of Restaurant Z, then the individual may input a travel time from 11:40 am to 12:00 pm). The pre-event information may be input by typing the information into appropriate input boxes displayed on the webpage <b>96</b> (such as, e.g., the description of the event), and/or by selecting options from a drop down menu (such as, e.g., the time block for the event). The individual may thereafter select a &#x201c;SUBMIT&#x201d;, &#x201c;DONE&#x201d;, &#x201c;SAVE AND CLOSE&#x201d; or other similar button, icon, or menu choice when he/she is finished creating the appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In instances where the individual wishes to change or edit an existing calendar appointment, he/she may access the existing appointment (via, e.g., a mouse click on the appropriate appointment cell <b>100</b> displayed on the electronic calendar <b>98</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and select the input boxes that he/she wishes to change/edit. If, for example, the lunch date for Restaurant Z was changed to Restaurant Y, the individual may click on the appointment, the event description input box, and then edit the event description to recite something similar to &#x201c;Lunch date at Restaurant Y&#x201d;. Upon accepting the change (which may be accomplished, e.g., by a mouse click on the &#x201c;DONE&#x201d; or &#x201c;SUBMIT&#x201d; button as mentioned above), the edited event description is uploaded to the electronic calendar <b>98</b> and saved therein.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Removing, scheduling, or editing an appointment may also be accomplished by placing a voice call to the call/data center <b>24</b>, and submitting a request to remove, schedule, or edit an appointment during the voice call. In this case, the voice call may be received at the switch <b>68</b>, which routes the call to an appropriate division of the data/call center <b>24</b>. In instances where the call/data center <b>24</b> is a data center, then the switch <b>68</b> may route the call to an appropriate application specific call center. In any event, the advisor <b>62</b> associated with the appropriate division (or call center) will authenticate the caller (e.g., by having the caller correctly answer one or more challenge questions), and will then update the calendar <b>98</b> according to the caller's request. For instance, the advisor <b>62</b> may access the individual's electronic calendar <b>98</b> via the webpage <b>96</b>, and perform the updating using the webpage <b>96</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The webpage <b>96</b> may also be used (directly by the individual or by the call/data center <b>24</b>) to designate an alert for one or more of the calendar <b>98</b> appointments. The alert may be a pre-selected visual or audio alert that is output within the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; upon recognition of a trigger associated with the alert. The individual may also select the trigger(s) that is/are to be associated with a particular appointment and to instruct the telematics unit to actuate the alert. As used herein, the term &#x201c;trigger&#x201d; refers to an incident that, upon occurrence thereof, prompts the telematics unit <b>14</b> to activate the alert. Triggers may be set by the individual user via the webpage <b>96</b> (and thus can be altered or revised), or may be set by a fleet owner/manager via the webpage <b>96</b> and may not be overridden by an individual driver. Once a trigger is set, it is sent to the telematics unit <b>14</b> that is linked to the calendar <b>98</b>. When the calendar <b>98</b> is associated with a particular user, the trigger can be sent to any vehicle telematics unit <b>14</b> that is located in a vehicle <b>12</b> identified in the user's profile. When the calendar <b>98</b> is associated with multiple users but a single vehicle <b>12</b>, the trigger can be sent to the telematics unit <b>14</b> of the single vehicle <b>12</b>. The trigger(s) can be sent at any time that the telematics unit <b>14</b> of the identified vehicle <b>12</b> is in an ON state. The webpage <b>96</b> or the call/data center <b>24</b> if managing the webpage <b>96</b> will automatically ping the vehicle <b>12</b> to transmit the trigger (in the form of packet data) to the telematics unit <b>14</b> for storage therein.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The triggers may be associated with a time of a particular appointment and/or may be associated with a position of the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033;. The individual or fleet owner/manager may designate a time that occurs prior to the event/appointment time as the trigger. More particularly, the trigger may be the recognition that the then-current time is 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc. prior to the start of an event/appointment stored in the calendar <b>98</b>. For example, if the scheduled appointment is at 11:00 am and the trigger is 30 minutes prior to the start of the appointment, at 10:30, the telematics unit <b>14</b> (if in an ON state) will recognize the set trigger and will activate the alert about the appointment within the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, and/or <b>12</b>&#x2033;. In another example, the time-based trigger may be set to &#x201c;X&#x201d; number of minutes before the vehicle's arrival to a particular destination. &#x201c;X&#x201d; would be set when the trigger is set, and would be estimated during travel via downloaded directions with estimated travel times.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The individual or fleet owner/manager may designate a predefined geographic boundary (identified by reference numeral <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) as the trigger. More particularly, the trigger may be the recognition that the then-current vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; position coincides with or falls within the set geographic boundary <b>120</b>. For example, when the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; enters the set geographic boundary, the telematics unit <b>14</b> will recognize the set trigger and will activate the alert associated with the trigger within the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, and/or <b>12</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates multiple examples of the geographic boundary <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;&#x2032;. In one example, the geographic boundary <b>120</b> is constructed around a location at which the event described in the calendar appointment is to occur, and the alert is automatically activated when the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; enters the geographic boundary <b>120</b>. If, for example, the electronic calendar <b>98</b> includes an appointment for a lunch date at Restaurant X (identified by reference character &#x201c;X&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), the geographic boundary <b>120</b> may, for instance, be defined by a circular (or other geometric) boundary with X as the center point and a predefined radius &#x201c;r&#x201d;. This type of geographic boundary <b>120</b> may be desirable when the route to be taken may not be known in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another example, the geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2032; is defined by all or a portion of a road segment <b>114</b> or an intersection I near the location of Restaurant X. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; turns onto the road segment <b>114</b> off of road segment <b>110</b>, the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; is within the geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2032;, and the alert will be automatically activated by the telematics unit <b>14</b>. This type of geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2032; may be desirable when the route to be taken is known in advance. While the intersection I is used as the geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2032; in this example, it is to be understood that any road segment and/or intersection (for example, the intersection of segments <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>) may be used as the geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another example, the geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2033; may be defined by an exit ramp off of a highway or other major road segment, such as highway M shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this example, the telematics unit <b>14</b> may activate the alert if it recognizes that the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; has taken a particular exit ramp off of highway M, such as ramp <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In still another example, the geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; may be defined as a border constructed around any predefined geographic area or region. As previously mentioned above, this type of geographic boundary <b>120</b> may be constructed around the location at which the event is to occur (such as Restaurant X). In other instances however, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; is constructed around a predefined geographic area or region along a most probable route toward the location at which the event is to occur. For instance, if the lunch date at Restaurant X is to occur on a Tuesday, the geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2032;&#x2033; may be constructed around an area along a route that the individual will most likely take from his/her workplace to Restaurant X. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the individual may, for instance, be most likely to take highway M northbound, and then exit off highway M at exit <b>112</b> toward road segment <b>114</b>. As soon as the vehicle <b>12</b> enters the geographic boundary <b>120</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;, the telematics unit <b>14</b> will automatically activate the alert.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">While numerous examples of the geographic boundary <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;&#x2032; are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is to be understood that any desirable geographic boundary may be designated as the trigger and may encompass any desirable mileage, intersection(s), road segment(s), exit(s), landmark(s), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In any of these examples, the telematics unit <b>14</b> is aware of the fact that the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; is located within the preset geographic boundary <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;&#x2032; by comparing GPS coordinate data taken from the GPS component <b>44</b> with the GPS coordinate data defining the geographic boundary <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;&#x2032;. If a match is found between the compared coordinates (i.e., the GPS coordinate data of the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; falls within that defined by the geographic boundary <b>120</b>), the telematics unit <b>14</b> determines that the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; has in fact entered the geographic boundary <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;. The comparison between the GPS coordinate data of the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; and that of the geographic boundary <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;&#x2032; may, for example, be continuously run in the background of the telematics unit <b>14</b> as soon as the vehicle telematics unit <b>14</b> is in an ON state, the ignition is in an ON state, or the vehicle transmission system is shifted into a drive mode. In another example, the comparison run by the telematics unit <b>14</b> is initiated within a predefined amount of time prior to a scheduled appointment, and is continuously run until a predefined amount of time after scheduled appointment or upon detecting a trigger. For instance, if a scheduled appointment is at 5:00 pm, the telematics unit <b>14</b> may be preset to start running the comparison a half an hour ahead of the 5:00 pm appointment time (i.e., at 4:30 pm), and continue to run the comparison until i) a trigger is detected (e.g., the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; entered a predefined geographic boundary <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;, <b>120</b>&#x2033;&#x2032; as described above) or until a half hour after the appointment time (i.e., at 5:30 pm).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring back to the discussion about appropriate triggers, in still another example, the individual or fleet owner/manager may designate both a time that occurs prior to the event/appointment time and a predefined geographic boundary <b>120</b> as triggers. In this example, the trigger is the recognition that the then-current vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; position coincides with or falls within the set geographic boundary <b>120</b> and/or the preset time period before the start of the event/appointment. For example, if the scheduled appointment is at 11:00 am and the triggers include both i) within 30 minutes prior to the start of the appointment and ii) a geographic boundary of 10 miles from the location of the appointment, the telematics unit <b>14</b> (if in an ON state) will recognize the set triggers (and activate the alert) when at least one of the two alert-triggering events take place. In one example when the first trigger is detected, the telematics unit <b>14</b> will automatically generate the alert, and thereafter will call the call/data center <b>24</b> to report that the alert was generated. Upon receiving the call, the call/data center <b>24</b> may, in some instances, elect to delete the second trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In yet another example, multiple triggers may be embodied in nested geographic boundaries; i.e., one or more geographic boundaries within an outer geographic boundary. An example of nested geographic boundaries (i.e., an outer geographic boundary <b>120</b><sub>OB </sub>and an inner geographic boundary <b>120</b><sub>IB</sub>) is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For instance, a first trigger may be detected when the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; enters the outer geographic boundary <b>120</b><sub>OB</sub>, and then a second alert may be generated when the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; enters the inner geographic boundary <b>120</b><sub>IB</sub>. Details of example alerts are provided hereinbelow, however for purposes of illustrating the instant example, alerts are also now described. In instances where the alerts are data alerts or voice alerts, the first and second alerts output to the user on the display <b>80</b> (for data alerts) or through the audio component <b>60</b> (for voice alerts) may, in some cases, include the same message (e.g., &#x201c;Sales call with Client A at 12:00 pm&#x201d;, etc.). In other cases, the first and second alerts may include different messages, whereby the first alert that is generated when the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; enters the outer boundary <b>120</b><sub>OB </sub>may have a primary message associated therewith, and the second alert that is generated when the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; enters the inner boundary <b>120</b><sub>IB </sub>may have a secondary message associated therewith. For instance, the primary message may be, e.g., &#x201c;Sales call with Client A at 12:00 pm&#x201d;, and the secondary message may be, e.g., &#x201c;Don't forget to wish Client A happy birthday.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Upon updating the calendar <b>98</b> (by deleting an appointment, creating a new appointment, changing an appointment, selecting an alarm, setting a trigger, etc.), the calendar <b>98</b> is automatically stored at the host server <b>94</b> of the webpage <b>96</b>, and the associated triggers are automatically modified in the respective vehicle(s) <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033;. In a non-limiting example, the triggers are modified by replacing a currently-existing trigger(s) stored in the telematics unit <b>14</b> with the new trigger(s) associated with the updated calendar <b>98</b>. In this example, the currently-existing trigger(s) is/are deleted, and the new trigger(s) is/are stored in the telematics unit <b>14</b>. In another non-limiting example, the triggers are modified by adding the new trigger(s) to the currently-existing trigger(s) stored in the telematics unit <b>14</b>. In this example, the new trigger(s) may include the same message/reminder and geographic boundary, for example, as the other trigger(s), however the new trigger(s) may be associated with an extended expiration time or some other feature that adds on to the original trigger.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When a trigger is recognized, the visual or audio alert is generated within the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; to inform the in-vehicle user of the upcoming appointment. The alert may be a pre-set alert, or it may be generated in real time. A pre-set alert (e.g., a simple text message or voice message identifying the appointment details) may be selected using the webpage <b>96</b>, and will be sent to the telematics unit memory <b>38</b> for storage therein. When the trigger is recognized, this pre-saved message will be output within the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033;. After the pre-saved message is played, it may be saved (e.g., in a message inbox or the like associated with the calendar <b>98</b>) at least for a predetermined amount of time after the message is played so that the user may replay the message at a later time if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some instances when a trigger is recognized, a data call may be initiated from the telematics unit <b>14</b> to the call/data center <b>24</b>. The switch <b>68</b> at the call/data center <b>24</b> routes the data call to an appropriate advisor <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032;, who/which can retrieve calendar <b>98</b> information from the host server <b>94</b> and transmit the information to the vehicle <b>12</b>. In this example, transmission of the information is accomplished by downloading the information directly to the telematics unit <b>14</b>. Transmission of the information to the vehicle <b>12</b> may also be accomplished via a voice call. For instance, a fleet manager/owner may recite a voice alert to the vehicle <b>12</b> driver in real time or a pre-recorded alert may be triggered as the vehicle <b>12</b> approaches a destination at which the scheduled appointment is to take place. This voice alert may, e.g., be a command to &#x201c;speak to an advisor&#x201d; in instances where the fleet manager/owner may want to provide certain instructions to the vehicle <b>12</b> driver such as, e.g., complex delivery instructions/requirements that requires two-way verbal interaction (such as active participation by the vehicle <b>12</b> driver in response to various requirements of the delivery).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In another example, the telematics unit call <b>14</b> is ultimately patched through to the host server <b>94</b> (by the advisor <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032;) so that the telematics unit <b>14</b> can retrieve pre-event appointment information to be included in the alert. More specifically, the desktop application of the advisor <b>62</b>, <b>62</b>&#x2032; may be used to access the user profile to retrieve information pertaining to the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; and/or the vehicle owner/subscriber, and this information may be attached to the data call that is forwarded to the host server <b>94</b> so that the host server <b>94</b> knows which calendar information to retrieve. In this example, the call from the telematics unit <b>14</b> may be placed as soon as the telematics unit <b>14</b> recognizes one of the triggers described above. In response to the call, the call center <b>24</b> transmits, to the telematics unit <b>14</b>, a text form of the pre-event information for the appointment associated with the recognized trigger. The telematics unit <b>14</b> utilizes the pre-event information to formulate an alert (such as a data alert to be presented on the display <b>80</b> or a voice alert to be output through the audio component <b>60</b>) designed to notify the vehicle occupant(s) of the upcoming appointment. This example may be used by fleet vehicles <b>12</b> where delivery instructions change prior to arrival at the appointment destination. In these cases, the fleet manager/owner may request that the alert(s) stored at the host server <b>94</b> is/are associated with an easily updatable message.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In instances where a data alert is formulated in real time, the vehicle bus <b>34</b> of the telematics unit <b>14</b> receives the information from the host server <b>94</b> or call center <b>24</b>, and transmits the information to the display <b>80</b> for viewing by the in-vehicle occupant(s).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In instances where a voice alert is formulated in real time, the telematics unit <b>14</b> uses the text-to-speech unit <b>89</b> to convert the received text into an audible, human-recognizable form, and then constructs the alert so that it relays a notification to the vehicle occupant(s) of an upcoming appointment including at least some of the pre-event information. The voice alert may be something similar to &#x201c;Lunch with Bob at Restaurant X&#x201d;, &#x201c;Stop at grocery store&#x201d;, &#x201c;Sales meeting with client A, 9:00 AM&#x201d;, etc. It is to be understood that if the trigger associated with the appointment is based upon time, the voice alert (or data alert) may be output to the vehicle occupant(s) at a predetermined amount of time prior to the starting time of the event, which often falls within a designated travel time.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As mentioned above, the outputting of the voice alert to the vehicle occupant(s) may be accomplished, for example, using the audio component <b>60</b> disposed in the vehicle <b>12</b>. In instances where the audio component <b>60</b> is turned off at the time the alert is generated, the telematics unit <b>14</b> will activate the audio component <b>60</b> so that the voice alert may be played to the vehicle occupant(s). In instances where the audio component <b>60</b> is turned on at the time the alert is generated (e.g., the vehicle occupant(s) is/are listening to a radio station, music stored on a compact disc, a podcast stored on an MP3 player, etc.), the telematics unit <b>14</b> will momentarily override the output of the audio component <b>60</b> so that the voice alert may be played to the vehicle occupant(s).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the trigger is generated and the alert is activated, the telematics unit <b>14</b> automatically initiates a vehicle data upload event (via a vehicle data upload (VDU) system not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for uploading a memo to the electronic calendar <b>98</b> resident at the host server <b>94</b>. The memo may, in an example, be generated by the telematics unit <b>14</b> using a preset protocol, and the memo itself may conform to a preset template. The template may include, e.g., that the alert was played at xx:xx, otherwise indicating that the alert was activated. The memo generated by the telematics unit <b>14</b> is stored in the calendar <b>98</b> as post-event appointment information.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Upon storing the memo in the calendar <b>98</b>, a response message may be automatically transmitted back to the telematics unit <b>14</b> from the host server <b>94</b> to remove the trigger from the vehicle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When a trigger is not recognized, an alert is not generated or output within the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033;. As one example, when the telematics unit <b>14</b> is not in an ON state during the preset time interval before the start of an appointment, the time trigger will not be recognized and the alert will not be generated. As another example, when the vehicle <b>12</b> does not enter the geographic boundary <b>120</b> within a designated time interval (such as during the travel time period or within a predetermined amount of time during the time block of the event), activation of the alert by the telematics unit <b>14</b> will not be triggered. When the trigger is not activated and is associated with a particular time that has expired, the telematics unit <b>14</b> may, for example, disable or delete the trigger so that the associated alert cannot be activated. Whenever a preset trigger is not recognized, the telematics unit <b>14</b> automatically initiates a vehicle data upload event for uploading another memo to the electronic calendar <b>98</b> that is resident on the webpage <b>96</b>. This other memo indicates that the trigger was not recognized and thus the associated alert was not activated, and, in some instances, also indicates that the trigger has been disabled or deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In instances where the vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; is a member of a fleet, the telematics unit <b>14</b> may also automatically initiate a message (such as a text message, a voice message, an e-mail message, etc.) that may be transmitted directly to the fleet manager (e.g., to the fleet manager's cellular phone, personal digital assistance, personal computer, or other suitable device) indicating that the alert was activated or not activated.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Once the memo indicating that the alert has been activated or the other memo indicating that the alert has not been activated has been uploaded to the electronic calendar <b>98</b>, the individual or another person authorized to access the calendar <b>98</b> may view the memo/other memo. Viewing may be desirable, for example, by a fleet manager to see whether a particular driver or vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; associated with the calendar has attended all of its scheduled appointments. In instances where a driver or vehicle <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>&#x2032;, <b>12</b>&#x2033; has missed one or more of the appointments (as may be concluded by the other memo indicating that the alert was not activated), the fleet manager may use such information to contact the individual or business party associated with the appointment to fulfill any obligations that may have been missed and/or to reschedule the appointment.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some instances, one or more of the vehicle occupant(s) and/or a person authorized to view the calendar <b>98</b> may respond to the memo/other memo. In one example, responding to the memo/other memo may be accomplished by a vehicle occupant by posting an audio message to the electronic calendar <b>98</b>. This may include reciting the message as utterances into the microphone <b>28</b> inside the vehicle <b>12</b>, where the utterances are recorded by the recorder <b>91</b>. The recorded audio message may be transmitted to the host server <b>94</b> at which the electronic calendar <b>98</b> is resident during a vehicle data upload event, and the host server <b>94</b> may upload the voice message to the calendar <b>98</b> as a voice post or voice upload.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In another example, responding to the memo/other memo may be accomplished by posting a data message to the electronic calendar <b>98</b>. The data message may be generated by an authorized person viewing the calendar <b>98</b> by typing comments into the appointment cell <b>100</b> in response to the memo/other memo. The data message may otherwise be generated by the vehicle occupant(s) from a voice recording of the message (taken by the recorder <b>91</b>), which is then converted into text via the speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>, <b>88</b>&#x2032;. In instances where the text is converted by the speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>, the data message is transmitted from the telematics unit <b>14</b> to the host server <b>94</b> during a vehicle data upload event, and then posted to the calendar <b>98</b> as a data post or data upload. In instances where the text is converted by the speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>&#x2032;, the voice recording is transmitted to the call/data center <b>24</b>, where it is converted to text by the speech-to-text unit <b>88</b>&#x2032;. The data message is then transmitted to the host server <b>94</b> from the call/data center <b>24</b> and then uploaded to the calendar <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In yet another example, responding to the memo/other memo may be accomplished by sending a short message service (SMS) message to another person authorized to access the electronic calendar <b>98</b> via the webpage <b>96</b>, who may post the SMS message to the electronic calendar <b>98</b>. For instance, the vehicle occupant(s) may recite a response to the memo/other memo into a microphone associated with his/her mobile communications device (e.g., a smart phone), which is converted into text via an internal speech-to-text engine. The text version of the message, in the form of an SMS message, may be submitted to the authorized user, who may upload the message onto the calendar <b>98</b> using the webpage <b>96</b>. The smart phone may contain an application for recording messages and creating text messages from the recorded messages.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In still another example, the vehicle occupant may send an SMS message to the host server <b>94</b> using a specific shortcode (e.g., &#x201c;12345 calendar&#x201d;), and the host server <b>94</b> may autoreply with options to, e.g., view and/or edit the calendar <b>98</b>, to generate a new alert, etc. Upon authorizing the SMS message sender (via, e.g., verifying the MDN of the device used to submit the SMS message, as well as correctly answering selected challenge question(s)), the host server <b>94</b> will upload any responses made by the SMS message sender to the host server's <b>94</b> autoreply.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">While several examples have been described in detail, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosed examples may be modified. Therefore, the foregoing description is to be considered exemplary rather than limiting.</p>
