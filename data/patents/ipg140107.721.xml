<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an electric door lock, more particularly to an electric door lock that is operable in manual and electronic modes to lock and unlock, which can be conveniently assembled and secured into position on a left-hand door or a right-hand door.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The function of a lock is to maintain the security of the house owner's life and property, so, the development of lock design tends to require easy operation and use, but a design that's hard to open for unscrupulous people. In view of current widely used locks, no matter whether the door lock is indoors or outdoors, most of the locks are of a mechanical type using a key to lock and unlock. Such kind of key-controlled door locks, in fact, are inconvenient. Therefore, electric door locks are developing robustly and changing with the times. Due to their internal electronic and mechanical structure, the general electric door lock is assembled and secured into position on a left-hand door or a right-hand door and therefore needs modified settings. Also, electronic control devices cannot correctly recognize whether the dead bolt correctly reaches the unlocked position or locked position. Thus, how to eliminate these above-mentioned shortcomings becomes the motivation of the present invention. In U.S. patent application Publication No. US20070169525, there is disclosed an electric door lock which still has the shortcomings of recognizing whether the dead bolt is in the correct locked or unlocked position, no matter whether the electric door lock is assembled and secured into position on a left-hand door or a right-hand door.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, the purpose of this invention is to provide an electric door lock, which can be easily assembled and secured into position on a left-hand door or a right-hand door.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another purpose of this invention is to provide an electric door lock, which is assembled easily, and can recognize whether the dead bolt correctly reaches the unlocked or locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An electric door lock including: a lock housing; an operating member having a holding part and a shaft part, the shaft part partially disposed in the lock housing, the shaft part connected to the holding part, the holding part defined as a long axis; a cog wheel installed in the lock housing, the cog wheel having at least one bump; a coupling plate set on the operating member, the coupling plate having at least one bulge, one arc part and one protruding part, the arc part set in, and able to rotate in the arc shaped groove; and a motor set in the lock housing; three sensor switches set separately in the lock housing; wherein, the operating the motor causes the cog wheel to rotate and push the bulge of the coupling plate past the bump on the cog wheel, so that the protruding part of the coupling plate of the electric door lock installed in the required position on the left-hand door or right-hand door, selectively touches the two sensor switches adjacent to each other, so as to reach the correct unlocked position or locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the electric door lock further comprises a lock sliding cover mechanism and an external cover positioning mechanism, wherein the lock sliding cover mechanism includes a decorative cover, a sliding cover and a flexible element, and the external cover positioning mechanism includes an external cover and an engaging component.</p>

The shaft part <b>122</b> can partially penetrate the through-hole <b>111</b> of the lock housing <b>11</b> and the end of shaft part <b>122</b> has a predetermined shape (this invention revealing the circular shaft with two adjacent flat sides cut into the circular shaft). A recess <b>123</b> is formed at the axis of the shaft part <b>122</b> and a circlip groove <b>124</b> is formed close to the end of shaft part <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The above-mentioned electric driving unit <b>13</b> can be installed in the accommodating space <b>112</b> of the lock housing <b>11</b>. The electric driving unit <b>13</b> is a reversible motor <b>131</b>. A worm shaft <b>132</b> is installed at the front of the motor <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The worm wheel <b>14</b> is made up of a small gear <b>141</b> superimposed on a large gear <b>142</b> (the worm wheel <b>14</b> can be constructed as one unit). The large gear <b>142</b> can mesh with the worm shaft <b>132</b> of the motor <b>131</b> so as to control the speed and be able to change the direction of transmission. A hole <b>143</b> is in the center of worm wheel <b>14</b>, which can accept a dowel pin <b>144</b> to pass through, allowing worm wheel <b>14</b> to be set in the accommodating space <b>112</b> of the lock housing <b>11</b>, but allowing worm wheel <b>14</b> to rotate as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A cog wheel <b>15</b>, having cogs which can mesh with the small gear <b>141</b> on worm gear <b>14</b> to slow the speed of transmission. A center hole <b>151</b> is in the center of the cog wheel <b>15</b>. The cog wheel <b>15</b> can be installed on the second flange <b>114</b> of the lock housing <b>11</b>. Two separate bumps <b>152</b> are formed on the side <b>153</b> of the cog wheel <b>15</b>. The external shape of the separate bumps <b>152</b> is a camber shape.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the coupling plate <b>16</b> has a plate <b>160</b> and a ringed part <b>165</b>, the plate <b>160</b> and ringed part <b>165</b> are connected by two first junctions <b>167</b> set on opposite sides of the plate <b>160</b> on a diameter line on plate <b>160</b>, and four separate second junctions <b>168</b>. The second junctions <b>168</b> and first junctions <b>167</b> form an angle. A protruding part <b>162</b> extends on one side from the outer circumference of the ringed part <b>165</b>. One side of the ringed part <b>165</b> faces side <b>153</b> of the cog wheel <b>15</b>. Two bulges <b>164</b> are set apart at an interval and extend from the ringed part <b>165</b>. The outer shape of the bulges <b>164</b> is an arc shape. The two bulges <b>164</b> respectively are set approximately perpendicular to the first junctions <b>167</b>. When the coupling plate <b>16</b> is installed on the shaft part <b>122</b> of the operating member <b>12</b>, the protruding part <b>162</b> and the long axis <b>1211</b> of the holding part <b>121</b> of the operating member <b>12</b> are designed to rotate in alignment with each other. The plate <b>160</b> of the coupling plate <b>16</b> has an arc part <b>169</b> which extends toward the lock housing <b>11</b>. The arc part <b>169</b> can be installed in the arc shaped groove <b>116</b> of the lock housing <b>11</b>. The respective ends of the arc part <b>169</b> form stoppers <b>1691</b> so as to limit the turning angle of coupling plate <b>16</b> when the coupling plate <b>16</b> rotates and the stoppers <b>1691</b> come into contact with the blocking surface <b>1151</b> of the lock housing <b>11</b>. A shaped through hole <b>161</b> is formed in the center of plate <b>160</b> of the coupling plate <b>16</b>, which has the same cross-sectional shape as the end of the shaft part <b>122</b> of the operating member <b>12</b> so as to install the coupling plate <b>16</b> on the shaft part <b>122</b> of the operating member <b>12</b>, a circlip <b>19</b> is installed on the circlip groove <b>124</b> to hold coupling plate <b>16</b> on the shaft part <b>122</b>. The coupling plate <b>16</b> and the operating member <b>12</b> are designed to rotate in alignment with each other and directly affect each other.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The described electronic control device <b>17</b>, on which is installed control circuitry and chips (not shown in the figures), can be installed in the accommodating space <b>112</b> of the lock housing <b>11</b>. Installed on the electronic control device <b>17</b> is the first sensor switch <b>171</b>, the second sensor switch <b>172</b> and the third sensor switch <b>173</b> (the sensor switches can be micro switches, limit switches, infrared sensors, etc.), wherein, the first sensor switch <b>171</b> and the second sensor switch <b>172</b> are set approximately 90 degrees apart, the first sensor switch <b>171</b> and the third sensor switch <b>173</b> are also set approximately 90 degrees apart in the other direction. The first sensor switch <b>171</b> has a touch control part <b>1711</b>, the second sensor switch <b>172</b> has a touch control part <b>1721</b>, and the third sensor switch <b>173</b> has a touch control part <b>1731</b>. The touch control part <b>1711</b> of the first sensor switch <b>171</b>, the touch control part <b>1721</b> of the second sensor switch <b>172</b>, and the touch control part <b>1731</b> of the third sensor switch <b>173</b> can selectively be touched by the protruding part <b>162</b> on coupling plate <b>16</b> and the electronic control device <b>17</b> can control the motor <b>131</b> to rotate forwards or backwards.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A frame <b>18</b> can be installed on the inside side (not shown in the figures) of the door by two bolts <b>5</b>, said frame <b>18</b> is installed and secured on the door together with dead bolt <b>2</b>, and the external lock housing <b>3</b> on the outside side of the door. And the frame <b>18</b> can be installed in the accommodating space <b>112</b> of the lock housing <b>11</b> so as to seal a part of the accommodating space <b>112</b> of the lock housing <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, the external lock housing <b>3</b> includes: a decorative cover <b>31</b>, a cylinder lock <b>32</b> and an electronic control component <b>34</b> (which can be a keypad component, a fingerprint recognition component, a remote control component . . . and so on, the invention revealing a keypad component), wherein the electronic control component <b>34</b> controls the electronic control device <b>17</b> through an electronic circuit (not shown in the figures). And the cylinder lock <b>32</b> connects to a transmission <b>33</b>, the transmission <b>33</b> is inserted through hole <b>23</b> of the driving mechanism <b>22</b> of dead bolt <b>2</b> and then inserts into recess <b>123</b> of the operating member <b>12</b>, thereby driving dead bolt head <b>24</b> of dead bolt <b>2</b> to extend out the dead bolt housing <b>21</b>, or recede into dead bolt housing <b>21</b>, or any position in between.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an unlocked condition, when the electric door lock <b>10</b> of the invention is assembled and secured into position on a right-hand door (not shown in the figures), the protruding part <b>162</b> of the coupling plate <b>16</b> touches on the touch control part <b>1711</b> of the first sensor switch <b>171</b> (the main purpose of the this action is to relay to the electronic control device <b>17</b> that the door is in an unlocked position, the electronic control components <b>34</b> therefore are not able to repeat the unlocking action). At this moment, the position of the two bumps <b>152</b> on the cog wheel <b>15</b> are situated in a clockwise direction and close to the two bulges <b>164</b> on coupling plate <b>16</b>. When the user would like to manually operate the door to a locked position, the user just needs to turn the operating member <b>12</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) thereby directly driving the coupling plate <b>16</b> counterclockwise (as the arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows). Since the operating member <b>12</b>, the transmission shaft <b>33</b> and the coupling plate <b>16</b> are designed to rotate together, the transmission shaft <b>33</b> can drive the driving mechanism <b>22</b> of the dead bolt <b>2</b> (not shown in the figure), thereby forcing dead bolt head <b>24</b> to move out of dead bolt housing <b>21</b> and also turning protruding part <b>162</b> of the coupling plate <b>16</b> to touch on the touch control part <b>1721</b> of the second sensor switch <b>172</b> (the main purpose of this action is to relay to the electronic device <b>17</b> that the door is in a locked position, the electronic components <b>34</b> therefore are not able to repeat the locking action). The coupling plate <b>16</b> will thus move from the unlocked position shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to the locked position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It therefore follows that manually turning operating member <b>12</b> in the opposite direction described above (not shown in the figure) will move coupling plate <b>16</b> to the locked position. Obviously cylinder lock <b>32</b> has the same functions as operating member <b>12</b>, and its use will not be repeated again.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when the electric door lock <b>10</b> of this invention is assembled and secured into position on a right-hand door and the user wishes to electronically operate coupling plate <b>16</b> to move from the unlocked position (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to the locked position (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), the electronic control component <b>34</b> is used to control the electronic control device <b>17</b>, the motor <b>131</b> rotates the worm shaft <b>132</b>, the said worm shaft <b>132</b> drives the worm wheel <b>14</b> which then drives cog wheel <b>15</b> to rotate counterclockwise so as to make the two bumps <b>152</b> on the cog wheel <b>15</b> respectively move close (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to the two bulges <b>164</b> (shown as a dotted line). The two bumps <b>152</b> on the cog wheel <b>15</b> respectively push the two bulges <b>164</b> on the coupling plate <b>16</b>, thereby forcing coupling plate <b>16</b> to rotate counterclockwise. When the protruding part <b>162</b> of the coupling plate <b>16</b> touches the second sensor switch <b>172</b> and thus stops, it has to be noted that the motor <b>131</b> will continue to operate a while to let bump <b>152</b> on the cog wheel <b>15</b> pass over the bulge <b>164</b> of the coupling plate <b>16</b>, which rotates to the locked position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This is to prevent interference caused when manually turning coupling plate <b>16</b> clockwise and the bump <b>152</b> on the cog wheel <b>15</b> meets with bulge <b>164</b> on the coupling plate <b>16</b>, and also allows operating member <b>12</b> to maintain a power saving mode when operated manually. Owing to the different specifications of dead bolt <b>2</b> and the gap between the transmission shaft <b>33</b>, the hole <b>23</b> and the recess <b>123</b> of the operating member <b>12</b>, when making dead bolt head <b>24</b> move from the unlocked position to the locked position, it's necessary to rotate the operating member <b>12</b> and thereby coupling plate <b>16</b>, approximately 90 to 120 degrees. Therefore, when the rotating protruding part <b>162</b> of the coupling plate <b>16</b> touches the touch control part <b>1721</b> of the second sensor switch <b>172</b> and thus stops, the motor <b>131</b> still drives the cog wheel <b>15</b> counterclockwise to rotate a short distance until the bump <b>152</b> on the cog wheel <b>15</b> passes over bulge <b>164</b> on coupling plate <b>16</b> and stops. And the protruding part <b>162</b> on the coupling plate <b>16</b> has to touch on the touch control part <b>1721</b> of the second sensor switch <b>172</b>, so the width of the protruding part <b>162</b> on the coupling plate <b>16</b> needs to be set according to the specifications of dead bolt <b>2</b> and the gap between the transmission shaft <b>33</b>, the hole <b>23</b> and recess <b>123</b> of the operating member <b>12</b>. The set width of the protruding part <b>162</b> on the coupling plate <b>16</b> is angle C (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which is formed by the two sides of the protruding part <b>162</b> on the coupling plate <b>16</b> to the axis of the coupling plate <b>16</b> is between 5 to 80 degrees (the invention angle is set at about 60 degrees). On the contrary, from the locked position to the unlocked position, all the actions are similar to the above mentioned but in the opposite direction, which will not be repeated again.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the electric door lock is assembled and secured into position on a left-hand door or a right-hand door. Electronic control device <b>17</b> of the electric door lock <b>10</b> will automatically detect the direction of dead bolt head <b>24</b> of the dead bolt <b>2</b> at any particular moment, thereby automatically adjusting protruding part <b>162</b> of the coupling plate <b>16</b> to switch the touch control part <b>1711</b> of the first sensor switch <b>171</b> to an unlocked position and switch the touch control part <b>1731</b> of the third sensor switch <b>173</b> to a locked position. The transmission mode and operating procedures are the same as the aforementioned, which will not be reiterated again.</p>
