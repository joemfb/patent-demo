<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of scheduling transmitting and receiving communication slots for co-located radio devices is provided. A Bluetooth (BT) device first synchronizes its communication time slots with a co-located radio module, and then obtains the traffic pattern of the co-located radio module. Based on the traffic pattern, the BT device selectively skips one or more TX or RX time slots to avoid data transmission or reception in certain time slots and thereby reducing interference with the co-located radio module. In addition, the BT device generates a co-located coexistence (CLC) bitmap and transmits the CLC bitmap to its peer BT device such that the peer BT device can also skip data transmission or reception in certain time slots affected by the co-located radio module. The skipped time slots are disabled for TX or RX operation to prevent interference and to achieve more energy saving.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/254,771, entitled &#x201c;Systems and Methods for Enhancing BT, LTE, and WiMAX Coexistence Efficiency,&#x201d; filed on Oct. 26, 2009, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosed embodiments relate generally to wireless network communications, and, more particularly, to Multi-Radio Terminals (MRT) containing Bluetooth (BT) and Mobile Wireless Systems (MWS) radios.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has adopted a series of standards for both wireless local area networks (WLANs) known as 802.11 and wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs) known as 802.16. It is commonly known that WiFi refers to interoperable implementations of the IEEE 802.11 technology, and WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) refers to interoperable implementations of the IEEE 802.16 technology. On the other hand, Bluetooth is a wireless standard for wireless personal area networks (WPANs) developed by the Bluetooth special interest group (SIG). Bluetooth provides a secure way for exchanging data over short distances using frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology. Due to scarce radio spectrum resource, different technologies may operate in overlapping or adjacent radio spectrums. For example, WiFi often operates at 2.412-2.4835 GHz, WiMAX often operates at 2.3-2.4 or 2.496-2.690 GHz, and Bluetooth often operates at 2.402-2.480 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the demand for wireless communication continues to increase, wireless communication devices such as cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers, etc., are increasingly being equipped with multiple radios. A multiple radio terminal (MRT) may simultaneously include Bluetooth, WiMAX, and WiFi radios. Simultaneous operation of multiple radio modules co-located on the same physical device, however, can suffer significant degradation including significant interference between them because of the overlapping or adjacent radio spectrums. Due to physical proximity and radio power leakage, when the transmission of data for a first radio module overlaps with the reception of data for a second radio module in time domain, the second radio module reception can suffer due to interference from the first radio module transmission. Likewise, data transmission of the second radio module can interfere with data reception of the first radio module.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (Prior Art) is a diagram that illustrates interference between a mobile wireless system (MWS) radio module <b>11</b> and a Bluetooth (BT) master radio module <b>12</b> that are co-located in an MRT<b>10</b>. Both MWS<b>11</b> and BT<b>12</b> transmit and receive data via scheduled transmitting (TX) and receiving (RX) time slots on a frame-by-frame basis. For example, each MWS frame contains five consecutive RX slots scheduled for receiving operation followed by three consecutive TX slots scheduled for transmitting operation. On the other hand, a Time Division Duplex (TDD) scheme is used by BT devices where a BT master and a BT slave alternate TX and RX operation. Because MWS radio module <b>11</b> and BT radio module <b>12</b> are co-located within MRT<b>10</b>, in a general, the transmission of one radio module will interfere with the reception of another radio module. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, data reception in three RX time slots of BT<b>12</b> are interfered by concurrent data transmission in TX time slots of MWS<b>11</b>, and data reception in six RX time slots of MWS<b>11</b> are interfered by concurrent data transmission in TX time slots of BT<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (Prior Art) is a diagram that illustrates traffic pattern of a BT master device <b>22</b> affected by a co-located MWS radio module <b>21</b>. The traffic pattern of MWS<b>21</b> remains the same as the traffic pattern of MWS<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while BT<b>22</b> has an Extended Voice (EV3) traffic pattern using an Extended Synchronous Connection Oriented (eSCO) link, with T<sub>eSCO</sub>=6 and W<sub>eSCO</sub>=4. Under such EV3 traffic pattern, BT<b>22</b> has one scheduled TX time slot followed by one scheduled RX time slot for every six BT slots (i.e., T<sub>eSCO</sub>=6), with four retransmission opportunities (i.e., W<sub>eSCO</sub>=4). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, data transmission of MWS<b>21</b> interferes with data reception of BT<b>22</b>, while data transmission of BT<b>22</b> does not interfere with data reception of MWS<b>21</b> (e.g., because of low transmission power of BT<b>22</b>). As a result, EV3 data reception in the scheduled EV3RX time slot in eSCO window #<b>2</b> is corrupted, causing BT<b>22</b> to re-transmit EV3 data to a BT slave in the following EV3TX time slot and to receive EV3 data from the BT slave in the following EV3RX time slot successfully. It can be seen that BT<b>22</b> consumes 25% more energy due to interference from co-located MWS<b>21</b>. A solution is sought to improve efficiency and save energy for radio modules co-located within the same MRT.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method of scheduling transmitting and receiving communication slots for co-located radio devices is provided. A Bluetooth (BT) device first synchronizes its communication time slots with a co-located radio module, and then obtains the traffic pattern of the co-located radio module. The traffic pattern information includes frame configuration information such as DL/UL duration, active/inactive duration, and frame length. Based on the traffic pattern, the BT device selectively skips one or more TX or RX time slots to avoid data transmission or reception in certain time slots and thereby reducing interference with the co-located radio module. The skipped time slots are disabled for TX or RX operation to prevent interference and to achieve more energy saving.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the BT device generates co-located coexistence (CLC) information based on the traffic pattern information. The CLC information may be represented by a CLC bitmap, each bit of the CLC bitmap indicates whether a communication slot can be used for transmitting or receiving data. For example, in a TX CLC bitmap, each bit indicates whether data transmission of a communication slot of the BT radio module will interfere with data reception of the co-located radio module in a corresponding time slot. Similarly, in a RX CLC bitmap, each bit indicates whether data transmission of the co-located radio module will interfere with data reception of the BT device in a corresponding time slot. The generated CLC bitmap is used for selectively skipping TX or RX operation to avoid interference. The BT device then transmits the CLC bitmap to its peer BT device such that the peer BT device can also skip data transmission or reception in certain time slots affected by the co-located radio module.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference will now be made in detail to some embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a simplified block diagram of a Multi-Ratio Terminal (MRT) <b>32</b> in a wireless communication system <b>30</b> in accordance with one novel aspect. Wireless communication system <b>30</b> comprises a base station BS<b>31</b>, a mobile station MRT<b>32</b>, and a BT headset BT<b>33</b>. Mobile station MRT<b>32</b> simultaneously includes a mobile wireless system (MWS) radio module <b>45</b> and a Bluetooth (BT) radio module <b>46</b>. MRT<b>32</b> communicates with its serving base station BS<b>31</b> using MWS radio module <b>45</b> via a WiMAX link <b>34</b>, while communicates with a BT headset BT<b>33</b> using BT radio module <b>46</b> via a BT link <b>35</b>. MWS radio module <b>45</b> comprises a transmitter and/or receiver <b>41</b> and an MWS driver control block <b>42</b>. BT radio module <b>46</b> comprises a transmitter and/or receiver <b>43</b> and a BT driver control block <b>44</b>. MWS driver <b>42</b> and BT driver <b>44</b> communicate with each other via a coexistence-signaling interface <b>49</b>. Coexistence-signaling interface <b>49</b> is also connected to processor <b>47</b> and memory <b>48</b> of mobile station MRT<b>32</b>. Although coexistence signaling interface <b>49</b> is denoted as one module, it may include both hardware and software implementation. For example, hardware implementation may be used for timing/synchronization between MWS<b>45</b> and BT<b>46</b>, while software implementation may be used for traffic information exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, MWS<b>45</b> is a WiMAX radio module that operates at 2.3-2.4 or 2.496-2.690 GHz, while BT<b>46</b> is a BT radio module that operates at 2.402-2.480 GHz. Simultaneous operation of multiple radio modules co-located on the same physical device, however, can suffer significant degradation including significant interference between them because of the overlapping or adjacent radio spectrums. This is especially true when both MWS<b>45</b> and BT<b>46</b> use time division multiplexing (TDM) protocol for data communication. Under TDM mode, when a scheduled communication time slot for data transmission for a first radio module overlaps in time with a scheduled communication time slot for data reception for a second radio module, data reception of the second radio module can suffer due to interference from data transmission of the first radio module. Likewise, data transmission of the second radio module can interfere with data reception of the first radio module.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one novel aspect, BT radio module <b>46</b> selectively skips scheduled transmitting (TX) and/or receiving (RX) time slots to improve scheduling efficiency and thereby save energy via coexistence-signaling interface <b>49</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, BT<b>46</b> first synchronizes its communication time slots with MWS<b>45</b> (step <b>1</b>), and then obtains the traffic pattern of MWS<b>45</b> (step <b>2</b>) via coexistence-signaling interface <b>49</b>. The traffic pattern information includes frame configuration information such as DL/UL duration and frame length. Based on the traffic pattern, BT<b>46</b> selectively skips one or more TX or RX time slots to avoid mutual interference between BT<b>46</b> and MWS<b>45</b> (step <b>3</b>). In addition, BT<b>46</b> generates a co-located coexistence (CLC) bitmap (step <b>4</b>) and transmits the CLC bitmap to its peer BT device (step <b>5</b>) such that the peer BT device can also skip data transmission or reception in certain time slots affected by MWS<b>45</b>. During the skipped time slots, TX or RX operation is given up by disabling or turning off the transmitter or receiver to achieve more energy saving. Various embodiments and examples are now described below with more details.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a first embodiment of selectively skipping communication slots in accordance with one novel aspect. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, MWS radio module <b>51</b> has a typical MWS traffic pattern, each MWS frame contains eight communication slots including five consecutive RX slots followed by three consecutive TX slots. On the other hand, BT master radio module <b>52</b> has an Asynchronous Connection-Oriented (ACL) traffic pattern. A Time Division Duplex (TDD) scheme is used by BT devices where BT master and BT slave alternate TX and RX operation. The packet start shall be aligned with the slot start. BT master <b>52</b> first aligns its communication slots with MWS<b>51</b> to minimize mutual interference. BT<b>52</b> then obtains the traffic pattern of MWS<b>51</b>. Based on the obtained traffic pattern, BT master <b>52</b> deliberately gives up certain allowed TX and RX slots that will be affected by co-located MWS radio module <b>51</b> to save energy. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the TX/RX communication slots denoted by a think-lined box are originally allowed for TX and RX operation, but are now being selectively skipped because those slots will be affected by MWS<b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a second embodiment of selectively skipping communication slots in accordance with one novel aspect. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, MWS radio module <b>53</b> has the same traffic pattern as MWS<b>51</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each MWS frame contains eight communication slots including five consecutive RX slots followed by three consecutive TX slots. BT master radio module <b>54</b>, however, has an extended voice (EV3) traffic pattern, each eSCO window contains six communication slots (i.e., T<sub>eSCO</sub>=6) with one reserved TX slot followed by one reserved RX slot and four retransmission time slots (i.e., W<sub>eSCO</sub>=4). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, BT<b>54</b> deliberately gives up EV3 data transmission in originally reserved TX slot <b>55</b> because an acknowledgement for the transmitted EV3 data will not be successfully received in the next RX slot <b>56</b> due to interference from MWS<b>53</b>. In addition, BT<b>54</b> also skips EV3 data reception in originally reserved RX slot <b>56</b> to save energy. Instead, BT<b>54</b> performs data transmission and reception successfully in the next TX slot <b>57</b> and RX slot <b>58</b> in eSCO window #<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A further improvement can be achieved when a BT master informs a BT slave that the BT master cannot perform RX operation in certain communication slots. As a result, the BT slave can also avoid null EV3 data transmission in these slots and thus save energy. As illustrate in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the BT slave is originally reserved to transmit EV3 data to BT master <b>54</b> in slot <b>56</b>. Because the BT slave is informed that BT master <b>54</b> cannot perform data reception in this slot, the BT slave thus deliberately skips sending EV3 data in slot <b>56</b> to save energy.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">From the above illustration, it can be seen that based on the traffic characteristics or traffic pattern of a co-located MWS radio module, a BT master and slave can selectively skip TX and RX slots to save energy. Because the traffic pattern for a co-located MWS radio module can be obtained by the BT device, such information can be shared between the BT master and slave to improve scheduling efficiency by avoiding affected communication slots. Furthermore, because the traffic pattern of an MWS radio module is repeated for every MWS frame, such information can be represented as a co-located coexistence (CLC) bitmap described below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a first example of CLC bitmap in accordance with one novel aspect. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each MWS frame is 5 ms in length and contains eight communication slots including five RX slots followed by three TX slots. Each BT slot is 625 us in length. After frame synchronization, the MWS frames are aligned with BT slots in time domain. If data transmission of the co-located MWS radio module interferes with data reception of the BT device, then the BT device will not perform data reception in any of the MWS TX slots. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a BT RX CLC bitmap <b>61</b> is used to indicate whether a BT slot can be used to receive data. For example, a &#x201c;1&#x201d; bit indicates YES for data reception and a &#x201c;0&#x201d; bit indicates NO for data reception. Similarly, if data transmission of the BT device interferes with data reception of the co-located MWS radio module, then the BT device will not perform data transmission in any of the MWS RX slots. As a result, a BT TX CLC bitmap <b>62</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is used to indicate whether a BT slot can be used to transmit data. Because every twenty-four BT slots are aligned with three MWS frames and the traffic pattern of the MWS radio module repeats for every frame, the 24-bit RX CLC bitmap <b>61</b> and TX CLC bitmap <b>62</b> are sufficient to represent packet scheduling information.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a second example of CLC bitmap in accordance with one novel aspect. The MWS frame and traffic pattern in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is the same as the MWS frame and traffic pattern illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, however, data transmission of the BT device does not interfere with data reception of the co-located MWS radio module. This is also referred to as hybrid mode, which normally occurs when the transmission power of the BT device is relatively low. Under the hybrid mode, BT RX CLC bitmap <b>71</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> remains the same as BT RX CLC bitmap <b>61</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. BT TX CLC bitmap <b>72</b>, however, contains only &#x201c;1&#x201d; bits because every BT slot can be used to transmit data.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the use of CLC bitmaps by a BT master device <b>81</b> and a BT slave device <b>82</b>. An eSCO link with T<sub>eSCO</sub>=6 and W<sub>eSCO</sub>=4 exists between them. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, BT master <b>81</b> is co-located with an MWS radio module <b>83</b>. MWS<b>83</b> has a typical traffic pattern as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Based on the traffic pattern, BT master <b>81</b> generates a BT RX CLC bitmap <b>84</b> and a BT TX CLC bitmap <b>85</b>, both the same as BT RX CLC bitmap <b>71</b> and BT TX CLC bitmap <b>72</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> respectively. After the CLC bitmap information is generated by BT master <b>81</b>, it is then transmitted to BT slave <b>82</b> via a Link Manager Protocol (LMP) message (e.g., LMP_CLC_BITMAP). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, both BT master <b>81</b> and slave <b>82</b> have an EV3 traffic pattern, with originally scheduled EV3TX and EV3RX time slots at the beginning of each eSCO window. Based on the CLC bitmap information, BT master <b>81</b> skips the scheduled EV3 activity in slots <b>86</b> and <b>87</b>. Similarly, BT slave <b>82</b> also skips the scheduled EV3 activity in slots <b>88</b> and <b>89</b>. Instead, BT master <b>81</b> and BT slave <b>82</b> performs EV3TX and EV3RX in the next two communication slots. As a result, data transmission and reception under the adjusted EV3 traffic pattern of BT master <b>81</b> and BT slave <b>82</b> will not be interfered by co-located MWS radio module <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates different examples of selectively skipping scheduled communication slots by a BT master and a peer BT slave device. The BT master is co-located with an MWS radio module having a typical WiMAX traffic pattern depicted at the top of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Based on the WiMAX traffic pattern, the BT master determines certain time slots that the BT master would not perform data transmission as denoted by area with slashed shading. Data transmission in these time slots would cause interference to the co-located MWS radio module because they overlap with the downlink receiving (DL RX) activity of the MWS radio module. Because the BT master would not perform data transmission in these time slots, it also implies that the same time slots should not be used for data reception by the peer BT slave. Similarly, the BT master determines certain time slots that the BT master will not perform data reception as denoted by areas with dotted shading. Data reception in these time slots would be interfered by the co-located MWS radio module because they overlap with the uplink transmitting (UL TX) activity of the MWS radio module. Because the BT master would not perform data reception in these time slots, it also implies that the same time slots should not be used for data transmission by the peer BT slave.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a first example #1, the BT master device selectively gives up one or more scheduled TX slots if a corresponding acknowledgement (ACK) of the transmitted data cannot be received successfully due to interference. For instance, the first time slot in eSCO window #<b>2</b> (denoted by a think-lined box) is originally scheduled for data transmission for the BT master, but is now skipped because the BT master knows that it cannot successfully receive an ACK for the transmitted data in the next slot.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a second example #2, the BT slave device selectively gives up one or more scheduled TX slots if it is estimated that the data to be transmitted would not be received by its peer BT device successfully. For instance, the second time slot in eSCO window #<b>2</b> (denoted by a think-lined box) is originally scheduled for data transmission for the BT slave, but is now skipped because the BT slave is informed that its peer BT master would not be able to receive the transmitted data successfully.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a third example #3, the BT master device selectively gives up one or more scheduled TX slots if it is estimated that data transmission in those TX slots would interfere data reception of the co-located device. For instance, the first time slot in eSCO window #<b>3</b> (denoted by a think-lined box) is originally scheduled for data transmission for the BT master, but is now skipped because the BT master knows that the transmitting operation would cause RX failure on the co-located MWS radio module.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a fourth example #4, the BT master device selectively gives up one or more scheduled RX slots if the receiving operation would be affected by interference from the co-located MWS radio module. For instance, the second time slot in eSCO window #<b>2</b> (denoted by a think-lined box) is originally scheduled for data reception for the BT master, but is now skipped because the BT master knows that it cannot successfully receiving data due to interference from the co-located MWS radio module.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a fifth example #5, the BT slave device selectively gives up one or more scheduled RX slots if it is estimated that its peer BT device would not transmit data in those RX slots. For instance, the first time slot in eSCO window #<b>3</b> (denoted by a think-lined box) is originally scheduled for data reception for the BT slave, but is now skipped because the BT slave is informed that its peer BT master would not transmit data in this slot.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the energy saving of a BT master and slave with the proposed scheduling method. The top half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates WiMAX and BT activity with conventional eSCO solution using EV3 (T<sub>eSCO</sub>=6, and W<sub>eSCO</sub>=4). Under conventional scheduling, if a scheduled TX or RX slot fails because of interference, then the BT master and slave performs retransmission in the next available slots. Based on the waveforms of BT master TX, BT master RX, BT slave TX, and BT slave RX, the duty cycle of the BT master and BT slave can be calculated as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D</i><sub>MASTER</sub>=(10&#xd7;382 &#x3bc;s+4&#xd7;90 &#x3bc;s)/15 ms=27.9%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D</i><sub>SLAVE</sub>=(10&#xd7;382 &#x3bc;s+2&#xd7;126 &#x3bc;s+6&#xd7;90 &#x3bc;s)/15 ms=30.7%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The bottom half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates WiMAX and BT activity with proposed eSCO solution using EV3 (T<sub>eSCO</sub>=6, and W<sub>eSCO</sub>=4). Under the proposed scheduling, if a scheduled TX or RX is estimated to fail because of interference, then the BT master and slave skip the scheduled slot and perform TX or RX in the next available slots. Because the skipped slot is given up for TX or RX operation, the transmitter or receiver is disabled or turned off during the skipped slot to save energy. Based on the waveforms of BT master TX, BT master RX, BT slave TX, and BT slave RX, the duty cycle of the BT master and BT slave can be calculated as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D</i><sub>MASTER</sub>=(8&#xd7;382 &#x3bc;s+126 &#x3bc;s)/15 ms=21.2%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D</i><sub>SLAVE</sub>=(8&#xd7;382 &#x3bc;s+2&#xd7;90 &#x3bc;s+126 &#x3bc;s)/15 ms=22.4%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Thus, the proposed method for eSCO scheduling saves (27.9 &#x2212;21.2)/27.9&#x2248;24% energy for BT master, and saves (30.7 &#x2212;22.4)/30.7&#x2248;27% for BT slave.
</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a deadlock problem and a solution under the proposed scheduling method. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a BT master communicates with a BT slave, and the BT slave is co-located with an MWS radio module having typical WiMAX traffic pattern. The communication slots marked with MNA and MA are TX slots for the BT master polling with NACK or ACK. The communication slots marked with SD and S are TX slots for the BT slave with or without sending data. The top half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a deadlock problem under conventional packet scheduling method. When the BT slave transmits data in a first SD slot <b>111</b>, the BT master transmits an ACK to acknowledge the transmitted data in the next corresponding MA slot <b>112</b>. The ACK transmitted by the BT master, however, is corrupted due to interference from data transmission of the MWS radio module. Next time when the BT master transmits, it changes from ACK to NACK under Automatic Retransmission Request (ARQ) mechanism. Because the BT slave has never received an ACK for its transmitted data in slot <b>111</b>, it attempts to retransmit the same data packet in the next SD slot <b>113</b>. The BT master again transmits an ACK to the BT slave in the next MA slot <b>114</b>. The ACK is again corrupted due to interference from the co-located MWS radio module. The same operation repeats thus deadlock forms.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The bottom half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates how the above-described deadlock problem is resolved by the proposed scheduling method. After the BT master receives data transmitted from the BT slave in the first SD slot <b>111</b>, the BT master skips its next scheduled TX slot <b>112</b> for sending the ACK to the BT slave. This is because the BT master is informed by the BT slave that the BT slave cannot successfully receive data in slot <b>112</b> due to interference from the co-located MWS radio module. Instead, the BT master postpones the ACK transmission to the next TX slot <b>115</b>, and the ACK is successfully received by the BT slave without interference from the MWS radio module. Thus, by deliberately giving up certain scheduled TX/RX slots, the scheduling deadlock problem is resolved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a simplified block diagram of a MRT <b>120</b> having an IEEE802.11-compatible device Wi-Fi<b>121</b> and a BT device BT<b>122</b> in accordance with a novel aspect. Wi-Fi<b>121</b> comprises a transmitter and/or receiver <b>123</b> and a Wi-Fi driver <b>124</b>. BT radio module <b>122</b> comprises a transmitter and/or receiver <b>125</b> and a BT driver <b>126</b>. Wi-Fi driver <b>124</b> and BT driver <b>126</b> communicate with each other via a coexistence-signaling interface <b>129</b>. Coexistence-signaling interface <b>129</b> is also connected to processor <b>127</b> and memory <b>128</b> of MRT<b>120</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, Wi-Fi<b>121</b> is a Wi-Fi radio module that operates at 2.412-2.4835 GHz, while BT<b>122</b> is a BT radio module that operates at 2.402-2.480 GHz. Simultaneous operation of multiple radio modules co-located on the same physical device, however, can suffer significant degradation including significant interference between them because of the overlapping or adjacent radio spectrums. Thus, scheduling the transmission and reception of the co-located radio modules not to overlap in time domain can substantially reduce the interference between them and thereby increase system performance.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one novel aspect, BT radio module <b>122</b> generates a CLC bitmap to be shared between Wi-Fi radio module <b>121</b> for packet scheduling such that the transmission and reception of the two radio modules do not overlap in time domain. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, BT<b>122</b> first receives a CLC request from Wi-Fi<b>121</b> (step <b>1</b>), and then obtains traffic characteristics and requirement, such as Wi-Fi<b>121</b> requests to use 50% of the time, from Wi-Fi<b>121</b> (step <b>2</b>) via coexistence-signaling interface <b>129</b>. Based on the traffic characteristics and requirement, BT<b>122</b> generates a co-located coexistence (CLC) bitmap and transmits the CLC bitmap back to Wi-Fi<b>121</b> (step <b>3</b>). For example, BT CLC bitmap <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> indicates a number of pre-defined communication slots reserved by BT<b>122</b> to perform data transmission and reception. BT CLC bitmap <b>130</b> also indicates a time duration when BT<b>122</b> does not perform any TX or RX operation. In one embodiment, BT<b>122</b> transmits a countdown signal to WiFI<b>121</b> (step <b>4</b>). Based on the CLC bitmap and the countdown signal, WiFi<b>121</b> enters active mode when BT<b>122</b> does not perform TX or RX operation, and enters power-saving mode during the reserved communication slots to reduce interference. In addition, BT<b>122</b> transmits CLC bitmap <b>130</b> to its peer BT device (step <b>5</b>) such that the peer BT device performs TX or RX operation only during the reserved time slots.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a flow chart of a method of scheduling TX and RX communication slots for co-located radio devices in accordance with one novel aspect. In step <b>131</b>, a BT radio module obtains traffic pattern information of another co-located radio module. In step <b>132</b>, the BT radio module schedules its communication slots for TX and RX operation. The communication time slots of the BT radio module and the other radio module are aligned after frame synchronization. In step <b>133</b>, the BT radio module selectively skips one or more TX and/or RX time slots based on the obtained traffic pattern information to avoid interference between the BT radio module and the co-located radio module. Instead, the BT radio module performs TX and RX operation during the time slots that are not affected by the co-located radio module. By deliberately giving up TX or RX time slots and disabling TX or RX operation during the skipped time slots, better scheduling efficiency and more energy saving is achieved for the BT radio module.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flow chart of a method of generating CLC information for co-located radio devices in accordance with one novel aspect. In step <b>141</b>, a BT radio module obtains traffic pattern information of a co-located radio module. In step <b>142</b>, the BT radio module determines CLC information based on the traffic pattern information. The CLC information indicates whether one or more communication slots of the BT radio module can be used for TX or RX operation. In step <b>143</b>, the BT radio module transmits the CLC information to its peer BT module such that the peer BT can more efficiently schedule its TX and RX operation and thereby save more energy.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Although the present invention has been described in connection with certain specific embodiments for instructional purposes, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, although a WiMAX radio module and a Wi-Fi radio module are used in the detailed description, a Long Term Evolution (LTE) device may be used as a co-located radio module instead. In addition, the BT device co-located with another radio module may be either a BT master or a BT slave. Accordingly, various modifications, adaptations, and combinations of various features of the described embodiments can be practiced without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.</p>
