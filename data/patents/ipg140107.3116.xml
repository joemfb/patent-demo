<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A mirror structure is provided in which at least a portion of a wavefront sensor is integrated with a mirror. In particular, a mirror structure is provided in which a Hartmann mask or a microlens array of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor is integrated with a mirror to provide a very compact wavefront detector/corrector in a single device. Such a mirror structure may be used in a laser cavity to simplify adaptive optics in the cavity. Furthermore, a Hartmann Mask may be integrated with self deforming mirror comprising an active PZT layer bonded to a passive mirror substrate, wherein the Hartmann Mask comprises an array of apertures formed through the active PZT layer.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is the U.S. National Phase of PCT/GB2009/051539, filed Nov. 16, 2009, which claims priority to British Patent Application No. 0821150.0, filed Nov. 19, 2008 and European Patent Application No. 08275076.1 filed Nov. 19, 2008 each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to mirror structures and in particular, but not exclusively, to a mirror structure in which at least a part of an optical wavefront sensor is integrated with a mirror. Such devices are particularly suited to use in adaptive laser optics.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Image sensors are used widely as diagnostic tools for lasers, for example to check laser beam quality within a test procedure before a laser system is delivered, but they may also be incorporated into a laser system to sample the laser beam with a beam splitter. Used in this way, the image sensor is limited to providing information on the intensity distribution within the laser beam. An image sensor may comprise a conventional array of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) arranged to detect the profile of light intensity across the width of the laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A more sophisticated sensor is a standard Shack-Hartmann sensor which comprises a microlens array that samples an incident wavefront over the aperture of the sensor and an image sensor that detects the position of a focussed spot of light in each microlens sub-aperture. Position data from the image sensor provides a measurement of the average wavefront slope across each sub-aperture as represented by the displacement of the respective focussed spot of light from the axis of the respective microlens. In order to provide an accurate representation of the total wavefront, the size of each sub-aperture is made small enough to capture the highest order aberration expected. However, the complexity of subsequent data processing increases rapidly with the number of microlenses in the array, reducing the sensor's speed. The image sensor is generally configured as a square array of individual sensors, such as a CCD array, but an array of position-sensitive detectors (PSDs) may be used alternatively.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Where the application is not photon-limited, it is possible to replace the microlens array with a Hartmann mask. A Hartmann mask is generally a mechanical mask with a square array of apertures. While the principle of operation is the same as for the standard Shack-Hartmann sensor, the Hartmann mask will obstruct more of the incident light than a microlens array.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is known to use Shack-Hartmann sensors directly as diagnostic tools for deriving wavefront and intensity information for a laser, and hence the intensity profile, as one measure of the quality of a laser beam. In particular, it is known to use either or both of a conventional CCD array and a Shack-Hartmann sensor in conjunction with a wavefront corrector or deformable mirror as part of an Adaptive Optics System, for example in an intra-cavity laser adaptive optics (AO) arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">From a first aspect, the present invention resides in a mirror structure, comprising a mirror having a reflective surface arranged to allow a portion of incident light to pass therethrough and wherein the mirror has at least one component of an optical sensor integrated therewith, arranged to receive light that passes through said reflective surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a preferred embodiment, at least a Hartmann mask of a Hartmann wavefront sensor is integrated with the mirror. If the mirror comprises a mirror substrate with the reflective surface applied thereto, then the Hartmann mask may comprise an array of apertures formed in the mirror substrate. Alternatively, if the mirror comprises a substantially transparent mirror substrate, then the Hartmann mask may be formed in a distinct layer within the mirror structure, for example one applied to a surface of the mirror substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the Hartmann mask is covered by a planarisation layer to which said reflective surface is applied. A planarisation layer may provide an optically flat and polished surface on which to apply the reflective surface of the mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further preferred embodiment, the at least one component of an optical sensor is a microlens array of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor integrated with the mirror. The microlens array may be covered by a planarisation layer to provide an optically flat polished surface for the reflective surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further preferred embodiment, the at least one component of an optical sensor is an optical detector. The optical detector may take one of a number of different forms according to what properties of the incident light are to be detected. For example, the optical detector may comprise a charge-coupled device (CCD) or position sensing detector (PSD). Such an optical detector may be integrated with either a plane mirror or with a deformable mirror that has an active layer of deformable material coupled to a passive substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably the optical detector is provided to detect the wavefront slope of the incident light at one or more points across the aperture of the mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the preferred Hartmann mask embodiments, the mirror may be a fixed profile mirror or it may be a deformable mirror. In a preferred embodiment, the mirror is a self-deforming mirror comprising an active layer of deformable material coupled to a substantially transparent passive substrate and wherein the Hartmann mask comprises an array of apertures formed in the active layer of deformable material. Of course, if the active layer is formed using a substantially transparent deformable material, such as a known form of single crystal piezo-electric material, then the Hartmann mask may be formed in another way, for example by an array of small apertures in a common electrode layer of the deformable mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the self-deforming mirror is supported by means of one or more passive flexible support elements coupled to a housing and wherein an optical detector is provided within the housing to detect the wavefront slope of the incident light at one or more points across the aperture of the mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The optical sensor in preferred embodiments of the present invention may comprise a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) array, a Position Sensitive Detector (PSD) or array of PSDs, a quad detector or array of quad detectors, or a Hartmann wavefront sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">From a second aspect, the present invention resides in a laser mirror comprising a mirror structure according to the first aspect, above. Such a device may be used as the main component in a simplified intra-cavity adaptive optics system, removing the need for a separate sensor and wavefront corrector. Because the sensor is integrated behind a mirror surface, only small amounts of light will reach the sensor. While integration of the sensor behind a mirror surface will exclude photon-limited applications such as Astronomy, this type of device is ideal for use with laser systems where interrogation of the wavefront or beam profile often requires some form of attenuation to ensure that excess laser power does not damage the optical sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A mirror structure incorporating at least one component of a Hartmann or a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor may be used with a laser cavity in either a closed loop or an open loop configuration.</p>

However, by way of introduction, a known type of wavefront sensor&#x2014;the Shack-Hartmann sensor&#x2014;suitable for use in preferred embodiments of the present invention, will firstly be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a sectional view is provided through a conventional Shack-Hartmann sensor <b>10</b> comprising an array of microlenses <b>12</b> that each sample an incident wavefront <b>14</b> over a sub-aperture of the sensor <b>10</b>, and an optical sensor <b>16</b>, comprising an array (typically square) of individual CCDs or PSDs that each detect the position of a focussed spot of light <b>18</b> in the respective sub-aperture. Position data from the image sensor <b>16</b> provides a set of measurements of average wavefront slope <b>20</b> across each sub-aperture as represented by the displacement <b>22</b> of the respective focussed spot of light <b>18</b> from the axis <b>24</b> of the focussing microlens <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to provide an accurate representation of the total wavefront <b>14</b>, the size of each sub-aperture, and hence of each microlens <b>12</b>, is made small enough to capture the highest order aberration that needs to be corrected for. However, the complexity of subsequent data processing increases rapidly with the number of microlenses <b>12</b> in the array, reducing the overall rate of response of the sensor <b>10</b> to changes in the wavefront <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Where the application is not photon-limited, it is known to replace the array of microlenses <b>12</b> with a so-called Hartmann mask. A Hartmann mask is generally a mechanical mask with a square array of apertures. While the principle of operation of a sensor incorporating a Hartmann mask is the same as for the conventional Shack-Hartmann sensor <b>10</b>, the Hartmann mask will obstruct more of the incident light than a microlens array, limiting its use to applications in which the light levels are going to be sufficiently high to be detectable by the image sensor <b>16</b> after passing through the Hartmann mask.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A simple known laser cavity structure will now be described briefly with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as one example of a potential application of Hartmann wavefront sensors. Features of this simple laser cavity will be referenced later when discussing applications of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a simple laser cavity <b>25</b> is bounded by a first laser mirror <b>26</b> and a second, partially reflective laser mirror <b>27</b>. Within the cavity a laser beam <b>28</b> is generated by a lasing medium <b>29</b> and travels between the first and second mirrors <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> before being output from the partially reflective second mirror <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is known to use Shack-Hartmann sensors <b>10</b> directly as diagnostic tools for deriving wavefront and intensity information for a laser, and hence the intensity profile, as one measure of the quality of a laser beam. In particular, it is known to use either or both of a conventional CCD array and a Shack-Hartmann sensor in conjunction with a wavefront corrector or deformable mirror as part of an Adaptive Optics System, for example in an intra-cavity laser adaptive optics (AO) arrangement as will now be described in outline with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a representation is provided of a laser cavity <b>30</b> that is bounded by a first laser mirror <b>32</b> and a second, partially reflective output mirror <b>34</b>. A laser beam <b>36</b>, generated within a lasing medium <b>38</b>, travels between the first laser mirror <b>32</b> and the second, partially reflective output mirror <b>34</b> by way of a third, fixed mirror <b>40</b> and a deformable mirror <b>42</b>. Light from the laser beam <b>36</b> is sampled by a beam splitter <b>44</b> placed in the path of the laser beam <b>36</b> between the deformable mirror <b>42</b> and the output mirror <b>34</b> to direct a portion of light <b>46</b> towards a wavefront sensor <b>48</b>, for example a Shack-Hartmann sensor <b>10</b> as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where the wavefront profile of the laser beam <b>36</b> may be detected. The wavefront sensor <b>48</b> outputs data to a controller <b>50</b> which determines, on the basis of those data, an appropriate deformation profile to apply to the deformable mirror <b>42</b> so as to make corresponding adjustments to the laser beam wavefront as is reflects from the deformable mirror <b>42</b> within the laser cavity <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A Shack-Hartmann sensor <b>10</b> may be used as a wavefront sensor <b>48</b> within the laser cavity <b>30</b> in either a closed loop or an open loop configuration. The distortions induced in a laser cavity are generally thermal in nature and so there will be no instantaneous response due to modifications applied by a wavefront corrector such as the deformable mirror <b>42</b>. For this reason, the controller <b>50</b> is generally arranged to implement an adaptive control system based around an iterative search algorithm. In a closed loop configuration such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the wavefront sensor <b>48</b> is placed after the wavefront correcting deformable mirror <b>42</b> so that it will detect any residual wavefront errors. An iterative control algorithm may be implemented by the controller <b>50</b> so that the system converges on an optimal level of correction for the laser beam <b>36</b>. This provides for more accurate wavefront correction than is possible in an open loop system in which the wavefront sensor precedes the wavefront corrector and there is no feedback loop, but its response will be faster than in a closed loop system.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described which enable a simplification of the adaptive optics intra-cavity arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, amongst other advantages. A first preferred embodiment will be now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, a sectional view is provided through a mirror structure <b>60</b> comprising a fixed mirror having a reflective surface <b>62</b> that is arranged to allow a small amount of light to pass through it, and a CCD or CMOS active pixel sensor array <b>64</b> integrated within the mirror structure <b>60</b>. The integrated sensor array <b>64</b> is arranged within the structure <b>60</b> such that light that passes through the reflective surface <b>62</b> may be detected by the sensor array <b>64</b>. Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, a plan view is provided of the same mirror structure <b>60</b> from a view point above the reflective surface <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, the mirror structure <b>60</b> comprises a thin layer (of the order of 300 &#x3bc;m) of silicon <b>66</b> on which the CCD or CMOS active pixel sensor array <b>64</b> is fabricated using conventional fabrication techniques. The size of the sensor array <b>64</b> is chosen to be wider than the intended optical aperture <b>65</b> which, in the case of an intra-cavity laser beam, is likely to be significantly less wide than the diameter of the reflective surface <b>62</b> and most likely confined to the central region of that surface <b>62</b>. A planarisation and/or passivation layer <b>68</b>, preferably of silicon dioxide or silicon nitride, or one layer of each, is applied to cover the sensor array <b>64</b> to a thickness sufficient to enable an optically flat polished surface to be provided above the sensor array <b>64</b>, suitable for the application of the reflective surface <b>62</b>. A passivation layer, in particular, may be required to ensure that any electrically conducting tracks on the surface of the silicon layer <b>66</b> are not shorted, in particular if the reflective surface <b>62</b> is provided by a coating of gold, for example. A planarisation layer may be required for example if the sensor array fabrication process leaves behind small surface features, for example tracking or exposed circuitry, which would lead to undesirable &#x201c;print-through&#x201d; on the reflective surface <b>62</b>. A planarisation layer would provide for a high quality, optically flat reflective surface <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The planarisation/passivation layers <b>68</b> are required to be at least partially transparent to light at the operating wavelength for the mirror, e.g. for a laser mirror, so that light may reach and be detectable by the sensor array <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably the silicon layer <b>66</b> is bonded to a rigid and supportive carrier layer <b>70</b>, preferably made from un-processed silicon or silicon carbide so as to have a similar expansion coefficient to the silicon layer <b>66</b> and, in the case of silicon carbide, to provide a highly thermally conductive layer to assist in the efficient removal of heat from the mirror structure <b>60</b> when applied to laser cavities. Because the silicon layer <b>66</b> is likely to be thin (e.g. 300 &#x3bc;m), it may be beneficial during assembly of the structure <b>60</b> to bond the silicon layer <b>66</b> to the carrier layer <b>70</b> before the planarisation/passivation layer <b>68</b> is polished flat, to provide additional support.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, the electrically conducting tracks to the sensors of the array <b>64</b> extend to the periphery of the silicon layer <b>66</b> and terminate with serial output pads <b>72</b> provided around the periphery of the mirror structure <b>60</b>. Interconnection to the peripheral serial output pads <b>72</b> may be achieved in a number of known ways, for example using a flexi-circuit of a type described in published international patent application WO 2005/124425, an elastomeric connector, wire bonding or soldering.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The level of attenuation to be introduced by the reflective surface coating <b>62</b> of the mirror is determined by a requirement to match, in a given application, the intensity of light transmitted to the sensor array <b>64</b> to the sensitivity of the sensors in the array <b>64</b>. The reflective surface <b>62</b> preferably comprises a coating of gold, enhanced gold or a multi-layer dielectric coating.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an alternative arrangement of the mirror structure <b>60</b>, the sensor array <b>64</b> may be integrated/bonded to a deeper layer within the mirror structure <b>60</b>, or even to the lowest surface of the mirror structure, if the intermediate layer or layers of substrate material are sufficiently transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The mirror structure <b>60</b> with the integrated sensor array <b>64</b>, described above, may be used in any number of known configurations. For example, in the laser cavity <b>30</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mirror structure <b>60</b> may replace one or both of the first or second laser mirrors <b>32</b> or <b>40</b>. This would simplify the laser cavity <b>30</b>, removing the need for the beamsplitter <b>44</b> and separate sensor <b>48</b>. If two such mirror structures <b>60</b> are incorporated in the laser cavity <b>30</b>, each may contribute different measures of laser beam quality to an adaptive optics control system.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The mirror structure <b>60</b> may be used in conjunction with an iterative search algorithm to control a deformable mirror for intra-cavity adaptive optics. One such algorithm is a hill-climbing algorithm which modifies the deformable mirror to maximise the optical power within a specific &#x2018;software aperture&#x2019; on the sensor array <b>64</b>. This type of algorithm is particularly suited to intra-cavity adaptive optics where the slow response of the cavity means that, after an adjustment of the deformable mirror, the cavity needs to be left to stabilise before any further adjustments are made.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a second preferred embodiment of the present invention, a mirror structure similar to the structure <b>60</b> described above, excluding the carrier layer <b>70</b>, may form the basis of a deformable mirror structure, as will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a sectional view is provided through a self-deforming mirror structure <b>80</b> comprising a thin (of the order of 300 &#x3bc;m) passive substrate layer <b>82</b>, preferably of silicon and corresponding to the silicon layer <b>66</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, bonded to an active PZT layer <b>84</b>. A sensor array <b>86</b> has been fabricated on the silicon layer <b>82</b> by conventional fabrication techniques, and a planarisation and/or passivation layer <b>88</b> has been applied to cover the sensor array <b>86</b> and any associated tracks to provide an optically flat surface for the application of an at least partially transmissive reflective surface <b>90</b>. Sensor output connection pads <b>92</b> are provided around the periphery of the deformable mirror structure <b>80</b> for interconnection via a cable <b>93</b> with the sensor array <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The active PZT layer <b>84</b> is provided on one face with a thin continuous electrode layer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), sandwiched between the silicon layer <b>82</b> and the PZT layer <b>84</b>, and on the other face with a patterned array of electrodes <b>94</b> to enable selected regions of the PZT layer <b>84</b> to be energised and thus deformed. Preferably a flexi-circuit <b>96</b> of the type referenced above may be connected to the electrodes <b>94</b> and an interconnect cable <b>98</b> may be provided to enable voltages to be supplied selectively to the electrodes <b>94</b>. The self-deforming parts (<b>82</b> to <b>96</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the mirror structure <b>80</b> are supported from below around their periphery by means of one or more compliant support elements <b>100</b> mounted on a rigid base <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Whereas, in the mirror structure <b>80</b>, the silicon layer <b>82</b> is bonded to a patterned PZT layer <b>84</b> to form a deformable mirror, it may alternatively be bonded to an array of actuators, for example piezo-tubes, PZT stacks or MEMS actuators to form a zonal deformable mirror. The silicon layer <b>82</b> may alternatively be added to a true bimorph deformable mirror structure, or form the top layer of a symmetric bimorph structure.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As an alternative to PZT, the layer of active material <b>84</b> may comprise a layer of a single crystal piezo-electric material of which known examples are substantially transparent to light, or a layer of an electrostrictive material.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The mirror structure <b>80</b> may conveniently be retro-fitted into an existing laser cavity, for example replacing the first laser mirror <b>26</b> in the simple laser cavity <b>25</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to enable adaptive optics to be added without increasing the complexity of the cavity. The usefulness of a deformable mirror in a simple laser cavity <b>25</b> is dependent upon the width of the laser beam <b>28</b> within the cavity <b>25</b>. If the beam width is too small then only the very lowest order distortion (e.g. spherical) would be correctable by the mirror structure <b>80</b>. However, such a mirror structure <b>80</b> may still prove very useful; the main optical distortion that will be present in a cavity will be driven by thermal lensing.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a third preferred embodiment of the present invention, a mirror structure will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in which a Hartmann mask is integrated with a laser mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, a sectional view is provided through a mirror structure <b>110</b> comprising a transparent mirror substrate <b>112</b>, made from glass for example, a reflective surface <b>114</b> that is arranged to allow a small amount of light to pass through it, a Hartmann mask <b>116</b> disposed between the reflective surface <b>114</b> and the mirror substrate <b>112</b> and a sensor <b>118</b> fabricated on a layer of silicon <b>120</b> or other semi-conductor material, arranged to receive light transmitted through the reflective surface <b>114</b>, the apertures of the Hartmann mask <b>116</b> and the mirror substrate <b>112</b>. Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, a plan view is provided of the same mirror structure <b>110</b> viewed from a position above the reflective surface <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The Hartmann mask <b>116</b> may comprise either a pre-formed Hartmann mask that is bonded to the mirror substrate <b>112</b> or a Hartmann mask formed by photolithography directly onto the surface of the mirror substrate <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A planarisation layer <b>122</b> is provided to cover the Hartmann mask <b>116</b> and to provide an optically flat and transparent polished surface onto which the reflective surface <b>114</b>, comprising a thin deposit of gold for example, is formed. Alternatively, the Hartmann Mask <b>116</b> may be bonded between two glass substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The depth of the mirror substrate <b>112</b>, and hence the separation of the sensor <b>118</b> from the Hartmann mask <b>116</b>, is selected according to the maximum wavefront slope that needs to be measured and the resolution of the sensor <b>118</b>. The sensor <b>118</b> may comprise a conventional CCD or an array of PSDs as described above, covered if necessary by a planarisation layer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to give a flat contact surface with the mirror substrate <b>112</b>, and may be mounted on the back of the mirror substrate <b>112</b> in such a way that it may be replaced if necessary. Interconnection to the sensor is provided by means if connection pads <b>124</b> provided around the periphery of the silicon layer <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For applications that involve use of the mirror structure <b>110</b> in a harsh environment, the sensor <b>118</b> may be hermetically bonded to the back of the mirror substrate <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In view of the high level of optical attenuation provided by the combination of a reflective surface coating <b>114</b> and a Hartmann Mask <b>116</b>, the mirror structure <b>110</b> according to this third preferred embodiment is likely to be used in a high power laser system.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention, a mirror structure is provided in which a microlens array and a sensor are integrated with a laser mirror to provide an integrated Shack-Hartmann sensor. The mirror structure according to this fourth preferred embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>, a sectional view is provided through a mirror structure <b>130</b> comprising a transparent mirror substrate <b>132</b>, made from glass for example, a reflective surface <b>134</b> that is arranged to allow a small amount of light to pass through it, a microlens array <b>136</b> disposed between the reflective surface <b>134</b> and the mirror substrate <b>132</b> and an optical sensor <b>138</b> arranged to receive light transmitted through the reflective surface <b>134</b>, the microlens array <b>136</b> and the mirror substrate <b>132</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In common with the sensors used in preferred embodiments described above, the sensor <b>138</b> comprises an CCD or an array of PSDs fabricated on a layer of silicon <b>140</b> or other semi-conductor material, covered if necessary with a planarisation layer <b>142</b> to provide a flat surface for bonding to the mirror substrate <b>132</b>. Connection pads <b>139</b> are provided, as above, for interconnection with the sensor <b>138</b>. A further planarisation layer <b>144</b> is formed to cover the microlens array <b>136</b> for the purpose of providing an optically flat polished surface ready to receive a layer of gold, for example, to form the reflective surface <b>134</b>. However, in order for the microlenses in the array <b>136</b> to function as lenses, the microlenses are formed using a material with a different refractive index to the material forming the planarisation layer <b>144</b>.</p>

However, if a transparent single crystal piezo-electric material were to be used for the active layer <b>152</b>, then the Hartmann mask may be implemented in a different way and may comprise an array or apertures formed only in the common electrode layer for example.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A partially transmissive reflective surface <b>158</b>, for example of gold, is carried by the passive substrate <b>154</b>, if necessary formed on an optically flat polished surface of a thin, optically transparent planarisation layer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) applied to cover the passive substrate <b>154</b>. A partitioned electrode layer <b>160</b> is provided to enable selected regions of the active layer <b>152</b> to be energised via a flexi-circuit <b>162</b> of a type referenced above.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The deformable mirror, comprising the components <b>152</b> to <b>164</b>, is supported preferably from below by means of a number of discrete passive flexible support elements <b>166</b> disposed around its periphery or, alternatively, by a continuous annular flexible support element <b>166</b>. The support elements <b>166</b> are mounted on an annular section <b>170</b> of a rigid housing that comprises the annular section <b>170</b> fixed to a base plate <b>172</b>. The rigid housing <b>170</b>, <b>172</b> encloses a cavity <b>174</b> beneath the supported deformable mirror components.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">An optical sensor <b>176</b> is provided within the rigid housing <b>170</b>, <b>172</b>, conveniently mounted within the cavity <b>174</b> on the base plate <b>172</b>, comprising an array of discrete quad detectors or an array of CCDs fabricated on a wafer of silicon <b>178</b> with each discrete detector centred below the position of a respective aperture <b>156</b> of the Hartmann mask.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The size of the apertures <b>156</b> is chosen to be large enough to let through enough of the incident light to be detectable by the sensor <b>176</b> but to be small enough so that &#x201c;print-through&#x201d; due to the apertures <b>156</b> is negligible at the mirror reflective surface <b>158</b>. Furthermore, because the apertures <b>156</b> for the Hartmann Mask are being created in the active PZT layer <b>152</b>, there will be a limit on the number of apertures <b>156</b> (Hartmann &#x201c;windows&#x201d;) and hence sensor array size that can be used. As more and more Hartmann windows are added, the amount of PZT remaining in the active layer <b>152</b> to generate the required mirror curvatures will be reduced, restricting the voltage sensitivity of the device. The position of each aperture <b>156</b> in the active layer <b>152</b> preferably coincides with a gap between electrodes in the electrode layer <b>160</b> to minimise the number of apertures that need to be formed in the electrodes.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this fifth preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it has been found that deformation of the active PZT layer <b>152</b> does not significantly affect the displacement of the centroids of light spots at the sensor array <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Whereas the mirror structure <b>150</b> in this fifth preferred embodiment is shown comprising a deformable mirror with a single active PZT layer <b>152</b>, a deformable mirror may be integrated with the structure <b>150</b> that uses other materials or is of a different type, for example a true bimorph or a symmetrical bimorph type of deformable mirror, or one of a type that is deformed using stacked actuators, PZT tubes, or MEMS devices.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The mirror structure <b>150</b> of this fifth preferred embodiment may be used to replace the first laser mirror <b>26</b> in the simple laser cavity <b>25</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In such an application, while there may be a limit on the number of individual Hartmann windows that can be added, this may not be an issue for intra-cavity wavefront correction where the main aberration that requires correction is the thermal lensing of the laser rod <b>28</b>. Depending on the geometry, the main distortions requiring correction will be either spherical or astigmatic. Spherical aberrations will be circularly symmetrical, and so may be determined using just one line of Hartmann windows/apertures <b>156</b> along a radius of the mirror. The astigmatic case may be determined with two orthogonal lines of Hartmann windows/apertures <b>156</b>, each along a radius of the mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The mirror structure <b>150</b> may be used extra-cavity but the control system would be based either on an iterative search algorithm system or it would be configured for open loop control. In a further refinement, the mirror structure <b>150</b> may be used in a distributed control configuration where the control for a particular element of the deformable mirror is calculated based only upon the outputs of sensors in the sensor array <b>176</b> that are closest to the axis of the mirror element.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The mirror structures in preferred embodiments of the present invention, described above, have provided different examples of both fixed and deformable mirrors each having at least a part of an optical wavefront sensor integrated with them to enable light passing through the reflective surfaces of the mirrors to be detected for the purpose of wavefront correction. Those parts of a wavefront sensor have included at least a Hartmann Mask for a Hartmann sensor or the microlens array for a Shack-Hartmann sensor. Preferred positions of those parts within the mirror structures have been discussed but preferred mirror structures according to the present invention would not be limited to those positions. Furthermore, preferred sensor configurations have also been discussed, but preferred mirror structures according to the present invention are not limited to those configurations and alternative configurations are included within the scope of the present invention, as would be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in this field.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Whereas laser applications have been discussed, in particular, it will be clear that mirror structures according to the present invention may be applied to any field where the incident light levels are sufficient to enable wavefront measurement using those mirror structures.</p>
