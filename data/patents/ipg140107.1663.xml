<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A golf club comprises a shaft, a club head, and a connection assembly that allows the shaft to be easily disconnected from the club head. In particular embodiments, the connection assembly includes a removable hosel sleeve that allows a shaft to be supported a desired predetermined orientation relative to the club head. In this manner, the shaft loft and/or lie angle of the club can be adjusted without resorting to traditional bending of the shaft. In another embodiment, the club head has an adjustable sole that can be adjusted upwardly and downwardly relative to the strike face of the club head, which is effective to adjust the face angle of the club head.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application is directed to embodiments of a golf club, particularly a golf club head that is removably attachable to a golf club shaft.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For a given type of golf club (e.g., driver, iron, putter, wedge), the golfing consumer has a wide variety of variations to choose from. This variety is driven, in part, by the wide range in physical characteristics and golfing skill among golfers and by the broad spectrum of playing conditions that a golfer may encounter. For example, taller golfers require clubs with longer shafts; more powerful golfers or golfers playing in windy conditions or on a course with firm fairways may desire clubs having less shaft flex (greater stiffness); and a golfer may desire a club with certain playing characteristics to overcome a tendency in their swing (e.g., a golfer who has a tendency to hit low-trajectory shots may want to purchase a club with a greater loft angle). Variations in shaft flex, loft angle and handedness (i.e., left or right) alone account for 24 variations of the TaylorMade r7 460 driver.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Having such a large number of variations available for a single golf club, golfing consumers can purchase clubs with club head-shaft combinations that suit their needs. However, shafts and club heads are generally manufactured separately, and once a shaft is attached to a club head, usually by an adhesive, replacing either the club head or shaft is not easily done by the consumer. Motivations for modifying a club include a change in a golfer's physical condition (e.g., a younger golfer has grown taller), an increase the golfer's skill or to adjust to playing conditions. Typically, these modifications must be made by a technician at a pro shop. The attendant cost and time spent without clubs may dissuade golfers from modifying their clubs as often as they would like, resulting in a less-than-optimal golfing experience. Thus, there has been effort to provide golf clubs that are capable of being assembled and disassembled by the golfing consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To that end, golf clubs having club heads that are removably attached to a shaft by a mechanical fastener are known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,083,529 to Cackett et al (hereinafter, &#x201c;Cackett&#x201d;) discloses a golf club with interchangeable head-shaft connections. The connection includes a tube, a sleeve and a mechanical fastener. The sleeve is mounted on a tip end of the shaft. The shaft with the sleeve mounted thereon is then inserted in the tube, which is mounted in the club head. The mechanical fastener secures the sleeve to the tube to retain the shaft in connection with the club head. The sleeve has a lower section that includes a keyed portion which has a configuration that is complementary to the keyway defined by a rotation prevention portion of the tube. The keyway has a non-circular cross-section to prevent rotation of the sleeve relative to the tube. The keyway may have a plurality of splines, or a rectangular or hexagonal cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While removably attachable golf club heads of the type represented by Cackett provide golfers with the ability to disassemble a club head from a shaft, it is necessary that they also provide club head-shaft interconnections that have the integrity and rigidity of conventional club head-shaft interconnection. For example, the manner in which rotational movement between the constituent components of a club head&#x2014;shaft interconnection is restricted must have sufficient load-bearing areas and resistance to stripping. Consequently, there is room for improvement in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a representative embodiment, a golf club shaft assembly for attaching to a club head comprises a shaft having a lower end portion and a sleeve mounted on the lower end portion of the shaft.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; refer to one or more than one, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As used herein, the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; means &#x201c;comprises.&#x201d; For example, a device that includes or comprises A and B contains A and B but may optionally contain C or other components other than A and B. A device that includes or comprises A or B may contain A or B or A and B, and optionally one or more other components such as C.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, there is shown characteristic angles of golf clubs by way of reference to a golf club head <b>300</b> having a removable shaft <b>50</b>, according to one embodiment. The club head <b>300</b> comprises a centerface, or striking face, <b>310</b>, scorelines <b>320</b>, a hosel <b>330</b> having a hosel opening <b>340</b>, and a sole <b>350</b>. The hosel <b>330</b> has a hosel longitudinal axis <b>60</b> and the shaft <b>50</b> has a shaft longitudinal axis. In the illustrated embodiment, the ideal impact location <b>312</b> of the golf club head <b>300</b> is disposed at the geometric center of the striking surface <b>310</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The ideal impact location <b>312</b> is typically defined as the intersection of the midpoints of a height (H<sub>ss</sub>) and width (W<sub>ss</sub>) of the striking surface <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Both H<sub>ss </sub>and W<sub>ss </sub>are determined using the striking face curve (S<sub>ss</sub>). The striking face curve is bounded on its periphery by all points where the face transitions from a substantially uniform bulge radius (face heel-to-toe radius of curvature) and a substantially uniform roll radius (face crown-to-sole radius of curvature) to the body (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the illustrated example, H<sub>ss </sub>is the distance from the periphery proximate the sole portion of S<sub>ss </sub>to the perhiphery proximate the crown portion of S<sub>ss </sub>measured in a vertical plane (perpendicular to ground) that extends through the geometric center of the face. Similarly, W<sub>ss </sub>is the distance from the periphery proximate the heel portion of S<sub>ss </sub>to the periphery proximate the toe portion of S<sub>ss </sub>measured in a horizontal plane (e.g., substantially parallel to ground) that extends through the geometric center of the face. See USGA &#x201c;Procedure for Measuring the Flexibility of a Golf Clubhead,&#x201d; Revision 2.0 for the methodology to measure the geometric center of the striking face.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a lie angle <b>10</b> (also referred to as the &#x201c;scoreline lie angle&#x201d;) is defined as the angle between the hosel longitudinal axis <b>60</b> and a playing surface <b>70</b> when the club is in the grounded address position. The grounded address position is defined as the resting position of the head on the playing surface when the shaft is supported at the grip (free to rotate about its axis) and the shaft is held at an angle to the ground such that the scorelines <b>320</b> are horizontal (if the club does not have scorelines, then the lie shall be set at 60-degrees). The centerface target line vector is defined as a horizontal vector which is perpendicular to the shaft when the club is in the address position and points outward from the centerface point. The target line plane is defined as a vertical plane which contains the centerface target line vector. The square face address position is defined as the head position when the sole is lifted off the ground, and the shaft is held (both positionally and rotationally) such that the scorelines are horizontal and the centerface normal vector completely lies in the target line plane (if the head has no scorelines, then the shaft shall be held at 60-degrees relative to ground and then the head rotated about the shaft axis until the centerface normal vector completely lies in the target line plane). The actual, or measured, lie angle can be defined as the angle <b>10</b> between the hosel longitudinal axis <b>60</b> and the playing surface <b>70</b>, whether or not the club is held in the grounded address position with the scorelines horizontal. Studies have shown that most golfers address the ball with actual lie angle that is 10 to 20 degrees less than the intended scoreline lie angle <b>10</b> of the club. The studies have also shown that for most golfers the actual lie angle at impact is between 0 and 10 degrees less than the intended scoreline lie angle <b>10</b> of the club.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a loft angle <b>20</b> of the club head (referred to as &#x201c;square loft&#x201d;) is defined as the angle between the centerface normal vector and the ground plane when the head is in the square face address position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, a hosel loft angle <b>72</b> is defined as the angle between the hosel longitudinal axis <b>60</b> projected onto the target line plane and a plane <b>74</b> that is tangent to the center of the centerface. The shaft loft angle is the angle between plane <b>74</b> and the longitudinal axis of the shaft <b>50</b> projected onto the target line plane. The &#x201c;grounded loft&#x201d; <b>80</b> of the club head is the vertical angle of the centerface normal vector when the club is in the grounded address position (i.e., when the sole <b>350</b> is resting on the ground), or stated differently, the angle between the plane <b>74</b> of the centerface and a vertical plane when the club is in the grounded address position.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a face angle <b>30</b> is defined by the horizontal component of the centerface normal vector and a vertical plane (&#x201c;target line plane&#x201d;) that is normal to the vertical plane which contains the shaft longitudinal axis when the shaft <b>50</b> is in the correct lie (i.e., typically 60 degrees+/&#x2212;5 degrees) and the sole <b>350</b> is resting on the playing surface <b>70</b> (the club is in the grounded address position).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The lie angle <b>10</b> and/or the shaft loft can be modified by adjusting the position of the shaft <b>50</b> relative to the club head. Traditionally, adjusting the position of the shaft has been accomplished by bending the shaft and the hosel relative to the club head. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the lie angle <b>10</b> can be increased by bending the shaft and the hosel inward toward the club head <b>300</b>, as depicted by shaft longitudinal axis <b>64</b>. The lie angle <b>10</b> can be decreased by bending the shaft and the hosel outward from the club head <b>300</b>, as depicted by shaft longitudinal axis <b>62</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, bending the shaft and the hosel forward toward the striking face <b>310</b>, as depicted by shaft longitudinal axis <b>66</b>, increases the shaft loft. Bending the shaft and the hosel rearward toward the rear of the club head, as depicted by shaft longitudinal axis <b>68</b>, decreases the shaft loft. It should be noted that in a conventional club the shaft loft typically is the same as the hosel loft because both the shaft and the hosel are bent relative to the club head. In certain embodiments disclosed herein, the position of the shaft can be adjusted relative to the hosel to adjust shaft loft. In such cases, the shaft loft of the club is adjusted while the hosel loft is unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Adjusting the shaft loft is effective to adjust the square loft of the club by the same amount. Similarly, when shaft loft is adjusted and the club head is placed in the address position, the face angle of the club head increases or decreases in proportion to the change in shaft loft. Hence, shaft loft is adjusted to effect changes in square loft and face angle. In addition, the shaft and the hosel can be bent to adjust the lie angle and the shaft loft (and therefore the square loft and the face angle) by bending the shaft and the hosel in a first direction inward or outward relative to the club head to adjust the lie angle and in a second direction forward or rearward relative to the club head to adjust the shaft loft.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Head-Shaft Connection Assembly</heading>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Now with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, there is shown a golf club comprising a golf club head <b>300</b> attached to a golf club shaft <b>50</b> via a removable head-shaft connection assembly, which generally comprises in the illustrated embodiment a shaft sleeve <b>100</b>, a hosel insert <b>200</b> and a screw <b>400</b>. The club head <b>300</b> is formed with a hosel opening, or passageway, <b>340</b> that extends from the hosel <b>330</b> through the club head and opens at the sole, or bottom surface, of the club head. Generally, the club head <b>300</b> is removably attached to the shaft <b>50</b> by the sleeve <b>100</b> (which is mounted to the lower end portion of the shaft <b>50</b>) by inserting the sleeve <b>100</b> into the hosel opening <b>340</b> and the hosel insert <b>200</b> (which is mounted inside the hosel opening <b>340</b>), and inserting the screw <b>400</b> upwardly through the opening in the sole and tightening the screw into a threaded opening of the sleeve, thereby securing the club head <b>300</b> to the sleeve <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">By way of example, the club head <b>300</b> comprises the head of a &#x201c;wood-type&#x201d; golf club. All of the embodiments disclosed in the present specification can be implemented in all types of golf clubs, including but not limited to, drivers, fairway woods, utility clubs, putters, wedges, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As used herein, a shaft that is &#x201c;removably attached&#x201d; to a club head means that the shaft can be connected to the club head using one or more mechanical fasteners, such as a screw or threaded ferrule, without an adhesive, and the shaft can be disconnected and separated from the head by loosening or removing the one or more mechanical fasteners without the need to break an adhesive bond between two components.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The sleeve <b>100</b> is mounted to a lower, or tip end portion <b>90</b> of the shaft <b>50</b>. The sleeve <b>100</b> can be adhesively bonded, welded or secured in equivalent fashion to the lower end portion of the shaft <b>50</b>. In other embodiments, the sleeve <b>100</b> may be integrally formed as part of the shaft <b>50</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a ferrule <b>52</b> can be mounted to the end portion <b>90</b> of the shaft just above shaft sleeve <b>100</b> to provide a smooth transition between the shaft sleeve and the shaft and to conceal the glue line between the shaft and the sleeve. The ferrule also helps minimize tip breakage of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the hosel opening <b>340</b> extends through the club head <b>300</b> and has hosel sidewalls <b>350</b>. A flange <b>360</b> extends radially inward from the hosel sidewalls <b>350</b> and forms the bottom wall of the hosel opening. The flange defines a passageway <b>370</b>, a flange upper surface <b>380</b> and a flange lower surface <b>390</b>. The hosel insert <b>200</b> can be mounted within the hosel opening <b>340</b> with a bottom surface <b>250</b> of the insert contacting the flange upper surface <b>380</b>. The hosel insert <b>200</b> can be adhesively bonded, welded, brazed or secured in another equivalent fashion to the hosel sidewalls <b>350</b> and/or the flange to secure the insert <b>200</b> in place. In other embodiments, the hosel insert <b>200</b> can be formed integrally with the club head <b>300</b> (e.g., the insert can be formed and/or machined directly in the hosel opening).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">To restrict rotational movement of the shaft <b>50</b> relative to the head <b>300</b> when the club head <b>300</b> is attached to the shaft <b>50</b>, the sleeve <b>100</b> has a rotation prevention portion that mates with a complementary rotation prevention portion of the insert <b>200</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the shaft sleeve has a lower portion <b>150</b> having a non-circular configuration complementary to a non-circular configuration of the hosel insert <b>200</b>. In this way, the sleeve lower portion <b>150</b> defines a keyed portion that is received by a keyway defined by the hosel insert <b>200</b>. In particular embodiments, the rotational prevention portion of the sleeve comprises longitudinally extending external splines <b>500</b> formed on an external surface <b>160</b> of the sleeve lower portion <b>150</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref> and the rotation prevention portion of the insert comprises complementary-configured internal splines <b>240</b>, formed on an inner surface <b>250</b> of the hosel insert <b>200</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>.

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the screw <b>400</b> comprises a head <b>410</b> having a surface <b>420</b>, and threads <b>430</b>. The screw <b>400</b> is used to secure the club head <b>300</b> to the shaft <b>50</b> by inserting the screw through passageway <b>370</b> and tightening the screw into a threaded bottom opening <b>196</b> in the sleeve <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, the club head <b>300</b> can be secured to the shaft <b>50</b> by other mechanical fasteners. When the screw <b>400</b> is fully engaged with the sleeve <b>100</b>, the head surface <b>420</b> contacts the flange lower surface <b>390</b> and an annular thrust surface <b>130</b> of the sleeve <b>100</b> contacts a hosel upper surface <b>395</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The sleeve <b>100</b>, the hosel insert <b>200</b>, the sleeve lower opening <b>196</b>, the hosel opening <b>340</b> and the screw <b>400</b> in the illustrated example are co-axially aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">It is desirable that a golf club employing a removable club head-shaft connection assembly as described in the present application have substantially similar weight and distribution of mass as an equivalent conventional golf club so that the golf club employing a removable shaft has the same &#x201c;feel&#x201d; as the conventional club. Thus, it is desired that the various components of the connection assembly (e.g., the sleeve <b>100</b>, the hosel insert <b>200</b> and the screw <b>400</b>) are constructed from light-weight, high-strength metals and/or alloys (e.g., T6 temper aluminum alloy 7075, grade 5 6Al-4V titanium alloy, etc.) and designed with an eye towards conserving mass that can be used elsewhere in the golf club to enhance desirable golf club characteristics (e.g., increasing the size of the &#x201c;sweet spot&#x201d; of the club head or shifting the center of gravity to optimize launch conditions).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The golf club having an interchangeable shaft and club head as described in the present application provides a golfer with a club that can be easily modified to suit the particular needs or playing style of the golfer. A golfer can replace the club head <b>300</b> with another club head having desired characteristics (e.g., different loft angle, larger face area, etc.) by simply unscrewing the screw <b>400</b> from the sleeve <b>100</b>, replacing the club head and then screwing the screw <b>400</b> back into the sleeve <b>100</b>. The shaft <b>50</b> similarly can be exchanged. In some embodiments, the sleeve <b>100</b> can be removed from the shaft <b>50</b> and mounted on the new shaft, or the new shaft can have another sleeve already mounted on or formed integral to the end of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In particular embodiments, any number of shafts are provided with the same sleeve and any number of club heads is provided with the same hosel configuration and hosel insert <b>200</b> to receive any of the shafts. In this manner, a pro shop or retailer can stock a variety of different shafts and club heads that are interchangeable. A club or a set of clubs that is customized to suit the needs of a consumer can be immediately assembled at the retail location.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>, there is shown the sleeve <b>100</b> of the club head-shaft connection assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>. The sleeve <b>100</b> in the illustrated embodiment is substantially cylindrical and desirably is made from a light-weight, high-strength material (e.g., T6 temper aluminum alloy 7075). The sleeve <b>100</b> includes a middle portion <b>110</b>, an upper portion <b>120</b> and a lower portion <b>150</b>. The upper portion <b>120</b> can have a wider thickness than the remainder of the sleeve as shown to provide, for example, additional mechanical integrity to the connection between the shaft <b>50</b> and the sleeve <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, the upper portion <b>120</b> may have a flared or frustroconical shape, to provide, for example, a more streamlined transition between the shaft <b>50</b> and club head <b>300</b>. The boundary between the upper portion <b>120</b> and the middle portion <b>110</b> comprises an upper annular thrust surface <b>130</b> and the boundary between the middle portion <b>110</b> and the lower portion <b>150</b> comprises a lower annular surface <b>140</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the annular surface <b>130</b> is perpendicular to the external surface of the middle portion <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, the annular surface <b>130</b> may be frustroconical or otherwise taper from the upper portion <b>120</b> to the middle portion <b>110</b>. The annular surface <b>130</b> bears against the hosel upper surface <b>395</b> when the shaft <b>50</b> is secured to the club head <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sleeve <b>100</b> further comprises an upper opening <b>192</b> for receiving the lower end portion <b>90</b> of the shaft <b>50</b> and an internally threaded opening <b>196</b> in the lower portion <b>150</b> for receiving the screw <b>400</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper opening <b>192</b> has an annular surface <b>194</b> configured to contact a corresponding surface <b>70</b> of the shaft <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In other embodiments, the upper opening <b>192</b> can have a configuration adapted to mate with various shaft profiles (e.g., a constant inner diameter, plurality of stepped inner diameters, chamfered and/or perpendicular annular surfaces, etc.). With reference to the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, splines <b>500</b> are located below opening <b>192</b> (and therefore below the lower end of the shaft) to minimize the overall diameter of the sleeve. The threads in the lower opening <b>196</b> can be formed using a Spiralock&#xae; tap.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As noted above, the rotation prevention portion of the sleeve <b>100</b> for restricting relative rotation between the shaft and the club comprises a plurality of external splines <b>500</b> formed on an external surface of the lower portion <b>150</b> and gaps, or keyways, between adjacent splines <b>500</b>. Each keyway has an outer surface <b>160</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>, <b>9</b>-<b>10</b>, the sleeve comprises eight angularly spaced splines <b>500</b> elongated in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the sleeve <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</figref>, each of the splines <b>500</b> in the illustrated configuration has a pair of sidewalls <b>560</b> extending radially outwardly from the external surface <b>160</b>, beveled top and bottom edges <b>510</b>, bottom chamfered corners <b>520</b> and an arcuate outer surface <b>550</b>. The sidewalls <b>560</b> desirably diverge or flair moving in a radially outward direction so that the width of the spline near the outer surface <b>550</b> is greater than the width at the base of the spline (near surface <b>160</b>). With reference to features depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the splines <b>500</b> have a height H (the distance the sidewalls <b>550</b> extend radially from the external surface <b>160</b>), and a width W<sub>1 </sub>at the mid-span of the spline (the straight line distance extending between sidewalls <b>560</b> measured at locations of the sidewalls equidistant from the outer surface <b>550</b> and the surface <b>160</b>). In other embodiments, the sleeve comprises more or fewer splines and the splines <b>500</b> can have different shapes and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Embodiments employing the spline configuration depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref> provide several advantages. For example, a sleeve having fewer, larger splines provides for greater interference between the sleeve and the hosel insert, which enhances resistance to stripping, increases the load-bearing area between the sleeve and the hosel insert and provides for splines that are mechanically stronger. Further, complexity of manufacturing may be reduced by avoiding the need to machine smaller spline features. For example, various Rosch-manufacturing techniques (e.g., rotary, thru-broach or blind-broach) may not be suitable for manufacturing sleeves or hosel inserts having more, smaller splines. In some embodiments, the splines <b>500</b> have a spline height H of between about 0.15 mm to about 1.0 mm with a height H of about 0.5 mm being a specific example and a spline width W<sub>1 </sub>of between about 0.979 mm to about 2.87 mm, with a width W<sub>1 </sub>of about 1.367 mm being a specific example.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The non-circular configuration of the sleeve lower portion <b>150</b> can be adapted to limit the manner in which the sleeve <b>100</b> is positionable within the hosel insert <b>200</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>, the splines <b>500</b> are substantially identical in shape and size. Six of the eight spaces between adjacent splines can have a spline-to-spline spacing S<sub>1 </sub>and two diametrically-opposed spaces can have a spline-to-spline spacing S<sub>2</sub>, where S<sub>2 </sub>is a different than S<sub>1 </sub>(S<sub>2 </sub>is greater than S<sub>1 </sub>in the illustrated embodiment). In the illustrated embodiment, the arc angle of S<sub>1 </sub>is about 21 degrees and the arc angle of S<sub>2 </sub>is about 33 degrees. This spline configuration allows the sleeve <b>100</b> to be dually positionable within the hosel insert <b>200</b> (i.e., the sleeve <b>100</b> can be inserted in the insert <b>200</b> at two positions, spaced 180 degrees from each other, relative to the insert). Alternatively, the splines can be equally spaced from each other around the longitudinal axis of the sleeve. In other embodiments, different non-circular configurations of the lower portion <b>150</b> (e.g., triangular, hexagonal, more of fewer splines) can provide for various degrees of positionability of the shaft sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The sleeve lower portion <b>150</b> can have a generally rougher outer surface relative to the remaining surfaces of the sleeve <b>100</b> in order to provide, for example, greater friction between the sleeve <b>100</b> and the hosel insert <b>200</b> to further restrict rotational movement between the shaft <b>50</b> and the club head <b>300</b>. In particular embodiments, the external surface <b>160</b> can be roughened by sandblasting, although alternative methods or techniques can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The general configuration of the sleeve <b>100</b> can vary from the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>. In other embodiments, for example, the relative lengths of the upper portion <b>120</b>, the middle portion <b>110</b> and the lower portion <b>150</b> can vary (e.g., the lower portion <b>150</b> could comprise a greater or lesser proportion of the overall sleeve length). In additional embodiments, additional sleeve surfaces could contact corresponding surfaces in the hosel insert <b>200</b> or hosel opening <b>340</b> when the club head <b>300</b> is attached to the shaft <b>50</b>. For example, annular surface <b>140</b> of the sleeve may contact upper spline surfaces <b>230</b> of the hosel insert <b>200</b>, annular surface <b>170</b> of the sleeve may contact a corresponding surface on an inner surface of the hosel insert <b>200</b>, and/or a bottom face <b>180</b> of the sleeve may contact the flange upper surface <b>360</b>. In additional embodiments, the lower opening <b>196</b> of the sleeve can be in communication with the upper opening <b>192</b>, defining a continuous sleeve opening and reducing the weight of the sleeve <b>100</b> by removing the mass of material separating openings <b>196</b> and <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>, the hosel insert <b>200</b> desirably is substantially tubular or cylindrical and can be made from a light-weight, high-strength material (e.g., grade 5 6Al-4V titanium alloy). The hosel insert <b>200</b> comprises an inner surface <b>250</b> having a non-circular configuration complementary to the non-circular configuration of the external surface of the sleeve lower portion <b>150</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the non-circulation configuration comprises splines <b>240</b> complementary in shape and size to the splines <b>500</b> of the sleeve <b>150</b>. That is, there are eight splines <b>240</b> elongated in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the hosel insert <b>200</b> and the splines <b>240</b> have sidewalls <b>260</b> extending radially inward from the inner surface <b>250</b>, chamfered top edges <b>230</b> and an inner surface <b>270</b>. The sidewalls <b>260</b> desirably taper or converge toward each other moving in a radially inward direction to mate with the flared splines <b>500</b> of the sleeve. The radially inward sidewalls <b>260</b> have at least one advantage in that full surface contact occurs between the teeth and the mating teeth of the sleeve insert. In addition, at least one advantage, is that the translational movement is more constrained within the assembly compared to other spline geometries having the same tolerance. Furthermore, the radially inward sidewalls <b>260</b> promote full sidewall engagement rather than localized contact resulting in higher stresses and lower durability.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">With reference to the features of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the spline configuration of the hosel insert is complementary to the spline configuration of the sleeve lower portion <b>150</b> and as such, adjacent pairs of splines <b>240</b> have a spline-to-spline spacing S<sub>3 </sub>that is slightly greater than the width of the sleeve splines <b>500</b>. Six of the splines <b>240</b> have a width W<sub>2 </sub>slightly less than inter-spline spacing S<sub>1 </sub>of the sleeve splines <b>500</b> and two diametrically-opposed splines have a width W<sub>3 </sub>slightly less than inter-spline spacing S<sub>2 </sub>of the sleeve splines <b>500</b>, wherein W<sub>2 </sub>is less than W<sub>3</sub>. In additional embodiments, the hosel insert inner surface can have various non-circular configurations complementary to the non-circular configuration of the sleeve lower portion <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Selected surfaces of the hosel insert <b>200</b> can be roughened in a similar manner to the exterior surface <b>160</b> of the shaft. In some embodiments, the entire surface area of the insert can be provided with a roughened surface texture. In other embodiments, only the inner surface <b>240</b> of the hosel insert <b>200</b> can be roughened.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the screw <b>400</b> desirably is made from a light-weight, high-strength material (e.g., T6 temper aluminum alloy 7075). In certain embodiments, the major diameter (i.e., outer diameter) of the threads <b>430</b> is less than 6 mm (e.g., ISO screws smaller than M6) and is either about 4 mm or 5 mm (e.g., M4 or M5 screws). In general, reducing the thread diameter increases the ability of the screw to elongate or stretch when placed under a load, resulting in a greater preload for a given torque. The use of relatively smaller diameter screws (e.g., M4 or M5 screws) allows a user to secure the club head to the shaft with less effort and allows the golfer to use the club for longer periods of time before having to retighten the screw.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The head <b>410</b> of the screw can be configured to be compatible with a torque wrench or other torque-limiting mechanism. In some embodiments, the screw head comprises a &#x201c;hexalobular&#x201d; internal driving feature (e.g., a TORX screw drive) (such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) to facilitate application of a consistent torque to the screw and to resist cam-out of screwdrivers. Securing the club head <b>300</b> to the shaft <b>50</b> with a torque wrench can ensure that the screw <b>400</b> is placed under a substantially similar preload each time the club is assembled, ensuring that the club has substantially consistent playing characteristics each time the club is assembled. In additional embodiments, the screw head <b>410</b> can comprise various other drive designs (e.g., Phillips, Pozidriv, hexagonal, TTAP, etc.), and the user can use a conventional screwdriver rather than a torque wrench to tighten the screw.</p>

where E is the Young's modulus of the material of the element, A is the cross-sectional area of the element and L is the length of the element. The lower the axial stiffness of an element, the greater the element will elongate when placed in tension or shorten when placed in compression. A club head-shaft connection having low axial stiffness is desirable to maximize elongation of the screw <b>400</b> and the sleeve, allowing for greater preload to be applied to the screw <b>400</b> for better retaining the shaft to the club head. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, when the screw <b>400</b> is tightened into the sleeve lower opening <b>196</b>, various surfaces of the sleeve <b>100</b>, the hosel insert <b>200</b>, the flange <b>360</b> and the screw <b>400</b> contact each other as previously described, which is effective to place the screw, the shaft, and the sleeve in tension and the hosel in compression.

L<sub>screw </sub>is the length of the portion of the screw placed in tension (measured from the flange bottom <b>390</b> to the bottom end of the shaft sleeve).

<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The components of the connection assembly can be modified to achieve different values. For example, the screw <b>400</b> can be longer than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In some embodiments, the length of the opening <b>196</b> can be increased along with a corresponding increase in the length of the screw <b>400</b>. In additional embodiments, the construction of the hosel opening <b>340</b> can vary to accommodate a longer screw. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a club head <b>600</b> comprises an upper flange <b>610</b> defining the bottom wall of the hosel opening and a lower flange <b>620</b> spaced from the upper flange <b>610</b> to accommodate a longer screw <b>630</b>. Such a hosel construction can accommodate a longer screw, and thus can achieve a lower k<sub>eff</sub>, while retaining compatibility with the sleeve <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-10</figref>, the cross-sectional area of the sleeve <b>100</b> is minimized to minimize k<sub>sleeve </sub>by placing the splines <b>500</b> below the shaft, rather than around the shaft as used in prior art configurations.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In certain embodiments, a shaft sleeve can have 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 splines. The height H of the splines of the shaft sleeve in particular embodiments can range from about 0.15 mm to about 0.95 mm, and more particularly from about 0.25 mm to about 0.75 mm, and even more particularly from about 0.5 mm to about 0.75 mm. The average diameter D of the spline portion of the shaft sleeve can range from about 6 mm to about 12 mm, with 8.45 mm being a specific example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the average diameter is the diameter of the spline portion of a shaft sleeve measured between two points located at the mid-spans of two diametrically opposed splines.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The length L of the splines of the shaft sleeve in particular embodiments can range from about 2 mm to about 10 mm. For example, when the connection assembly is implemented in a driver, the splines can be relatively longer, for example, 7.5 mm or 10 mm. When the connection assembly is implemented in a fairway wood, which is typically smaller than a driver, it is desirable to use a relatively shorter shaft sleeve because less space is available inside the club head to receive the shaft sleeve. In that case, the splines can be relatively shorter, for example, 2 mm or 3 mm in length, to reduce the overall length of the shaft sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The ratio of spline width W<sub>1 </sub>(at the midspan of the spline) to average diameter of the spline portion of the shaft sleeve in particular embodiments can range from about 0.1 to about 0.5, and more desirably, from about 0.15 to about 0.35, and even more desirably from about 0.16 to about 0.22. The ratio of spline width W<sub>1 </sub>to spline H in particular embodiments can range from about 1.0 to about 22, and more desirably from about 2 to about 4, and even more desirably from about 2.3 to about 3.1. The ratio of spline length L to average diameter in particular embodiments can range from about 0.15 to about 1.7.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Tables 2-4 below provide dimensions for a plurality of different spline configurations for the sleeve <b>100</b> (and other shaft sleeves disclosed herein). In Table 2, the average radius R is the radius of the spline portion of a shaft sleeve measured at the mid-span of a spine, i.e., at a location equidistant from the base of the spline at surface <b>160</b> and to the outer surface <b>550</b> of the spline (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The arc length in Tables 2 and 3 is the arc length of a spline at the average radius.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Table 2 shows the spline arc angle, average radius, average diameter, arc length, arc length, arc length/average radius ratio, width at midspan, width (at midspan)/average diameter ratio for different shaft sleeves having 8 splines (with two 33 degree gaps as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), 8 equally-spaced splines, 6 equally-spaced splines, 10 equally-spaced splines, 4 equally-spaced splines. Table 3 shows examples of shaft sleeves having different number of splines and spline heights. Table 4 shows examples of different combinations of lengths and average diameters for shaft sleeves apart from the number of splines, spline height H, and spline width W<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The specific dimensions provided in the present specification for the shaft sleeve <b>100</b> (as well as for other components disclosed herein) are given to illustrate the invention and not to limit it. The dimensions provided herein can be modified as needed in different applications or situations.</p>

<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Now with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>, there is shown a golf club comprising a head <b>700</b> attached to a removable shaft <b>800</b> via a removable head-shaft connection assembly. The connection assembly generally comprises a shaft sleeve <b>900</b>, a hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> (also referred to herein as an adapter sleeve), a hosel insert <b>1100</b>, a washer <b>1200</b> and a screw <b>1300</b>. The club head <b>700</b> comprises a hosel <b>702</b> defining a hosel opening, or passageway <b>710</b>. The passageway <b>710</b> in the illustrated embodiment extends through the club head and forms an opening in the sole of the club head to accept the screw <b>1300</b>. Generally, the club head <b>700</b> is removably attached to the shaft <b>800</b> by the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> (which is mounted to the lower end portion of the shaft <b>800</b>) being inserted into and engaging the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b>. The hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> is inserted into and engages the hosel insert <b>1100</b> (which is mounted inside the hosel opening <b>710</b>). The screw <b>1300</b> is tightened into a threaded opening of the shaft sleeve <b>900</b>, with the washer <b>1200</b> being disposed between the screw <b>1300</b> and the hosel insert <b>1100</b>, to secure the shaft to the club head.</p>

<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Accordingly, the shaft sleeve lower portion <b>950</b> defines a keyed portion that is received by a keyway defined by the hosel sleeve inner surface <b>1096</b>, and hosel sleeve outer surface <b>1050</b> defines a keyed portion that is received by a keyway defined by the hosel insert inner surface <b>1140</b>. In alternative embodiments, the rotation prevention portions can be elliptical, rectangular, hexagonal or other non-circular complementary configurations of the shaft sleeve lower portion <b>950</b> and the hosel sleeve inner surface <b>1096</b>, and the hosel sleeve outer surface <b>1050</b> and the hosel insert inner surface <b>1140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the screw <b>1300</b> comprises a head <b>1330</b> having head, or bearing, surface <b>1320</b>, a shaft <b>1340</b> extending from the head and external threads <b>1310</b> formed on a distal end portion of the screw shaft. The screw <b>1300</b> is used to secure the club head <b>700</b> to the shaft <b>800</b> by inserting the screw upwardly into passageway <b>710</b> via an opening in the sole of the club head. The screw is further inserted through the washer <b>1200</b> and tightened into an internally threaded bottom portion <b>996</b> of an opening <b>994</b> in the sleeve <b>900</b>. In other embodiments, the club head <b>700</b> can be secured to the shaft <b>800</b> by other mechanical fasteners. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-19</figref>, when the screw <b>1300</b> is securely tightened into the shaft sleeve <b>900</b>, the screw head surface <b>1320</b> contacts the washer <b>1200</b>, the washer <b>1200</b> contacts a bottom surface <b>1120</b> of the hosel insert <b>1100</b>, an annular surface <b>1060</b> of the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> contacts an upper annular surface <b>730</b> of the club <b>700</b> and an annular surface <b>930</b> of the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> contacts an upper surface <b>1010</b> of the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> is configured to support the shaft <b>50</b> at a desired orientation relative to the club head to achieve a desired shaft loft and/or lie angle for the club. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 31</figref>, the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> comprises an upper portion <b>1020</b>, a lower portion <b>1050</b>, and a bore or longitudinal opening <b>1040</b> extending therethrough. The upper portion, which extends parallel the opening <b>1040</b>, extends at an angle with respect to the lower portion <b>1050</b> defined as an &#x201c;offset angle&#x201d; <b>780</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, when the hosel insert <b>1040</b> is inserted into the hosel opening <b>710</b>, the outer surface of the lower portion <b>1050</b> is co-axially aligned with the hosel insert <b>1100</b> and the hosel opening. In this manner, the outer surface of the lower portion <b>1050</b> of the hosel sleeve, the hosel insert <b>1100</b>, and the hosel opening <b>710</b> collectively define a longitudinal axis B. When the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> is inserted into the hosel sleeve, the shaft sleeve and the shaft are co-axially aligned with the opening <b>1040</b> of the hosel sleeve. Accordingly, the shaft sleeve, the shaft, and the opening <b>1040</b> collectively define a longitudinal axis A of the assembly. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the hosel sleeve is effective to support the shaft <b>50</b> along longitudinal axis A, which is offset from longitudinal axis B by offset angle <b>780</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Consequently, the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> can be positioned in the hosel insert <b>1100</b> in one or more positions to adjust the shaft loft and/or lie angle of the club. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> represents a connection assembly embodiment wherein the hosel sleeve can be positioned in four angularly spaced, discrete positions within the hosel insert <b>1100</b>. As used herein, a sleeve having a plurality of &#x201c;discrete positions&#x201d; means that once the sleeve is inserted into the club head, it cannot be rotated about its longitudinal axis to an adjacent position, except for any play or tolerances between mating splines that allows for slight rotational movement of the sleeve prior to tightening the screw or other fastening mechanism that secures the shaft to the club head. In other words, the sleeve is not continuously adjustable and has a fixed number of finite positions and therefore has a fixed number of &#x201c;discrete positions&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, crosshairs A<sub>1</sub>-A<sub>4 </sub>represent the position of the longitudinal axis A for each position of the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b>. Positioning the hosel sleeve within the club head such that the shaft is adjusted inward towards the club head (such that the longitudinal axis A passes through crosshair A<sub>4 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) increases the lie angle from an initial lie angle defined by longitudinal axis B; positioning the hosel sleeve such that the shaft is adjusted away from the club head (such that axis A passes through crosshair A<sub>3</sub>) reduces the lie angle from an initial lie angle defined by longitudinal axis B. Similarly, positioning the hosel sleeve such that the shaft is adjusted forward toward the striking face (such that axis A passes through crosshair A<sub>2</sub>) or rearward toward the rear of the club head (such that axis A passes through the crosshair A<sub>1</sub>) will increase or decrease the shaft loft, respectively, from an initial shaft loft angle defined by longitudinal axis B. As noted above, adjusting the shaft loft is effective to adjust the square loft by the same amount. Similarly, the face angle is adjusted in proportion to the change in shaft loft. The amount of increase or decrease in shaft loft or lie angle in this example is equal to the offset angle <b>780</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Similarly, the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> can be inserted into the hosel sleeve at various angularly spaced positions around longitudinal axis A. Consequently, if the orientation of the shaft relative to the club head is adjusted by rotating the position of the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b>, the position of the shaft sleeve within the hosel sleeve can be adjusted to maintain the rotational position of the shaft relative to longitudinal axis A. For example, if the hosel sleeve is rotated 90 degrees with respect to the hosel insert, the shaft sleeve can be rotated 90 degrees in the opposite direction with respect to the hosel sleeve in order to maintain the position of the shaft relative to its longitudinal axis. In this manner, the grip of the shaft and any visual indicia on the shaft can be maintained at the same position relative to the shaft axis as the shaft loft and/or lie angle is adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In another example, a connection assembly can employ a hosel sleeve that is positionable at eight angularly spaced positions within the hosel insert <b>1100</b>, as represented by cross hairs A<sub>1</sub>-A<sub>8 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Crosshairs A<sub>5</sub>-A<sub>8 </sub>represent hosel sleeve positions within the hosel insert <b>1100</b> that are effective to adjust both the lie angle and the shaft loft (and therefore the square loft and the face angle) relative to an initial lie angle and shaft loft defined by longitudinal axis B by adjusting the orientation of the shaft in a first direction inward or outward relative to the club head to adjust the lie angle and in a second direction forward or rearward relative to the club head to adjust the shaft loft. For example, crosshair A<sub>5 </sub>represents a hosel sleeve position that adjusts the orientation of the shaft outward and rearward relative to the club head, thereby decreasing the lie angle and decreasing the shaft loft.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The connection assembly embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref> provides advantages in addition to those provided by the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> (e.g., ease of exchanging a shaft or club head) and already described above. Because the hosel sleeve can introduce a non-zero angle between the shaft and the hosel, a golfer can easily change the loft, lie and/or face angles of the club by changing the hosel sleeve. For example, the golfer can unscrew the screw <b>1300</b> from the shaft sleeve <b>900</b>, remove the shaft <b>800</b> from the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b>, remove the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> from the hosel insert <b>1100</b>, select another hosel sleeve having a desired offset angle, insert the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> into the replacement hosel sleeve, insert the replacement hosel sleeve into the hosel insert <b>1000</b>, and tighten the screw <b>1300</b> into the shaft sleeve <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Thus, the use of a hosel sleeve in the shaft-head connection assembly allows the golfer to adjust the position of the shaft relative to the club head without having to resort to such traditional methods such as bending the shaft relative to the club head as described above. For example, consider a golf club utilizing the club head-shaft connection assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref> comprising a first hosel sleeve wherein the shaft axis is co-axially aligned with the hosel axis (i.e., the offset angle is zero, or, axis A passes through crosshair B). By exchanging the first hosel sleeve for a second hosel sleeve having a non-zero offset angle, a set of adjustments to the shaft loft, lie and/or face angles are possible, depending, in part, on the position of the hosel sleeve within the hosel insert.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In particular embodiments, the replacement hosel sleeves could be purchased individually from a retailer. In other embodiments, a kit comprising a plurality of hosel sleeves, each having a different offset angle can be provided. The number of hosel sleeves in the kit can vary depending on a desired range of offset angles and/or a desired granularity of angle adjustments. For example, a kit can comprise hosel sleeves providing offset angles from 0 degrees to 3 degrees, in 0.5 degree increments.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In particular embodiments, hosel sleeve kits that are compatible with any number of shafts and any number of club heads having the same hosel configuration and hosel insert <b>1100</b> are provided. In this manner, a pro shop or retailer need not necessarily stock a large number of shaft or club head variations with various loft, lie and/or face angles. Rather, any number of variations of club characteristic angles can be achieved by a variety of hosel sleeves, which can take up less retail shelf and storeroom space and provide the consumer with a more economic alternative to adjusting loft, lie or face angles (i.e., the golfer can adjust a loft angle by purchasing a hosel sleeve instead of a new club).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-26</figref>, there is shown the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> of the head-shaft connection assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>. The shaft sleeve <b>900</b> in the illustrated embodiment is substantially cylindrical and desirably is made from a light-weight, high-strength material (e.g., T6 temper aluminum alloy 7075). The shaft sleeve <b>900</b> can include a middle portion <b>910</b>, an upper portion <b>920</b> and a lower portion <b>950</b>. The upper portion <b>920</b> can have a greater thickness than the remainder of the shaft sleeve to provide, for example, additional mechanical integrity to the connection between the shaft <b>800</b> and the shaft sleeve <b>900</b>. The upper portion <b>920</b> can have a flared or frustroconical shape as shown, to provide, for example, a more streamlined transition between the shaft <b>800</b> and club head <b>700</b>. The boundary between the upper portion <b>920</b> and the middle portion <b>910</b> defines an upper annular thrust surface <b>930</b> and the boundary between the middle portion <b>910</b> and the lower portion <b>950</b> defines a lower annular surface <b>940</b>. The shaft sleeve <b>900</b> has a bottom surface <b>980</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the annular surface <b>930</b> is perpendicular to the external surface of the middle portion <b>910</b>. In other embodiments, the annular surface <b>930</b> may be frustroconical or otherwise taper from the upper portion <b>920</b> to the middle portion <b>910</b>.

In the illustrated embodiment, the opening upper portion <b>998</b> has an internal sidewall having a constant diameter that is complementary to the configuration of the lower end portion of the shaft <b>800</b>. In other embodiments, the opening upper portion <b>998</b> can have a configuration adapted to mate with various shaft profiles (e.g., the opening upper portion <b>998</b> can have more than one inner diameter, chamfered and/or perpendicular annular surfaces, etc.). With reference to the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, splines <b>1400</b> are located below the opening upper portion <b>998</b> and therefore below the shaft to minimize the overall diameter of the shaft sleeve.

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In particular embodiments, the rotation prevention portion of the shaft sleeve comprises a plurality of splines <b>1400</b> on an external surface <b>960</b> of the lower portion <b>950</b> that are elongated in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the shaft sleeve <b>900</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-22</figref> and <b>26</b>.

In other embodiments, the external surface <b>960</b> can comprise more splines (such as up to 12) or fewer than four splines and the splines <b>1400</b> can have different shapes and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-33</figref>, there is shown the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> of the head-shaft connection assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>.

<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The splined configuration of the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> dictates the degree to which the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> is positionable within the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 30</figref>, the splines <b>1400</b> and <b>1600</b> are substantially identical in shape and size and adjacent pairs of splines <b>1400</b> and <b>1600</b> have substantially similar spline-to-spline spacings. This spline configuration allows the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> to be positioned within the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> at four angularly spaced positions relative to the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b>. Similarly, the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> can be positioned within the club head <b>700</b> at four angularly spaced positions. In other embodiments, different non-circular configurations (e.g., triangular, hexagonal, more or fewer splines, variable spline-to-spline spacings or spline widths) of the shaft sleeve lower portion <b>950</b>, the hosel opening lower portion <b>1096</b>, the hosel lower portion <b>1050</b> and the hosel insert inner surface <b>1140</b> could provide for various degrees of positionability.</p>

The enhanced surface roughness provides, for example, greater friction between the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> and the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> and between the hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> and the hosel insert <b>1100</b> to further restrict relative rotational movement between these components. The contacting surfaces of shaft sleeve, the hosel sleeve and the hosel insert can be roughened by sandblasting, although alternative methods or techniques can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-36</figref>, the hosel insert <b>1100</b> desirably is substantially tubular or cylindrical and can be made from a light-weight, high-strength material (e.g., grade 5 6Al-4V titanium alloy). The hosel insert <b>1100</b> comprises an inner surface <b>1140</b> defining a rotation prevention portion having a non-circular configuration that is complementary to the non-circular configuration of the hosel sleeve outer surface <b>1090</b>.

<p id="p-0173" num="0172">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>, the screw <b>1300</b> desirably is made from a lightweight, high-strength material (e.g., T6 temper aluminum alloy 7075). In certain embodiments, the major diameter (i.e., outer diameter) of the threads <b>1310</b> is about 4 mm (e.g., ISO screw size) but may be smaller or larger in alternative embodiments. The benefits of using a screw <b>1300</b> having a reduced thread diameter (about 4 mm or less) include the benefits described above with respect to screw <b>400</b> (e.g., the ability to place the screw under a greater preload for a given torque).</p>

In additional embodiments, the screw head <b>1330</b> can comprise various other drive designs (e.g., Phillips, Pozidriv, hexagonal, TTAP, etc.), and the user can use a conventional screwdriver to tighten the screw.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38-42</figref>, the screw <b>1300</b> desirably has an inclined, spherical bottom surface <b>1320</b>.

As discussed above and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a hosel sleeve <b>1000</b> can be selected to support the shaft at a non-zero angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the hosel opening. In such a case, the shaft sleeve <b>900</b> and the screw <b>1300</b> extend at a non-zero angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the hosel insert <b>1100</b> and the washer <b>1200</b>. Because of the inclined surfaces <b>1320</b> and <b>1220</b> of the screw and the washer, the screw head can make complete contact with the washer through <b>360</b> degrees to better secure the shaft sleeve in the hosel insert. In certain embodiments, the screw head can make complete contact with the washer regardless of the position of the screw relative to the longitudinal axis of the hosel opening.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">For example, in the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, the head-shaft connection assembly employs a first hosel sleeve having a longitudinal axis that is co-axially aligned with the hosel sleeve opening longitudinal axis (i.e., the offset angle between the two longitudinal axes A and B is zero). The screw <b>1300</b> contacts the washer <b>1200</b> along the entire circumferential edge <b>1225</b> of the washer <b>1200</b>. When the first hosel sleeve is exchanged for a second hosel sleeve having a non-zero offset angle, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, the tapered washer surface <b>1220</b> and the tapered screw head surface <b>1320</b> allow for the screw <b>1300</b> to maintain contact with the entire circumferential edge <b>1225</b> of the washer <b>1200</b>. Such a washer-screw connection allows the bolt to be loaded in pure axial tension without being subjected to any bending moments for a greater preload at a given installation torque, resulting in the club head <b>700</b> being more reliably and securely attached to the shaft <b>800</b>. Additionally, this configuration allows for the compressive force of the screw head to be more evenly distributed across the washer upper surface <b>1210</b> and hosel insert bottom surface <b>1120</b> interface.</p>

Much like the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the screw <b>400</b> is inserted into the opening <b>3014</b>, through the opening in shoulder <b>3012</b>, and is tightened into the shaft sleeve <b>3006</b> to secure the shaft to the club head. However, unlike the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the shaft sleeve <b>3006</b> is configured to support the shaft at different positions relative to the club head to achieve a desired shaft loft and/or lie angle.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">If desired, a screw capturing device, such as in the form of an o-ring or washer <b>3036</b>, can be placed on the shaft of the screw <b>400</b> above shoulder <b>3012</b> to retain the screw in place within the club head when the screw is loosened to permit removal of the shaft from the club head. The ring <b>3036</b> desirably is dimensioned to frictionally engage the threads of the screw and has a outer diameter that is greater than the central opening in shoulder <b>3012</b> so that the ring <b>3036</b> cannot fall through the opening. When the screw <b>400</b> is tightened to secure the shaft to the club head, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref>, the ring <b>3036</b> desirably is not compressed between the shoulder <b>3012</b> and the adjacent lower surface of the shaft sleeve <b>3006</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref> shows the screw <b>400</b> removed from the shaft sleeve <b>3006</b> to permit removal of the shaft from the club head. As shown, in the disassembled state, the ring <b>3036</b> captures the distal end of the screw to retain the screw within the club head to prevent loss of the screw. The ring <b>3036</b> desirably comprises a polymeric or elastomeric material, such as rubber, Viton, Neoprene, silicone, or similar materials. The ring <b>3036</b> can be an o-ring having a circular cross-sectional shape as depicted in the illustrated embodiment. Alternatively, the ring <b>3036</b> can be a flat washer having a square or rectangular cross-sectional shape. In other embodiments, the ring <b>3036</b> can various other cross-sectional profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The shaft sleeve <b>3006</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44-47</figref>. The shaft sleeve <b>3006</b> in the illustrated embodiment comprises an upper portion <b>3016</b> having an upper opening <b>3018</b> for receiving and a lower portion <b>3020</b> located below the lower end of the shaft. The lower portion <b>3020</b> can have a threaded opening <b>3034</b> for receiving the threaded shaft of the screw <b>400</b>. The lower portion <b>3020</b> of the sleeve can comprise a rotation prevention portion configured to mate with a rotation prevention portion of the hosel insert <b>200</b> to restrict relative rotation between the shaft and the club head. As shown, the rotation prevention portion can comprise a plurality of longitudinally extending external splines <b>500</b> that are adapted to mate with corresponding internal splines <b>240</b> of the hosel insert <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>). The lower portion <b>3020</b> and the external splines <b>500</b> formed thereon can have the same configuration as the shaft lower portion <b>150</b> and splines <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> and <b>9</b>-<b>10</b> and described in detail above. Thus, the details of splines <b>500</b> are not repeated here.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Unlike the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> and <b>9</b>-<b>10</b>, the upper portion <b>3016</b> of the sleeve extends at an offset angle <b>3022</b> relative to the lower portion <b>3020</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, when inserted in the club head, the lower portion <b>3020</b> is co-axially aligned with the hosel insert <b>200</b> and the hosel opening <b>3004</b>, which collectively define a longitudinal axis B. The upper portion <b>3016</b> of the shaft sleeve <b>3006</b> defines a longitudinal axis A and is effective to support the shaft <b>3008</b> along axis A, which is offset from longitudinal axis B by offset angle <b>3022</b>. Inserting the shaft sleeve at different angular positions relative to the hosel insert is effective to adjust the shaft loft and/or the lie angle, as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the upper portion <b>3016</b> of the shaft sleeve desirably has a constant wall thickness from the lower end of opening <b>3018</b> to the upper end of the shaft sleeve. A tapered surface portion <b>3026</b> extends between the upper portion <b>3016</b> and the lower portion <b>3020</b>. The upper portion <b>3016</b> of the shaft sleeve has an enlarged head portion <b>3028</b> that defines an annular bearing surface <b>3030</b> that contacts an upper surface <b>3032</b> of the hosel <b>3002</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>). The bearing surface <b>3030</b> desirably is oriented at a 90-degree angle with respect to longitudinal axis B so that when the shaft sleeve is inserted in to the hosel, the bearing surface <b>3030</b> can make complete contact with the opposing surface <b>3032</b> of the hosel through 360 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, the hosel opening <b>3004</b> desirably is dimensioned to form a gap <b>3024</b> between the outer surface of the upper portion <b>3016</b> of the sleeve and the opposing internal surface of the club head. Because the upper portion <b>3016</b> is not co-axially aligned with the surrounding inner surface of the hosel opening, the gap <b>3024</b> desirably is large enough to permit the shaft sleeve to be inserted into the hosel opening with the lower portion extending into the hosel insert at each possible angular position relative to longitudinal axis B. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the shaft sleeve has eight external splines <b>500</b> that are received between eight internal splines <b>240</b> of the hosel insert <b>200</b>. The shaft sleeve and the hosel insert can have the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 13</figref>, respectively. This allows the sleeve to be positioned within the hosel insert at two positions spaced 180 degrees from each other, as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Other shaft sleeve and hosel insert configurations can be used to vary the number of possible angular positions for the shaft sleeve relative to the longitudinal axis B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48 and 49</figref>, for example, show an alternative shaft sleeve and hosel insert configuration in which the shaft sleeve <b>3006</b> has eight equally spaced splines <b>500</b> with radial sidewalls <b>502</b> that are received between eight equally spaced splines <b>240</b> of the hosel insert <b>200</b>. Each spline <b>500</b> is spaced from an adjacent spline by spacing S<sub>1 </sub>dimensioned to receive a spline <b>240</b> of the hosel insert having a width W<sub>2</sub>. This allows the lower portion <b>3020</b> of the shaft sleeve to be inserted into the hosel insert <b>200</b> at eight angularly spaced positions around longitudinal axis B (similar to locations A<sub>1</sub>-A<sub>8 </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). In a specific embodiment, the spacing S<sub>1 </sub>is about 23 degrees, the arc angle of each spline <b>500</b> is about 22 degrees, and the width W<sub>2 </sub>is about 22.5 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 51</figref> show another embodiment of a shaft sleeve and hosel insert configuration. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 51</figref>, the shaft sleeve <b>3006</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>) has eight splines <b>500</b> that are alternately spaced by spline-to-spline spacing S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2</sub>, where S<sub>2 </sub>is greater than S<sub>1</sub>. Each spline has radial sidewalls <b>502</b> providing the same advantages previously described with respect to radial sidewalls. Similarly, the hosel insert <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>) has eight splines <b>240</b> having alternating widths W<sub>2 </sub>and W<sub>3 </sub>that are slightly less than spline spacing S<sub>1 </sub>and S<sub>2</sub>, respectively, to allow each spline <b>240</b> of width W<sub>2 </sub>to be received within spacing S<sub>1 </sub>of the shaft sleeve and each spline <b>240</b> of width W<sub>3 </sub>to be received within spacing S<sub>2 </sub>of the shaft sleeve. This allows the lower portion <b>3020</b> of the shaft sleeve to be inserted into the hosel insert <b>200</b> at four angularly spaced positions around longitudinal axis B. In a particular embodiment, the spacing S<sub>1 </sub>is about 19.5 degrees, the spacing S<sub>2 </sub>is about 29.5 degrees, the arc angle of each spline <b>500</b> is about 20.5 degrees, the width W<sub>2 </sub>is about 19 degrees, and the width W<sub>3 </sub>is about 29 degrees. In addition, using a greater or fewer number of splines on the shaft sleeve and mating splines on the hosel insert increases and decreases, respectively, the number of possible positions for shaft sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">As can be appreciated, the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-51</figref> is similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref> in that both permit a shaft to be supported at different orientations relative to the club head to vary the shaft loft and/or lie angle. An advantage of the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-51</figref> is that it includes less pieces than the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-20</figref>, and therefore is less expensive to manufacture and has less mass (which allows for a reduction in overall weight).</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> shows an another embodiment of a golf club assembly that is similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> includes a club head <b>3050</b> having a hosel <b>3052</b> defining a hosel opening <b>3054</b>, which in turn is adapted to receive a hosel insert <b>200</b>. The hosel opening <b>3054</b> is also adapted to receive a shaft sleeve <b>3056</b> mounted on the lower end portion of a shaft (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>) as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The shaft sleeve <b>3056</b> has a lower portion <b>3058</b> including splines that mate with the splines of the hosel insert <b>200</b>, an intermediate portion <b>3060</b> and an upper head portion <b>3062</b>. The intermediate portion <b>3060</b> and the head portion <b>3062</b> define an internal bore <b>3064</b> for receiving the tip end portion of the shaft. In the illustrated embodiment, the intermediate portion <b>3060</b> of the shaft sleeve has a cylindrical external surface that is concentric with the inner cylindrical surface of the hosel opening <b>3054</b>. In this manner, the lower and intermediate portions <b>3058</b>, <b>3060</b> of the shaft sleeve and the hosel opening <b>3054</b> define a longitudinal axis B. The bore <b>3064</b> in the shaft sleeve defines a longitudinal axis A to support the shaft along axis A, which is offset from axis B by a predetermined angle <b>3066</b> determined by the bore <b>3064</b>. As described above, inserting the shaft sleeve <b>3056</b> at different angular positions relative to the hosel insert <b>200</b> is effective to adjust the shaft loft and/or the lie angle.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In this embodiment, because the intermediate portion <b>3060</b> is concentric with the hosel opening <b>3054</b>, the outer surface of the intermediate portion <b>3060</b> can contact the adjacent surface of the hosel opening, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>. This allows easier alignment of the mating features of the assembly during installation of the shaft and further improves the manufacturing process and efficiency. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 61 and 62</figref> are enlarged views of the shaft sleeve <b>3056</b>. As shown, the head portion <b>3062</b> of the shaft sleeve (which extends above the hosel <b>3052</b>) can be angled relative to the intermediate portion <b>3060</b> by the angle <b>3066</b> so that the shaft and the head portion <b>3062</b> are both aligned along axis A. In alternative embodiments, the head portion <b>3062</b> can be aligned along axis B so that it is parallel to the intermediate portion <b>3060</b> and the lower portion <b>3058</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Adjustable Sole</heading>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">As discussed above, the grounded loft <b>80</b> of a club head is the vertical angle of the centerface normal vector when the club is in the address position (i.e., when the sole is resting on the ground), or stated differently, the angle between the club face and a vertical plane when the club is in the address position. When the shaft loft of a club is adjusted, such as by employing the system disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-42</figref> or the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-51</figref> or by traditional bending of the shaft, the grounded loft does not change because the orientation of the club face relative to the sole of the club head does not change. On the other hand, adjusting the shaft loft is effective to adjust the square loft of the club by the same amount. Similarly, when shaft loft is adjusted and the club head is placed in the address position, the face angle of the club head increases or decreases in proportion to the change in shaft loft. For example, for a club having a 60-degree lie angle, decreasing the shaft loft by approximately 0.6 degree increases the face angle by +1.0 degree, resulting in the club face being more &#x201c;open&#x201d; or turned out. Conversely, increasing the shaft loft by approximately 0.6 degree decreases the face angle by &#x2212;1.0 degree, resulting in the club face being more &#x201c;closed&#x201d; or turned in.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Conventional clubs do not allow for adjustment of the hosel/shaft loft without causing a corresponding change in the face angle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-53</figref> illustrates a club head <b>2000</b>, according to one embodiment, configured to &#x201c;decouple&#x201d; the relationship between face angle and hosel/shaft loft (and therefore square loft), that is, allow for separate adjustment of square loft and face angle. The club head <b>2000</b> in the illustrated embodiment comprises a club head body <b>2002</b> having a rear end <b>2006</b>, a striking face <b>2004</b> defining a forward end of the body, and a bottom portion <b>2022</b>. The body also has a hosel <b>2008</b> for supporting a shaft (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The bottom portion <b>2022</b> comprises an adjustable sole <b>2010</b> (also referred to as an adjustable &#x201c;sole portion&#x201d;) that can be adjusted relative to the club head body <b>2002</b> to raise and lower at least the rear end of the club head relative to the ground. As shown, the sole <b>2010</b> has a forward end portion <b>2012</b> and a rear end portion <b>2014</b>. The sole <b>2010</b> can be a flat or curved plate that can be curved to conform to the overall curvature of the bottom <b>2022</b> of the club head. The forward end portion <b>2012</b> is pivotably connected to the body <b>2002</b> at a pivot axis defined by pivot pins <b>2020</b> to permit pivoting of the sole relative to the pivot axis. The rear end portion <b>2014</b> of the sole therefore can be adjusted upwardly or downwardly relative to the club head body so as to adjust the &#x201c;sole angle&#x201d; <b>2018</b> of the club (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>), which is defined as the angle between the bottom of the adjustable sole <b>2010</b> and the non-adjustable bottom surface <b>2022</b> of the club head body. As can be seen, varying the sole angle <b>2018</b> causes a corresponding change in the grounded loft <b>80</b>. By pivotably connecting the forward end portion of the adjustable sole, the lower leading edge of the club head at the junction of the striking face and the lower surface can be positioned just off the ground at contact between the club head and a ball. This is desirable to help avoid so-called &#x201c;thin&#x201d; shots (when the club head strikes the ball too high, resulting in a low shot) and to allow a golfer to hit a ball &#x201c;off the deck&#x201d; without a tee if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The club head can have an adjustment mechanism that is configured to permit manual adjustment of the sole <b>2010</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, an adjustment screw <b>2016</b> extends through the rear end portion <b>2014</b> and into a threaded opening in the body (not shown). The axial position of the screw relative to the sole <b>2010</b> is fixed so that adjustment of the screw causes corresponding pivoting of the sole <b>2010</b>. For example, turning the screw in a first direction lowers the sole <b>2010</b> from the position shown in solid lines to the position shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>. Turning the screw in the opposite direction raises the sole relative to the club head body. Various other techniques and mechanisms can be used to affect raising and lowering of the sole <b>2010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Moreover, other techniques or mechanisms can be implemented in the club head <b>2000</b> to permit raising and lowering of the sole angle of the club. For example, the club head can comprise one or more lifts that are located near the rear end of the club head, such as shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54-58</figref>, discussed below. The lifts can be configured to be manually extended downwardly through openings in the bottom portion <b>2022</b> of the club head to increase the sole angle and retracted upwardly into the club head to decrease the sole angle. In a specific implementation, a club head can have a telescoping protrusion near the aft end of the head which can be telescopingly extended and retracted relative to the club head to vary the sole angle.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In particular embodiments, the hosel <b>2008</b> of the club head can be configured to support a removable shaft at different predetermined orientations to permit adjustment of the shaft loft and/or lie angle of the club. For example, the club head <b>2000</b> can be configured to receive the assembly described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (shaft sleeve <b>900</b>, adapter sleeve <b>1000</b>, and insert <b>1100</b>) to permit a user to vary the shaft loft and/or lie angle of the club by selecting an adapter sleeve <b>1000</b> that supports the club shaft at the desired orientation. Alternatively, the club head can be adapted to receive the assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-47</figref> to permit adjustment of the shaft loft and/or lie angle of the club. In other embodiments, a club shaft can be connected to the hosel <b>2008</b> in a conventional manner, such as by adhesively bonding the shaft to the hosel, and the shaft loft can be adjusted by bending the shaft and hosel relative to the club head in a conventional manner. The club head <b>2000</b> also can be configured for use with the removable shaft assembly described above and disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">Varying the sole angle of the club head changes the address position of the club head, and therefore the face angle of the club head. By adjusting the position of the sole and by adjusting the shaft loft (either by conventional bending or using a removable shaft system as described herein), it is possible to achieve various combinations of square loft and face angle with one club. Moreover, it is possible to adjust the shaft loft (to adjust square loft) while maintaining the face angle of club by adjusting the sole a predetermined amount.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">As an example, Table 5 below shows various combinations of square loft, grounded loft, face angle, sole angle, and hosel loft that can be achieved with a club head that has a nominal or initial square loft of 10.4 degrees and a nominal or initial face angle of 6.0 degrees and a nominal or initial grounded loft of 14 degrees at a 60-degree lie angle. The nominal condition in Table 5 has no change in sole angle or hosel loft angle (i.e., &#x394;sole angle=0.0 and &#x394;hosel loft angle=0.0). The parameters in the other rows of Table 5 are deviations to this nominal state (i.e., either the sole angle and/or the hosel loft angle has been changed relative to the nominal state). In this example, the hosel loft angle is increased by 2 degrees, decreased by 2 degrees or is unchanged, and the sole angle is varied in 2-degree increments. As can be seen in the table, these changes in hosel loft angle and sole angle allows the square loft to vary from 8.4, 10.4, and 12.4 with face angles of &#x2212;4.0, &#x2212;0.67, 2.67, &#x2212;7.33, 6.00, and 9.33. In other examples, smaller increments and/or larger ranges for varying the sole angle and the hosel loft angle can be used to achieve different values for square loft and face angle.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Also, it is possible to decrease the hosel loft angle and maintain the nominal face angle of 6.0 degrees by increasing the sole angle as necessary to achieve a 6.0-degree face angle at the adjusted hosel loft angle. For example, decreasing the hosel loft angle by 2 degrees of the club head represented in Table 5 will increase the face angle to 9.33 degrees. Increasing the sole angle to about 2.0 degrees will readjust the face angle to 6.0 degrees.</p>

<p id="p-0200" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54-58</figref> illustrates a golf club head <b>4000</b>, according to another embodiment, that has an adjustable sole. The club head <b>4000</b> comprises a club head body <b>4002</b> having a rear end <b>4006</b>, a striking face <b>4004</b> defining a forward end of the body, and a bottom portion <b>4022</b>. The body also has a hosel <b>4008</b> for supporting a shaft (not shown). The bottom portion <b>4022</b> defines a leading edge surface portion <b>4024</b> adjacent the lower edge of the striking face that extends transversely across the bottom portion <b>4022</b> (i.e., the leading edge surface portion <b>4024</b> extends in a direction from the heel to the toe of the club head body).</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The bottom portion <b>4022</b> further includes an adjustable sole portion <b>4010</b> that can be adjusted relative to the club head body <b>4002</b> to raise and lower the rear end of the club head relative to the ground. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the adjustable sole portion <b>4010</b> is elongated in the heel-to-toe direction of the club head and has a lower surface <b>4012</b> that desirably is curved to match the curvature of the leading edge surface portion <b>4024</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, both the leading edge surface <b>4024</b> and the bottom surface <b>4012</b> of the sole portion <b>4010</b> are concave surfaces. In other embodiments, surfaces <b>4012</b> and <b>4024</b> are not necessarily curved surfaces but they desirably still have the same profile extending in the heel-to-toe direction. In this manner, if the club head deviates from the grounded address position (e.g., the club is held at a lower or flatter lie angle), the effective face angle of the club head does not change substantially, as further described below. The crown to face transition or top-line would stay relatively stable when viewed from the address position as the club is adjusted between the lie ranges described herein. Therefore, the golfer is better able to align the club with the desired direction of the target line. In some embodiments, the top-line transition is clearly delineated by a masking line between the painted crown and the unpainted face.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The sole portion <b>4010</b> has a first edge <b>4018</b> located toward the heel of the club head and a second edge <b>4020</b> located at about the middle of the width of the club head. In this manner, the sole portion <b>4010</b> (from edge <b>4018</b> to edge <b>4020</b>) has a length that extends transversely across the club head less than half the width of the club head. As noted above, studies have shown that most golfers address the ball with a lie angle between 10 and 20 degrees less than the intended scoreline lie angle of the club head (the lie angle when the club head is in the address position). The length of the sole portion <b>4010</b> in the illustrated embodiment is selected to support the club head on the ground at the grounded address position or any lie angle between 0 and 20 degrees less than the lie angle at the grounded address position. In alternative embodiments, the sole portion <b>4010</b> can have a length that is longer or shorter than that of the illustrated embodiment to support the club head at a greater or smaller range of lie angles. For example, the sole portion <b>4010</b> can extend past the middle of the club head to support the club head at lie angles that are greater than the scoreline lie angle (the lie angle at the grounded address position).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57 and 58</figref>, the bottom portion of the club head body can be formed with a recess <b>4014</b> that is shaped to receive the adjustable sole portion <b>4010</b>. One or more screws <b>4016</b> (two are shown in the illustrated embodiment) can extend through respective washers <b>4028</b>, corresponding openings in the adjustable sole portion <b>4010</b>, one or more shims <b>4026</b> and into threaded openings in the bottom portion <b>4022</b> of the club head body. The sole angle of the club head can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the number of shims <b>4026</b>, which changes the distance the sole portion <b>4010</b> extends from the bottom of the club head. The sole portion <b>4010</b> can also be removed and replaced with a shorter or taller sole portion <b>4010</b> to change the sole angle of the club. In one implementation, the club head is provided with a plurality of sole portions <b>4010</b>, each having a different height H (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>) (e.g., the club head can be provided with a small, medium and large sole portion <b>4010</b>). Removing the existing sole portion <b>4010</b> and replacing it with one having a greater height H increases the sole angle while replacing the existing sole portion <b>4010</b> with one having a smaller height H will decrease the sole angle.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In an alternative embodiment, the axial position of each of the screws <b>4016</b> relative to the sole portion <b>4010</b> is fixed so that adjustment of the screws causes the sole portion <b>4010</b> to move away from or closer to the club head. Adjusting the sole portion <b>4010</b> downwardly increases the sole angle of the club head while adjusting the sole portion upwardly decreases the sole angle of the club head.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">When a golfer changes the actual lie angle of the club by tilting the club toward or away from the body so that the club head deviates from the grounded address position, there is a slight corresponding change in face angle due to the loft of the club head. The effective face angle, eFA, of the club head is a measure of the face angle with the loft component removed (i.e. the angle between the horizontal component of the face normal vector and the target line vector), and can be determined by the following equation:</p>

The eight discrete sleeve positions &#x201c;L&#x201d;, &#x201c;N&#x201d;, NU&#x201d;, &#x201c;R&#x201d;, &#x201c;N-R&#x201d;, &#x201c;N-L&#x201d;, NU-R&#x201d;, and NU-L&#x201d; represent the different spline positions a golfer can position a sleeve with respect to the club head. Of course, it is understood that four, twelve, or sixteen sleeve positions are possible. In each embodiment, the sleeve positions are symmetric about four orthogonal positions. The preferred method to locate and lock these positions is with spline teeth engaged in a mating slotted piece in the hosel as described in the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0217">The &#x201c;L&#x201d; or left position allows the golfer to hit a draw or draw biased shot. The &#x201c;NU&#x201d; or neutral upright position enables a user to hit a slight draw (less draw than the &#x201c;L&#x201d; position). The &#x201c;N&#x201d; or neutral position is a sleeve position having little or no draw or fade bias. In contrast, the &#x201c;R&#x201d; or right position increases the probability that a user will hit a shot with a fade bias.</p>

<p id="p-0217" num="0219">As shown in Table 6, the heaviest movable weight is about 16 g and two lighter weights are about 1 g. A total weight of 18 g is provided by movable weights in this exemplary embodiment. It is understood that the movable weights can be more than 18 g or less than 18 g depending on the desired CG location. The movable weights can be of a weight and configuration as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,773,360, 7,166,040, 7,186,190, 7,407,447, 7,419,441 or U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/025,469, 11/524,031, which are incorporated by reference herein. Placing the heaviest weight in the toe region will provide a draw biased shot. In contrast, placing the heaviest weight in the heel region will provide a fade biased shot and placing the heaviest weight in the rear position will provide a more neutral shot.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0220">The exemplary embodiment shown in Table 6 provides at least five different loft angle values for eight different sleeve configurations. The loft angle value varies from about 9.5&#xb0; to 11.5&#xb0; for a nominal 10.5&#xb0; loft (at neutral) club. In one embodiment, a maximum loft angle change is about 2&#xb0;. The sleeve assembly or adjustable loft system described above can provide a total maximum loft change (&#x394;loft) of about 0.5&#xb0; to about 3&#xb0; which can be described as the following expression in Eq. 4.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>0.5&#xb0;&#x2266;&#x394;loft&#x2266;3&#xb0;&#x2003;&#x2003;Eq.4<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0221">The incremental loft change can be in increments of about 0.2&#xb0; to about 1.5&#xb0; in order to have a noticeable loft change while being small enough to fine tune the performance of the club head. As shown in Table 6, when the sleeve assembly is positioned to increase loft, the face angle is more closed with respect to how the club sits on the ground when the club is held in the address position. Similarly, when the sleeve assembly is positioned to decrease loft, the face angle sits more open.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0222">Furthermore, five different face angle values for eight different sleeve configurations are provided in the embodiment of Table 6. The face angle varies from about 0.3&#xb0; to 3.7&#xb0; in the embodiment shown with a neutral face angle of 2.0&#xb0;. In one embodiment, the maximum face angle change is about 3.4&#xb0;. It should be noted that a 1&#xb0; change in loft angle results in a 1.7&#xb0; change in face angle.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0223">The exemplary embodiment shown in Table 6 further provides five different lie angle values for eight different sleeve configurations. The lie angle varies from about 59&#xb0; to 61&#xb0; with a neutral lie angle of 60&#xb0;. Therefore, in one embodiment, the maximum lie angle change is about 2&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0224">In an alternative exemplary embodiment, an equivalent 9.5&#xb0; nominal loft club would have similar face angle and lie angle values described above in Table 6. However, the loft angle for an equivalent 9.5&#xb0; nominal loft club would have loft values of about 1&#xb0; less than the loft values shown throughout the various settings in Table 6. Similarly, an equivalent 8.5&#xb0; nominal loft club would have a loft angle value of about 2&#xb0; less than those shown in Table 6.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0225">According to some embodiments of the present application, a golf club head has a loft angle between about 6 degrees and about 16 degrees or between about 13 degrees and about 30 degrees in the neutral position. In yet other embodiments, the golf club has a lie angle between about 55 degrees and about 65 degrees in the neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0226">Table 7 illustrates another exemplary embodiment having a nominal club loft of 10.5&#xb0;, a nominal lie angle of 60&#xb0;, and a nominal face angle of 2.0&#xb0;. In the exemplary embodiment of Table 7, the offset angle of the shaft is nominally 1.5&#xb0;.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Mass Characteristics</heading>
<p id="p-0229" num="0231">A golf club head has a head mass defined as the combined masses of the body, weight ports, and weights. The total weight mass is the combined masses of the weight or weights installed on a golf club head. The total weight port mass is the combined masses of the weight ports and any weight port supporting structures, such as ribs.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0232">In one embodiment, the rear weight <b>6304</b> is the heaviest weight being between about 15 grams to about 20 grams. In certain embodiments, the lighter weights can be about 1 gram to about 6 grams. In one embodiment, a single heavy weight of 16 g and two lighter weights of 1 g is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0233">In some embodiments, a golf club head is provided with three weight ports having a total weight port mass between about 1 g and about 12 g. In certain embodiments, the weight port mass without ribs is about 3 g for a combined weight port mass of about 9 g. In some embodiments, the total weight port mass with ribbing is about 5 g to about 6 g for a combined total weight port mass of about 15 g to about 18 g.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0234"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64A</figref> illustrates a top cross-sectional view with a portion of the crown <b>6426</b> partially removed for purposes of illustration. A toe weight <b>6408</b>, a rear weight <b>6410</b>, and a heel weight <b>6412</b> are fully inserted into a toe weight port <b>6402</b>, a rear weight port <b>6404</b>, and a heel weight port <b>6406</b>, respectively. A sleeve assembly <b>6418</b> of the type described herein is also shown. In one embodiment, the toe weight port <b>6402</b> is provided with at least one rib <b>6414</b> and the rear weight port <b>6404</b> is provided with at least one rib <b>6416</b>. The heel weight port <b>6412</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64A</figref> does not require a rib due to the additional stability and mass provided by the hosel recess walls <b>6422</b>. Thus, in one embodiment, the heel weight port <b>6412</b> is lighter than the toe weight port <b>6402</b> and rear weight port <b>6404</b> due to the lack of ribbing. The toe weight port rib <b>6414</b> is comprised of a first rib <b>6414</b><i>a </i>and a second rib <b>6414</b><i>b </i>that attach the toe weight port rib to a portion of the interior wall of the sole <b>6424</b>.</p>

The first <b>6416</b><i>a </i>and second <b>6416</b><i>b </i>rib are attached to the outer surface of the rear weight port <b>6404</b> and an inner surface of the sole <b>6424</b>.

<p id="p-0234" num="0236">In one embodiment, the addition of the sleeve assembly <b>6418</b> and hosel recess walls <b>6422</b> increase the weight in the heel region by about 10 g to about 12 g. In other words, a club head construction without the hosel recess walls <b>6422</b> and sleeve assembly <b>6418</b> would be about 10 g to about 12 g lighter. Due to the increase in weight in the heel region, a mass pad or fixed weight that might be placed in the heel region is unnecessary. Therefore, the additional weight from the hosel recess walls <b>6422</b> and sleeve assembly <b>6418</b> provides a sufficient impact on the center of gravity location without having to insert a mass pad or fixed weight.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0237">In one exemplary embodiment, the weight port walls are roughly 0.6 mm to 1.5 mm thick and has a mass between 2 g to about 5 g. In one embodiment, the weight port walls alone weigh about 3 g to about 4 g. A hosel insert (as described above) has a weight of between 1 g to about 4 g. In one embodiment, the hosel insert is about 2 g. The sleeve that is inserted into the hosel insert weighs about 5 g to about 8 g. In one embodiment, the sleeve is about 6 g to about 7 g. The screw that is inserted into the sleeve weighs about 1 g to 2 g. In one exemplary embodiment, the screw weighs about 1 g to about 2 g.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0238">Therefore, in certain embodiments, the hosel recess walls, hosel insert, sleeve, and screw have a combined weight of about 10 g to 15 g, and preferably about 14 g.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0239">In some embodiments of the golf club head with three weight ports and three weights, the sum of the body mass, weight port mass, and weights is between about 80 g and about 220 g or between about 180 g and about 215 g. In specific embodiments the total mass of the club head is between 200 g and about 210 g and in one example is about 205 g.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0240">The above mass characteristics seek to create a compact and lightweight sleeve assembly while accommodating the additional weight effects of the sleeve assembly on the CG of the club head. Preferably, the club head has a hosel outside diameter <b>6428</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64B</figref>) which is less than 15 mm or even more preferably less than 14 mm. The smaller hosel outside diameter when coupled with the sleeve assembly of the embodiments described above will ensure that a excessive weight in the hosel region is minimized and therefore does not have a significant effect on CG location. In other words, a small hosel diameter when coupled with the sleeve assembly is desirable for mass and CG properties and avoids the problems associated with a large, heavy, and bulky hosel. A smaller hosel outside diameter will also be more aesthetically pleasing to a player than a large and bulky hosel.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Volume Characteristics</heading>
<p id="p-0239" num="0241">The golf club head of the present application has a volume equal to the volumetric displacement of the club head body. In several embodiments, a golf club head of the present application can be configured to have a head volume between about 110 cm<sup>3 </sup>and about 600 cm<sup>3</sup>. In more particular embodiments, the head volume is between about 250 cm<sup>3 </sup>and about 500 cm<sup>3</sup>, 400 cm<sup>3 </sup>and about 500 cm<sup>3</sup>, 390 cm<sup>3 </sup>and about 420 cm<sup>3</sup>, or between about 420 cm<sup>3 </sup>and 475 cm<sup>3</sup>. In one exemplary embodiment, the head volume is about 390 to about 410 cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Moments of Inertia and CG Location</heading>
<p id="p-0240" num="0242">Golf club head moments of inertia are defined about axes extending through the golf club head CG. As used herein, the golf club head CG location can be provided with reference to its position on a golf club head origin coordinate system. The golf club head origin is positioned on the face plate at approximately the geometric center, i.e. the intersection of the midpoints of a face plate's height and width.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0243">The head origin coordinate system includes an x-axis and a y-axis. The origin x-axis extends tangential to the face plate and generally parallel to the ground when the head is ideally positioned with the positive x-axis extending from the origin towards a heel of the golf club head and the negative x-axis extending from the origin to the toe of the golf club head. The origin y-axis extends generally perpendicular to the origin x-axis and parallel to the ground when the head is ideally positioned with the positive y-axis extending from the head origin towards the rear portion of the golf club. The head origin can also include an origin z-axis extending perpendicular to the origin x-axis and the origin y-axis and having a positive z-axis that extends from the origin towards the top portion of the golf club head and negative z-axis that extends from the origin towards the bottom portion of the golf club head.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0244">In some embodiments, the golf club head has a CG with a head origin x-axis (CGx) coordinate between about &#x2212;10 mm and about 10 mm and a head origin y-axis (CGy) coordinate greater than about 15 mm or less than about 50 mm. In certain embodiments, the club head has a CG with an origin x-axis coordinate between about &#x2212;5 mm and about 5 mm, an origin y-axis coordinate greater than about 0 mm and an origin z-axis (CGz) coordinate less than about 0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0245">More particularly, in specific embodiments of a golf club head having specific configurations, the golf club head has a CG with coordinates approximated in Table 8 below.

In one embodiment, the movable weight change can provide a CG change in the x-direction (heel-toe) of between about 2 mm and about 10 mm in order to achieve a large enough CG change to create significant performance change to offset or enhance the possible loft, lie, and face angel adjustments described above. A substantial change in CG is accomplished by having a large difference in the weight that is moved between different weight ports and having the weight ports spaced far enough apart to achieve the CG change. In certain embodiments, the CG is located below the center face with a CGz of less than 0. The CGx is between about &#x2212;2 mm (toe-ward) and 8 mm (heel-ward) or even more preferably between about 0 mm and about 6 mm.

<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Thin Wall Construction</heading>
<p id="p-0252" num="0254">According to some embodiments of a golf club head of the present application, the golf club head has a thin wall construction. Among other advantages, thin wall construction facilitates the redistribution of material from one part of a club head to another part of the club head. Because the redistributed material has a certain mass, the material may be redistributed to locations in the golf club head to enhance performance parameters related to mass distribution, such as CG location and moment of inertia magnitude. Club head material that is capable of being redistributed without affecting the structural integrity of the club head is commonly called discretionary weight. In some embodiments of the present invention, thin wall construction enables discretionary weight to be removed from one or a combination of the striking plate, crown, skirt, or sole and redistributed in the form of weight ports and corresponding weights.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0255">Thin wall construction can include a thin sole construction, i.e., a sole with a thickness less than about 0.9 mm but greater than about 0.4 mm over at least about 50% of the sole surface area; and/or a thin skirt construction, i.e., a skirt with a thickness less than about 0.8 mm but greater than about 0.4 mm over at least about 50% of the skirt surface area; and/or a thin crown construction, i.e., a crown with a thickness less than about 0.8 mm but greater than about 0.4 mm over at least about 50% of the crown surface area. In one embodiment, the club head is made of titanium and has a thickness less than 0.65 mm over at least 50% of the crown in order to free up enough weight to achieve the desired CG location.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0256">More specifically, in certain embodiments of a golf club having a thin sole construction and at least one weight and two weight ports, the sole, crown and skirt can have respective thicknesses over at least about 50% of their respective surfaces between about 0.4 mm and about 0.9 mm, between about 0.8 mm and about 0.9 mm, between about 0.7 mm and about 0.8 mm, between about 0.6 mm and about 0.7 mm, or less than about 0.6 mm. According to a specific embodiment of a golf club having a thin skirt construction, the thickness of the skirt over at least about 50% of the skirt surface area can be between about 0.4 mm and about 0.8 mm, between about 0.6 mm and about 0.7 mm or less than about 0.6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0257">The thin wall construction can be described according to areal weight as defined by the equation (Eq. 5) below.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>AW=&#x3c1;&#xb7;<i>t</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;Eq. 5<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0258">In the above equation, AW is defined as areal weight, &#x3c1; is defined as density, and t is defined as the thickness of the material. In one exemplary embodiment, the golf club head is made of a material having a density, &#x3c1;, of about 4.5 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less. In one embodiment, the thickness of a crown or sole portion is between about 0.04 cm to about 0.09 cm. Therefore the areal weight of the crown or sole portion is between about 0.18 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>and about 0.41 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the areal weight of the crown or sole portion is less than 0.41 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>over at least about 50% of the crown or sole surface area. In other embodiments, the areal weight of the crown or sole is less than about 0.36 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>over at least about 50% of the entire crown or sole surface area.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0259">In certain embodiments, the thin wall construction is implemented according to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/870,913 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,186,190, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Variable Thickness Faceplate</heading>
<p id="p-0258" num="0260">According to some embodiments, a golf club head face plate can include a variable thickness faceplate. Varying the thickness of a faceplate may increase the size of a club head COR zone, commonly called the sweet spot of the golf club head, which, when striking a golf ball with the golf club head, allows a larger area of the face plate to deliver consistently high golf ball velocity and shot forgiveness. Also, varying the thickness of a faceplate can be advantageous in reducing the weight in the face region for re-allocation to another area of the club head.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0261">A variable thickness face plate <b>6500</b>, according to one embodiment of a golf club head illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 65A and 65B</figref>, includes a generally circular protrusion <b>6502</b> extending into the interior cavity towards the rear portion of the golf club head. When viewed in cross-section, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65A</figref>, protrusion <b>6502</b> includes a portion with increasing thickness from an outer portion <b>6508</b> of the face plate <b>6500</b> to an intermediate portion <b>6504</b>. The protrusion <b>6502</b> further includes a portion with decreasing thickness from the intermediate portion <b>6504</b> to an inner portion <b>6506</b> positioned approximately at a center of the protrusion preferably proximate the golf club head origin. An origin x-axis <b>6512</b> and an origin z-axis <b>6510</b> intersect near the inner portion <b>6506</b> across an x-z plane. However, the origin x-axis <b>6512</b>, origin z-axis <b>6510</b>, and an origin y-axis <b>6514</b> pass through an ideal impact location <b>6501</b> located on the striking surface of the face plate. In certain embodiments, the inner portion <b>6506</b> can be aligned with the ideal impact location with respect to the x-z plane.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0262">In some embodiments of a golf club head having a face plate with a protrusion, the maximum face plate thickness is greater than about 4.8 mm, and the minimum face plate thickness is less than about 2.3 mm. In certain embodiments, the maximum face plate thickness is between about 5 mm and about 5.4 mm and the minimum face plate thickness is between about 1.8 mm and about 2.2 mm. In yet more particular embodiments, the maximum face plate thickness is about 5.2 mm and the minimum face plate thickness is about 2 mm. The face thickness should have a thickness change of at least 25% over the face (thickest portion compared to thinnest) in order to save weight and achieve a higher ball speed on off-center hits.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0263">In some embodiments of a golf club head having a face plate with a protrusion and a thin sole construction or a thin skirt construction, the maximum face plate thickness is greater than about 3.0 mm and the minimum face plate thickness is less than about 3.0 mm. In certain embodiments, the maximum face plate thickness is between about 3.0 mm and about 4.0 mm, between about 4.0 mm and about 5.0 mm, between about 5.0 mm and about 6.0 mm or greater than about 6.0 mm, and the minimum face plate thickness is between about 2.5 mm and about 3.0 mm, between about 2.0 mm and about 2.5 mm, between about 1.5 mm and about 2.0 mm or less than about 1.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0264">In certain embodiments, a variable thickness face profile is implemented according to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/006,060, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,997,820, 6,800,038, and 6,824,475, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0268" num="0270">When a weight or weight port is used as a reference point from which a distance, i.e., a vectorial distance (defined as the length of a straight line extending from a reference or feature point to another reference or feature point) to another weight or weights port is determined, the reference point is typically the volumetric centroid of the weight port.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0271">When a movable weight club head and the sleeve assembly are combined, it is possible to achieve the highest level of club trajectory modification while simultaneously achieving the desired look of the club at address. For example, if a player prefers to have an open club face look at address, the player can put the club in the &#x201c;R&#x201d; or open face position. If that player then hits a fade (since the face is open) shot but prefers to hit a straight shot, or slight draw, it is possible to take the same club and move the heavy weight to the heel port to promote draw bias. Therefore, it is possible for a player to have the desired look at address (in this case open face) and the desired trajectory (in this case straight or slight draw).</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0272">In yet another advantage, by combining the movable weight concept with an adjustable sleeve position (effecting loft, lie and face angle) it is possible to amplify the desired trajectory bias that a player may be trying to achieve.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0273">For example, if a player wants to achieve the most draw possible, the player can adjust the sleeve position to be in the closed face position or &#x201c;L&#x201d; position and also put the heavy weight in the heel port. The weight and the sleeve position work together to achieve the greater draw bias possible. On the other hand, to achieve the greatest fade bias, the sleeve position can be set for the open face or &#x201c;R&#x201d; position and the heavy weight is placed in the top port.</p>
<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Product of Distance Between Weight Ports the Maximum Weight, and the Maximum Loft Change</heading>
<p id="p-0272" num="0274">As described above, the combination of a large CG change (measured by the heaviest weight multiplied by the distance between the ports) and a large loft change (measured by the largest possible change in loft between two sleeve positions, &#x394;loft) results in the highest level of trajectory adjustability. Thus, a product of the distance between at least two weight ports, the maximum weight, and the maximum loft change is important in describing the benefits achieved by the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0275">In one embodiment, the product of the distance between at least two weight ports, the maximum weight, and the maximum loft change is between about 50 mm&#xb7;g&#xb7;deg and about 6,000 mm&#xb7;g&#xb7;deg or even more preferably between about 500 mm&#xb7;g&#xb7;deg and about 3,000 mm&#xb7;g&#xb7;deg. In other words, in certain embodiments, the golf club head satisfies the following expressions in Eq. 6 and Eq. 7.

</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0276">In the above expressions, Dwp, is the distance between two weight port centroids (mm), Mhw, is the mass of the heaviest weight (g), and &#x394;loft is the maximum loft change (degrees) between at least two sleeve positions. A golf club head within the ranges described above will ensure the highest level of trajectory adjustability.</p>
