<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an inductive power system and method with an inductive power receiver positioned somewhere over an extended surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The provision of electric power where and when needed, is an important consideration when constructing buildings. The number and location of power outlets required for each room is dependent upon how the room will be used. Often, however, the future function of the room is not known during its construction. Consequently, it is often necessary to relocate power outlets long after a building is completed, which can be costly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional power outlets are typically situated at strategic points around the walls of rooms. A ring main to which the power sockets are connected may be provided. Such a ring main is typically embedded in the wall, and electrical boxes in/on the wall are connected therewith. The location of power outlets is thus determined by the locations of the fixed electrical boxes. Once the wall has been finished, the relocation of power outlets is difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To add or relocate power outlets, additional wiring must be provided. The additional wiring may itself be located within or embedded into the wall by chiseling a groove into the surface thereof, running the wiring along the groove and rendering over the wiring, with plaster, pointing compound or the like. Additional power outlets are typically either sunk into depressions cut into the wall surface or alternatively, protruding electrical boxes are screwed or bolted there onto. Another method for relocating power outlets is to attach a power conduit to the outside of the wall and to run wiring through the external conduit, with power outlets being connected to the external conduit. Such a solution is commonly used in schools, colleges, laboratories and other institutions, particularly where the walls are constructed from solid stone, concrete or brick. It will be appreciated that this solution is costly, time consuming and unsightly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 3,585,565 to Price describes an electrical tape and plug connector designed to facilitate and simplify the installation of electrical wiring. Substantially flat or film conductors are sandwiched between insulating layers of protective material. The sandwich construction includes a ground conductor insulated from the two mains current carrying conductors. One surface or side of the tape or cable is coated with a pressure-sensitive adhesive. A three-prong connector adapts the tape or cable to a utility outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Price's solution allows wiring to lie flat against a wall surface which makes the wiring less obtrusive and simpler to install. However installation of the utility outlets requires the removal of insulation from the conducting tape and the connection of a special plug. Furthermore, the utility outlet once connected cannot be removed without exposing the conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An alternative system is described in United States Patent Application No. 2002/0084096 to Chang. Chang describes an electric wire coupling device which includes one or more electric wires having one or more electric cables engaged and received in an outer rubber covering. One or more sockets each has a socket housing and two conductor members secured in the socket housing, which are aligned with the orifices of the socket housing for receiving plugs. The electric wires and/or the sockets each has an adhesive material for attaching to the supporting wall without further fasteners. The socket may include a side opening for coupling to the other electric wires.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In Chang's system the power strip and outlets are stuck onto a wall surface and protrude there from. Aside from being unsightly, if the protruding sockets are knocked they may become detached from the wall. Because the sockets and wires are supported only by the adhesive and not by additional fasteners, if the sockets become detached from the wall they will only be supported by the wire itself, thereby posing a safety hazard.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Conventional electrical sockets have holes therein into which the pins of corresponding plugs are inserted to form a conductive coupling. For safety, the power supplying side of the couple is generally the female part, and does not have bare conductive elements protruding therefrom. The plug coupled to the device is the corresponding male part, typically having bare pins. The size of the pins and holes are such that even a small child cannot insert his or her fingers thereinto. In high quality sockets, an earth connection is provided, and, only when a plug with a longer earth pin is inserted there into, is it possible to insert a pin (or anything else) into the holes connected to the current carrying live and neutral wires. Nevertheless, children do occasionally manage to insert pencils, pins and other objects into socket holes, sometimes with fatal results. Water can also cause shorting and may result in electrocution.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since sockets are unsightly, the number of sockets installed on a wall is generally limited. Often, their position is not appropriate to changing requirements and extension cords are needed.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For these and other reasons, there is a need for alternative power provision than occasionally positioned, conventional socket outlets along a wall and the present disclosure addresses this need.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0133">As those of ordinary skill in the art will understand, various features of the present disclosure as illustrated and described with reference to any one of the Figures may be combined with features illustrated in one or more other Figures to produce embodiments of the present disclosure that are not explicitly illustrated or described. The combinations of features illustrated provide representative embodiments for typical applications. However, various combinations and modifications of the features consistent with the teachings of the present disclosure may be desired for particular applications or implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0134">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing a schematic diagram of a power providing system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. A workspace <b>1</b>, such as a corner of a room, bounded by walls <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, a ceiling <b>2</b><i>c </i>and a floor <b>2</b><i>d</i>, contains a variety of electrical appliances <b>4</b>, such as a television set <b>4</b><i>a </i>and a light fixture <b>4</b><i>b</i>, for example. Such electrical appliances <b>4</b> are adapted to draw power from inductive power outlets <b>6</b>. It is a particular feature of one aspect of the disclosure that inductive power outlets are incorporated into the bounding surfaces <b>2</b> of the room, such as the walls, ceiling and flooring thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0135">Inductive power coupling allows energy to be transferred from a power supply to an electric load without a conduction path being provided therebetween. A power supply is wired to a primary inductor and an oscillating electric potential is applied across the primary inductor which induces an oscillating magnetic field. The oscillating magnetic field may induce an oscillating electrical current in a secondary inductor placed close to the primary inductor. In this way, electrical energy may be transmitted from the primary inductor to the secondary inductor by electromagnetic induction without the two inductors being conductively connected. When electrical energy is transferred from a primary inductor to a secondary inductor, the pair are said to be inductively coupled. An electric load wired in series with such a secondary inductor may draw energy from the power source when the secondary inductor is inductively coupled to the primary inductor.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0136">In the inductive power outlets <b>6</b>, primary inductors <b>7</b> are wired to a power source, such as the electric mains for example, via a controller. The controller provides the electronics to drive the primary coil. Such electronics may include, for example, a switching unit providing a high frequency oscillating voltage across the primary inductor for driving same.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0137">Electrical devices <b>4</b> may receive power from the inductive power outlets via secondary inductors <b>5</b> configured to inductively couple with the primary inductors <b>7</b> of the inductive power outlets <b>6</b>. As will be outlined in greater detail below, in some embodiments of the disclosure, secondary inductors <b>5</b> may be housed in inductive receiving units wired to the electrical devices <b>2</b>. In other embodiments, secondary inductors may be incorporated into the electrical devices themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0138">According to various embodiments of the disclosure, inductive power outlets may be incorporated into prefabricated building materials. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a plasterboard panel <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure is shown. The plasterboard panel <b>100</b> consists of a layer of building material <b>102</b>, such as gypsum or the like, sandwiched between facing sheets <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, that are typically of paper. Built into the plasterboard panel <b>100</b> are one or more primary inductors <b>108</b>A-F and connecting wires <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> that extend to the edge of the panel <b>100</b> allowing it to be coupled to a mains power supply (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0139">If bulky, the primary inductors <b>108</b>A-F may be embedded within the building material <b>102</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the primary inductors such as inductive coils <b>108</b>A-F may be relatively thin and may simply be adhered or stuck onto the facing sheet <b>104</b> designed to be the outer facing surface of the panel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0140">The primary inductors <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and conducting wires <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may be fabricated from wires or metal foil, such as an aluminum or copper sheet. Alternatively, the primary inductive coils <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and conducting wires <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may be printed or painted onto the facing sheet <b>104</b> using conductive inks.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0141">Flux guidance cores may improve the electromagnetic coupling of primary coils <b>108</b> with secondary coils <b>604</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) brought into proximity with them. In certain embodiments of the disclosure, flux guidance cores (not shown) for example of ferrite or amorphous ferromagnetic material are associated with each primary coil and embedded in the walling. Further components such as ferromagnetic shielding elements or the like may additionally be incorporated therein.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0142">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plasterboard panel <b>100</b> may be incorporated into a wall <b>200</b>, such as a standard drywall comprising panels <b>202</b> of plasterboard mounted onto a framework <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0143">For use in bathrooms and the like, the plasterboard panel <b>100</b> may usefully be fabricated from &#x2018;green&#x2019; water-resistant plasterboard. Indeed, it will be appreciated that the term plasterboard is used rather loosely herewith and may refer to other building materials, particularly those used for dry-walling, such as gypsum, plasterboard, gyproc, sheetrock or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0144">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> showing a partially unrolled roll of wallpaper <b>300</b>. The wallpaper <b>300</b> comprises a flexible sheet <b>302</b> of a laminar material that is typically a paper or fabric, the front surface <b>301</b> of which may be printed or patterned. On the back <b>304</b> of the flexible sheet <b>302</b>, a plurality of primary inductive coils <b>308</b> are provided. The primary coils <b>308</b> may be fabricated from a metal foil and adhered onto the flexible sheet <b>302</b>, or may comprise conductive inks printed onto the flexible sheet <b>302</b> by silk screening for example.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0145">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the wall paper <b>300</b> is designed to be stuck onto the surface of a wall <b>400</b>. The primary coils <b>308</b> are configured to inductively couple with secondary inductive coils <b>602</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Such secondary inductive coils <b>602</b> may be carried by power adaptors <b>420</b> used to provide power outlets attached to the surface <b>402</b> of the wall <b>400</b>; with secondary inductive coils wired to electrical devices, such as light fixtures <b>460</b> or televisions <b>480</b>, for example; or on furniture such as tables and the like (not shown), brought into proximity with the wall, and having conventional power sockets or inductive power outlets thereupon.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0146">Power adaptors <b>420</b> may be secured to walls <b>400</b> using adhesives, or may be screwed or bolted into place. Alternatively, magnets may be embedded into the wall to magnetically couple with corresponding magnets within the power adaptors <b>420</b>. Power adaptors <b>420</b> may be readily exchanged between different power points without the need for additional wiring. It will be appreciated that power adaptors <b>420</b> may be incorporated within appliances such as a television <b>480</b>, music system or the like. It is further noted that a single appliance such as a television <b>480</b> may span more than one primary inductive coil <b>308</b>, thereby allowing the appliance to draw power from more than one power point. This may be useful in various applications, such as where the power needed by an appliance is greater than the power that may be supplied by a single primary inductive coil <b>308</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0147">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the material from which the flexible sheet <b>302</b> is fabricated may usefully be heavily patterned or textured to conceal electrical components thereunder, such as primary inductive coils <b>308</b> on the back thereof, and electrical conducting strips <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> extending to the edge of the paper <b>300</b> for coupling to a mains power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0148">Optionally, the paper <b>300</b> has an adhesive surface <b>306</b> on the back surface thereof, for adhering to a wall <b>400</b>. Self adhesive, pre-glued wallpapers per se. are known, and technologies thereof may be adapted for the inductive papers described herein. Thus, optionally, a waxy release layer or backing sheet <b>307</b>, such as a low density polyethylene or the like is adhered to the self adhesive layer <b>306</b>. The backing sheet <b>307</b> may be peeled off, enabling the paper <b>300</b> to be adhered to a surface, such as a wall <b>400</b>, via the adhesive surface <b>306</b> thereby exposed. Alternatively the front surface <b>301</b> may be coated with a waxy release material coating, such that when rolled up the self adhesive layer <b>306</b> is easily separated manually. Other possibilities will present themselves to wallpaper hangers.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0149">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in certain embodiments of the disclosure, control boxes <b>500</b>, may be hard-wired to a ring main <b>540</b> to provide the electronics to drive the primary coils <b>508</b> embedded or adhered to the walling <b>510</b>. Driving electronics (not shown) may be provided. For example, these may include a switching unit providing high frequency oscillating voltage supply and an outlet selector for selecting the power outlet to be driven. The control box <b>500</b> may be connected to the primary coils <b>508</b> by crimple connectors <b>520</b> such as flat PCB connectors for example. Optionally connecting power tape <b>560</b> may be provided having no primary inductive coils but having conducting strips (not shown) for connecting between the walling <b>510</b> and a control box <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0150">A power adaptor <b>600</b> may include a secondary inductive coil <b>602</b> hard wired to a conventional power jack <b>604</b> to which a conventional power plug (not shown) may be coupled.

When the secondary inductive coil <b>604</b> in a power adaptor <b>600</b> is aligned with a primary inductive coil <b>508</b> in the wall <b>510</b>, power may be inductively transferred between the coils thereby providing power to a load.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0151">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> an exemplary configuration of electrical components is shown within a section of power walling <b>700</b> according to another embodiment of the disclosure. A common electrical conducting strip <b>710</b> connects with all the primary inductive coils <b>708</b> within a column. A control strip <b>712</b> consists of a bundle of conducting wires each of which is connected to only one of the primary inductive coils <b>708</b>. Wherever the power walling is severed, the common electrical conducting strip <b>710</b> and the control strip <b>712</b> may be connected to a control box <b>500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The control strip <b>712</b> thus provides a means for selectively activating each primary inductive coil individually. The configuration of electrical components described above provides control of individual primary coils. It will be appreciated, however, that alternative configurations of electrical components are possible, as will be apparent to persons skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0152">Typically before plastering over a wall, plasterers tape is used to cover over joints in the plaster board. Plasterer's tape, typically a scrim or hessian paper tape, helps to maintain the integrity of the surface and reduces the risk of the plaster cracking along the joints.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0153">Self adhesive plasterer's tape is known, such as that described by Stough in U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,394. Stough's tape assists in rapid taping of seams between adjacent drywall units, and is provided in rolls. The tape has a first layer of flexible paper material with an inwardly facing pressure-sensitive adhesive coating thereon. A second layer of reinforcing woven fiber material overlies the first layer. A third layer of flexible material overlies the woven fiber material to encapsulate the fiber material between the first layer and the second layer. The third layer has an outwardly facing release coating such that the first layer adhesive will releasably engage the third layer for manual separation of the tape when rolled upon itself. A crease is formed along the center of the tape to facilitate positioning of the tape in a wall corner. The self release properties of the tape allow it to be easily dispensed and applied without the need to remove a backing. The adhesive is formulated to maintain adhesion even when wetted by an overlying layer of drywall mud. Furthermore the release coating on the third layer accepts and allows the adherence of drywall mud such as jointing compound, plaster and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0154">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>showing a roll of power outlet tape <b>800</b> incorporating inductive power outlets <b>842</b> according to another embodiment of the disclosure. The power outlet tape <b>800</b> is constructed from three layers. The first layer <b>820</b> has a pressure sensitive adhesive surface <b>822</b> which may be adhered to a surface such as a wall. The second layer <b>840</b> holds the electrical components which include a series of power outlets <b>842</b> and electrical conducting strips <b>844</b>, <b>846</b>. The third layer <b>860</b> overlies the second layer <b>840</b> thereby sandwiching the electrical components between the first <b>820</b> and third layer <b>860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0155">The electrical components of the second layer <b>840</b> are electrical conducting strips <b>844</b>, <b>846</b> and a series of primary inductive coils <b>842</b>. The primary inductive coils <b>842</b> are configured to inductively couple with secondary inductive coils carried by power adaptors which may be used to provide power outlets upon the surface of a wall.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0156">The outer surface <b>862</b> of the third layer <b>860</b> may be coated with a waxy release material coating such as a low density polyethylene or the like, such that when rolled up the adhesive surface <b>822</b> of the first layer is easily separated from the outer surface <b>862</b> of the third layer <b>860</b>, typically by hand. Alternatively a releasable cover slip (not shown) covered in a waxy release material may be adhered to the adhesive layer <b>822</b> to protect the adhesive surface from gathering dust and the like as well as to prevent the tape <b>800</b> from prematurely sticking to objects.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b </i>shows an alternative embodiment of a power outlet tape <b>800</b>&#x2032; comprising a two dimensional array <b>840</b>&#x2032; of primary inductive coils <b>842</b>&#x2032;. Three rows of primary inductive coils are provide each having its own pair of conducting strips <b>844</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, <b>846</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. It is noted that such a roll of tape <b>800</b>&#x2032; may be useful for covering large areas for example table tops, work surfaces or the like. Thus the alternative power outlet tape <b>800</b>&#x2032; may be used to provide an array of remote power points.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0158">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, the power tape <b>800</b> is shown being applied to a wall <b>900</b>.

In order to obscure the seams <b>960</b> between adjacent drywall boards <b>920</b>, the segments of power outlet tape <b>800</b> are used to bridge between the adjacent drywall boards <b>920</b>. The drywall boards <b>920</b> and taped seams <b>960</b> create a substantially flat surface upon which plaster <b>980</b> may be applied. It is noted that plaster <b>980</b> containing ferromagnetic material may provide additional flux guidance for the inductive couplings. In the prior art the bridging function has been performed by a paper, hessian or other scrim tape with no embedded electrical components.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0159">The ends of the power outlet tape segments may be connected to the control box <b>500</b> by means of crimple connectors <b>520</b> such as flat PCB connectors for example.

<p id="p-0112" num="0161">Inductive power adaptors are used to provide power to wall-mounted appliances as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>b </i>and <b>9</b><i>c</i>. With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b</i>, a fully plastered wall <b>950</b> is shown, concealing two segments of power outlet tape <b>810</b><i>a</i>, <b>810</b><i>b </i>each having five power points at each of which is located a primary inductive coil <b>842</b><i>a</i>-<i>j</i>. Each segment <b>810</b><i>a</i>, <b>810</b><i>b </i>is connected to a control box <b>500</b><i>a</i>, <b>500</b><i>b </i>which is hard wired to a ring main <b>540</b>. Various exemplary appliance units include, inter alia: a single jack power adaptor <b>420</b>, a double jack power adaptor <b>440</b>, a light fixture power adaptor <b>460</b> and a wall mounted television <b>480</b>. Power adaptors <b>420</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>460</b> may be secured to the walls using adhesives or screwed into place. Alternatively, magnets may be embedded into the wall to magnetically couple with magnets in the adaptors <b>420</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>460</b>. The power adaptors <b>420</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>460</b> are thus readily exchanged between power points without the need for any further wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0162">It will be appreciated that power adaptors may be embedded in appliances such as a television <b>480</b>, a music system or the like. It is noted that a single appliance such as the television <b>480</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b </i>may span more than one primary inductive coil <b>842</b><i>g</i>, <b>842</b><i>h</i>, thereby allowing the appliance to draw power from more than one power point if required, for example where the power needed is greater than the power supplied by a single primary inductive coil <b>842</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0163">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>c</i>, a representation of an inductive power adaptor <b>600</b> is shown coupled to a power point <b>842</b> along a segment of power outlet tape <b>810</b> which is connected to a control box <b>500</b>. In the power adaptor <b>600</b> a secondary inductive coil <b>602</b> is hard wired to a conventional power jack <b>604</b> which may be coupled to a conventional power plug. Alternatively, the secondary inductive coil <b>604</b> may be hardwired directly to an electric load such as a light fixture or the like. When the secondary inductive coil <b>604</b> in a power adaptor <b>600</b> is aligned with a primary inductive coil <b>842</b> in the power outlet tape <b>800</b>, power may be transferred between the coils thereby providing power to a load.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0164">Two embodiments of the power outlet tape are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Referring particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>, in the first embodiment, the electrical components <b>840</b> are configured such that a common electrical conducting strip <b>844</b> connects with all the primary inductive coils <b>842</b> along the tape. Such a control strip <b>846</b> may consist of a bundle of conducting wires each of which is connected to only one of the primary inductive coils <b>842</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0165">A segment of the power outlet tape is detached from the roll, by severing the tape, perhaps by manual tearing or by using a cutting implement such as a pair of scissors or a knife. Wherever the power outlet tape is severed, the common electrical conducting strip <b>844</b> and the control strip <b>846</b> may be connected to a control box <b>500</b>. With this first configuration, the control strip <b>846</b> may be used to selectively activate each primary inductive coil <b>842</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0166">A second embodiment of the electrical components <b>640</b> of the power outlet tape is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>. Here, each primary inductive coil <b>642</b> is connected to its own pair of dedicated conducting strips <b>644</b>, <b>646</b>. The conducting strip pairs from each primary inductive coil <b>642</b> extend along the power outlet tape for a length sufficient that severing the tape along any line provides access to three pairs of conducting strips. Thus, severing the tape of the second embodiment along the line A for example provides contacts to the pairs of conducting strips <b>644</b><i>b</i>-<i>d</i>, <b>646</b><i>b</i>-<i>d </i>controlling each of the following three primary inductive coils <b>642</b><i>b</i>, <b>642</b><i>c</i>, <b>642</b><i>d</i>. Whereas severing the tape of the second embodiment along the line C for example, provides contacts to the pairs of conducting strips <b>644</b><i>d</i>-<i>f</i>, <b>646</b><i>d</i>-<i>f </i>controlling each of the next following three primary inductive coils <b>642</b><i>d</i>, <b>642</b><i>e</i>, <b>642</b><i>f</i>. It will be appreciated that, although only three primary inductive coils may be individually controlled in the power outlet tape shown here, the number of individually controllable primary inductive coils depends upon the length of the extension of the conducting strips <b>644</b>, <b>646</b>. Thus a range of tapes may be provided with varying conductor extension lengths for providing different numbers of individually controllable primary inductive coils.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0167">Now U.S. Pat. No. 6,444,962 to Reichelt, incorporated herein by reference, describes a heating arrangement that consists of at least one heating element in the form of a flat element with two opposite-lying, essentially parallel conductors and a coating arranged therebetween for the generation of electromagnetic waves. The coating material is comprised of a binding agent, an insulating agent, a dispersion agent, water and graphite. The heating device also comprises a control device with a harmonic generator containing an electric component that has a rapid rate of current rise and is suitable for generating a high harmonic content. The harmonic generator is coupled to both electric conductors of the heating element in order to emit a spectrum of vibrations in natural molecular frequency ranges. A low-cost, highly effective heating system is thus provided, which, in one embodiment, is a flat panel that can be provided in coiled up form similar to wallpaper. Thus flat, wall mounted heating elements that may be incorporated within wallpaper are known.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0168">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it has been surprisingly found to be advantageous to provide inductive coils <b>6</b> or ferromagnetic shields having relatively high internal resistance, such that in addition to inducing an electrical current, the oscillation of an electrical current therein additionally produces a heating effect. Such a heating effect may be used as a convection heater for heating the room <b>1</b>, and usefully, inductive coils having high resistivity are situated under the floor <b>2</b><i>d </i>or beneath a window, thereby facilitating effective heat circulation in the room.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0169">In open plan areas, such as offices, factory workfloors, exhibition halls, warehouses and the like, it is often to provide power to electrical devices at a distance from the walls. To avoid trailing wires, power may be provided from floor mounted or ceiling mounted sockets, however both of these approaches are problematic. Prior art floor mounted plugs and cables may be kicked or knocked which may damage the connections and even cause injury to bystanders and in many situations it is desirable for the floor to be kept clear of power sockets and trailing wires. Overhead power provision require cables to be lowered from the ceiling which may be unsightly and is impractical where the ceiling is high, such as in large halls and auditoria or for outdoor use, where there is no ceiling.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0170">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a solution to the above problem is proposed, wherein floor mounted inductive power outlets <b>1200</b> are wired via underfloor wiring <b>1220</b> to a power source (not shown) either directly or via a control unit (not shown). The primary inductive coil units <b>1200</b> are configured to inductively couple with secondary coils <b>1300</b> placed thereabove, that are themselves coupled to electrical loads <b>1320</b>, <b>1325</b>. In this manner, open floor sockets are avoided. It will be appreciated that the system <b>1100</b> as herein described may be used with a variety of flooring types such as rugs, fitted carpet, parquet, linoleum, floor tiles, tiling, paving and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0171">Floor mounted devices <b>1320</b>, such as a standing lamp <b>1320</b><i>a </i>or a photocopier <b>1320</b><i>b</i>, with secondary power coils <b>1300</b> in the bases thereof may be situated directly above the floor mounted primary coils <b>1200</b>. Alternatively furniture <b>1325</b> such as a desk <b>1325</b><i>a </i>or a chair <b>1325</b><i>b </i>with secondary coil <b>1300</b> therein may be placed over the floor mounted primary coils <b>1200</b> and may serve as platforms for providing power to electrical devices <b>1340</b> placed thereupon such as a reading lamp <b>1340</b><i>a</i>, or desktop appliances <b>1340</b> such as a laptop computer <b>1340</b><i>b </i>or a novelty coffee mug <b>1340</b><i>c </i>which directly heats the liquid therein.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0173">Other electrical devices into which secondary coils <b>1200</b> may be incorporated for aligning with primary coils <b>1200</b> of the system <b>1100</b> include household appliances such as standing lamps, televisions, music centers, video recorders, DVDs, and, if suitable wattage is made available, even washing machines, clothes dryers and the like, as well as cooking appliances such as ovens, cookers, hot-plates, fridges and freezers for example. In the workplace, the system <b>1100</b> may be provided to power typically floor mounted devices such as paper shredders, fans, photocopiers, computers, printers or heavy machinery.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0174">It is further noted that furniture <b>1325</b> may be provided with primary coils <b>1400</b> incorporated therewithin for coupling with secondary coils <b>1500</b> associated with worktop appliances. Furniture into which such primary coils may be embodied include chairs, tables, workbenches, partitioning walls, cupboards or such like.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0175">Worktop appliances having integral secondary coils <b>1500</b> which may be aligned with the primary coils <b>1400</b> incorporated within a tabletop <b>1326</b> for example include desk lamps, ambient lighting units, fans, wireless telephones, speakers, speaker phones, conference call base units, electric pencil sharpeners, electric staplers, display devices, electrical picture frames, VDUs, projectors, televisions, videos, music centers, computers, calculators, scanners, printers, fax machines, photocopiers, paper shredders, hot plates, electrically heated mugs and mobile phones.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0176">There are a number of electrical appliances for personal hygiene that are often used in the privacy of the bathroom. These include shavers, toothbrushes, hair-dryers, hair curlers and the like. Other electrical devices are also found in the bathroom, including heaters and lights. Water and electricity should be kept separate however. Electrocution in bathrooms is a real risk, and light switches are usually either located outside the bathroom, or are ceiling mounted with pull cords. These issues may be addressed by battery powered appliances, having disposable or rechargeable batteries. However, disposable batteries are expensive and ecologically damaging. Neither disposable nor rechargeable batteries are particularly reliable in that they seem to run out of power in the middle of tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0177">Bathroom walls are often tiled with ceramic tiles and sink surrounds are typically fabricated from natural or artificial polished stone, stainless steel, ceramic, or acrylics to provide easily cleaned surfaces that may be repeatedly washed. For safety, bathroom electricity sockets are typically covered with waterproof coverings. It will be appreciated that power outlet sockets, are less easily cleaned than such work-surfaces, since the socket holes for plug pins, and switches must be kept dry to prevent short circuits, or worse, electrocution.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0178">By providing power to appliances via an inductive couple, the risk of electrocution within the bathroom can be minimized. Indeed, some appliances may be used within the bath.</p>

The primary coil may also be incorporated in the wall or door of a bathroom cabinet, behind a vinyl or Formica surface layer, for example. Similarly, a primary coil may be concealed beneath or within the floor such as under or within a rug, fitted carpet, parquet, linoleum, floor tiles, tiling, paving and the like, enabling an appliance to be placed on the floor and operated without being plugged in by a visible power cord.

<p id="p-0138" num="0187">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref><i>f</i>, a digital bathroom scales <b>2600</b> with a secondary coil <b>2612</b> therebeneath may be positioned over a primary coil <b>2618</b> embedded in the floor <b>2620</b>, or placed under a bathmat (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0188">Thus some embodiments of the present disclosure do away with conventional power outlet sockets in the bathroom, which are difficult to clean and have an inherent risk of electrocution.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0189">Certain appliances, such a refrigerators, freezers, stoves and dishwashers are power hungry, large devices that tend to be plugged into dedicated sockets, and are rarely moved, apart from to allow cleaning of the space thereunder and therebehind. Such devices are well served by conventional, conductive power technology.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0190">Many other domestic kitchen appliances and gadgets, such as egg beaters, bread-makers, liquidizers, orange juice extractors, vegetable juicers, food-processors, electric knives, toasters, domestic sterilizers sandwich toasters, popcorn makers, magnetic stirrers, waffle makers, electrical barbecue grills, slow cookers, hot-plates, deep-fat fryers, electrical frying pans, knife sharpeners, electrical tin-openers and the like, are used occasionally, and may be stored in cupboards when not in use, to keep work-surfaces available for the job in hand.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0191">Ideally, such devices should be usable on any available work surface, including the draining board by the sink, countertops, table top and the like. The well designed kitchen of the prior art has double power outlet sockets set into the walls above all such work-surfaces, enabling such occasionally used devices to be plugged in and used where desired.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0192">Kitchens, which are used for the preparation of food for human consumption, should be kept hygienically clean. Walls are often tiled with ceramic tiles and counter tops are typically fabricated from polished stone, stainless steel, or Formica, to provide an easily cleaned surface that may be repeatedly washed. It will be appreciated that power outlet sockets, are less easily cleaned than such work-surfaces, since the socket holes for plug pins, and switches must be kept dry to prevent short circuits, or worse, electrocution.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0193">Kettles are particularly problematic, as they need to be regularly refilled from the tap (faucet). For safe usage, the kettle should be disconnected from the electric power supply, and in properly designed kitchens, sockets are not located close to sinks, and kettle wires are kept short. To avoid bringing the cord with plug attached to the sink, which is hazardous, the cords of kettles can usually be disconnected at the point of connection to the kettle. Should this point of connection get wet however, there is a real danger of short-circuiting and blowing or tripping a fuse, which is inconvenient, and also prevents a real danger of electrocution which is rather more serious.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0194">For some applications, these issues may be addressed by battery powered appliances, having disposable or rechargeable batteries. However, disposable batteries are expensive and ecologically damaging. Neither disposable nor rechargeable batteries are particularly reliable in that they seem to run out of power in the middle of tasks, and for high power requiring devices such as kettles and deep fat fryers, battery power is not a practical option.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0195">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>a</i>, a schematic representation is shown of an electrical appliance <b>3120</b>, specifically, a toaster. Instead of having a plug on a flex for plugging into a power outlet socket as with conventional appliances, a secondary coil <b>3124</b> is provided in the base <b>3122</b> thereof. The electrical appliance <b>3120</b> may be powered by placing it on a work surface <b>3140</b> incorporating a primary inductive coil <b>3144</b>, so that the secondary coil <b>3124</b> is aligned with the primary coil <b>3144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0196">It will be appreciated that although a toaster is described herein by way of an example, the electrical appliance <b>3120</b> may be any of a wide range of appliances or gadgets such as egg beaters, bread-makers, liquidizers, orange juice extractors, vegetable juicers, food-processors, electric knives, sandwich toasters, waffle makers, electrical barbecue grills, slow cookers, hot-plates, deep-fat fryers, electrical frying pans, knife sharpeners and domestic sterilizers, kettles, urns, radios, cassette players, CD players and electrical tin-openers.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0197">The primary coil <b>3144</b> is wired to a power supply <b>3160</b> via a driver <b>3180</b> which provides the electronics to drive the primary coil <b>3144</b>.

<p id="p-0149" num="0198">The primary coil <b>3144</b> may be concealed behind a facing layer <b>3142</b> of the kitchen work-top, or table. The facing layer may be a sheet of sticky back plastic, vinyl, Formica or wood veneer, for example. Similarly, a primary coil may be concealed beneath or within the floor such as under or within a rug, fitted carpet, parquet, linoleum, floor tiles, tiling, paving and the like, enabling the domestic appliance to be placed on the floor and operated.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0199">In one embodiment, primary coils may be placed into a resin that hardens as artificial marble, which is a polymer matrix composite including mineral filler, such as solid surface building materials, for example Corian&#xae; or the so-called, Caesar&#xae; Stone, manufactured in Israel. Caesar&#xae; stone may be cast with sinks and drainers built in. Unlike real stone that needs drilling from behind to provide a primary inductive coil near the upper surface thereof, where desired, Caesar stone and similar composite materials, including concrete, may be cast around inclusions such as metal objects including inductive coils and connecting wires.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0202">Kitchen surfaces are often smooth, enabling them to be easily wiped clean. This feature enables suckers or suction cups to be used to temporarily attach lightweight objects to kitchen surfaces.

<p id="p-0156" num="0205">Now, generally lead acid accumulators such as used in cars, are designed to produce a high current burst, whereas rechargeable batteries are essentially designed for powering electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptop computers over extensive periods of time. Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to appliances including capacitors or electrochemical power storage devices designed to provide appropriate power to power electrical motors for a number of seconds to two or three minutes, and are thus appropriate for powering food processors, toasters, kettles, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0206">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>d</i>, a storage area <b>3000</b>, such as a drawer or cupboard having primary charging coils <b>3121</b> in the base thereof is shown.

<p id="p-0158" num="0207">In the power providing systems above described, the power outlets are generally fixed in predetermined locations. According to other embodiments of the present disclosure, the power outlets are movable to suit changing requirements. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>a</i>, a movable power outlet <b>4100</b>, according to another embodiment of the present disclosure is shown, for providing power to an electrical device, specifically a computer <b>4182</b>. A primary coil <b>4120</b>, adjacent to the back face <b>4142</b> of a surface layer <b>4140</b>, is affixed to a positioning mechanism <b>4160</b>. The primary coil <b>4120</b> is configured to inductively couple with a secondary coil <b>4180</b> wired to the computer <b>4182</b>. The positioning mechanism <b>4160</b> is configured to move the primary coil <b>4120</b> behind the surface layer <b>4140</b> so that the primary coil <b>4120</b> may be repositioned.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0208">The primary coil <b>4120</b> is wired to a power source typically via a controller (not shown) providing the electronics to drive the primary coil <b>4120</b>. Driving electronics may include a switching unit, providing a high frequency oscillating voltage supply, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0209">In some embodiments of the disclosure, the power outlet <b>4100</b> may be incorporated into a vertical surface such as a wall of a building or a cabinet. The primary coil <b>4120</b> may be moved behind a surface layer <b>4140</b> of wall paper or stretched canvas for example. Alternatively the power outlet <b>4100</b> may be incorporated behind a facing layer of a horizontal platform such as a desk-top, a kitchen work-top, a conference table or a work bench for example of mica, Formica or wood veneer. In other embodiments the primary coils <b>4120</b> are configured to move beneath flooring such as rugs, fitted carpet, parquet, linoleum, floor tiles, tiling, paving and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0210">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b</i>, according to a first embodiment of the positioning mechanism <b>4160</b>, the primary coil <b>4120</b> is sandwiched between the surface layer <b>4140</b> and a base layer <b>4162</b>. The primary coil <b>4120</b> is affixed to a carriage <b>4161</b>, mounted upon a roller-ball <b>4163</b> and is configured to roll over the base layer <b>4162</b>. A magnetic element <b>4166</b>, such as iron, steel or a permanent magnet, is affixed to the carriage <b>4161</b>. The magnetic element <b>4166</b> is configured to be pulled by a nearby attracting magnetic element <b>4168</b> situated upon the front face <b>4144</b> of the surface layer <b>4140</b>. Moving the attracting magnetic element <b>4168</b> across the plane of the surface <b>4140</b> drags the magnetic element <b>4166</b>, thereby dragging the primary coil <b>4120</b> beneath the surface layer <b>4140</b> and positioning it as required.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0211">It will be appreciated that instead of the roller-ball <b>4163</b>, the carriage <b>4161</b> may be mounted upon other elements such as wheels, skis, levitating magnetic elements or the like. Where applicable, movement of the positioning mechanism <b>4160</b> may further be assisted by coating abutting surfaces with low-friction materials, such as Teflon&#xae; (PTFE).</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0212">In a second embodiment of the positioning mechanism <b>5160</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>a</i>, a primary coil unit <b>5120</b> is slidably mounted to a rail <b>5162</b>. The rail <b>5162</b> may run horizontally behind the skirting board <b>5141</b> of a wall <b>5140</b> for example. The primary coil unit <b>5120</b> is configured to be movable into various positions along the rail <b>5162</b>. The primary coil unit <b>5120</b> may be pulled manually by magnets as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>a</i>. Alternatively the primary coil unit <b>5120</b> may be mounted upon motorized wheels <b>5164</b> and configured to drive itself along the rail <b>5162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0213">It will be appreciated that the rail <b>5162</b> may be straight or curved and may even snake back and forth to cover an extended area of the wall <b>5140</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>b</i>. According to still other embodiments, more than one primary coil units <b>5120</b><i>b </i>may be independently positionable. Alternatively a plurality of primary coil units may all be moved together.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0214">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>c </i>showing a third embodiment of the positioning mechanism <b>5160</b><i>c </i>in which a primary coil unit <b>5120</b> is slidably mounted to a boom rail <b>5162</b>, which is slidably supported by a pair of generally perpendicular supporting tracks <b>5164</b> to form an adjustable H-frame <b>5165</b>. Thus the position of the primary coil unit <b>5120</b> may be moved behind a surface layer <b>5140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0215">It will be appreciated that in embodiments where the positioning mechanism <b>5160</b> is orientated vertically, behind a vertical surface layer <b>5140</b> such as a wall say, the supporting tracks <b>5164</b> may be replaced by supporting pulleys. Such pulleys may be used to support the boom rail <b>5162</b> which may be lowered and raised by adjusting the pulleys either manually or by a driving motor. Alternatively, the primary coil unit <b>5120</b> may be suspended from a pulley mounted to trolley configured to run horizontally along a fixed gantry beam spanning the width of the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0216">According to a fourth embodiment of the positioning mechanism <b>5160</b><i>d</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>d</i>, a primary coil unit <b>5120</b> is affixed to four guiding cables <b>5162</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. The lengths of the guiding cables <b>5162</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are independently controlled by pulleys <b>5164</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, located at four points defining the corners of a quadrilateral <b>5166</b>. The position of the primary coil unit <b>5120</b> may be manipulated by the pulleys <b>5164</b> into any position within the quadrilateral <b>5166</b>. It will be apparent that other configurations of three or more pulleys may be used to manipulate the primary coil unit <b>5120</b> over two dimensions and two or even one pulley may be used to manipulate a primary coil unit along a line.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0217">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>a</i>, in a further embodiment of the disclosure, the primary coil <b>6120</b> is adjacent to the back face <b>6142</b> of the surface layer <b>6140</b> and is configured to inductively couple with a secondary coil <b>6180</b> located upon the front face <b>6142</b> of the surface layer <b>6140</b>. The secondary coil <b>6180</b> may be wired to an electrical device such as a light bulb <b>6184</b> for example.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0218">In order to maximize the inductive coupling between the primary coil <b>6120</b> and the secondary coil <b>6180</b>, the gap between them should be minimal. Therefore the primary coil <b>6120</b> may be pressed tightly against the back face <b>6142</b> of the surface layer <b>6140</b>. A clutch may be provided, such as a compressed helical spring <b>6122</b> for example, which urges the primary coil <b>6120</b> towards the back face <b>6142</b>. Optionally, recesses may be cut into the back plate <b>6142</b>, providing bays <b>6146</b> therein, wherein the thickness of the surface layer <b>6140</b> is reduced. The primary coil <b>6120</b> may be docked at one of these bays <b>6146</b> for efficient inductive coupling by minimizing the thickness of the dielectric layer between primary <b>6120</b> and secondary coil <b>6180</b>. A flux guidance core <b>6124</b>, for example comprising ferromagnetic material such as ferrite, may be incorporated into the primary coil <b>6120</b>, the secondary coil <b>6180</b> or even within the surface layer <b>6140</b> to optimize the inductive coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0219">Pressing the primary coil <b>6120</b> against the back face <b>6142</b>, however, increases the friction between them and may impede the movement of the primary coil <b>6120</b>. Therefore, a releasing mechanism <b>6130</b> may be provided to disengage the primary coil <b>6120</b> from the back face <b>6142</b>. According to one embodiment of the release mechanism <b>6130</b>, the primary coil <b>6120</b> is affixed to the distal end of a lever <b>6132</b> which is configured to pivot about a point P connected to a carriage <b>6126</b>. A first attractive magnetic element such as a permanent magnet <b>6134</b> is affixed to the proximal end of the lever <b>6132</b> and situated close to the back face <b>6142</b> of the surface layer <b>6140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0220">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref><i>b</i>, the release mechanism <b>6130</b> is configured such that a second magnetic element <b>6136</b>, which may be adjacent to the front face <b>6144</b> of the surface layer <b>6140</b>, may be brought into proximity with the first magnetic element <b>6134</b>. The first magnetic element <b>6134</b> is attracted towards the back surface <b>6142</b> by the second magnetic element <b>6136</b>. The lever <b>6132</b> pivots about point P, compressing the spring <b>6122</b> and disengaging the primary coil <b>6120</b> from the back face <b>6142</b> of the surface layer <b>6140</b>. The carriage <b>6126</b> is then free to carry the primary coil <b>6120</b> to a new position as required. It is noted that the first magnetic element <b>6134</b> and second magnetic element <b>6136</b> may also provide a positioning mechanism <b>6160</b> as described in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0221">It will be appreciated that, for automated systems, one embodiment of the release mechanism <b>6130</b> may include electromagnets mounted to the carriage <b>6126</b> behind the surface layer <b>6140</b>. The electromagnets may be used to disengage the primary coil <b>6120</b> from the back face <b>6142</b> thereby serving the function of the magnetic elements <b>6134</b>, <b>6136</b> described above.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0222">By not requiring holes for coupling pins, the inductive power outlets described above may be disguised effectively and are less obtrusive than conventional power outlets. Generally, the fact that socketless outlets are less obtrusive is advantageous. However, being harder to spot than conventional power outlets has its disadvantages presenting new problems to be solved. Notably, the user must somehow locate the concealed outlet before being able to use it.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0223">The problem of locating such sockets is particularly acute where the power outlets are behind a concealing surface such as a desk top or wall, and mounted upon positioning mechanisms as described above. Where the position of a power outlet is adjustable by being mounted on a track or arm, within a wall cavity or hollow work surface, and where the surface is opaque, it is not possible to indicate the position of such power outlets by making indicative marks on the concealing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0224">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>a </i>a locatable power outlet <b>7100</b> is shown in accordance with another embodiment of the disclosure.

<p id="p-0176" num="0225">The primary coil <b>7120</b> is wired to a power source typically via a controller (not shown) providing the electronics to drive the primary coil <b>7120</b>. Driving electronics may include a switching unit providing a high frequency oscillating voltage supply, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0226">According to certain embodiments of the disclosure, the power coil <b>7120</b> may be concealed behind a vertical surface such as a wall of a building or a cabinet. The primary coil <b>7120</b> may be concealed behind a surface <b>7140</b> of wall paper or stretched canvas for example. Alternatively the primary coil <b>7120</b> may be concealed behind a facing layer of a horizontal platform such as a desk-top, a kitchen work-top, a conference table or a work bench for example of mica, Formica or wood veneer. In other embodiments a primary coil <b>7120</b> is concealed beneath flooring such as rugs, fitted carpet, parquet, linoleum, floor tiles, tiling, paving and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0227">It will be apparent that when the location of the primary coil <b>7120</b> is known, a secondary coil <b>7180</b> may be brought into alignment with it, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref><i>b</i>. When so aligned, the primary coil <b>7120</b> may inductively couple with the secondary coil <b>7180</b>, thereby powering an electrical device, such as a computer <b>7182</b>, wired to the secondary coil <b>7180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0228">In one embodiment, the location of a concealed primary coil <b>7120</b> is indicated to the user by a visual display <b>7110</b> incorporated within the surface <b>7140</b>.

The adjustable primary coil <b>7121</b> is controllable remotely from a control panel <b>7111</b> and the location of the adjustable primary coil <b>7121</b> is indicated by the position of a marker <b>7125</b> upon a map <b>7123</b> represented upon a control panel <b>7111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0230">It will be appreciated that a control panel <b>7111</b> may be a touch screen upon which the marker <b>7125</b> is a cursor which may be moved about a virtual map to control a positioning mechanism.

<p id="p-0182" num="0231">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>a </i>a schematic representation is shown of a power outlet <b>8100</b> according to yet another embodiment of the disclosure. Power outlet <b>8100</b> includes a concealed primary coil <b>8120</b> that incorporates a transmitter, such as a light emitting diode <b>8110</b>. A locator beam L is transmitted by the light emitting diode <b>8110</b> to indicate the position of the primary coil <b>8120</b>. The surface <b>8140</b> is translucent to the wavelength emitted by the LED and thus the locator beam L may be detected by a photodiode responsive to the wavelength. It has been found that Infra Red radiation emitted by an LED behind a 0.8 mm Formica sheet may be detected by standard digital cameras including digital cameras of the type incorporated in many modern mobile phones <b>8200</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0232">It is noted that thin layers <b>8140</b> of many materials such as plastic, cardboard, Formica or paper sheet, are transparent to infra-red light. Although a light emitting diode <b>8110</b> transmitting light in the infra-red region of the electromagnetic spectrum is invisible to the human eye, it is readily detectable by digital cameras and, if such an infra red light emitting diode is incorporated into a primary coil <b>8120</b>, a standard mobile phone <b>8200</b> equipped with a digital camera may serve as a detector to locate the primary coil <b>8120</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that a suitably powerful visible light emitter can be used enabling detection by the naked eye, provided that the covering material selected is transparent/translucent to the specific wavelength at the emission intensity of the emitter and the thickness of the covering layer <b>8140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0233">It will be appreciated that appropriate detectors may be selected and specified for detecting specific electromagnetic wavelengths, including ultra-violet radiation, micro waves, radio waves or even x-ray or shorter wavelengths and thus as long as embedded electromagnetic signal emitter and detector are considered together, there are a very large number of essentially equivalent solutions to this problem. Furthermore, transmitters configured to transmit other types of radiation, including mechanical vibrations such as both audible and inaudible (e.g. ultrasonic) sound waves, could be used for locating the concealed primary coil with the appropriate, corresponding detection means.</p>

A location monitor <b>8118</b> monitors the location of the primary coil <b>8121</b> and sends a location signal S to the microcontroller <b>8116</b>. The microcontroller <b>8116</b> is configured to modulate the bit-rate signal with the location signal S. The voltage applied to the primary coil <b>8121</b> may be a modulated variable voltage with a frequency f, carrying an encoded location signal S. It will be appreciated that the variable voltage may produce a radio wave of frequency f which may be transmitted as a locator beam L. Alternatively, the locator beam L may be transmitted by a dedicated transmitter, separate from the primary coil <b>8121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0235">A receiver unit <b>8201</b> that includes a receiver <b>8221</b> may be provided. The receiver <b>8221</b> may be tuned to receive the locator beam L of frequency f. The received locator beam L signal can be cross-correlated with a reference signal of frequency f to isolate the location signal S. The location of the primary coil <b>8121</b> may thereby be transmitted to a remote receiver unit <b>8201</b>, which may then output the location of the primary coil unit to a display.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0236">Although a digital bit-rate modulated locator beam L is described in the fourth embodiment hereinabove, it will be appreciated that the locator beam L may alternatively be modulated in other ways such as by analogue or digital frequency modulation or by amplitude modulation, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0237">The location monitor <b>8118</b> may monitor the location of the movable primary coil <b>8121</b> directly by keeping track of movements of the primary coil <b>8121</b> in relation to some reference points. Alternative external sensors such as proximity sensors based on infra-red sensors, ultrasonic sensors, magnetic sensors (like Hall probes), inductance sensors, capacitance sensors or the like, may be used to monitor the movement of the primary coil <b>8121</b> indirectly, by triangulation for example. A particular embodiment of the location monitor <b>8300</b> is represented schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>c</i>. According to the embodiment, the location monitor <b>8300</b> includes a host <b>8310</b> carrying a tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b>, an array of tracking-signal detectors <b>8340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and a processor <b>8360</b>. The tracking-signal detectors <b>8340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are typically arranged in an array having fixed positions relative to each other in communication with the processor <b>8360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0238">The tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b> may be used to indicate the location of a variety of hosts. Accordingly, the location monitor <b>8300</b> may be used to monitor the location of any device hosting the tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b>, Possible hosts for the tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b> may include a movable inductive power outlet such as described hereinabove and/or a movable inductive power receiver such as the receiver <b>602</b> described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Other host devices will occur to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0239">Typically, the tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b> is configured to emit a tracking-signal ST which is detectable by the each of tracking-signal detectors <b>8340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. The array of tracking-signal detectors <b>8340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may be used to determine the location of the tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b> relative to the array of tracking-signal detectors <b>8340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>using triangulation. Various emitters may be used in the location monitor <b>8300</b> such as emitters of electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, ultrasonic signals and the like as well as combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0240">Each tracking-signal detector <b>8340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may register the time at which it detects the tracking-signal ST and communicate this time to the processor <b>8360</b>. The processor <b>8360</b> is configured to use this data to calculate the relative distance of the tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b> to each tracking-signal detector <b>8340</b> and thereby using triangulation to calculate its relative location. Although an array of three tracking-signal detectors <b>8340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is described hereinabove, larger arrays may be used in other embodiments for example when the host is movable over a large region of space, or where the tracking-signal ST may be obstructed.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0241">In various embodiments, the emission-time of the tracking-signal ST may additionally be communicated to the processor <b>8360</b>. The emission-time of the tracking-signal ST is the time at which the tracking-signal ST is emitted from its host. Where the tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b> is mounted in a moving power outlet, the tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b> may itself be connected to the processor <b>3860</b> via a communication line <b>8370</b> such that the emission-time may be communicated directly from the host to the processor <b>3860</b>. Alternatively, data pertaining to the emission-time may be encoded into the tracking-signal and may be communicated to the processor <b>8360</b> via the tracker-signal detectors <b>8340</b><i>a</i>-<i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0242">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref><i>d</i>, an alternative embodiment of the location monitor <b>8300</b>&#x2032; is shown in which the tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b>&#x2032; is mounted upon a movable inductive power receiver <b>8440</b>. Tracking-signal receivers <b>8340</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and a processor <b>8360</b>&#x2032; are associated with an extended inductive power transmission surface <b>8420</b> having a plurality of inductive power outlets <b>8422</b>. The location monitor <b>8301</b> of the embodiment may be used to locate the inductive power receiver <b>8440</b> relative to the inductive power outlets <b>8422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0243">The inductive power receiver <b>8440</b> is configured to draw power inductively from at least one inductive power outlet <b>8422</b>, interacting wirelessly therewith. It will be appreciated, therefore, that a direct conductive communication line between the tracking-signal emitter <b>8320</b>&#x2032; hosted by the inductive power receiver <b>8440</b> and the outlet-based processor <b>8360</b>&#x2032; is inappropriate for a wireless environment.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0244">In this embodiment, a double tracking-signal may be emitted by dual tracking-signal emitters. According to the embodiment, two tracking-signals ST&#x2032;, ST&#x2033; are transmitted simultaneously: a first tracking-signal ST&#x2032; being a slow traveling wave, typically an acoustic wave, and a second tracking-signal ST&#x2033; being a relatively fast traveling wave, typically an electromagnetic wave. Because the second tracking-signal ST&#x2033; is a fast traveling wave, the emission-time may be recorded by a timing-detector <b>8342</b> positioned such that it receives the second tracking-signal near-instantaneously. The emission-time may thereby communicated to the processor <b>8360</b>&#x2032;. The processor <b>8360</b>&#x2032; is configured to calculate the position of an inductive power receiver <b>8440</b> placed in proximity to the inductive power transmission surface <b>8420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0245">It is a particular feature of this embodiment that the processor <b>8300</b>&#x2032; may be further configured to communicate with an outlet driver <b>8430</b>. Thus the location of the inductive power receiver <b>8440</b> relative to the array of inductive power outlets <b>8422</b> may be communicated to the outlet driver <b>8430</b>. The outlet driver <b>8430</b> may use this information to select the appropriate inductive power outlet <b>8422</b> to activate. Typically, the inductive power outlet <b>8422</b> closest to the inductive power receiver <b>8440</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0246">It is noted that the spacing between the inductive power outlets <b>8422</b> determines the ease with which the inductive power outlet <b>8422</b> may be aligned to the inductive power receiver <b>8440</b>. Where the inductive power receiver <b>8440</b> is placed in between inductive power outlets <b>8422</b>, the closest outlet is generally selected. In further embodiments, the array of inductive power outlets <b>8422</b> may themselves be mounted upon a movable frame (not shown). The movable frame may be used to align the inductive power receiver <b>8440</b> to the closest inductive power outlet <b>8422</b>. Accordingly, the moveable frame may have a range of movement approximately of the order of the spacing between the inductive power outlets <b>8422</b> within the array. Various embodiments of the moving frame may be driven by motors, piezoelectric elements, connected to the frame via force transmission mechanisms such as gears and so on as suit requirements.</p>

Optionally, a communication line <b>8570</b> may be provided between the processor <b>8360</b>&#x2033; and the movable inductive power outlet <b>8422</b>&#x2033;. It will be appreciated that, in this embodiment processor <b>8360</b>&#x2033; may be further configured to determine the required placement of the movable inductive power outlet <b>8422</b>&#x2033; and to direct the movable inductive power outlet <b>8422</b>&#x2033; accordingly so as to provide power to the inductive power receiver <b>8440</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0248">A high power inductive power outlet, when active, produces a large oscillating magnetic field.

<p id="p-0202" num="0251">The inductive power outlet <b>9200</b> consists of a primary coil <b>9220</b>, wired to a power supply <b>9240</b>, for inductively coupling with a secondary coil <b>9260</b> wired to an electric load <b>9264</b>. It is a particular feature of this embodiment of the present disclosure that a circuit-breaker <b>9280</b> is connected in series between the power supply and the primary coil <b>9220</b> and configured such that, when actuated, it disconnects the primary coil <b>9220</b> from the power supply <b>9240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0252">The primary coil <b>9220</b> is typically wired to a power supply <b>9240</b> via a driver <b>9230</b> which provides the electronics to drive the primary coil <b>9220</b>.

<p id="p-0208" num="0257">The primary coil <b>9221</b> may be used to power an electrical device such as a computer <b>9262</b> wired to a secondary coil <b>9261</b>; the computer <b>9262</b> being placed upon the platform <b>9641</b> such that the secondary coil <b>9261</b> coupled to the computer <b>9262</b> is aligned to the primary coil <b>9221</b> concealed within the platform <b>9641</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0258">In various embodiments of the disclosure, a primary detector <b>9421</b> is located in the locality of the primary coil <b>9221</b> and is configured to detect a magnetic field generated by a primary coil <b>9221</b> actively transmitting power. The detector <b>9421</b> may function in accordance with one or more of a variety of principles, including, inter alia, magnetic sensing means Hall probes, etc. Alternatively, the detector may be a heat sensor or electromagnetic sensor configured to detect one or more scientific effects inherent to or associated with the operation of the primary coil <b>9221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0259">A secondary detector <b>9441</b> is also provided, to detect the presence or operation of the secondary coil <b>9261</b>. The secondary detector <b>9441</b> may do this by detecting a signal from the secondary coil <b>9261</b> or by detecting a signal from the primary coil or from its surroundings that indicates directly or indirectly, the presence or absence of a secondary coil inductively coupled therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0260">The secondary detector may be a heat detector <b>9441</b> configured to detect a significant temperature rise in the platform <b>9641</b> in the vicinity of the primary coil <b>9221</b>. Alternatively, the secondary detector may be a magnetic sensor, a Hall probe, an electromagnetic sensor, or the like, configured to detect transmissions from the secondary coil <b>9261</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0261">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref><i>a</i>, a specific configuration is shown, such that when a secondary coil <b>9261</b> is inductively coupled to the primary coil <b>9221</b>, power transmitted by the primary coil <b>9221</b> is received by the secondary coil <b>9261</b>, thereby powering the electrical device <b>9262</b>. Consequently, the primary detector <b>9421</b> may detect a magnetic field generated by the primary coil <b>9221</b>, and send a primary signal P to a controller <b>9401</b> indicating that power is being transmitted by the primary coil <b>9221</b>. Because the power is being transferred to the electrical device <b>9262</b>, where the secondary detector <b>9441</b> is a temperature probe, it detects no significant temperature rise and can be configured to send a secondary signal S to a controller <b>9401</b> indicating that an electric load is inductively coupled to the primary coil <b>9221</b>, or not to send a signal, thereby providing an equivalent indication, depending on the logic programming of the controller <b>9401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0262">Thus, if the controller <b>9401</b> receives a primary signal P, indicating that power is present in the primary coil <b>9221</b>, and a secondary signal S, indicating that an electric load is present, it does not trigger the circuit-breaker <b>9281</b> and the primary coil <b>9221</b> continues to draw power from the power supply <b>9241</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0263">When no secondary coil <b>9261</b> is inductively coupled to the primary coil <b>9221</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref><i>b</i>, power transmitted by the primary coil <b>9221</b> is dissipated throughout the platform <b>9641</b> as heat. The primary detector <b>9421</b> again detects a magnetic field generated by the primary coil <b>9221</b> and sends a primary signal P to a controller <b>9401</b> indicating that power is being transmitted by the primary coil <b>9221</b>. In this case however, the secondary detector <b>9441</b> does detect a significant temperature rise due to the heat dissipated throughout the platform <b>9641</b> and so sends a secondary signal S indicating that no electric load is inductively coupled to the primary coil <b>9221</b>. The controller <b>9401</b> receives the primary signal P, indicating that power is being generated, and the secondary signal S, indicating that no electric load is present, consequently the controller <b>9401</b> triggers the circuit-breaker <b>9281</b> thereby disconnecting the primary coil <b>9221</b> from the power supply <b>9241</b> and preventing any further power from being transmitted by the primary coil <b>9221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0264">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a schematic diagram is presented showing a plurality of inductive power outlets <b>9203</b> protected by a remote leak prevention system <b>9003</b> according to a further embodiment of the present disclosure. An array of primary inductive coils <b>9223</b> are incorporated within a wall <b>9643</b> and wired to a power supply (not shown) via a driver <b>9233</b>.

<p id="p-0216" num="0265">When a primary coil <b>9223</b> is activated, the driver <b>9233</b> provides it with a variable voltage oscillating at a characteristic frequency f Consequently, the primary coil <b>9223</b> transmits radio waves at a frequency of f. The remote leak prevention system <b>9003</b> includes a primary detector such as a radio receiver <b>9423</b> within range of the wall <b>9643</b>, tuned to detect radio waves at the characteristic frequency f.

<p id="p-0218" num="0267">The primary detector <b>9423</b> may then demodulate the radio waves to identify the secondary tag.

According to a basic embodiment, the controller <b>9500</b> is operable to then trigger a circuit breaker (not shown) thereby disconnecting all the primary coils <b>9223</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0268">Alternatively, the driver <b>9233</b> may additionally comprise a modulator (not shown) for tagging the power transmissions of each active primary coil <b>9223</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>with a primary tag uniquely identifying the active primary coil <b>9223</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>from which the radio waves are transmitted. The primary detector <b>9423</b> will then detect the primary tag and thereby identify which rogue primary coil is transmitting power in the absence of a secondary coil.
