<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/570,950, filed Sep. 30, 2009, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/101,437 filed Sep. 30, 2008, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention generally relates to vertical mount package systems and, more particularly, the invention relates to vertical mount package systems for MEMS sensors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of different applications use sensor systems to detect the movement of an underlying object. For example, inertial sensors, e.g., accelerometers or gyroscopes, are typically used in safety and navigation systems for automotive, military, aerospace and marine applications. Sensors employing microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices are increasingly used in such applications due to their relatively small size and their capability to detect relatively small amounts or changes in the measured item.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">MEMS devices typically employ a movable mass formed with one or more fixed, non-moving structures. For example, the movable mass may be suspended in a plane above a substrate and movable with respect to the substrate. The movable structure and the fixed structures form a capacitor having a capacitance that changes when the movable structure moves relative to the fixed structures in response to applied forces or acceleration, such as along a predetermined axis of the device, e.g., x-, y- and z-axes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">MEMS devices are often mounted or secured within packages because of the moving structures involved and the typical required device sensitivities. These packages may protect the device and permit electrical connections from the device to other components or systems. One type of package currently used for some MEMS devices is a premolded leadframe package. These types of packages typically include a preformed or premolded housing having walls surrounding a leadframe at the base of the walls to form a cavity. The electrical connections are then usually provided through the walls of the housing, and the device is coupled to the leadframe at the bottom of the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some applications, the sensor die is parallel to the package mounting plane so that the device is in a horizontal orientation. In other applications, the sensor die is perpendicular to the board or base that the package is mounted on, so that the device is held in a vertical orientation. In this situation, the package may need to be robust enough in order for the MEMS sensors to be functional or to work properly. In some cases, however, the package may impart unacceptable levels of stress on the device or may impart unacceptable levels of vibration to the device making it unusable.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a vertical mount package for use with a MEMS sensor includes a first leadframe having first leads and molding material substantially surrounding at least a portion of the first leads. The molding material forms a cavity for holding the MEMS sensor and forms a package mounting plane for mounting the package on a base. The cavity has a die mounting plane that is substantially non-parallel to the package mounting plane. The first leads are configured to provide electrical contacts within the cavity and to provide electrical contacts to the base.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method of forming a vertical mount package for use with MEMS sensors provides a first leadframe having first leads and forms a moldable material around at least a portion of the first leads. The molding material forms a cavity for holding the MEMS sensor and forms a package mounting plane for mounting the package on a base. The cavity has a die mounting plane that is substantially non-parallel to the package mounting plane. The first leads are configured to provide electrical contacts within the cavity and to provide electrical contacts to the base.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In related embodiments, a second portion of the first leads may be substantially coplanar with the package mounting plane and the molding material may substantially surround the first leads. The molding material may form one or more extensions. A portion of the one or more extensions may form the package mounting plane. The one or more extensions may substantially surround a portion of the first leads or may not surround any of the first leads. A second portion of the first leads may protrude from the molding material and may be substantially parallel to the package mounting plane. The package may further include a second leadframe having second leads. The second leads may be configured to provide electrical contacts within the cavity and to provide electrical contacts to the base. At least a portion of the second leads may be disposed above at least a portion of the first leads. The first leads and the second leads may be configured to provide electrical contacts to the base on at least two sides of the vertical mount package. The die mounting plane may be substantially perpendicular to the package mounting plane. The package may further include two or more bumps coupled to the molding material and protruding from the package mounting plane.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a vertical mount package assembly includes a MEMS sensor and a package surrounding the MEMS sensor. The package includes a first leadframe having first leads and molding material substantially surrounding at least a portion of the first leads. The molding material forms a cavity for holding the MEMS sensor and forms a package mounting plane for mounting the package on a base. The cavity has a die mounting plane that is substantially non-parallel to the package mounting plane. The first leads are configured to provide electrical contacts within the cavity to the MEMS sensor and to provide electrical contacts to the base. The assembly may further include an integrated circuit die electrically coupled to the MEMS sensor.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Various embodiments of the present invention provide a vertical mount package and package assembly for use with MEMS sensors, such as MEMS inertial sensors, e.g., accelerometers and gyroscopes. The package may include one or two leadframes and molding material surrounding a portion of one or both leadframes. The molding material forms a cavity that the MEMS sensor may be positioned within. When two leadframes are used, one leadframe is positioned on top of or above the other leadframe. The leadframe(s) and molding material are formed so as to hold the MEMS sensor in a vertical orientation relative to a printed circuit board or other base that the package may be electrically connected to, although other non-parallel orientations may also be used. The molding material forms a package mounting plane that contacts the printed circuit board or base and permits the package to be mounted to the base. This configuration ensures that the package holds the MEMS sensor in the designated orientation relative to the base in a repeatable and reliable manner. The package, preferably, has a cavity large enough to hold multiple dies. The package configuration increases the package stability and minimizes the amount of stress imparted to the MEMS sensor, thus increasing the sensor reliability and performance. Reducing stress is particularly beneficial for applications entailing gyroscopes since those types of sensors are sensitive to stress. Details of illustrative embodiments are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a process of forming a vertical mount package assembly and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2E</figref> schematically show perspective views during stages in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, according to illustrative embodiments of the present invention. Although the following discussion describes various relevant steps for forming the vertical mount package assembly, it does not describe all the required steps. Other processing steps may also be performed before, during, and/or after the discussed steps. Such steps, if performed, have been omitted for simplicity. The order of the processing steps may also be varied and/or combined. Accordingly, some steps are not described and shown. Similarly, although the following discussion involves inertial sensors, principles of illustrative embodiments may apply to other sensor devices, such as pressure sensors or microphones. Accordingly, discussion of inertial sensors is exemplary and is not intended to limit the scope of various embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2A</figref>, the process begins at step <b>100</b>, which provides a first leadframe <b>10</b>. The first leadframe <b>10</b> may be formed from a structural leadframe <b>12</b> having a plurality of first leadframes <b>10</b> joined together. The first leadframe <b>10</b> has a plurality of first leads <b>11</b>. In step <b>110</b>, molding material <b>14</b> may be formed around a portion of the first leads <b>11</b> in the first leadframe <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the molding material <b>14</b> may be formed in one or more areas of the structural leadframe <b>12</b> around the plurality of first leadframes <b>10</b>. The molding material <b>14</b> may be molded around the first leads <b>11</b> using known methods (e.g., transfer molding, injection molding) and using known materials, (e.g., thermoplastic or thermosetting materials, such as liquid crystal polymer (LCP) materials, polyphenylenesulphide (PPS) materials, polyphthalamide (PPA) materials, epoxy molding compound materials). In step <b>120</b>, a second leadframe <b>16</b> may optionally be provided above a portion of the first leadframe <b>10</b> (from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). The second leadframe <b>16</b> may be formed from a strip leadframe <b>18</b> having a plurality of second leadframes <b>16</b> joined together. The second leadframe <b>16</b> has a plurality of second leads <b>17</b> (not shown). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, two strip leadframes <b>18</b> may be provided above the structural leadframe <b>12</b>. In step <b>130</b>, molding material <b>14</b> may optionally be formed in one or more areas of the strip leadframe <b>18</b> around a portion of the second leads <b>17</b> in the second leadframe <b>16</b>, thus forming a plurality of vertical mount packages <b>22</b>. The molding material <b>14</b> may be molded around the second leads <b>17</b> using known methods (e.g., transfer molding, injection molding) and using known materials, (e.g., thermoplastic or thermosetting materials, such as LCP materials, PPS materials, PPA materials, epoxy molding compound materials).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although the above discussion and drawings show providing the first leadframe <b>10</b> and then optionally providing the second leadframe <b>16</b>, when two leadframes are used the order may be reversed in some embodiments. Similarly, in some embodiments, the molding material <b>14</b> may be formed around the second leadframe <b>16</b> and then formed around the first leadframe <b>16</b>. Alternatively, both leadframes <b>10</b>, <b>16</b> may be provided together and the molding material <b>14</b> may be formed around the first leadframe <b>10</b> and then formed around the second leadframe <b>16</b>, or formed around the second leadframe <b>16</b> and then the first leadframe <b>10</b>, or formed around both leadframes <b>10</b>, <b>16</b> at substantially the same time or during the same processing step. Thus, the order of steps <b>100</b>-<b>130</b> may be varied and/or combined. When one leadframe <b>10</b> is used, the molding material <b>14</b> may form the plurality of vertical mount packages <b>22</b> without the need for a second leadframe and/or second molding material forming process.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows eight vertical mount packages <b>22</b> being formed on one structural leadframe <b>12</b>. However, any number of packages may be formed on the structural leadframe <b>12</b> and any number of packages may be formed at substantially the same time or a single package <b>22</b> may be formed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, when two leadframes <b>10</b>, <b>16</b> are used, a portion of the strip leadframe <b>18</b> may be removed from each package <b>22</b>, although this may be done later in the process.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The molding material <b>14</b> forms a cavity <b>24</b> for holding a MEMS sensor (MEMS sensor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>). At the bottom of the cavity <b>24</b>, the molding material <b>14</b> forms a die mounting plane <b>25</b> that may be used to mount one or more MEMS sensors, other dies, etc. The molding material <b>14</b> also forms a package mounting plane <b>27</b> for mounting the package <b>22</b> on the base. The die mounting plane <b>25</b> is substantially non-parallel to the package mounting plane <b>27</b>, so that the MEMS sensor is held in a position other than a horizontal orientation relative to the base. For example, the package mounting plane <b>24</b> may be substantially perpendicular to the die mounting plane <b>25</b> so that the MEMS sensor is held in a vertical orientation relative to the base. Similarly, the package mounting plane <b>24</b> may be at a designated angle, other than zero, relative to the die mounting plane <b>25</b> so that the MEMS sensor is held at the designated angle relative to the base. Since the molding material is able to be formed within tight dimensional tolerances, this configuration ensures that the die mounting plane <b>25</b> and the package mounting plane <b>27</b> are positioned relative to one another in a repeatable and reliable manner for each package made. Consequently, this configuration enables the package <b>22</b> to hold the MEMS sensor in the designated orientation relative to the base in a repeatable way. Previously, vertical mount packages were coupled to and mounted on the base with leads that protruded from the molding material. In this case, the leads were bent or otherwise formed to form the package mounting plane, but the bending process resulted in a package that had a wider variation of the package mounting plane position to the die mounting plane. In addition, the unsupported leads may permit unacceptable levels of vibration in the package <b>22</b> that may compromise the performance of the MEMS sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In embodiments of the present invention, the first leads <b>11</b> are configured to provide electrical contacts <b>28</b> within the cavity <b>24</b> and to provide electrical contacts <b>26</b> on the outside of the package <b>22</b>. The molding material <b>14</b> is formed around a portion of the first leads <b>11</b> such that at least a surface of the first leads <b>11</b> remains uncovered so that an electrical connection may be made to the first leads <b>11</b> within the cavity <b>24</b> and on the outside of the package <b>22</b>. When two leadframes <b>10</b>, <b>16</b> are used, second leads <b>17</b> are also configured to provide electrical contacts <b>28</b> within the cavity <b>24</b> and to provide electrical contacts <b>26</b> on the outside of the package <b>22</b>, and the molding material <b>14</b> is formed around a portion of the second leads <b>17</b> such that at least a surface of the second leads <b>17</b> remains uncovered so that an electrical connection may be made to the second leads <b>17</b> within the cavity <b>24</b> and on the outside of the package <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a designated area <b>30</b> may be optionally formed in the molding material <b>14</b> for mounting the MEMS sensor <b>32</b>. The area <b>30</b> elevates the MEMS sensor <b>32</b> from the die mounting plane <b>25</b> at the bottom of the cavity <b>24</b>, thus reducing the stress imparted on the MEMS sensor <b>32</b>. The area <b>30</b> is shown as a cross-shape in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, although other patterns may be used. For example, the area may be donut-shaped and adhesive may be provided in the inner circle area in order to further stabilize the mounting of the MEMS sensor <b>32</b>. In addition, although one area <b>30</b> is shown, more than one area <b>30</b> may be optionally formed if more than one MEMS sensor is to be mounted or attached to the molding material <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>140</b>, a MEMS sensor <b>32</b> is attached to the molding material <b>14</b> at the bottom of the cavity <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, to form a vertical mount package assembly <b>36</b>. As known by those skilled in the art, any suitable attaching means may be used to attach the MEMS sensor <b>32</b> to the molding material <b>14</b>, e.g., solder, an adhesive material, or a mechanical attachment. Although one MEMS sensor <b>32</b> is shown in each vertical mount package <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, more than one sensor may be used in each package <b>22</b>. The MEMS sensor <b>32</b> is electrically connected to the electrical contacts <b>28</b> by known methods, e.g., wire bonding, flip-chip, etc. One or more other dies <b>34</b> (e.g., an integrated circuit die) may be also attached to the bottom of the cavity <b>24</b>. The die <b>34</b> may be electrically coupled to the electrical contacts <b>28</b> by known methods. The MEMS sensor <b>32</b> and the die <b>34</b> may be electrically connected to each other, or the MEMS sensor <b>32</b> may be formed on the same die with other circuitry, and the MEMS sensor <b>32</b>, the die <b>34</b>, or both may be electrically connected to the electrical contacts <b>28</b>. One or more MEMS sensors <b>32</b> and dies <b>34</b> may be provided in each vertical mount package <b>22</b> in the same processing step. Similarly, the electrical connections from the MEMS sensors <b>32</b> and/or dies <b>34</b> to the electrical contacts <b>28</b> may be provided in each vertical mount package <b>22</b> in the same processing step.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In step <b>150</b>, a cap structure <b>20</b> may be added to the package assembly <b>36</b> to cover the cavity <b>24</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>. To attach the cap structure <b>20</b> to the molding material <b>14</b>, any suitable attaching methods may be used, e.g., solder, an adhesive material, or a mechanical attachment. The cap <b>20</b> may form a seal with the molding material <b>14</b> so as to protect the MEMS sensor <b>32</b> from hazards that may impact the functioning of the sensor, e.g., from gases, particles, moisture, etc. One or more caps <b>20</b> may be provided over the one or more assemblies <b>36</b> in the same processing step.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Other processing steps may be taken to complete production of the vertical mount package assembly <b>36</b>. For example, in step <b>160</b>, the vertical mount package assembly <b>36</b> may be separated from other package assemblies <b>36</b> formed in the structural leadframe <b>12</b> by known methods. As mentioned above, the vertical mount package assembly <b>36</b> shown and discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2E</figref> is exemplary. Thus, embodiments may vary from the process shown and discussed above. For example, the first leadframe <b>10</b> and/or the second leadframe <b>16</b> may have other configurations than shown. Similarly, the strip leadframe <b>18</b> may be removed from the vertical mount package assembly <b>36</b> at substantially the same time as the structural leadframe <b>12</b>, rather than earlier in the process, or the strip leadframe <b>18</b> may be removed after the structural leadframe <b>12</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</figref> schematically show one embodiment of a vertical mount package assembly <b>36</b> formed with two leadframes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> schematically shows a perspective view of the assembly <b>36</b> with the molding material <b>14</b> transparent so as to show the configuration of the first and second leadframes <b>10</b>, <b>16</b> within the assembly <b>36</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> schematically shows a side view of the assembly <b>36</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> with the molding material <b>14</b> transparent. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the cavity <b>24</b> is facing toward the left. The first leadframe <b>10</b> has a number of first leads <b>11</b>. The first leads <b>11</b> may have substantially the same configuration within the assembly <b>36</b>, as shown, or may have a different configuration from one another within the assembly <b>36</b>. Similarly, the second leadframe <b>16</b> has a number of second leads <b>17</b>. The second leads <b>17</b> may have substantially the same configuration within the assembly <b>36</b>, as shown, or may have a different configuration from one another within the assembly <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the first leads <b>11</b> in the first leadframe <b>10</b> may have a portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>disposed beneath the cavity <b>24</b>, although the first leads <b>11</b> may go around the cavity <b>24</b> without going beneath it. As used herein, above and below (or other such designations) are arbitrary, but refer to the directions previously used with respect to the assembly formation process discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2E</figref>. For example, the top of the assembly refers to the surface in which the cap may be formed. The second leads <b>17</b> in the second leadframe <b>16</b> have a portion <b>17</b><i>a </i>disposed above a portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the first leads <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first leads <b>11</b> may have a portion <b>11</b><i>c </i>that is substantially coplanar with a portion <b>17</b><i>b </i>of the second leads <b>17</b>.

The uncovered surface of portions <b>11</b><i>c </i>and <b>17</b><i>b </i>are substantially coplanar with the package mounting plane <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the first leads <b>11</b> may have a portion <b>11</b><i>d </i>that is substantially coplanar with a portion <b>17</b><i>c </i>of the second leads <b>17</b>. The first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> may be substantially surrounded by the molding material <b>14</b>, but a surface of the first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> (portions <b>11</b><i>d </i>and <b>17</b><i>c</i>) may not be surrounded or may be uncovered by the molding material <b>14</b> in order to provide the electrical contacts <b>28</b> within the cavity <b>24</b> for the vertical mount package <b>22</b>, as better shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The package mounting plane <b>27</b> may optionally include bumps <b>38</b> formed on the outside of the package <b>22</b> to stabilize it, as better shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>. One or more bumps <b>38</b> may be used, preferably two or more bumps, and the bumps <b>38</b> may be formed at the four corners, as shown, or anywhere on the molding material <b>14</b> on the mounting side of the package <b>22</b>. The bumps <b>38</b> increase the standoff height of the package <b>22</b> and increase the solder joint reliability between the package <b>22</b> and a base (not shown) that the package <b>22</b> may be electrically connected to. When mounting the package <b>22</b> to the base, the package mounting plane <b>27</b> may be coupled to the base by known methods. For example, solder or some conductive material may couple the electrical contacts <b>26</b> to the base. The solder may be provided on the electrical contacts <b>26</b> with a minimum thickness of about the thickness of the bumps <b>38</b> so that the electrical contacts form an electrical connection with the base during a mounting process, e.g., a solder reflow process.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> and molding material <b>14</b> are formed so as to hold the MEMS sensor <b>32</b> in a vertical orientation relative to the base. For example, the base may be any board, chip, material, etc. (e.g., a printed circuit board) that connects the vertical mount package assembly <b>36</b> to other components and/or systems. For example, the vertical mount package assembly <b>36</b> and/or one or more MEMS sensors <b>32</b> thereon may communicate with a central computer (not shown) through some interconnection medium. Although the package mounting plane <b>27</b> and the corresponding coplanar first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> are shown substantially perpendicular to the die mounting plane <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</figref>, the package mounting plane <b>27</b> and the corresponding first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> may be disposed at an angle other than ninety degrees from the die mounting plane <b>25</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As previously discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A through 4D</figref> may optionally include bumps <b>38</b> formed on the package mounting plane <b>27</b> on the outside of the package <b>22</b> to stabilize it, as better shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C and 4D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows another embodiment of a vertical mount package assembly formed with two leadframes, although one leadframe may also be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, except that some of the first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> that form the electrical contacts <b>26</b> may be substantially surrounded by the molding material <b>14</b> and some of the first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> may protrude from the molding material <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, the molding material <b>14</b> forms one or more extensions <b>40</b> that extend from a recessed molding plane <b>42</b>. The bottom portion of the extension <b>40</b> forms the package mounting plane <b>27</b>. The one or more extensions <b>40</b> may substantially surround the first leads <b>11</b> and substantially surround the second leads <b>17</b> when two leadframes are used, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Alternatively, the one or more extensions <b>40</b> may not surround any first leads <b>11</b> or any second leads <b>17</b> when two leadframes are used. When mounting the package <b>22</b> to the base, the one or more extensions <b>40</b> may be coupled to the base by known methods. For example, when the extensions include first leads <b>11</b> and/or second leads <b>17</b>, solder or some conductive material may coupled the leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> to the base. When the extensions <b>40</b> do not include any first leads <b>11</b> or second leads <b>17</b>, the extensions <b>40</b> may be coupled to the base, e.g., using epoxy. Portions of the first leads <b>11</b> and/or the second leads <b>17</b> that protrude from the recessed molding plane <b>42</b> and that do not have any substantial molding material <b>14</b> surrounding it, have portions <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>17</b><i>d </i>that are substantially parallel to the package mounting plane <b>27</b>. The surface of portions <b>11</b><i>e </i>and <b>17</b><i>d </i>may be substantially coplanar with the package mounting plane <b>27</b> or may be slightly recessed from the package mounting plane <b>27</b>. For example, the surface of portions <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>17</b><i>d </i>may be recessed up to around 50 &#x3bc;m from the package mounting plane <b>27</b>. The surface of portions <b>11</b><i>e</i>, <b>17</b><i>d </i>form the electrical contacts <b>26</b> for the package <b>22</b> and may be electrically coupled to the base by known methods, e.g., solder or some conductive material. This configuration provides increased solder joint reliability, since the exposed first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> that protrude from the recessed molding plane <b>42</b> are compliant, and also provides good vertical stability, since the one or more extensions <b>40</b>, either with or without additional leads, are sturdy. The configuration also minimizes package tilt variations and reduces package vibration compared to prior art configurations that just have the leads mounting to and contacting the base. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the outer first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> on either end of the package <b>22</b> surrounded by the molding material <b>14</b> and the inner first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> exposed, any number of leads may be exposed and any number may be molded. In addition, any configuration of molded and exposed leads may be used. For example, the inner leads may be molded and the outer leads may be exposed, or there may be an alternating pattern of molded and exposed leads.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically shows another embodiment of a vertical mount package assembly formed with one leadframe, although two leadframes may also be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, except that there are no leads in the one or more extensions <b>40</b>. In addition, the first leads <b>11</b> are disposed around the cavity (not shown) rather than beneath it.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the one or more extensions <b>40</b> may include additional molding material <b>14</b><i>a</i>. This configuration may provide for good stability of the package <b>22</b> with its connection to a base <b>46</b>. The additional molding material <b>14</b><i>a </i>may be provided in any configuration around the exposed leads, e.g., having the contact surface of the package <b>22</b> form an I-shape, a T-shape, or an L-shape with the base <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8D</figref> schematically show another embodiment of a vertical mount package assembly <b>36</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A through 8D</figref> are similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</figref>, respectively, except that portions of the first and second leads <b>11</b>, <b>17</b> protrude out from the sides of the package <b>22</b> with one portion <b>11</b><i>f </i>of the first leads <b>11</b> and one portion <b>17</b><i>e </i>of the second leads <b>17</b> substantially coplanar or substantially parallel with the package mounting surface <b>27</b>. This configuration may provide additional stability to the package <b>22</b> or assembly <b>36</b> and good solder joint reliability due to the compliance of the leads.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A through 9D</figref> schematically show another embodiment of a vertical mount package assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A through 9D</figref> are similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A through 3D</figref>, respectively, except the second leads <b>17</b> of the second leadframe <b>16</b> are further extended beneath the cavity <b>24</b>. Thus, the first leads <b>11</b> and the second leads <b>17</b> are configured to provide electrical contacts to the base on at least two sides of the package <b>22</b>. For example, electrical contacts <b>44</b> on the outside of the package <b>22</b> are disposed about ninety degrees from the electrical contacts <b>26</b>, although other angles may be used if the package walls are disposed at other angles. This configuration allows the package <b>22</b> or assembly <b>36</b> to hold the MEMS sensor <b>32</b> in a vertical or horizontal orientation relative to the base. The configuration may also allow the package <b>22</b> or assembly <b>36</b> to hold the MEMS sensor <b>32</b> in any orientation relative to the base, e.g., any angle (instead of, or in addition to, horizontal or vertical).</p>
