<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED CASES</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The instant application claims full Paris Convention Priority of, and expressly incorporates by reference U.S. Ser. No. 61/480,985 (Apr. 29, 2011) as if the same were expressly set forth herein. Said case was entitled STROLLER LIGHTING KIT and filed in the name of the present inventors, likewise all Paris Convention rights are expressly reserved.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present inventions relate to use of light emitting devices in conjunction with apparatus useful to transport children. In particular, the instant teachings combine lighting requirements derived from known statutory schemes with child stroller art to offer for consideration, it is respectfully proposed, progress in science and the useful arts, by setting forth subject matters constituting invention as defined to be United States Letters Patent eligible under law.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diligent searching through numerous skilled professionals has only returned the following references, each of which is believed to be distinct from the teachings of the present invention, and herewith are disclosed solely to define the state of the art, as well as each being incorporated expressly by reference as if fully set forth herein:</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">US Patent Publications 2009/0244916; 2003/0185018 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,938,216; 6,558,018; 6,906,472; 6,394,633; 7,857,330; and 8,025,433. In sum, the present inventions address and overcome longstanding needs in the field of art to present enhanced and functionally effective lighting systems for strollers. It is respectfully submitted that, as discussed herein and claimed below, said teachings are new, novel and non-obvious to those having normal skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The mere existence of various types of mechanically challenged stroller lighting devices makes it apparent that this field of art has strong needs to be addressed, however the paucity of commercial and practical solutions in the prior art (among other things) has motivated the present inventors to devote time and efforts to solving these issues. The present inventors have learned that what is needed is an infant stroller lighting system and approach which includes, for example, LED lighting units arrayed in more efficient and helpful ways. By way of example, the present inventors have yet to encounter such approaches including (but certainly not limited to) a front lighting unit attaching to the stroller front side and a side lighting unit attaching to each of the right and left sides of the stroller, much as contemplated by existing statutory schemes (for analogous vehicles, such as a bicycle), as detailed, in applicants' subject provisional, as further described below and claimed as proprietary by those claims which are set forth below, along with legally included permutations thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Briefly stated, lighting systems for strollers enable users to integrate straight forward and modular lighting elements with eco-friendly practices to produce helpful and useful products whose functionality dictates safety levels consistent with statutory schemes for other wheeled vehicles, assuring visibility to both pedestrians and other street traffic for the subject inventions, to ensure added safety for children.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to embodiments, there is provided a lighting system for strollers, comprising, in combination, at least a lighting unit disposed within a housing, attachment member affixed to the rear wall of the housing, and, a carrying enclosure for housing and transporting the at least a lighting unit, attachment member and related accoutrements, whereby the carrying enclosure is configured as a bag-like sac and readily attachable to any known stroller.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to embodiments, there is provided a kit comprising, at least a lighting unit having a housing, a means for removably attaching the at least a lighting unit having a housing to any conventional stroller; and, bag-like retention means for holding and transporting contents of the kit along with instructions for use.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to embodiments, there is provided a method of creating a lighted stroller, comprising, in combination, providing at least two lighting units, attaching the at least two lighting units to a stroller, and activating the at least two lighting units, whereby they emit and reflect light.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Likewise, and/or in conjunction with the instant teachings, the present stroller lighting system includes kits designed to attach to children's strollers and to illuminate the surroundings of the stroller during conditions of low lighting and nighttime. Artisans readily understand than an LED light with two bulbs may be perceived as visible from at least about 60 meters and has been advertised as having approximately 150 hours of life (450 uses at 20 minutes per use.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, according to embodiments, the instant stroller lighting systems and kits includes LED lighting units. As disclosed throughout and claimed below, each lighting unit includes a durable housing, a plurality of long-lasting LED lights disposed on the housing, and an attachment member attached to a rear wall of the housing. The LED lights were designed to comply with applicable local, State, and Federal bicycle-illumination laws, and children's safety laws, as feasible and cost-effective.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to embodiments, LED front lighting units attach to a front side or front middle of the stroller and have white LED lights, resembling vehicle headlights, mindful that the number of stroller wheels is important. Likewise, those skilled in the art understand that such LEDs can utilize 2-4 AAA or 1-2 small disc batteries, virtually assuring long light life and low failure ratios for more than one light.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to embodiments, the front lighting unit is also tiltable for increased visibility, meaning angled in greater than one ordinal plane, by design, and may have automatic timing means. For example, a 15-20 minute auto-shutoff.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to embodiments, the front light unit may be removably attached to the front side of the stroller with a bracket mount, silicone light, or flush ziptie, or the like mechanical interface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to embodiments, LED side lighting units attach to each of the left and right sides of the stroller and have red reflector lights, and at least one of the left and right side lighting units may have a rear-facing white light for increased visibility (can't read your writing here).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The housing is provided in a wide range of varying sizes and in a wide range of colors and in a transparent form. Each lighting unit has at least one LED light thereon, although at least three LED lights are preferred. The attachment member is an elastic strap, and alternately a rare-earth magnet, a rubber/silicone strap, a clip, or a bracket with nuts and bolts provided for permanent attachment to the stroller.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, each lighting unit has a height of &#xbe; inch, a width of 1&#xbd; inches, and a depth of &#xbe; inch. In addition, the LED lights last up to approximately 100,000 hours and require little maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A storage bag, including in embodiments, a reusable bag with a zipper pocket for lights inside. Likewise, according to embodiments, a bag can also fold into a zippered pouch, and alternately, a console can be provided for storage of the lighting units. Each storage bag or console is provided with a carabineer for attachment to the stroller, according to embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus has been disclosed embodiments and features of the present stroller lighting kit so that the detailed description, thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated by artisans, including the addition of later-developed technology.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Numerous objects, features and advantages of the present stroller lighting kit will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of presently preferred, but nonetheless illustrative, examples of the present stroller lighting kit when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In this respect, before explaining the current examples of the present stroller lighting kit in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustration.
