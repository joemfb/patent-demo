<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with particular reference to the presently preferred exemplary embodiments. However, it should be understood that this class of embodiments provides only a few examples of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings herein. In general, statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily delimit any of the various claimed systems, methods or computer-readable media. Moreover, some statements may apply to some inventive features but not to others.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a particular embodiment of a system <b>100</b> to deliver television content. The system <b>100</b> includes a first device <b>102</b> that includes at least one television tuner and that is adapted to communicate with at least one second device <b>112</b> that is not equipped with a television tuner. Examples of devices equipped with at least one television tuner can include set-top box devices, televisions, gaming consoles (handheld and otherwise), other devices equipped with at least one television tuner, as well as combinations of such devices. Examples of devices that are not equipped with a television tuner can include personal data assistants (PDAs), digital cameras, mobile phones, laptop computers, personal computers, gaming consoles (handheld and otherwise), portable digital video disc (DVD) players, digital music players, other electronic devices that are not equipped with a television tuner, as well as combinations of such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first device <b>102</b> is adapted to receive television content via at least one television tuner from a video head-end (VHE) <b>122</b> of a television service provider, such as a cable television service provider, a satellite television service provider, or an Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) service provider, via an access network <b>132</b>. In a particular embodiment, the first device <b>102</b> can be adapted to communicate with the access network <b>132</b> via a home network <b>142</b>, which may also communicate with other devices at a user premises. In another embodiment, the first device <b>102</b> can include at least one tuner adapted to receive over-the-air content, such as an Advanced Television Standards Committee (ATSC) tuner or a National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) tuner.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an illustrative embodiment, each second device <b>112</b> is adapted to receive an input requesting television content. The input can comprise, for example, a selection of a physical switch, button or other part of the second device <b>112</b>, or a selection of a graphical menu item, icon, text, or other indicator, displayed at the second device <b>112</b>. In response to the input, the second device <b>112</b> is adapted to send a request for television content to the first device <b>102</b> via a Wi-Fi network or other WLAN. The request may identify a particular channel. In one embodiment, the second device <b>112</b> can be adapted to activate a wireless local area network (WLAN) interface in response to the selection. In some embodiments, the second device <b>112</b> may be adapted to deactivate another wireless interface, such as a cellular network interface, in response to the input. Further, the second device <b>112</b> can be adapted to activate or shift to a WLAN mode, television mode, or other mode in response to the input.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The first device <b>102</b> is adapted to receive requests for television content from a second device <b>112</b> via the WLAN. The first device <b>102</b> is adapted to receive television content from the VHE <b>142</b> or another source via a tuner and to send the television content directly to the second device <b>112</b> via the WLAN (i.e., without sending the television content to a third device that is separate from and facilitates communication between the first device <b>102</b> and the second device <b>112</b>). In an illustrative embodiment, the first device <b>102</b> can be adapted to narrowcast the television content to the second device <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, the first device <b>102</b> can be adapted to send television content directly to multiple second devices that request the television content.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The second device <b>112</b> is adapted to receive the television content directly from the first device <b>102</b> via the WLAN and to output the television content via a display portion, at least one audio output, or a combination thereof. The television content can include video content, audio content, or a combination thereof. In a particular embodiment, the second device <b>112</b> can be adapted to receive a channel change command or other command to request content associated with a particular television channel and to send data to the first device <b>102</b> via the WLAN indicating that the tuner (or a different tuner) is to be tuned to the particular channel. The first device <b>102</b> can be adapted to tune the tuner (or a different tuner) to the requested channel in response to such a request and to send television content associated with the requested channel directly to the second device <b>112</b> via the WLAN. In one example, a first television tuner at the first device <b>102</b> can be tuned to a standard definition channel, and a second television tuner at the first device <b>102</b> can be tuned to a high-definition channel in response to data received from the second device <b>112</b> requesting television content associated with a high-definition channel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the second device <b>112</b> can be adapted to receive a command to deactivate a television feature, a particular mode, or to otherwise discontinue outputting television content. The second device <b>112</b> can be adapted to send data to the first device <b>102</b> via the WLAN indicating that the first device <b>102</b> is to discontinue sending television content to the second device <b>112</b>. The first device <b>102</b> can be adapted to discontinue sending television content to the second device <b>112</b> via the WLAN in response to such data.</p>
