<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the manuscript data <b>100</b>, special data <b>104</b> (one example of special information) is retrieved. Further, the special data <b>104</b> is one example of the specific information.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The special data <b>104</b> denotes character strings or signs that are freely set by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The special data <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an enclosed character (i.e., a sign formed by enclosing the character &#x201c;confidential&#x201d;) and character strings of a &#x201c;confidential,&#x201d; a &#x201c;telephone number,&#x201d; and a &#x201c;OO project.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">These character strings or signs included in the special data <b>104</b> are data (one example of confidential information) keeping the secrecy or privacy of the manuscript data <b>100</b>. The secrecy or privacy of the manuscript data <b>100</b> is protected by allowing a user to freely set these special data <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The transmission source data <b>102</b> and the special data <b>104</b> are example of importance information.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Characters of the manuscript data <b>100</b> are recognized by the character recognition part of the scanner unit <b>7</b>. The transmission source data <b>102</b> and the special data <b>104</b> are stored in the storage unit <b>5</b> in the form of a setting table <b>19</b> (described later) while a user correlates these data with an output mode (described later). As a result, a predetermined output operation is performed in accordance with the transmission source data <b>102</b> and the special data <b>104</b> included in the manuscript data <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the setting table <b>19</b> may make setting for each destination data <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To identify the name of the destination data <b>101</b> and the name of the transmission source data <b>102</b>, reference is made to names registered in the setting table <b>19</b>. At least, the name of a user who uses the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> is registered in the destination data <b>101</b>. Therefore, a user's name can be prevented from being recognized as the transmission source data <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">(Facsimile Receiving System)</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a facsimile receiving system <b>500</b> of the invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, a plurality of facsimile machines <b>14</b> are connected to the telephone line <b>12</b>. The image forming apparatus <b>1</b> is also connected to the telephone line <b>12</b>. Accordingly, a facsimile can be sent and received between the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> and the facsimile machine <b>14</b> via the telephone line <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> receives a facsimile sent from the facsimile machine <b>14</b> as a sender via the facsimile communication unit <b>3</b>, the control unit <b>2</b> converts a manuscript data <b>100</b> of the facsimile into a predetermined format in order to print the manuscript data <b>100</b> by using the printer unit <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The image forming apparatus <b>1</b> is connected to a LAN <b>13</b>A of a network <b>13</b>. A host computer <b>15</b>, a mail server <b>16</b>, a printer <b>17</b>, etc., are connected to the LAN <b>13</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The host computer <b>15</b> includes a control unit and a storage unit (i.e., a hard disk). The host computer <b>15</b> may function as an external mass memory that stores image data obtained by the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The mail server <b>16</b> is connected to the Internet <b>13</b>B of the network <b>13</b>. An e-mail is sent and received between, for example, the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> and a terminal device <b>18</b> via the LAN <b>13</b>A and the Internet <b>13</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The printer <b>17</b> is connected to the LAN <b>13</b>A of the network <b>13</b>. The printer <b>17</b> prints image data transferred from the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> via the LAN <b>13</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Incidentally, the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> may be directly connected to the Internet <b>13</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The image forming apparatus <b>1</b> built into the facsimile receiving system <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> has a plurality of modes, each of which is used as an output mode executed when a facsimile is received. For example, the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> includes a general print mode function where the manuscript data <b>100</b> is output in the state of having been printed on a sheet of paper. In addition, the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> includes a storage mode where the received manuscript data <b>100</b> is stored in the storage unit <b>5</b> or the host computer <b>15</b>, a mail transmission mode where the received manuscript data <b>100</b> is sent to, for example, other terminal devices <b>18</b> by use of an e-mail, and a transfer mode where the received manuscript data <b>100</b> is transferred to, for example, the printer <b>17</b> by use of the network <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Setting information for executing each of the output modes is set by a user through the operating unit <b>6</b>. The setting information is stored on, for example, a hard disk of the storage unit <b>5</b>, for each destination data <b>101</b> in the form of the setting table <b>19</b> (which will be described later), in which the transmission source data <b>102</b> or the special data <b>104</b> is correlated with various setting information such as the output mode.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Incidentally, the setting information may be set by using the host computer <b>15</b> connected through the LAN <b>13</b>A or a management terminal (not shown).</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">(Setting Table)</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the setting table <b>19</b> is data stored by correlating the transmission source data <b>102</b> or the special data <b>104</b> and information necessary to execute the output mode with each other for the destination data <b>101</b>. The setting table <b>19</b> can be set for each destination data <b>101</b>. The user can input and select necessary items of the setting table <b>19</b> by use of the operation unit <b>6</b> to arrange setting information. The setting table <b>19</b> is stored in the storage unit in the form of a table.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Incidentally, the transmission source data <b>102</b> of the setting table <b>19</b> may not be required to set all items. In other words, at least one item of the transmission source data <b>102</b> is required to set. A transmission source can be specified if any one of the items of the transmission source data <b>102</b> is input. Any language can be input for the transmission source data <b>102</b> and can be used for the destination data <b>101</b>. Further, multiple languages can coexist in the setting table <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Additionally, a setting operation can be performed such that a plurality of output modes is correlated with the single piece of transmission source data <b>102</b> or special data <b>104</b>. According thereto, it is possible to output a single manuscript in a plurality of output modes.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, a plurality of output locations can be set for one output mode. For example, a plurality of printers <b>17</b> may be set as output locations of the transfer mode, and a plurality of mail addresses may be set as output locations of the mail transmission mode.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(Setting Table)</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, method for setting the setting table <b>19</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When a user operates the operating unit <b>6</b>, and a setting command of the setting table <b>19</b> is recognized at step <b>101</b> (hereinafter, referred to simply as &#x201c;S<b>101</b>&#x201d;) (S<b>101</b>: Yes), it is determined whether the destination data <b>101</b> to be set is input at S<b>102</b>. If it is determined that the destination data <b>101</b> is required to be input (S<b>102</b>: Yes), the destination data <b>101</b> is input and is stored in the storage unit <b>5</b> at S<b>103</b>. After the input of the destination data <b>101</b> is completed at S<b>103</b>, the destination data <b>101</b> to be set is selected at S<b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In contrast, if it is determined that the destination data <b>101</b> is not required to be input at S<b>102</b> (S<b>102</b>: No), S<b>103</b> is skipped, and the destination data <b>101</b> to be set is selected at S<b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Then, the transmission data <b>102</b> or the special data <b>104</b> is input at S<b>105</b>. As described above, what is required to input the transmission data <b>102</b> is to set any one of the sender name, the company name, the address, the telephone number, the fax number, and the e-mail address. Additionally, to input the special data <b>104</b>, a user can freely set character strings, signs, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">At S<b>106</b>, an output mode is set for the transmission data <b>102</b> or the special data <b>104</b> that has been input at S<b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Then, an output location in an output mode is set at S<b>107</b>. At this time, a plurality of output locations may be set without being limited to one output location. For example, if a storage mode is set at S<b>105</b>, the storage unit <b>5</b> and the host computer <b>15</b> may be set as destinations to which the manuscript data <b>100</b> is transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Then, at S<b>108</b>, it is determined whether an additional output mode is set for the transmission source data <b>102</b> or the special data <b>104</b> that has been input at S<b>105</b>. In other words, in one piece of transmission source data <b>102</b> or one piece of special data <b>104</b>, it is determined whether a plurality of output modes are set.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If it is determined that the additional output mode is set (S<b>108</b>: Yes), the process returns to S<b>106</b>, and setting of the additional output mode is executed at S<b>106</b> and S<b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In contrast, if it is determined that the additional output mode is not set (S<b>108</b>: No), it is determined at S<b>109</b> whether an additional transmission source data <b>102</b> or an additional special data <b>104</b> is input for the destination data <b>101</b> that has been selected at S<b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">If it is determined that the additional transmission source data <b>102</b> or the additional special data <b>104</b> is input (S<b>109</b>: Yes), the process returns to S<b>105</b>, and the additional input transmission source data <b>102</b> or the special data <b>104</b> is input at steps of from S<b>105</b> to S<b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In contrast, if it is determined that the additional transmission source data <b>102</b> or the additional special data <b>104</b> is not input (S<b>109</b>: No), it is determined whether the destination data <b>101</b> is again input or selected at S<b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If it is determined that the destination data <b>101</b> is again input or selected (S<b>110</b>: Yes), the process returns to S<b>102</b>, and the destination data <b>101</b> is again selected, and the setting table <b>19</b> will be set at following steps.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In contrast, if it is determined that the destination data <b>101</b> is not again input or selected (S<b>110</b>: No), the setting process is completed.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">(Operations)</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, operations of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> and operations of the facsimile receiving system <b>500</b> using the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It is assumed that the process of the invention is applied to the manuscript data <b>100</b>. If it is determined that a manuscript has been faxed and received from the facsimile machine <b>14</b> at S<b>201</b> (S<b>201</b>: Yes), specific information is extracted from the manuscript data <b>100</b> by the CPU <b>9</b> at S<b>202</b>, and the character recognition part of the scanner unit <b>7</b> respectively recognizes the destination data <b>101</b>, the transmission source data <b>102</b> and the special data <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Then, it is determined whether reference has been made to the setting tables <b>19</b> of all pieces of destination data <b>101</b> at S<b>203</b>. If it is determined that reference has not been made to the setting tables <b>19</b> of all pieces of destination data <b>101</b> (S<b>203</b>: No), reference is made by the setting table <b>19</b> to the transmission source data <b>102</b>, to the special data <b>104</b>, and to the output mode based on one piece of recognized destination data <b>101</b> at S<b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Then, it is determined whether the manuscript data <b>100</b> is unnecessary at S<b>205</b>. The reason why a determination of whether the manuscript data <b>100</b> is unnecessary is required is to meet user's request to discard the manuscript data <b>100</b> including the corresponding transmission source data <b>102</b> and the corresponding special data <b>104</b>. For example, S<b>205</b> discards a junk facsimile including advertisement, sales promotion, service information or the like and being sent to a large indefinite number of destinations.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If it is determined that the manuscript data <b>100</b> is unnecessary (S<b>205</b>: Yes), the process returns to S<b>203</b>, and it is determined whether reference has been made to the setting tables <b>19</b> of all recipients.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">If it is determined that the manuscript data <b>100</b> is not unnecessary at S<b>205</b> (S<b>205</b>: No), an output operation is executed in each output mode at the following steps of from S<b>206</b> to S<b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">If the storage mode is set in the output mode, received data (i.e., the manuscript data <b>100</b>) is stored in the storage unit <b>5</b> at S<b>206</b> and S<b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">If the print mode is set in the output mode, the manuscript data <b>100</b> is printed by the printer unit <b>8</b> at S<b>208</b> and S<b>209</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">If the mail transmission mode is set in the output mode, a mail is sent to the mail server <b>16</b> through the network <b>13</b> at S<b>210</b> and S<b>211</b>. The mail sent thereto, i.e., the contents of the manuscript data <b>100</b> can be confirmed by accessing the mail server <b>16</b> from the terminal device <b>18</b> and receiving the mail.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">If the transfer mode is set in the output mode, the manuscript data <b>100</b> is transferred to the printer <b>17</b> through the network <b>13</b> at S<b>212</b> and S<b>213</b>. The manuscript data <b>100</b> transferred thereto is printed by the printer <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The output operation is executed in this way, and then the process returns to S<b>203</b>, where it is again determined whether reference has been made to the setting tables <b>19</b> of all recipients.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If it is determined that reference has been made to the setting tables <b>19</b> of all recipients at S<b>203</b> (S<b>203</b>: Yes), the manuscript data <b>100</b> becomes unnecessary, and hence is deleted at S<b>214</b>.</p>
