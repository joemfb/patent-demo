<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hydrocarbons such as methane and carbon dioxide that are captured in ice crystals on the world's ocean floors store more energy than all fossil fuel reserves of coal, oil, and natural gas. Although these deposits provide a tremendous source of reusable energy, release and leakage of methane and other greenhouse gases pose a serious threat to the Earth's atmosphere. Analysis of arctic snow cores has shown that Earth's atmosphere contains about two times as much methane and thirty percent more carbon dioxide compared to any other time in the last 160,000 years. These greenhouse gases cause deleterious changes in the atmosphere. Increased presence of greenhouse gases results in greater trapping and accumulation of solar energy in the atmosphere, causing evaporation of the oceans and facilitates global climate change such as more frequent and more powerful hurricanes, torrential rainstorms and floods, more frequent tornadoes and lightning strikes, thereby resulting in increased weather-related economic loss and damages to human investments in farms, homes, and other industrial ventures.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The world population and demand for energy has grown to the point of requiring more oil than can be produced. To maintain the progress achieved by the Industrial Revolution that currently depends upon annually burning fossil resources that took more than one million years to accumulate, alternative sources of energy need to be utilized to produce sufficient energy to meet the ever-increasing energy demands of a growing population along with greater demand per person.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Previous efforts to harvest and produce energy from methane hydrates on the ocean floor have failed because of difficult problems including:

        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">Difficult ocean floor terrain such as adversely sloping areas where methane hydrate deposits are found. In addition, depending upon the temperature, hydrates may only be stable at depths greater than 1000&#x2032;.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">Unstable environmental conditions including the factors of (1) and (2) combined with the unstable nature of the methane hydrate deposits at temperatures above the freezing point of ice and at pressures less than about 480 psi.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0008">Expense and inefficiency of storage and transport of hydrocarbon hydrates. In addition to the factors discussed above, methane hydrate is relatively low in energy storage density because it is mostly water in the form of an ice crystal that surrounds a molecule of methane.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0009">Difficult mining situations with a high degree of environmental impact.

<p id="p-0021" num="0025">In order to fully understand the manner in which the above-recited details and other advantages and objects according to the invention are obtained, a more detailed description of the embodiments will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">The present invention is directed to systems and methods to produce and utilize methane, carbon dioxide, fixed nitrogen, trace minerals, carbon, and hydrogen derived from renewable resources. The system and method described herein are also directed to improved production, storage, and transfer of carbon materials, various useful chemical preparations, hydrogen, and energy from gas hydrate deposits.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">In one embodiment, a gas hydrate conversion system for harvesting hydrocarbon hydrate deposits and method of its use is provided. Though the gas hydrate conversion system may be used to harvest any type of hydrocarbon hydrate deposits from many types of sources, it is described in this embodiment for use in harvesting methane from gas hydrate deposits on the ocean floor. The current disclosure provides embodiments and combinations of embodiments for optimizing the production of valuable goods such as electricity, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oleum, sulfuric acid, ammonia, various ammonium compounds, nitric acid, oxides of nitrogen, and a variety of carbon products from feedstock compounds such as potentially troublesome hydrocarbon greenhouse gases along with such feedstocks of fossil origins. In one embodiment, high-value graphite products with novel capabilities are produced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">One skilled in the art will appreciate that aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein can apply to other types of gas hydrate conversion systems to provide similar advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">Gas hydrates found at the cold depths of the ocean floor represent a larger hydrocarbon reserve than all of the fossil coal, oil, and natural gas on earth's continents. According to some embodiments, the methods described herein may be used in a process for averting potentially catastrophic releases of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. This may be accomplished by harvesting and converting ocean floor deposits of hydrocarbon hydrates into energy, hydrogen, and carbon products. Harvested hydrocarbons may be utilized to produce needed goods and energy. Fresh water may be produced by decomposition of harvested gas hydrates or by chemical union of hydrogen and oxygen from air and may be distributed to meet the needs of seaboard communities. Collection and production apparatus are powered by electricity and hydrogen made from hydrocarbons extracted from fragile ice crystals at cold ocean depths.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">The embodiments described herein provide a system and associated methods for extracting methane from gas hydrate deposits on the ocean floor with minimal environmental impact. Such system and methods overcome the problems discussed above. Direct and/or indirect solar energy may utilized to release hydrocarbons from ice deposits. The system for extracting methane may capture solar energy at the ocean surface and use it to release methane and other hydrocarbons from hydrate deposits found on the cold, dark ocean floor. Alternatively, the system may harness renewable energy in heat pumping operations to release the methane and other hydrocarbons from hydrate deposits. The embodiments described herein provide a high volume conversion of hydrocarbons into customized carbon materials and hydrogen. The carbon materials and hydrogen may then be used to produce valuable goods as described above. For example, durable goods that contain substantial amounts of carbon such as packaging, fabrics, carpeting, paint and appliances made largely from thermoplastic and thermoset polymers may be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">The embodiments further provide additional carbon, graphite, and other products made in large part from carbon for purposes of sequestering the converted carbon from methane and other hydrocarbon greenhouse gases that would otherwise pose a threat to the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">In the embodiment described herein, high volume and improved efficiency conversion of hydrocarbons into carbon, carbon products, pyrolitic and other sources of customized graphite, and hydrogen is provided. In one embodiment, the hydrogen may be used for transportation fuel, production of electricity, and manufacture or production of chemicals (e.g., hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, ammonia, ammonium compounds, and various forms of carbon). Other objects and advantages will become apparent from the following specification and discussion of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a gas conversion system <b>100</b> having a floating factory <b>2</b> within a vessel and a harvesting appendage <b>19</b> that extracts methane from gas hydrate deposits <b>4</b> at the bottom of the ocean is shown. The extracted methane may be converted to carbon materials and hydrogen to be used to produce various valuable products as described above. A moveable pickup bell <b>6</b> may be provided at the distal end of the harvesting appendage <b>19</b> that provides a pathway with reduced pressure for the methane and induces the release of methane and other gas hydrates by heating the gas hydrate deposits <b>4</b> by a heat distributor <b>11</b>. Heating of the gas hydrates at the ocean floor to release methane is by a combination of techniques including the use of warm surface water in which pump <b>7</b> delivers surface water through conduit <b>9</b> to heat distributor <b>11</b> within bell <b>6</b> where it heats the gas hydrate in the area under the bell. Additional heat from factory operations may be added to warm surface water for this purpose. After warming the gas hydrate sufficiently to release methane the warming water is exhausted by gas-liquid separator assembly including downward opening louvers <b>12</b>, annular shroud <b>14</b>, and methane recovery director <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0034">The moveable pickup bell <b>6</b> is a primary collector of methane and other gas hydrates, released by heating of the gas hydrate deposits <b>4</b>. At least two zones of methane recovery are provided in conjunction with the harvesting appendage <b>19</b>. A primary methane capture zone <b>51</b> corresponds to the area under the moveable pickup bell (or primary collector) <b>6</b> wherein warm water from heat distributor <b>11</b> transfers heat to the hydrate deposit <b>4</b> to initiate release of methane and uptake by the primary hydrate conduit <b>8</b>. A secondary capture zone <b>52</b> surrounds the primary methane capture zone <b>51</b>, and corresponds to the area under a flexible skirt (or secondary collector) <b>80</b> that prevents escape of continued methane release after the bell has moved away from the primary methane capture zone <b>51</b> within a hydrate deposit harvesting area. Methane that is released too slowly to be captured in the primary collection zone <b>51</b> and found in the areas behind the movement of the primary collection zone <b>51</b> is captured within the secondary methane capture zone <b>52</b> under the flexible skirt <b>80</b> and are collected by a secondary hydrate conduit <b>82</b> and director vent <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">Flexible skirt <b>80</b> may also serve as a turbulence buffer to prevent silt and debris from being disturbed by the flow of warming water from heat distributor <b>11</b>. Silt that is entrained in water flowing upwards to separator <b>12</b> is returned to the ocean floor by a return distributor such as annular shroud <b>14</b> and may be directed by jets <b>71</b>, <b>73</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to a settling area of the ocean floor that is at a suitable location generally away from the area of hydrate harvest.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">Methane captured by the bell <b>6</b> and skirt <b>80</b> then travels and expands upward through the conduits toward an engine <b>10</b>. The engine <b>10</b> may be any suitable engine to propel the vessel, including, but not limited to, a turbo generator, a turbine, or a combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">The engine <b>10</b> is powered by expanding harvested methane that travels toward the factory via conduits <b>8</b>, <b>82</b>. Considerable energy is available for conversion to motive power by the expanding methane alone or in combination with other natural agents such as water, steam and wind. Such motive power may be used to propel or otherwise facilitate the transport or movement of a vessel in water. Energy produced by the engine <b>10</b> provides an important recovery of heat and/or pumping energy that may be used to further warm water delivered to the hydrate deposits by the heat distributor <b>11</b>. A novel thermodynamic cycle is performed in which heat from surface waters that may be 10&#xb0; to 30&#xb0; warmer than water at the ocean floor is used to release methane from hydrates at the ocean floor. Released methane provides a much higher thermodynamic quality and a denser, expansive medium than water vapor that is typically utilized in partial-pressure Ocean Thermal Energy Cycles or OTEC systems. This allows engine <b>10</b> to be much smaller and the system to be much less expensive than conventional OTEC systems working in the same conditions of the ocean environment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">In operation, released methane is continuously and rapidly heated by warming waters to achieve the highest thermodynamic properties and highest velocity toward turbine engine <b>10</b>. Water in primary and secondary conduits <b>8</b>, <b>82</b> is carried upward by the rising methane and is returned to the ocean by downward opening louvers <b>12</b>. Methane that is trapped in exiting water is recovered by shroud <b>14</b><i>a </i>that empties through upward opening louvers to the methane recovery director <b>16</b> where recovered methane joins primary methane traveling upward to turbine engine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">It is contemplated that heating of water including relatively fresh water that is a product of the decomposition of gas hydrates as described below may be accomplished using a system such as that which is disclosed in a U.S. patent application, filed concurrently herewith on Aug. 16, 2010 and titled METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF SUPPLEMENTED OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY CONVERSION(SOTEC) Ser. No. 12/857,546, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety as if fully set forth herein. In this instance it is optionally intended to evaporate such collected water in the cycle disclosed for further energy conversion and purification of water inventories first collected in conjunction with decomposition of gas hydrates.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">Additional heating may be supplied by a heat pump assembly <b>25</b> particularly in waters that have too little temperature difference between the surface and the ocean floor to release methane from the deposits of hydrate at the desired rate. Heat pump assembly <b>25</b>, includes a heat exchanger <b>20</b> where the working fluid is pressurized to increase the temperature, an expansion device <b>22</b> which may be a valve or expansion motor, an input heat exchanger <b>18</b> where expanded and cooled working fluid is heated by ocean water, and a compressor or pump <b>24</b> that compresses the working fluid into heat exchanger <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, wherein the expansion device <b>22</b> is an expander motor it is preferred to drive an electricity generator or to add the motive power to the drive for pump <b>24</b> for energy recovery purposes. In other embodiments, it is preferred to drive compressor <b>24</b> with renewable energy such as with a motor using electricity from a turbo generator engine <b>10</b> or by an internal combustion engine using methane and/or hydrogen extracted from the produced methane. Heat exchanger <b>18</b> may be coupled to the hull of floating factory vessel <b>2</b> to expand the area exposed to surrounding warm ocean water. Alternatively, one or more collection lines or inlets <b>26</b> may be present to provide a supply of warm surface ocean water from the surrounding ocean water.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">In some embodiments, energy to power the components of the floating factory <b>2</b> including heat pump <b>18</b> may be provided by renewable energy selected from the energy resource group including solar, wind, ocean current, wave, and hydrogen extracted from the renewable methane being harvested from the ocean floor. The use of a heat pump <b>24</b> to add heat to surface water warmed by solar energy is a preferred method for heating water found in low solar insulated areas. This is because for every unit of energy applied to compressor <b>24</b>, three or more units of heat are added to the warm water collected from the ocean surface water, enabling a striking use of solar energy that is captured by the vast expanses of ocean surface. Further, use of a heat pump <b>24</b> results in much faster and controlled release of methane from the hydrates at the freezing temperature of the dark ocean floor.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">Methane and other gases released by the present invention are separated into hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbon substances by filter trains <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each filter train provides very low impedance to methane flow and can be individually removed from operation for maintenance without reducing the throughput of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, after removal of non-hydrocarbons such as hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, and water vapor from the gas mixture produced in bell <b>6</b>, the remaining hydrocarbons are taken to a heat exchanger assembly <b>108</b>, preheated and then conveyed from port <b>110</b> to port <b>112</b> of furnace <b>102</b> in which graphite is deposited at 1,500&#xb0; C. to 3,000&#xb0; C. to form one or more continuously extracted billets <b>118</b>. Seals <b>114</b> prevent gases from escaping from the chamber formed by furnace <b>102</b> between opposing billet deposition faces <b>116</b>. As provided in Equation 2, hydrogen is released and is used in an exothermic reaction with oxygen to preheat incoming methane, water, and air in heat exchanger assembly <b>108</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">About 18 Kcal/mol or 32,400 BTU/lb mole CH<sub>4 </sub>is the required heat addition to decompose methane into carbon and hydrogen as shown in Equation 2. At 80% heat conservation efficiency this requires heat production of about 22.5 Kcal or 40,500/BTU lb mole which may be applied by any combination of applied heat including resistance heating, induction heating or by transfer of combustion heat in combustion annulus <b>105</b> as shown according to the reaction of Equation 1. Preheated hydrocarbon inventories can be divided between furnace port <b>112</b> for deposition of graphite and combustion annulus <b>105</b>. Along with preheated air hydrocarbons are fed into combustion annulus <b>105</b> for heating furnace <b>102</b> with or without assistance by electric heaters <b>104</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">The higher heating value of methane is 23,890 BTU/lb of CH<sub>4</sub>. Thus, 1.7 pounds of methane is burned to release 40,500 BTU/mole which is used to convert one mole of methane to one mole of carbon and two moles of hydrogen. At the assigned unit value of $1/10<sup>6 </sup>BTU for produced CH<sub>4</sub>, this is a fuel cost of about $0.041 to supply the heat needed to deposit 12 pounds of carbon and release 4 pounds of hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">The method and system described herein thus provides an efficient way to sequester or store carbon and eliminate a dangerous greenhouse gas threat to Earth's environment. In addition, hydrogen is efficiently produced and may be used in part to cleanly power the factory ship along with other vessels in the sea or it may be transported to shore by pipelines or tanker ships. Hydrogen provides no greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide or hydrocarbons upon combustion or use in a fuel cell and is greatly needed to for electricity generation and transportation applications in polluted cities of the world. Cooled hydrogen may be stored as a hydride, compressed gas, hydrogenated compound, cryogenic liquid, or slush in storage tanks <b>61</b>, <b>63</b>, and <b>65</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">After heating steam, incoming air, and methane the hydrogen may further heat ocean water either by direct heat exchange or in conjunction with heat pump <b>18</b> to aid in the release of methane from the ocean floor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">According to the embodiments described herein, the bell <b>6</b> may be constructed with sufficient weight to maintain its position against the sea floor regardless of the methane release rate from the hydrate deposit <b>4</b> being harvested and resulting buoyant forces. The bell <b>6</b> may be moved within a horizontal plane to harvest a large surface area hydrate deposit or it may be moved up and down a vertical plane to follow hydrate deposits that have relatively small areas but deep veins. Primary and secondary conduits <b>8</b>, <b>82</b> may be made of flexible tubing or telescoping tubing or combinations of both types for accommodating the situation being harvested. Horizontal propulsion of bell <b>8</b> is preferably by occasional jets of water from nozzles <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> (not shown), <b>74</b> that are in at least three or more opposing equally spaced locations around the upper portion of bell <b>6</b>. Suitable position sensors provide guidance of the harvesting appendage <b>19</b> and related components including the return location of debris through a return distributor <b>14</b> by a central controller <b>506</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Central controller <b>506</b> also adaptively optimizes operations including tracking of solar concentrator <b>54</b>, heat pump assembly <b>25</b> and other energy conversion operations. In instances that harvesting appendage <b>19</b> is controlled to traverse a hydrate deposit <b>4</b> with a large area, it is generally preferred to harvest blocks of hydrate deposits <b>4</b> by movement of bell <b>6</b> by thrust from jets <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> (not shown), <b>74</b> as needed to complete a block pattern of extraction and then to move the floating factory to the center of the next block to be harvested.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">According to some embodiments, power for propulsion and manufacturing operations is preferably provided by one or more heat engines that utilize thermochemical regeneration principles to increase thermal efficiency (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Billet(s) <b>118</b> are heated by combustion and supplemental heat from resistance or induction heaters <b>104</b> within furnace <b>102</b> to facilitate rapid decomposition of the methane and to deposit graphite. Graphite is generally the preferred form of carbon deposit because it provides a novel heat conservation methodology. Pyrolytic graphite is highly insulative in the direction perpendicular to the preferred basal plane of deposition. It is highly conductive within the basal planes. Heat released by combustion in channels <b>105</b> or input by electrical heating from heaters <b>104</b> provides uniform heating of the exposed basal planes for producing a high rate of carbon deposition. After being withdrawn from furnace <b>102</b> it is desired to conserve the heat from the hot billets <b>118</b> by heating water circulated in a counter-currant heat exchanger <b>120</b> as shown. Hot steam from W-<b>4</b> is used with a portion of the incoming methane to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide as shown in Equation 3, below.

<p id="p-0046" num="0050">Heat transfer components and operations for thermochemical regeneration for efficient operation of an engine <b>416</b> are provided according to one embodiment. A controller <b>441</b> adaptively adjusts the coordinates the adjustment of pumps, valves, and heating operations to optimize the processes described herein.

<p id="p-0050" num="0054">The process of Equation 4 can be accomplished by liquid phase methanol slurry catalysts at about 250&#xb0; F. (120&#xb0; C.) at favorable rates to produce inexpensive methanol.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">Nitrogen that is separated from the exhaust of engine <b>416</b> can be used as a cover gas for autoclave processing and it can be reacted with hydrogen to form ammonia or a variety of compounds. Equation 5 shows the venerable process of ammonia formation.

<p id="p-0052" num="0056">In some embodiments, sulfur may be utilized in the form of H<sub>2</sub>S and other sulfur compounds that are removed from the gas mixture delivered to the filter trains in processes that provide valuable chemicals and fertilizers. For example, ammonium sulfate can be readily produced from such feed stocks using any suitable technology including the well known Saturator, Wilputte, Pickle Liquor or Indirect process. Oleum and/or sulfuric acid may also be produced from sulfur values in the delivered gas mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">Similarly, other compounds such as ammonium chloride, ammonium bromide, ammonium iodide, ammonium nitrate, ammonium acetate, ammonium phosphate, and ammonium carbonates may be readily produced according to some embodiments to meet market demand for such products.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">According to another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, solar energy may be harnessed and used to initiate release of gas hydrates in areas that have abundant solar radiation reaching the surface of the ocean. In a preferred embodiment, some embodiments, solar energy is utilized to heat engine generators and photovoltaic arrays to produce electricity and to provide a solar energy apparatus <b>200</b> to beam concentrated solar energy to the ocean floor for purposes of heating the hydrate and releasing methane into bell <b>6</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the solar energy apparatus <b>200</b> may include a solar collector <b>54</b> that concentrates and delivers light at incident angles that efficiently conveys the light through a light conduit <b>56</b> with highly reflective walls to provide high-intensity delivery of solar energy directly to the areas where methane releases are desired. Delivery of light to the ocean floor, as opposed to warm water delivered by a heat distributor, provides the advantage of causing fewer disturbances of silt and debris.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">Light conduit <b>56</b> may also include a light pipe <b>56</b><i>a </i>of highly transparent medium such as glass or plastic that conducts solar energy to the ocean floor. Both types of light pipes <b>56</b><i>a </i>may use an artificial light and parabolic reflector assembly <b>58</b> to supplement and/or replace solar energy as needed. Suitable light sources include radiant sources such as catalytic heaters that combust hydrogen or methane to provide mostly infrared output, mantle burners with thorium oxide and rare earths that produce considerable light in the visible spectrum, incandescent lights, fluorescent lights, mercury vapor lights, sodium vapor lights, sulfur vapor lights and many other suitable artificial light sources. Final distribution and sealing of the light pipe is by an array of light distributors <b>60</b> as shown within bell <b>6</b>. The use of solar energy to release methane gas from gas hydrate deposits according to this embodiment may be used alone or in combination with a heat distributor <b>11</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">According to yet another embodiment, occasional washing of the methane collection system is provided by high pressure spraying from a robot spray cleaning system (RSCS) <b>500</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Cleaning of interior areas is generally more important than cleaning of exterior areas. With all other operations halted, one or more RSCS units may be added through ports at the top of flow director <b>14</b> and conduit <b>8</b> to clean the inside surfaces as needed to maintain the system in good working order. High pressure pump <b>502</b> supplies spray water to one or more RSCS spray units <b>514</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">In operation, the RSCS units assist in propelling themselves by orienting the cleaning sprays <b>504</b> in directions that provide thrust in the intended direction of travel. A central controller <b>506</b> provides coordination of the spray jet orientations to generally cancel jet thrust by actions of nozzles on opposite sides of the RSCS as shown. Positioning a RSCS at critical areas that need cleaning is accomplished by coordinated measurements of the distance that delivery tubing <b>510</b> is extended from storage spool <b>512</b> and by the angle and location that an inertial guidance navigation system within each RSCS reports to the central controller <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not limited except as by the appended claims.</p>
