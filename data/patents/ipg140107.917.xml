<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a pivotally secured together plier device used to manually restructure and roughen the surface of a synthetic tennis string on a strung tennis racquet. The roughened string surface increases the friction between the string and the tennis ball and thus the player can more easily generate spin on a tennis ball or a racket ball while striking the ball.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many tennis players try many different techniques to generate spin when they hit the tennis balls. The spin is generated by friction between the string and the ball. Thus, the rougher the string surface is, the easier it is for the player to generate spin. However, most strings, especially the new synthetic strings, are cylindrical in shape and have a smooth surface, making it difficult for players to generate a high speed spin on the tennis balls.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most strings are made of synthetic fiber and some of them are made of natural gut. Some string manufacturers provide Octagon or Hexagon shaped strings to increase the friction between the string and ball. It may be effective on the main string, but it does not make any difference on the cross string because of the direction of the racquet swing movement. In addition, after some time, the sharp edge of the Octagon and Hexagon will be worn away by wear and tear between the string and ball. Some strings come with a series of small dents on the surface to increase the roughness of the string surface. This is effective when it is new, however, after some time, the small dents will be worn off and the string surface becomes smooth again.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Even though the above mentioned non-cylindrical strings are commercially available, they can be expensive and/or lose some other good quality characteristics compared to traditional cylindrical shaped strings. Cylindrical shaped strings are still the most commonly used strings.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The primary objective of this invention is to provide a plier device to mechanically and permanently restructure the surface of a tennis racquet string, section by section on a strung tennis racquet, by means of mechanical deformation on a string.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a plier device comprising a pair of handle levers including a middle portion pivotally secured together with a pivot shaft. Each lever has a handle on one end and a jaw on the other. The plier device is made of steel or another hard material. Both upper jaw and bottom jaw have an elevated pattern of closely adjacent line grids. The end of the bottom jaw has an &#x201c;L&#x201d; shaped string locker design with a slot in the middle, which allows the bottom jaw to slide beneath a string by rotating the plier handles. Once the upper jaw is above the string and bottom jaw is beneath the string, close the pliers. A series of elevated line grids will then press and reform the string surface and leave a series of indentations on the string without damaging other characteristics of the string. The roughened string surface increases friction between the string and ball, making it easier for the players to generate spin. After some time, if the indentations on the string are removed because of wear and tear, the pliers can be used again to roughen the string.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tool of the present invention can be seen to include two plier handles <b>10</b>-<b>10</b> which pivot about pivot pin <b>11</b>. One of the handles <b>10</b>-<b>10</b> is rigidly connected to upper jaw <b>22</b> and the other handle is rigidly connected to lower jaw <b>21</b>. When handles <b>10</b>-<b>10</b> are spread apart, the jaws open, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and when the handles <b>10</b>-<b>10</b> are closed, the jaws close, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Upper jaw <b>22</b> and lower jaw <b>21</b> contain an elevated pattern of adjacent line grids <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The line grids <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> can come with different shapes, a rectangular block, a pyramid, a triangle or a half cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The upper jaw <b>22</b> and lower jaw <b>21</b> are shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The upper jaw <b>22</b> has an elevated L shaped jaw tip <b>25</b> at the end. An elevated pattern of elements <b>18</b> is on the top of elevated L shaped jaw tip <b>25</b>. Right beneath the elevated L shaped jaw tip <b>25</b> on the upper jaw <b>22</b>, a recessed indentation <b>24</b> is located on the lower jaw <b>21</b>. The indentation <b>24</b> is about &#x215b;&#x2033;-&#xbd;&#x2033; wide and 3/16&#x2033; to 5/16&#x2033; deep. An elevated pattern of line grids <b>19</b> is on the top of the recessed indentation <b>24</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The recessed indentation <b>24</b> is to lock the string in place once the lower jaw <b>21</b> slides beneath the string. Upon closure of the upper jaw <b>22</b> and the lower jaw <b>21</b>, a gap <b>12</b> is formed between line grids on the upper jaw <b>22</b> and the lower jaw <b>21</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The formed gap <b>12</b> is about 1/32&#x2033; which prevents the string from being cut by the elevated line grids <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> on the upper jaw <b>22</b> and lower jaw <b>21</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The lower jaw <b>21</b> has 2 elevated L shaped string lockers <b>23</b> at the end, which are extruded from upper jaw <b>22</b>, as indicated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Between these two L shaped string lockers <b>23</b>, at the end of lower jaw <b>21</b>, a slot <b>16</b> about &#x215b;&#x2033; in width and &#xbd;&#x2033; in depth is located in the center.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it can be seen that the center lines of the elevated pattern line grids <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> are not parallel to the center lines of the upper jaw <b>21</b> and lower jaw <b>22</b>. Instead, these two lines form an angle A<b>1</b>. Angle A<b>1</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may vary from about 15&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0;, or more preferably from about 20&#xb0; to 25&#xb0;. This feature allows the string pliers to make indentation marks on the strings that are not vertical or parallel to the center line of the main or cross strings. This design makes it easier for tennis players to generate spin on the balls.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it can be seen that the center line of upper jaw <b>22</b> and bottom jaw <b>21</b> is not parallel to the center line of the handles <b>10</b> of the pliers. Instead, it forms an angle A<b>2</b>. This feature makes the tool of the present invention much easier to operate than if it had the center line of upper jaw <b>22</b> and lower jaw <b>21</b> in direct alignment with the center line of the plier handles <b>10</b>. Angle A<b>2</b> indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may vary from about 15&#xb0; to about 35&#xb0;, or more preferably from about 20&#xb0; to 25&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The manner in which the tool of the present invention is used to deform and roughen the surface of the string on a strung racquet is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7-12</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the player intends to make a series of indentations on a cross string <b>14</b> on a strung racquet <b>13</b>. The player first puts the elevated L shaped string lockers <b>23</b> located at the end of lower jaw <b>21</b> under the cross string <b>14</b>, while the main string <b>15</b> is inserted in the slot <b>16</b> located in the center of lower jaw <b>21</b>. The L shaped string lockers <b>23</b> and the slot <b>16</b> lock both the main string <b>15</b> and the cross string <b>14</b> in place. This step is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The player then pushes down the plier handles <b>10</b>, so the plier pivots about the cross string <b>14</b>, As a result, the main string <b>15</b> is pushed down by the slot <b>16</b> and the lower jaw <b>21</b> is pushed under the cross string <b>14</b>. Cross string <b>14</b> is then pushed on the recessed indentation <b>24</b> on lower jaw <b>21</b>, and indentation <b>24</b> locks the cross string <b>14</b> in place, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Finally, the player can close the pliers and leave a series of indentations on the cross string <b>14</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11-14</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> show the front and the back of cross string <b>14</b> before the pliers are used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> show the front and the back of cross string <b>14</b> after the pliers are used to depress the cross string <b>14</b>. After the string is pressed, the pliers can then be opened and rotated upward to release the cross string <b>14</b> and main string <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The same manner can be repeated to put a series of indentations on the rest of the cross string <b>14</b> and the main string <b>15</b>. The player needs to turn over the racquet and work on the other side of the racquet to complete roughening the string surface. It is not necessary to roughen all the strings on the racquet, it is sufficient to roughen the string in the &#x201c;sweet spot&#x201d;, where the string makes contact with the balls most often. This covers about &#xbd; the racquet area, in the center.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the pliers can be further modified so twice as much string can be depressed by the pliers at one time. The modification in general is to combine two upper jaws <b>22</b> and two lower jaws <b>21</b> together, and separate each pair of upper jaw <b>22</b> and lower jaw <b>21</b> with a long slot <b>26</b>. The slot <b>26</b> is about &#x215b;&#x2033; wide and 1&#x2033; in depth. When cross string <b>14</b> is being depressed, both slots <b>24</b> allow 2 main strings <b>15</b> to be inserted and slot <b>26</b> allows one main string <b>15</b> to be inserted. Slots <b>24</b> push down two main strings <b>15</b>, while slot <b>26</b> does not push down the main string <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The tool of the present invention is made from any suitable common metal such as steel alloy, aluminum alloy, and the like. The handles <b>10</b>-<b>10</b> of the tool may preferably be covered with an insulator such as plastic, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed for the purpose of illustration, it will be understood that various changes, modifications, and substitutions may be incorporated in such embodiment within the scope of the invention without departing from the spirit of this invention.</p>
