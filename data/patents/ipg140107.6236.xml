<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For a period of time it has been possible to browse the Internet on a television set connected to a set-top box with Internet access. Generally, when a user viewing a TV channel (e.g., Nickelodeon&#x2122;) wants to explore content on the Internet, the user transitions away from the selected channel to another screen with a browser performing navigation tasks. This scenario and the occasional desire of consumers to avoid commercials by scanning other TV channels poses a challenge for broadcast media service providers who want to retain viewership and maintain advertisement revenues as high as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A need therefore arises for a system and method for presenting media services.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments in accordance with the present disclosure provide a system and method for presenting media services.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a first embodiment of the present disclosure, a computer-readable storage medium in a portal can have computer instructions for presenting at a media system as an aggregated service selectable media services of the portal contextually associated with a multimedia broadcast channel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a second embodiment of the present disclosure, a media system can have a controller element that contextually associates a plurality of portals with a corresponding plurality of multimedia broadcast channels as an aggregated service offering.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a third embodiment of the present disclosure, a method can involve supplying to a media services distributor a portal contextually associated with the multimedia broadcast channel for distribution to media systems as an aggregated service.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a fourth embodiment of the present disclosure, a method can involve distributing an aggregated service comprising media programs of a multimedia broadcast channel and a portal contextually associated with the multimedia broadcast channel.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment of an IPTV communication system <b>100</b>. In a typical IPTV backbone, there is at least one super head office server (SHS) which receives national media programs from satellite and/or media servers from service providers of multimedia broadcast channels. The SHS server forwards IP packets associated with the media content to video head servers (VHS) via a network of video head offices (VHO) according to a common multicast communication method. The VHS then distributes multimedia broadcast programs to commercial and/or residential buildings <b>102</b> housing a gateway <b>104</b> (e.g., a residential gateway or RG) that distributes broadcast signals to receivers such as Set-Top Boxes (STBs) <b>108</b> which in turn present broadcast selections to media devices <b>108</b> such as computers or television units managed in some instances by a media controller <b>107</b> (e.g., an infrared or RF remote control).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Unicast traffic can also be exchanged between the STBs <b>108</b> and the subsystems of the IPTV communication system <b>100</b> for services such as video-on-demand (VoD). Although not shown, the aforementioned multimedia system can also be combined with analog broadcast distributions systems.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">To enhance user experience, the service providers of the broadcast channels supply multimedia service portals to the communication system <b>100</b>. In the present illustration, the portals are supplied to the SHS. However, the portals can also be introduced at other IPTV subsystems such as the VHO, VHS, LAN, RG <b>104</b>, STB <b>106</b>, media device <b>108</b>, or media controller <b>107</b> by way of an IP network associated with the communication system <b>100</b>. Each of these portals is contextually associated with a select multimedia broadcast channel.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an exemplary embodiment <b>200</b> of the media portals. In this illustration, each a portal can aggregate a variety of services that are contextually associated with a specific broadcast channel. For example, for the Nickelodeon&#x2122; channel, the portal can include: a program guide <b>204</b> tailored to said channel; on-demand content <b>206</b> of previously broadcast Nickelodeon&#x2122; programs; a chat room <b>208</b> for exchanging views on shows, content, characters, etc.; contests <b>210</b> to engage subscribers in competitive events associated with Nickelodeon; polling services <b>212</b> to monitor subscriber needs and biases; forums <b>214</b> in which subscribers can join organizations or groups of like-minded subscribers; a search engine for exploring topics related to Nickelodeon programs, characters, shows in the making, movies, and so forth; and an assortment of video games such as a game for Jimmy Neutron&#x2122;, a game for Sponge Bob Square Pants&#x2122;, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The media channel &#x201c;N&#x201d; portal depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a duplicate copy of the media channel &#x201c;1&#x201d; portal for illustration purposes only. In practice, it is expected that by contextually tailoring each portal to a broadcast channel that said portals will vary in the media services they offer. For example, a C-SPAN viewer may not be interested in games, or contests. Instead such viewers may want to see media service links for local, national, and international news. Hence, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in practice would likely show disparate embodiments for each of the media service portals.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an exemplary method <b>300</b> operating in portions of the communication system <b>100</b>. Method <b>300</b> begins with step <b>302</b> in which a number of service providers of one or more multimedia broadcast channels contextually identifies media services for each of said broadcast channels (such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In step <b>304</b>, each broadcast service provider aggregates by common means the media services they have identified into a web services portal which they have assigned to a corresponding multimedia channel (e.g., a portal for Nickelodeon, a portal for MTV, a portal for CBS, a portal for CSPAN, and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Once a portal has been established for each multimedia channel, each broadcast service provider supplies in step <b>306</b> to a media services distributor (e.g., Comcast, AT&#x26;T) media programming (i.e., regular 24-7 episode programming and advertisements) of a multimedia broadcast channel and the contextually associated portal for said channel for distribution to subscribers of the IPTV communication system <b>100</b> as an aggregated service.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Once the broadcast channels and associated portals have been distributed, an STB <b>106</b> in step <b>308</b> can be programmed to monitor a channel selection directed by a request submitted by a media controller <b>107</b>. Once a selection is detected, the STB <b>106</b> can be programmed to present in step <b>310</b> media programming of the select channel and can as a background process select the portal that is contextually associated with said channel for future viewing. The portal selection of step <b>310</b> can be based on metadata that is retrieved by the STB <b>106</b> from the broadcast channel, or by way of provisioning information that is periodically supplied to the STB by one of the IPTV subsystems of the communication system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The metadata or provisioning information can include a table that associates a channel with its portal, subscription information defining whether the subscriber can access said portal, and portal information such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and if desired authentication data to securely access the portal. The media services distributor can choose to charge subscribers for supplying contextual portals, or can provide said services free of charge based on subsidization by the service providers of the broadcast channels.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In step <b>312</b>, the STB <b>106</b> can monitor a request for viewing the portal associated with the selected broadcast channel. This request can be received as a selection made by a subscriber on the media controller <b>107</b> (e.g., selecting a portal button on the remote controller). Alternatively, the request for the portal can be prompted from detecting a request to change broadcast channels at step <b>308</b>. In this embodiment, the portal can be invoked automatically prior to allowing a change of broadcast channels as a means to retain viewership with the previously selected broadcast service provider (e.g., Nickelodeon). The level of resistance applied by steps <b>308</b>, <b>312</b> to allow a change of broadcast channels can be varied by the service provider of the IPTV system <b>100</b>. That is, to leave the portal once entered the end user can be asked to request a departure from said portal by way of one or more soft keys selectable from the media controller <b>107</b>. This approach effectively requires at least two or more actions by the end user to effectuate a switch between broadcast channels. A service provider of the IPTV system <b>100</b> can selectively charge fees to broadcast channel service providers for a level of resistance added to steps <b>308</b> and <b>312</b> to depart the contextual portal supplied thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">If the media controller <b>107</b> has a display, the STB <b>106</b> can be programmed to present in step <b>314</b> the portal service selected at the media controller <b>107</b> without interruption to the media program displayed at the media device <b>108</b>. Alternatively, the STB <b>106</b> can present the portal at the media device concurrently with the media program being viewed. In yet another embodiment, the STB <b>106</b> can present the portal at the media device <b>107</b> in place of the media program being viewed. In step <b>316</b>, the STB <b>106</b> monitors for selection of a media service of the portal. If no selection is made, the STB <b>106</b> proceeds to step <b>320</b>. Otherwise, in step <b>318</b> the STB <b>106</b> presents the selected media service at the media controller <b>107</b> or media device <b>108</b> according to one of the aforementioned presentation embodiments of step <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Steps <b>320</b>-<b>328</b> can serve as supplemental embodiments to enhance the media services supplied by the communication system <b>100</b>. In step <b>320</b>, for example, a service provider of a particular broadcast channel can program its portal web server to monitor a transition between media programs of a corresponding channel (e.g., Sponge Bob ends and Jimmy Neutron begins). Upon detecting a program transition such as by receiving at the portal a message transmitted by the broadcast system, the portal can be programmed to retrieve metadata in step <b>322</b> from the broadcast channel for the new media program, and adapt in step <b>324</b> some or all of the media service links of the portal to said new media program. By way of steps <b>320</b>-<b>324</b>, the portal can adapt itself to offer media links specifically tailored to a Sponge Bob Square Pants show, while different media service links can be presented during a Jimmy Neutron show.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In yet another supplemental embodiment, the plurality of portals can be programmed to receive in step <b>326</b> programming selections collected by the IPTV communication system <b>100</b> over a suitable periodic cycle (per day, per week, or month). The collected data can be processed by the portal using any common or future pattern recognition method (e.g., regression analysis) that can detect and/or predict use patterns. The use patterns can be categorized as demographic and/or psychographic patterns of subscribers, which the portals can utilize to adapt media services of said portal in step <b>328</b> to better match subscriber demand.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To more readily target subscribers, the portals can also selectively perform pattern recognition analysis on like broadcast channels (Disney versus Nickelodeon versus Cartoon Channel) to detect subscriber needs of a specific category and age group. Generally, the program selections collected from subscribers can be anonymous. For certain subscribers who accept program selection monitoring as an enhanced service feature, the portal can be programmed to adapt to each subscriber who has opted into this form of monitoring. In this latter case, the STB <b>106</b> in steps <b>310</b>-<b>318</b> can be provisioned to access a portal account that is tailored to the subscriber. Collecting program selections and distributing such information to the portals can be an additional source of revenue for the media distributor.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">From step <b>328</b>, method <b>300</b> repeats the foregoing steps starting at step <b>308</b>. Note that once an initial broadcast channel is selected after, for example, power cycle of a media device <b>108</b>, step <b>308</b> adapts so that step <b>312</b> proceeds step <b>308</b> when no program selections are detected. At steps <b>312</b>, <b>320</b> and <b>326</b> portal requests, program transitions, and user pattern detection are processed at periodic intervals while monitoring program selections in steps <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">From the enhanced presentation techniques of method <b>300</b> broadcast channel service providers can reasonably expect to augment the number of viewers who select their channel, and the duration of viewership. This helps broadcast service providers to increase advertisement revenue from sponsors who are willing to pay higher fees to attract consumers. Media distributors (like AT&#x26;T) can also benefit from method <b>300</b> by charging broadcast channel service providers for distributing contextual portals to its subscribers and for supplying subscriber behavior such as in step <b>326</b>. In some instances, the media distributors can also host web servers for the portals as a way to provide a unified look and feel to its subscribers, and to derive additional revenue from the broadcast service providers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">From the foregoing descriptions, it would be evident to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that the aforementioned embodiments can be modified, reduced, or enhanced without departing from the scope and spirit of the claims described below. For example, some or a portion of the processing described for method <b>300</b> can be redistributed at different portions of communication system <b>100</b>. Also, customized contextual portals can be supplied to each VHO rather than the SHS as a means for broadcast service providers to present focused regional or State services. The STBs <b>106</b> can also be programmed to perform program selection collection and pattern recognition detection which can be supplied to the portals for adaptation in steps <b>326</b>-<b>328</b>. The supplemental embodiments of steps <b>320</b>-<b>328</b> can be removed or modified without adversely affecting operations of the present disclosure. These are but a few examples of how the embodiments described herein can be updated without altering the scope of the claims below.
