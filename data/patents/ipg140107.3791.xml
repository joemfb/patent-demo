<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Touch screens are becoming increasingly common, but touch screens do not inherently have a feedback mechanism (like audible click from a conventional keyboard). Thus, haptic or mechanic vibration feedback has emerged as a new technology that can provide a feedback mechanism that would not otherwise be present. Conventional haptic solutions, however, suffer from demanding control from host controller or processor. Namely, conventional haptics solutions are generally limited host interface communication bottle neck, which can limit haptic effect variations (i.e., variable frequency control and gain control). Moreover, many of these haptics solutions have low power efficiency, which is due at least in part to an on-chip low drop-out regulator (LDO). Therefore, there is a need for a method and/or apparatus that addresses shortcomings in conventional haptics solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An example of a conventional haptics solution is U.S. Pat. No. 7,791,588.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Refer now to the drawings wherein depicted elements are, for the sake of clarity, not necessarily shown to scale and wherein like or similar elements are designated by the same reference numeral through the several views.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an example of a system <b>100</b> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention can be seen. This system <b>100</b> can be a number of devices such as portable media players, smartphones, or gaming controllers and generally comprises a touch screen <b>102</b> (which can be a capacitive or resistive touch screen), a host processor <b>104</b> (i.e., digital signals processor or DSP), touch screen controller <b>106</b>, a driver <b>108</b> (which can be an amplifier), and an actuator <b>110</b> (which can be a linear actuator, a piezoelectric transducer, a motor, and so forth). Generally, an user can interact with the system <b>100</b> through the touch screen <b>102</b> (which is controlled by the touch screen controller <b>106</b> and host processor <b>104</b>). Based on the user's interaction with the system <b>100</b>, haptic effects can be generated. Generally, the touch screen controller <b>106</b> provides a sine wave to the actuator <b>110</b> (either directly or through driver <b>108</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the touch screen controller <b>106</b> (which is typically an integrated circuit or IC) can be seen in greater detail. The touch screen controller <b>106</b> generally comprises a touch screen interface <b>202</b> (which can, for example, be an interface for a 4-wire resistive touch screen), an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) <b>204</b> (which can be a successive approximation register (SAR) ADC), a pre-processor <b>206</b>, a host interface <b>208</b> (i.e., inter-integrated circuit or I<sup>2</sup>C interface), clock <b>210</b>, and a haptics driver <b>212</b>. Generally, the touch screen interface <b>202</b> receives data from a touch screen <b>102</b> and is converted by ADC <b>204</b> to a digital signal (which generally corresponds to a screen location). This digital signal is then processed by the pre-processor <b>206</b> and provided to the host processor <b>104</b> through the host interface <b>208</b>. The haptics driver <b>212</b> also communicates with the host processor <b>212</b> through the interface <b>208</b>, where it can receive a haptics effect instruction (which can generally correspond to a desired haptic effect). The haptics driver <b>206</b> is then able generate a sine wave (that corresponds to the desired haptic effect) for the driver <b>108</b> and/or the actuator <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The haptics driver <b>212</b> (as can be seen in greater detain in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and which can have about 8000 gates) can generate nearly any complex sine wave form using a small instruction set. The haptics driver <b>212</b> generally comprises a controller <b>302</b>, an instruction sequencer <b>304</b>, a sine wave synthesizer <b>306</b> (which generally comprises a sine angle calculator <b>310</b>, lookup table or LUT <b>312</b> and amplitude multiplier <b>314</b>), and an amplifier <b>310</b> (which is generally a class-D amplifier that is comprised of a pulse width modulator or PWM <b>316</b> and output circuit <b>318</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The instruction sequencer <b>306</b> is generally a state machine that (in conjunction with the controller <b>302</b>) decodes the haptics effect instruction from host processor <b>104</b> and calls a haptic profile from this decoded haptics effect instruction. Generally, the instruction sequencer <b>302</b> stores the instruction set for the haptics driver <b>212</b>, and this instruction set is generally comprised of four instructions: profile, move, wait/halt, and branch. These four instructions can be used to generate nearly ever haptics effect and function as the opcode for instruction words (which, in combination, can comprise haptic profile). The profile word <b>400</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is typically an 8-bit word and generally corresponds to sinusoidal portion of an output sine wave from the haptics controller <b>206</b>. It can include the opcode designation &#x201c;11&#x201d; (see reference numeral <b>402</b>) that corresponds to the profile instruction, and the profile word <b>400</b> also can includes as its data an amplitude and frequency field <b>404</b> (which is typically a 2-bit field) and profile duration field <b>406</b> (which is typically a 4-bit field and generally corresponds to a number of periods). The move word <b>500</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is typically a 16-bit word and generally corresponds to movement across the touch screen <b>102</b>, where the opcode designation can be &#x201c;10&#x201d; (see reference numeral <b>502</b>) and where the data generally comprises a reserved field <b>504</b> (which is typically 1-bit field), a register number field <b>506</b> (which is typically a 5-bit field), and register values field <b>508</b> (which is typically an 8-bit byte field). The wait/halt word <b>600</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is typically an 8-bit word that can indicate a wait duration or halt execution <b>604</b>. The opcode designation can be &#x201c;00&#x201d; (see reference numeral <b>602</b>), and the data can include a break/no break field <b>604</b> (which is typically a 1-bit field and which can be used for motor deceleration) and a wait duration or halt field <b>606</b> (which is typically a 5-bit field). The branch word <b>700</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) if typically an 8-bit word and is generally a looping instruction that allows different instructions to be strung together. It can have an opcode designation of &#x201c;11&#x201d; (see reference numeral <b>602</b>) and can include a reserved field <b>704</b> (which is typically 1-bit field), a register number field <b>706</b> (which is typically a 1-bit field), and a jump location field <b>708</b> (which is typically a 4-bit field) as its data.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Based on the haptic profile, the sine wave generator <b>306</b> can then generate a sine wave for amplifier <b>308</b>. Typically, the sine wave generator <b>306</b> has two modes of operation: frequency synthesizer mode and fixed pulse width generator (FPWG) mode. In the frequency synthesizer mode, the sine angle calculator <b>310</b>, LUT <b>312</b>, and amplitude multiplier <b>314</b> collectively calculate the duty cycle for the next pulse for PWM <b>316</b>. In the FPWG mode, the sine angle calculator <b>310</b> and amplitude multiplier <b>314</b> are bypassed, allowing the selection of one of (for example) eight fixed pulse width modulated frequencies that produce a sine wave in a frequency range (i.e., between about 10 Hz and about 20 kHz).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the instruction sequencer <b>304</b> can be seen in greater detail, and it is generally comprised of program counter <b>804</b>, instruction memory <b>812</b>, instruction register <b>814</b>, and multiplexer or muxes <b>802</b>, <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, and <b>810</b>. Generally, the instruction register <b>814</b> (which is generally a bank of registers) holds the parameters and control signals used for haptic operation, and the instruction memory <b>812</b> is generally comprised of two pages. Each of the instruction memory <b>812</b> and instruction register <b>814</b> are also generally implemented using latches. The first page of the instruction memory <b>812</b> generally includes built-in haptic profiles (or built-in control word sets), and the second page of the instruction memory <b>812</b> can be comprised of user-defined haptic profiles. Each of the control word sets employ the combinations of the words <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, and <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Looking first to creation of user-defined haptic profile, these haptic profiles can be stored in the instruction memory <b>812</b> (namely, the second page) through the host interface <b>208</b>. When writing, the write signal WR is asserted through the host interface <b>208</b>. This allows a user-defined haptics profile to be loaded and stored in the instruction memory <b>812</b> (as the data signal IMDATA).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Initially, in normal operation, the controller <b>302</b> asserts the program counter write signal INITPCWR and the program counter load signal PCLOAD so that an starting address STARTADDR can be loaded to the program counter <b>804</b> through multiplexer <b>802</b>. The stage address STARTADDR is output (as a program counter signal PC) to multiplexers <b>806</b> and <b>810</b>. With multiplexer <b>810</b>, an address ADDR is provided to the instruction memory <b>812</b>. Based on the page selected by the controller <b>302</b> through the page signal PAGE, the appropriate word (for the desired haptics profile) is read, and once the controller <b>302</b> asserts the load signal IMILD, the instruction register <b>814</b> can load the current word CURRENTINSTR (typically eight bits or sixteen bits). Additionally, the program counter signal PC is provided to multiplexer <b>806</b> to generate the next address PCADDR. Depending on whether there is a branch word (i.e., <b>700</b>) used, the controller <b>302</b> can select whether a portion of the current instruction CURSTR (typically 4 bits) or a predetermined value can be used. Generally, the current instruction CURRENTINSTR and the next word or instruction NEXTINSTR are used by the controller <b>302</b>. Additionally, the controller <b>302</b> can provide period numbers PERNO and wait signal WAIT to implement wait words (i.e., <b>600</b>), and the words stored in the instruction memory <b>812</b> can be read out through the host interface <b>208</b> (as the memory read MEMRD signal).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref>, examples of haptics profiles can be seen. The profile in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> generally corresponds to a sine wave for a &#x201c;key touch,&#x201d; and this haptics profile is generally comprised of four words (profile, wait/halt, profile, and wait/halt) shown in Table 1 below.</p>
