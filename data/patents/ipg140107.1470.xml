<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for sterilizing seed beds in soil by injecting hot pressurized water under the soil surface between a pair of spaced-apart side walls displaceable in the soil to form a seed bed rid of weeds between the side walls.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It has long been known that by injecting hot pressurized water or steam within a soil that unwanted seeds or weeds can be destroyed whereby to create planting beds. For example it is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,272,190 issued on Feb. 10, 1942 that soil can be sterilized by injecting super heated steam into the soil as a means of killing or destroying weed seeds, insect eggs, larva and pests. In that patent a ground furrowing implement is used which is pulled by tractor and steam is injected in the soil which is loosened by plough discs. The steam generating unit utilizes a very large boiler which has a fire box to generate super heated steam which is directed by pipes for discharge into the loosened soil behind the plough discs. Because this assembly causes the soil to be disturbed in a random fashion by pipes while steam is injected therein it has been found to be insufficient to provide clean seeding beds void of weeds or unwanted growth for future plantings.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 5,622,123 also relates to a process and apparatus for killing soil pathogens and it also utilizes stirrer tools which penetrate into the ground surface for mixing the soil and injecting hot water and wherein a foam is applied over the disturbed soil to provide an insulation whereby the heat from the hot water is being retained within the soil to disturb weeds. Again, this system disturbs the soil and uses foam to prevent rapid dissipation of the heat injected into the soil in an attempt to control the pathogenic organisms in the soil and particularly weed seeds. This apparatus uses a soil tilling feature which does not provide for the creation of clean seeding beds devoid of weeds.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is a feature of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for sterilizing soil and which substantially overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another feature of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for sterilizing soil and which apparatus comprises a hot water injection chamber defined by a pair of spaced-apart adjustable side walls having jet holes facing inwardly into a passage defined between the spaced-apart side walls to inject pressurized hot water under the top surface of a soil to form a seed bed by displacing the hot water injecting chamber over the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A further feature of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for sterilizing soil comprising at least two or more hot water injecting chambers adjustably supported in spaced-apart horizontal and vertical planes under a carriage displaceable over the soil to form thereunder, as it is displaced, two or more sterilized seeding beds.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a further feature of the present invention there is provided a method of sterilizing soil to destroy unwanted growth in a planting bed being formed in the soil by displacing at least one hot water injecting chamber having spaced-apart side walls and penetrated into the soil at a lower end thereof and having jet holes in the inner face of each of the spaced-apart side walls of each injecting chamber to inject hot water into the soil to destroy unwanted growth.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the above features, from a broad aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for sterilizing soil. The apparatus comprises at least one hot water injecting chamber defined by a pair of spaced-apart side walls secured to one another in defining therebetween an open-ended passage. A plurality of jet holes are provided in an inner surface of each of the side walls and facing in the direction of the passage. The jet holes communicate with a manifold connectable to a supply of pressurized hot water. Each of the side walls are configured to penetrate into the soil in at least in a lower region thereof whereby to inject into the soil in the passage between the pairs of plates the pressurized hot water as the hot water injecting chamber is displaced in the top surface of the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the above features, from a broad aspect, the present invention also provides a method of sterilizing soil to destroy unwanted growth in a planting bed being formed in the soil. The method comprises providing an apparatus as defined in the previous paragraph. Water is heated in a hot water generator to a temperature in the range of about 150&#xb0; F. to 200&#xb0; F. The apparatus is displaced in the top surface of the soil to create the planting bed with the hot water injecting chamber penetrating into the soil while injecting under pressure the hot water into the planting bed from opposed sides thereof to destroy weeds, seeds or roots of unwanted growth in the bed being formed.</p>

A handle <b>50</b> facilitates adjustment of the pivotal arm <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, the jet holes <b>14</b> are grouped to be disposed below the top surface <b>31</b>&#x2032; on the soil <b>31</b> when the water injecting chamber is in the engaged position whereby to saturate the soil with the pressurized hot water <b>32</b> injected by the jet holes <b>14</b>. The displaceable support linkage <b>40</b> is interlocked by suitable means when the water injecting chambers are in the engaged position. Also, the spacing between the support arms <b>35</b> is adjustable on its support rod <b>37</b> to adjust the spacing between the seeding beds <b>43</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) being formed by the water injecting chambers as they are pulled in the soil surface.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the opposed side walls <b>11</b> and <b>11</b>&#x2032; are penetrated in the soil surface <b>31</b> a distance of approximately 3 inches which is sufficient to locate the jet holes <b>14</b> below the soil surface <b>31</b> whereby to inject the hot water, which is at a temperature between 150&#xb0; F. and 200&#xb0; F. below the soil surface. These jet holes <b>14</b> face toward one another into the passage <b>13</b> to completely saturate the soil between the side walls <b>11</b> and <b>11</b>&#x2032;. It has been found that with the carriage <b>30</b> being displaced at a rate of about 4 gallons of hot water per 25 feet of bed with the side walls spaced-apart approximately 4 inches that the soil will remain saturated with the hot water for a period of approximately ten minutes which is satisfactory to destroy seeds of unwanted plants or plant roots, the hot water is also dispensed at a pressure sufficient to saturate the soil between the side walls and in the range of about 50 psi to 1000 psi depending on the spacing of the side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Having described the above soil sterilizing apparatus for sterilizing soil to destroy unwanted growth in a planting bed being formed in the soil, the method provides the step of heating water in a hot water generator to a temperature on the range of about 150&#xb0; F. to 200&#xb0; F. The apparatus of the present invention is displaced above a top surface of the soil to create planting or seeding beds <b>43</b> with the plates <b>11</b> and <b>11</b>&#x2032; penetrating into the soil while injecting under pressure hot water into the planting bed from opposed sides thereof to destroy weeds, seeds or roots of unwanted growth in the bed being formed. The method also comprises the step of adjusting the distance between the pair of spaced-apart side walls to define the width of the planting bed. The method also permits the adjustment of the distance between the water injecting chambers <b>10</b> and therefore the distance between the seeding beds <b>43</b> being formed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">All obvious modifications of the present invention are intended to be covered provided they are interpretable within the wording and broad interpretation of the claims.</p>
