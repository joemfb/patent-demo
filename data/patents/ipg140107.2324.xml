<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an antireflective film, and further to a polarizing plate and an image display device each using the film.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An antireflective film is disposed on a display surface for prevention of contrast reductions due to extraneous light reflected off and images mirrored in the screen of every variety of image display device, such as a liquid crystal display device (LCD), a plasma display panel (PDP), an electroluminescent display (ELD) or a cathode ray tube display device (CRT). Therefore, the antireflective film is required to have high physical strength (including abrasion resistance), high transparency, high chemical resistance and high weather resistance (including heat-and-moisture resistance and light stability). In addition, antistatic properties are required of the antireflective film in order to prevent dust (dirt or the like), which depresses display's visibility, from adhering to the antireflective film surface.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The antireflective film containing a conductive metal oxide is known (See JP-A-2005-196122). In the case of using a metal oxide as conductive material, the metal oxide density in a conductive layer must be increased in order for the conductive layer to having the required conductivity. However, there are cases where addition of metal oxide in excessive amounts adversely affects the transparency, hardness and durability.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, the antireflective film using a conductive polymer as conductive material is known (See JP-A-2005-96397). Such a film is formed from the conductive polymer produced by vapor-phase polymerization of its monomer(s), and it is desired that the film undergo further improvements in productivity and durability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of an illustrative, non-limiting embodiment of the invention is to provide an antireflective film that has excellent antistatic properties aimed at preventing adhesion of dust (dirt or the like), high adhesion and high physical strength including abrasion resistance and ensures excellent productivity.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an aspect of the invention, it is possible to produce an antireflective film which has excellent antistatic properties, high adhesion and high abrasion resistance and ensures high productivity. Display devices (image display devices) provided with the present antireflective films or the present polarizing plates are reduced in extraneous light reflected off and background's reflection mirrored in their respective screens, so very high visibility forms a feature of them.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An antireflective film according to an aspect of the invention is illustrated below.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">&#x3c;Layer Structure of Antireflective Film&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An antireflective film according to an aspect of the invention has on a transparent substrate (which is also referred to as a transparent support, a base film or a support) at least one conductive layer and at least one low refractive index layer, and can further have other functional layers singly or in the form of multiple layers in accordance with the intended use thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">One among preferred embodiments of the present antireflective film is a multilayer antireflective film formed by providing constituent layers on a substrate so as to achieve reflectivity reduction by optical interference in consideration of their refractive indexes, layer thicknesses, number and arranging order. The most simple structure of an antireflective film is a structure that only a low refractive index layer is applied to a substrate. For further reduction in reflectivity, it is favorable to configure an antireflective layer as a combination of a high refractive index layer having a higher refractive index than a substrate and a low refractive index layer having a lower refractive index than a substrate. Examples of a layer structure of the antireflective layer include a double-layer structure that a substrate is coated with a high refractive index layer and a low refractive index layer in order of mention and a triple-layer structure that a substrate is coated with three layers different in refractive index, namely a middle refractive index layer (which has a refractive index higher than the substrate or a hard coating layer and lower than a high refractive index layer), a high refractive index layer and a low refractive index layer which are stacked on top of each other in order of mention. In addition, there are many proposals of an antireflective film having a stack of more antireflective layers. Of those proposals, a structure that a middle refractive index layer, a high refractive index layer and a low refractive index layer are applied in order of mention to a hard coating layer provided on a substrate is preferred from the viewpoints of durability, optical properties, cost and productivity. Examples of such a structure include those disclosed in JP-A-8-122504, JP-A-8-110401, JP-A-10-300902, JP-A-2002-243906 and JP-A-2000-111706.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Moreover, another function may be imparted to each constituent layer. For instance, soil-resistant properties may be imparted to a low refractive index layer, while anti-static properties may be imparted to a high refractive index layer (as disclosed, e.g., in JP-A-10-206603 and JP-A-2002-243906).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Examples of a layer structure preferred by the present antireflective film are shown below. In each of the following structures, the term &#x201c;base film&#x201d; refers to the support formed of a film.

<p id="p-0028" num="0039">These layers can be formed according to an evaporation method, an atmospheric pressure plasma method, a coating method or so on. In point of productivity, formation by a coating method is advantageous.</p>

Of these two materials, the complex of a &#x3c0;-conjugated conductive polymer and a dopant attendant thereto is especially preferable to the other.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">1-(1) &#x3c0;-Conjugated Conductive Polymer</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0044">As the &#x3c0;-conjugated conductive polymer, any of organic polymers having &#x3c0;-conjugated systems as their respective main chains can be used.

In point of easiness of polymerization and stability in the air, polypyrrole, polythiophene and polyaniline are preferred over the others.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0045">Although such &#x3c0;-conjugated conductive polymers can have sufficient conductivity and compatibility with binder resins without having any substituents, introduction of functional groups, such as alkyl, carboxyl, sulfo, alkoxy, hydroxyl or cyano groups, into those &#x3c0;-conjugated conductive polymers is favorable for further increasing dispersibility or solubility in a binder resin as well as conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0046">As to such a &#x3c0;-conjugated conductive polymers, examples of such a substituted polypyrrole include poly(3-methylpyrrole), poly(3-ethylpyrrole), poly(3-n-propylpyrrole), poly(3-butylpyrrole), poly(3-octylpyrrole), poly(3-decylpyrrole), poly(3-docecylpyrrole), poly(3,4-dimethylpyrrole), poly(3,4-dibutylpyrrole), poly(3-carboxypyrrole), poly(3-methyl-4-carboxypyrrole), poly(3-methyl-4-carboxyethylpyrrole), poly(3-methyl-4-carboxybutylpyrrole), poly(3-hydroxypyrrole), poly(3-methoxypyrrole), poly(3-ethoxypyrrole), poly(3-butoxypyrrole), poly(3-hexyloxypyrrole) and poly(3-methyl-4-hexyloxypyrrole).</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0049">Of those polymers, a homopolymer selected from polypyrrole, polythiophene, poly(N-methylpyrrole), poly(3-methylthiophene), poly(3-methoxythiophene) or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), or a copolymer of any two of constituent monomers of the polymers recited above is preferably used in point of resistance and reactivity. Furthermore, polypyrrole and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) have an advantage over the others in that they have higher conductivity and yield an improvement in heat resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0050">In addition, the polymers substituted by alkyl groups, such as poly(N-methylpyrrole) and poly(3-methylthiophene), are also advantageous because they obtain improvements in solvent solubility and compatibility with and dispersibility in a binder resin. Of the alkyl groups, a methyl group is preferred over the others because it has no negative effect on the conductivity.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0053">The dopant including a polyanionic polymer is hereinafter referred to as a polyanionic dopant. The complex formation is effected via salt formation by chemically oxidative doping of a conductive polymer with such a polyanionic dopant.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0054">The anionic groups of a polyanionic dopant are preferably functional groups which enable chemically oxidative doping of a conductive polymer with the dopant, and besides, proton acids of which can unite with any of vinyl, glycidyl and hydroxyl groups.

<p id="p-0059" num="0070">During the complex formation, as the main chain of a conductive polymer grows, so are salts formed between anionic groups of a polyanionic dopant and the conductive polymer. Accordingly, the main chain of the conductive polymer grows along the polyanionic dopant and countless salts are formed between the resultant conductive polymer and the polyanionic dopant, thereby producing a complex. In this complex, it is presumed that every three monomeric units of the conductive polymer and every one anionic-group unit form a salt and several pieces of short-grown polymer form salts along the polyanionic dopant with a long length.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0125">Alternatively, it is advantageous to use a fluorine-containing compound as a catalyst.

More specifically, it is thought that the &#x3b2;-diketone or &#x3b2;-ketoester compound added and the metal atom(s) in the metal-chelate compound(s) (at least any of the zirconium, titanium and aluminum compounds) are coordinated, and thereby the function of the metal-chelate compounds, namely promotion of the condensation reaction of hydrolysate and partial condensate of the compounds represented by formulae (1) and (2), is inhibited, and the storage stability of the resultant composition is enhanced. R<sup>6 </sup>and R<sup>7 </sup>constituting each of the &#x3b2;-diketone and &#x3b2;-ketoester compounds have the same meanings as those constituting the metal-chelate compound as recited above, respectively.</p>

In the invention, it is appropriate that the &#x3b2;-diketone or &#x3b2;-ketoester compound be used in an amount of 2 moles or above, preferably 3 to 20 moles, per mole of the metal-chelate compound(s).

<p id="p-0129" num="0140">From the viewpoint of improvement of adhesion properties of an antireflective film, it is preferred that at least one hard coating layer or antiglare layer as described below is provided between the transparent substrate and the conductive layer. The adhesion properties between the transparent substrate and the conductive layer can be improved to a certain level by including the cross-linking site-forming compound in the conductive layer-forming composition including the polymeric material, and can be further improved by using a cross-linkable or polymerizable compound in the hard coating layer or antiglare layer.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">2. Hard Coating Layer</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0141">It is possible to provide the present antireflective film with a hard coating layer, preferably on one side of the transparent substrate, for the purpose of imparting physical strength to the film. The hard coating layer may have a multilayer structure including two or more layers.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0142">From the viewpoint of an optical design for an antireflective film, it is appropriate that the refractive index of the hard coating layer provided in the invention be in a range of 1.48 to 2.00, preferably 1.52 to 1.90, far preferably 1.55 to 1.80. In a preferred embodiment of the invention where at least one low refractive index layer is provided on the hard coating layer, refractive indexes too lower than the range as specified above become a cause of degradation in antireflective property, while too high refractive indexes contribute to a tendency to intensify the tint of reflected light.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0143">From the viewpoint of imparting sufficient durability and impact resistance to the film, the thickness of the hard coating layer is adjusted generally to the order of 0.5 to 50 &#x3bc;m, preferably 1 to 20 &#x3bc;m, far preferably 2 to 10 &#x3bc;m, especially preferably 3 to 7 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0144">In addition, the strength of the hard coating layer is preferably H or higher, far preferably 2H or higher, especially preferably 3H or higher, as determined by pencil hardness testing.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0145">Furthermore, the slighter the abrasion a sample piece of hard coating layer suffers in the Taber test according to JIS K5400, the higher suitability the hard coating layer has.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0146">The hard coating layer is preferably formed by cross-linking reaction or polymerization reaction of an ionizing radiation curable compound. More specifically, the hard coating layer can be formed by applying a coating composition containing an ionizing radiation curable multifunctional monomer or oligomer to the transparent substrate directly or via another layer, and then by subjecting the multifunctional monomer or oligomer to cross-linking reaction or polymerization reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0147">The functional groups of the ionizing radiation curable multifunctional monomer or oligomer are preferably photo-, electron beam- or radiation-polymerizable functional groups. Of these groups, photopolymerizable functional groups are preferred over the others.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0148">Examples of a photopolymerizable functional group include polymerizable unsaturated functional groups, such as a (meth)acryloyl group, a vinyl group, a styryl group and an allyl group. Of these groups, a (meth)acryloyl group is preferred over the others.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0149">Instead of or in addition to the polymerizable unsaturated group as recited above, cross-linkable functional groups may be introduced into the binder. Examples of a cross-linkable functional group include an isocyanate group, an epoxy group, an aziridine group, an oxazoline group, an aldehyde group, a carbonyl group, a hydrazine group, a carboxyl group, a methylol group and an active methylene group. Additionally, vinylsulfonic acid, an acid anhydride, a cyanoacrylate derivative, melamine, etherified methylol, ester, urethane and a metal alkoxide such as tetramethoxysilane can also be utilized as a monomer capable of forming a cross-linked structure. Moreover, functional groups that can deliver cross-linking properties as a result of decomposition reaction, such as blocked isocyanate groups, may be used. In other words, cross-linkable groups adopted in the invention may be groups whose reactivity, though not shown immediately, is shown as a result of decomposition. The binder having such cross-linkable functional groups can form a cross-linked structure by heating after application.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0151">To the binder of the hard coating layer, a high refractive index monomer, inorganic particles or both can be added for the purpose of controlling the refractive index of the hard coating layer. Inorganic particles have not only a refractive index control effect but also an effect of inhibiting curing shrinkage from occurring by cross-linking reaction. In the invention, the polymer produced by polymerizing any of the multifunctional monomers recited above, any of the high refractive index monomers recited above or both after formation of the hard coating layer, inclusive of inorganic particles dispersed therein, is referred to as the binder.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0152">The hard coating layer is adjusted in haze to suit the function intended to be imparted to the antireflective film.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0153">In the case of keeping the image sharpness, reducing the surface reflectance, and imparting a light scattering function to neither the interior nor the surface of the hard coating layer, the lower haze value the better. Specifically, the haze value is preferably 10% or below, far preferably 5% or below, especially preferably 2% or below.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0154">On the other hand, in the case of imparting an antiglare function by surface scattering of the hard coating layer, the surface haze is preferably from 5% to 15%, far preferably from 5% to 10%.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0156">The present film can be adjusted to have any values of surface haze and internal haze according to the intended purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0157">As to the surface roughness profile of the hard coating layer, it is appropriate for obtaining a clear surface with the intention of keeping image sharpness that the center-line-average surface roughness (Ra) among the surface roughness characteristics be adjusted to 0.10 &#x3bc;m or below. The Ra value is preferably 0.08 &#x3bc;m or below, far preferably 0.06 &#x3bc;m or below. In the present film, the surface roughness of the film is dominated by the surface roughness of the hard coating layer, so the center-line-average roughness of the antireflective film can be adjusted to the foregoing range by controlling the center-line-average surface roughness of the hard coating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0158">In addition to control of the surface roughness profile with the intention of keeping image sharpness, it is preferable to control transmitted image definition. The definition of images transmitted by the clear antireflective film is preferably 60% or above. The transmitted image definition is generally an index to the blur degree of images projected through film, and the greater value thereof means that images viewed through film are the higher in clarity and the better in quality. To be concrete, the transmitted image definition is preferably 70% or above, far preferably 80% or above.</p>

<p id="h-0014" num="0000">3. Antiglare Layer</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0167">An antiglare layer is provided for the purpose of contributing an antiglare property through surface scattering, preferably further contributing a hard coating property for enhancement of abrasion resistance, to the film.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0168">As methods of contributing an antiglare property to the film, there are known the method as disclosed in JP-A-6-16851 wherein an antiglare layer is formed by lamination of an embossed matte film having microscopic asperities on its surface, the method as disclosed in JP-A-2000-206317 wherein surface roughness is formed through curing shrinkage difference caused in an ionizing radiation curable resin by difference in amount of exposure to ionizing radiation, the method as disclosed in JP-A-2000-338310 wherein transmissive fine particles and transmissive resin are gelled and solidified through a decrease in a mass ratio of a good solvent to the transmissive resin by drying to result in formation of asperities on the coating surface, the method as disclosed in JP-A-2000-275404 wherein surface roughness is imparted by externally applied pressure, the method as disclosed in JP-A-2005-195819 wherein asperities are formed on the coating surface by utilizing phase separation in the process of evaporating a solvent from a solution of two or more polymers, and so on. And these known methods can be used in the invention, too.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">&#x3c;Transmissive Particles&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0169">A preferred aspect applicable to an antiglare layer for use in the invention consists in that the antiglare layer contains a binder capable of imparting hard coating properties, transmissive particles for imparting an antiglare property and a solvent as essential ingredients and surface roughness is formed with asperities of individual transmissive particles themselves or aggregates in which those particles gather. It is preferable that the antiglare layer having an antiglare property offers a compromise between the antiglare property and a hard coating property.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0170">Examples of transmissive particles used suitably in the antiglare layer include particles of inorganic compounds, such as silica particles and TiO<sub>2 </sub>particles, and resin particles, such as acrylic resin particles, cross-linked acrylic resin particles, polystyrene particles, cross-linked styrene resin particles, melamine resin particles and benzoguanamine resin particles. Of these particles, cross-linked styrene resin particles, cross-linked acrylic resin particles and silica particles are preferred over the others. The matting particles used may be either spherical or indefinite in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0171">In addition, matting particles of two or more types different in size may be used together. It is possible to impart antiglare property by use of matting particles having greater sizes and another optical property by use of matting particles having smaller sizes. For instance, when an antiglare antireflective film is stuck on a high-definition display having a pixel count of 133 ppi or above, a problem in point of display image quality, which is referred to as &#x201c;glitter&#x201d;, occurs in some cases. The glitter is brought about by loss of uniformity in brightness, which results from expansion or reduction of picture elements by microscopic asperities present on the antiglare antireflective film surface, so it can be greatly improved by using matting particles which are smaller in size than matting particles used for imparting antiglare property and different in refractive index from the binder.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0172">The matting particles are incorporated into an antiglare layer so that their content in an antiglare hard-coating layer formed ranges from 10 to 1,000 mg, preferably from 100 to 700 mg, per square meter.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0173">The thickness of the antiglare layer is preferably from 1 to 20 &#x3bc;m, far preferably from 2 to 10 &#x3bc;m. The thickness adjustment to such a range can serve a function as a hard coating, and also allows protection against curling and brittleness.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0174">On the other hand, it is appropriate that the center-line-average roughness (Ra) of the antiglare layer be adjusted to 0.10 &#x3bc;m or below, preferably 0.08 &#x3bc;m or below, far preferably 0.06 &#x3bc;m or below.</p>

<p id="h-0016" num="0000">4. Low Refractive Index Layer</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0176">For reduction in reflectance of the present film, it is appropriate that a low refractive index layer be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0177">The refractive index of the low refractive index layer is preferably from 1.20 to 1.46, far preferably from 1.25 to 1.46, particularly preferably from 1.30 to 1.46.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0178">The thickness of the low refractive index layer is preferably from 50 to 200 nm, far preferably from 70 to 100 nm. The haze of the low refractive index layer is preferably 3% or below, far preferably 2% or below, especially preferably 1% or below. The concrete strength of the low refractive index layer, as evaluated by the pencil hardness test under a load of 500 g, is preferably at least H, far preferably at least 2H, especially preferably at least 3H.</p>

<p id="p-0169" num="0180">Examples of an aspect of the curable composition suitable for forming the low refractive index layer include (1) a composition including a fluorine-containing polymer having cross-linkable or polymerizable functional groups, (2) a composition containing as a main component the hydrolytic condensation product of a fluorine-containing organosilane material, and (3) a composition containing a monomer having two or more ethylenically unsaturated groups and inorganic fine particles of hollow structure.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">4-(1) Fluorine-Containing Polymer Having Cross-Linkable or Polymerizable Functional Groups</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0181">As an example of a fluorine-containing polymer having cross-linkable or polymerizable functional groups, mention may be made of a copolymer of a fluorine-containing monomer and a monomer having a cross-linkable or polymerizable functional group. Examples of the fluorine-containing monomer include fluoroolefin (such as fluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and perfluoro-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxol), partially or completely fluorinated alkyl ester derivatives of (meth)acrylic acid (such as Biscoat 6FM, a product of Osaka Organic Chemical Industry Ltd., and M-2020, a product of Daikin Industries, Ltd.) and completely or partially fluorinated vinyl ethers.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0182">One aspect of the monomer used for imparting a cross-linking group is a (meth)acrylate monomer having in advance a cross-linkable functional group in its molecule, such as glycidyl methacrylate. Another aspect of the monomer used for the foregoing purpose is a monomer having a functional group, such as hydroxyl group, which is modified into a cross-linkable or polymerizable group through substitution after copolymerization with a fluorine-containing monomer. Examples of such a monomer include (meth)acrylate monomers each having a carboxyl group, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a sulfonic acid group or the like (such as (meth)acrylic acid, methylol(meth)acrylate, hydroxyalkyl(meth)acrylate and allyl acrylate). The latter aspect is disclosed in JP-A-10-25388 and JP-A-10-147739.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0183">In terms of solubility, dispersibility, coating characteristics, soil resistance and antistatic properties, the fluorine-containing copolymers can contain copolymerizable components as appropriate. For the purpose of giving soil resistance and a slippery property in particular to the copolymers, it is favorable to introduce silicone into either the main chain, side chains or both.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0184">As an example of a method of introducing a partial structure of polysiloxane into the main chain, mention may be made of the method as disclosed in JP-A-6-93100 which uses a polymeric initiator, such as an azo group-containing polysiloxaneamide (commercially available products of which include VPS-0501 and VPS-1001, trade names, products of Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). On the other hand, the introduction into side chains can be performed, e.g., by using the method of introducing polysiloxane having a reactive group as its one end group (e.g., Silaplain series, produced by Chisso Corporation) by polymer reaction as described in <i>J. Appl. Polym. Sci., </i>2000, 78, 1955, and JP-A-56-28219, or by synthesis according to the method of polymerizing a polysiloxane-containing silicone macromer. Both of these methods can be favorably used.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0185">Those polymers may be used in combination with curing agents having polymerizable unsaturated groups, if needed, as disclosed in JP-A-2000-17028. In addition, as disclosed in JP-A-2002-145952, it is preferable that those polymers are used in combination with fluorine-containing multifunctional compounds having polymerizable unsaturated groups. Examples of a polymerizable unsaturated group-containing multifunctional compound include the monomers having two or more ethylenically unsaturated groups per molecule. Moreover, the hydrolytic condensates of organosilanes as disclosed in JP-A-2004-170901, notably the hydrolytic condensates of (meth)acryloyl group-containing organosilanes, can be used to advantage.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0186">It is advantageous for these compounds to be used in combination with the polymers, notably the polymers having polymerizable unsaturated groups in their main units, because such combinations can produce a significant effect on enhancement of abrasion resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0187">When the curability of polymers themselves is not sufficient, the required level of curability can be imparted to the polymers by compounding the polymers and cross-likable compounds. When the polymers have, e.g., hydroxyl groups in their main units, it is preferable that a variety of amino compounds are used as curing agents. The amino compound usable as a cross-linkable compound is a compound having at least two amino groups chosen from, e.g., hydroxyalkylamino groups, alkoxyalkylamino groups, or both, with examples including melamine compounds, urea compounds, benzoguanamine compounds and glycoluril compounds. In the curing of these compounds, it is preferable that organic acids or salts thereof are used.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0188">Examples of those fluorine-containing polymers include those disclosed in JP-A-2003-222702 and JP-A-2003-183322.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">4-(2) Hydrolytic Condensate of Fluorine-Containing Organosilane Material</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0189">A composition containing hydrolytic condensate of a fluorine-containing organosilane compound as the main component is also preferable, because it also has a low refractive index and can ensure highly hard coating surface. As the hydrolytic condensate, the condensate of a fluorinated alkane having a hydrolyzable silanol group on one end or either end thereof and a tetraalkoxysilane compound is suitable. Examples of such a composition include the compositions disclosed in JP-A-2002-265866 and JP-A-2002-317152.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">4-(3) Composition Containing Monomer Having Two or More Ethylenically Unsaturated Groups and Inorganic Fine Particles of Hollow Structure</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0190">Still another aspect of the low refractive index layer preferred in the invention is a layer including a binder and particles of a low refractive index. The particles of a low refractive index, though may be either inorganic or organic particles, are preferably particles having holes on the inside. Examples of hollow particles include the silica particles disclosed in JP-A-2002-79616. The refractive index of those particles is preferably from 1.15 to 1.40, far preferably from 1.20 to 1.30. Examples of the binder include the monomers having two or more ethylenically unsaturated groups per molecule as described in the earlier section on the hard coating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0191">To the low refractive index layer for use in the invention, it is advantageous to add any of the polymerization initiators as described in the earlier section on the hard coating layer. When the composition for forming the low refractive index layer contains a radical polymerizable compound, the polymerization initiator can be used in an amount of 1 to 10 parts by mass, preferably 1 to 5 parts by mass, for the compound.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0192">In the low refractive index layer for use in the invention, inorganic particles can be incorporated. For imparting abrasion resistance, it is advantageous to use fine particles having sizes ranging from 15% to 150%, preferably from 30% to 100%, far preferably from 45% to 60%, of the thickness of the low refractive index layer.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0193">For the purpose of imparting properties including soil resistance, water resistance, chemical resistance and a slippery property, known polysiloxane- or fluorine-containing antifouling agents and slipping agents can be added to the low refractive index layer as appropriate.</p>

<p id="p-0204" num="0215">It is preferable that the cellulose acylate used in the invention has a Mw/Mn value close to 1.0 (where Mw is mass-average molecular weight, and Mn is number-average molecular weight), which can be determined by gel permeation chromatography. In other words, the cellulose acylate preferably has a narrow molecular-weight distribution. Specifically, the suitable Mw/Mn value is from 1.0 to 1.7, preferably from 1.3 to 1.65, especially preferably from 1.4 to 1.6.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0216">In general the total substitution degree is not shared equally &#x2153; by &#x2153; among the hydroxyl groups in the 2-, 3- and 6-positions of cellulose acylate, but the substitution degree of 6-position hydroxyl groups tends to be smaller than those of 2- and 3-position hydroxyl groups. In the cellulose acylate used in the invention, however, the substitution degree of 6-position hydroxyl groups is preferably greater than those of 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0217">It is appropriate that the 6-position hydroxyl groups be substituted by acyl groups in a proportion of at least 32%, preferably at least 33%, particularly preferably at least 34%, of the total substitution degree. In addition, it is preferable that the substitution degree of the 6-position acyl groups in the cellulose acylate is 0.88 or above. In addition to acetyl group, the 6-position hydroxyl groups may be substituted by acyl groups containing 3 or more carbon atoms, such as propionyl, butyroyl, valeloyl, benzoyl and acryloyl groups. The substitution degree in each position can be determined by NMR measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0218">The cellulose acetates prepared by the methods disclosed in JP-A-11-5851, Examples, paragraphs [0043] to [0044] Synthesis Example 1, paragraphs [0048] to [0049] Synthesis Example 2, and paragraphs [0051] to [0052] Synthesis Example 3, can be used as cellulose acylate for use in the invention.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">&#x3c;Polyethylene Terephthalate Film&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0219">As a substrate film used in the invention, polyethylene terephthalate film is also preferred because it has excellent transparency, mechanical strength, planarity, chemical resistance and moisture resistance, what's more it is cheap.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0220">For enhancement of the adhesion strength between a transparent plastic film and the hard coating layer, the use of transparent plastic film having undergone easily-adhering treatment is preferable by far.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0221">As examples of commercially available optical PET film with an easily-adhering layer, mention may be made of COSMOSHINE A4100 and A4300, products of Toyobo Co., Ltd.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">7. Coating Method</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0222">Each constituent layer of the present film can be formed using various methods including but not limited to the following methods.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0223">Specifically, the coating methods usable herein include known methods, such as a dip coating method, an air knife coating method, a curtain coating method, a roller coating method, a wire-bar coating method, a gravure coating method, an extrusion coating method (a die coating method) (see U.S. Pat. No. 2,681,294), and a microgravure coating method. Of these methods, a microgravure coating method and a die coating method are preferred over the others.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0224">The microgravure coating method usable in the invention is a coating method characterized in that a gravure roll having a diameter of about 10 mm to about 100 mm, preferably about 20 mm to about 50 mm, and a gravure pattern engraved all around the periphery is placed underneath a substrate and brought to a state of rotation in the direction opposite to a transport direction of the substrate, and application of a coating solution is performed by transferring a coating solution fed on the gravure roll surface in an amount kept constant by scraping an excess coating solution off the gravure roll surface with a doctor blade to the under surface of the substrate in a position where the upper surface of the substrate is in a free state. A transparent substrate in a roll form is continuously wound off, and thereon at least either the hard coating layer or at least one of low refractive index layers containing fluorine-containing olefin polymers can be coated by the microgravure coating method.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0225">As to the coating conditions in the microgravure coating method, the line number of a gravure pattern engraved on the gravure roll is preferably from 50 to 800 per inch, far preferably from 100 to 300 per inch, the depth of the gravure pattern is preferably from 1 to 600 &#x3bc;m, far preferably from 5 to 200 &#x3bc;m, the revs of the gravure roll is preferably from 3 to 800 rpm, far preferably from 5 to 200 rpm, and the transport speed of a substrate is preferably from 0.5 to 100 m/min, far preferably from 1 to 50 m/min.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0226">For supplying of the present film with high productivity, the adoption of an extrusion method (a die coating method) is favorable. In the region of a small wet coverage (20 cc/m<sup>2 </sup>or below) in particular, such as in the case of a hard coating layer or an antireflective layer, the adoption of the manufacturing method disclosed in JP-A-2006-122889 allows enhancement of coating film uniformity.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">8. Polarizing Plate</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0227">The present film is used as protective film arranged on one side or either side of a polarizer and, together with the polarizer, can form a polarizing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0228">Although the present film may be used as one of the protective films and commonly used cellulose acetate film may be used as the other protective film, it is advantageous to use as the other protective film a cellulose acetate film made by the solution film-formation method and stretched at a stretch ratio of 10 to 100% in the width direction of the film in a roll form.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0229">As polarizers, there are known an iodine polarizer, a dye polarizer using a dichroic dye and a polyene polarizer. The iodine polarizer and the dye polarizer are generally formed using polyvinyl alcohol film.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0230">The slow axes of the transparent substrate of the antireflective film and the cellulose acetate film and the transmission axis of the polarizer are positioned so as to become parallel in a substantial sense.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0231">Moisture permeability of protective films is important for productivity of a polarizing plate. The polarizer and the protective films are bonded together with an aqueous adhesive, and this adhesive solvent is dried by diffusion through the protective films. The higher the moisture permeability of the protective films, the faster the drying becomes and the more the productivity is improved. However, when the moisture permeability becomes too high, permeation of moisture into the polarizers occurs depending on the use environment of a liquid crystal display (under high humidity) to result in lowering of polarization power.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0232">The determination of what moisture permeability the protective films have is based on the thicknesses, free volumes, and hydrophilic or hydrophobic degrees of the transparent substrate and the polymer film (and the polymerizable liquid crystal compound).</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0233">When the present film is used as a protective film of a polarizing plate, the moisture permeability thereof is preferably from 100 to 1,000 g/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;24 hrs, far preferably from 300 to 700 g/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;24 hrs.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0234">When the film is manufactured, the thickness of a transparent substrate can be controlled by a lip flow rate and line speed, or by stretching or compression. As the moisture permeability varies with main materials used, it can be adjusted to the desired range by thickness control.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0235">In the case of manufacturing the film, the free volume of the transparent substrate can be controlled by drying temperature and time adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0236">In this case also, the moisture permeability can be adjusted to the desired range by free volume control since it varies with main materials used.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0237">The hydrophilic or hydrophobic degree of the transparent substrate can be controlled by additives. The moisture permeability is heightened by addition of hydrophilic additives to the free volume, while addition of hydrophobic additives lowers the moisture permeability.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0238">By independent control of the moisture permeability, it becomes possible to manufacture a polarizing plate having an optically compensatory power at low cost and with high productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0239">The polarizer may be any of known polarizers, or may be a polarizer cut from a long length of polarizer whose absorption axis is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the direction of the length. The polarizer whose absorption axis is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the direction of the length is formed in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0240">Specifically, such a polarizer can be formed by stretching a continuously supplied polymer film under a tension while holding both edges thereof with holding tools. Herein, the polymer film is stretched to 1.1 to 20.0 times its original length in the direction of the width. In addition, the longitudinally traveling speed difference between the film-edge holding tools is controlled to 3% or below, and the traveling direction of the film is bend as the film edges are held with the holding tools so that the film traveling direction at the exit from the film edge holding process tilts 20 to 70 degrees toward the substantial stretch direction of the film. The 45&#xb0; tilt of the film traveling direction is especially advantageous from the viewpoint of productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0241">Detailed description of the polymer film stretching method can be found in JP-A-2002-86554, paragraphs [0020] to [0030].</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0242">Of two protective films for a polarizer, it is also preferable that the film other than the antireflective film is an optically compensatory film having optically compensatory layers including an optically anisotropic layer. The optically compensatory film (retardation film) can improve viewing angle characteristics of a liquid crystal display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0243">As to the optically compensatory film, though any of known ones can be used, the optically compensatory film disclosed in JP-A-2001-100042 is preferable in point of viewing angle increase.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">9. Usage Pattern of The Invention</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0244">The present film can be used in image display devices including a liquid crystal display device (LCD), a plasma display panel (PDP), an electroluminescent display (ELD) and a cathode-ray tube display device (CRT). Optical filters according to the invention can be used on known displays, such as plasma display panels (PDP) and cathode-ray tube display devices (CRT).</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">9-(1) Liquid Crystal Display Device</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0245">The present film and polarizing plate can be used with advantage in image display devices including a liquid crystal display device, and it is preferable that they are used as the outermost layers of displays. The crystal display device has a liquid crystal cell and two polarizing plates disposed on both side of the liquid crystal cell. The liquid crystal cell holds liquid crystal between two electrode plates. In addition, an optically anisotropic layer is arranged between the liquid crystal cell and one of the polarizing plates or, in some cases, two optically anisotropic layers are arranged between the liquid crystal cell and the two polarizing plates each.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0246">The crystal cell is preferably a TN-mode, VA-mode, OCB-mode, IPS-mode or ECB-mode crystal cell.</p>
<p id="h-0029" num="0000">&#x3c;TN Mode&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0247">In a TN-mode liquid crystal cell, rod-shaped liquid crystalline molecules are aligned in a substantially horizontal direction, and that in a state of being twisted by 60&#xb0; to 120&#xb0;, when no voltage is applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0248">TN-mode crystal cells are prevailingly utilized in color TFT liquid crystal display devices, and described in an abundant technical literature.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">&#x3c;VA Mode&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0249">In a VA-mode liquid crystal cell, rod-shaped liquid crystalline molecules align in a substantially vertical direction when no voltage is applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0250">VA-mode liquid crystal cells include not only (1) a strict sense of VA-mode liquid crystal cell in which, while rod-shaped liquid crystalline molecules align in a substantially vertical direction when no voltage is applied thereto, they are forced to align in a substantially horizontal direction by application of a voltage thereto (as disclosed in JP-A-2-176625), but also (2) a multidomain VA-mode (MVA-mode) liquid crystal cell which ensures a viewing angle increase (as described in <i>SID </i>97 Digest of Tech. Papers (preprints) 28, p. 845(1997)), (3) an n-ASM-mode liquid crystal cell in which rod-shaped liquid crystalline molecules align in a substantially vertical direction when no voltage is applied thereto, but they are brought into a twisted multidomain alignment by application of a voltage thereto (as described in preprints of Nippon Ekisho Toronkai (Symposium on Liquid Crystal), pp. 58-59 (1998)), and (4) a SURVAIVAL-mode liquid crystal cell (announced at LCD International 98).</p>
<p id="h-0031" num="0000">&#x3c;OCB Mode&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0251">The liquid crystal cell of OCB mode is a liquid crystal cell of bend alignment mode in which rod-shaped liquid crystalline molecules in the upper part and those in the lower part are forced to align (symmetrically) in substantially opposite directions, and examples thereof are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,583,825 and 5,410,422. Since the rod-shaped liquid crystal molecules are symmetrically aligned in the upper part and the lower part of a liquid crystal cell, the bend alignment mode liquid crystal cell has an optically self-compensatory function. Therefore, this liquid crystal mode is referred to as an OCB (Optically Compensatory Bend) liquid crystal mode. The liquid crystal display devices of the bend alignment mode have an advantage of high response speed.</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">&#x3c;IPS Mode&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0252">The liquid crystal cell of IPS mode adopts a mode of switching by application of a lateral electric field to nematic liquid crystal, and details thereof are described in <i>Proc. IDRC </i>(Asia Display '95), pp. 577-580 and pp. 707-710.</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">&#x3c;ECB Mode&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0253">In an ECB-mode liquid crystal cell, rod-shaped liquid crystalline molecules are aligned in a substantially horizontal direction. The ECB mode is one of liquid crystal display modes having the most simple structures, and described, e.g., in JP-A-5-203946.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">9-(2) Displays Other Than Liquid Crystal Display Device</p>
<p id="h-0035" num="0000">&#x3c;PDP&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0254">A plasma display panel (PDP) is generally made up of a gas, glass substrates, electrodes, an electrode lead material, a thick-film print material and fluorescent substances. The glass substrates are a front glass substrate and a rear glass substrate. Each glass substrate is provided with an electrode and an insulation layer. The rear glass substrate is further provided with phosphor layers. These two glass substrates are assembled, and a gas is sealed into a space between them.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0255">Plasma display panels are already commercially available. Descriptions thereof can be found in JP-A-5-205643 and JP-A-9-306366.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0256">In some cases, a front plate is placed in front of a plasma display panel. It is appropriate that the front plate be strong enough to protect the plasma display panel. The front plate can be used in a state that there is a clearance between the front plate and the plasma display panel, or in a state that the front plate is bonded directly to the plasma display panel proper.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0257">In an image display such as a plasma display panel, an optical filter can be stuck directly on the display surface. When a front plate is provided in front of the display, the optical filter may be stuck on either the front side (outside) or rear side (display side) of the front plate.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">&#x3c;Touch Panel&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0258">The present film can be applied to touch panels as disclosed in JP-A-5-127822 and JP-A-2002-48913.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0259">Moreover, the present film can be used as a protective film of an organic electroluminescent device or so on.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0260">When the present film is used in an organic electroluminescent device, the descriptions in JP-A-11-335661, JP-A-11-335368, JP-A-2001-192651, JP-A-2001-192652, JP-A-2001-192653, JP-A-2001-335776, JP-A-2001-247859, JP-A-2001-181616, JP-A-2001-181617, JP-A-2002-181816, JP-A-2002-181617 and JP-A-2002-056976 are applicable.
