<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The embodiments of the invention relate generally to growth of plant-life and, more specifically, relate to providing an aeration and hydroponic growth mechanism for plant applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well-known that plants and flowers, etc., are often used to decorate various indoor and outdoor areas of rooms, homes, offices, public places (e.g., airports, etc.). There have been various designs put forth for planters, decorative vase center pieces, home gardening vessels with sophisticated grow lights, and nutrient distribution. For example, with regard to the &#x201c;cut&#x201d; flower industry, both the consumers and sellers (e.g., florists, nurseries, grocery stores, gift shops, etc.) share a limited shelf life or exposure time once the flower has been cut from the root source (of nutrition), providing merely a temporary visual enjoyment of the plant (usually at the peak of the plant's bloom cycle). It is understood that plants require a correct combinational environment of light, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, and water, etc., that are combined with attention and care, whereupon the plant continues to grow for a certain time period or life.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One major problem with traditional flower/plant vases is that they lack adequate air supply to provide adequate oxygen to the stem or roots of the flowers planted within the vases. It is well-known that without adequate oxygen, a plant cannot absorb the necessary nutritional requirements to extend or sustain life or achieve growth. Without a source of circulating oxygen, the water soon turns stagnate resulting in plant or flower subsequently dying.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the invention provide an aeration mechanism for hydroponical aeration and growth of plant applications are described. In accordance with the embodiments, there are provided methods, apparatus, and systems for hydroponical aeration of plants. In one embodiment, a method for hydroponical aeration of plants may include supplying, via an air pump, oxygenated air to a plant within a section of a plant vase that is part of a plant vessel. The section includes roots of the plant submerged in water. The method may further include evenly distributing, via an air diffuser, the oxygenated air to the roots of the plant to facilitate hydroponic growth of the plant.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the invention provide a plant vessel employing an aeration mechanism to provide oxygenated air through a technique of hydroponics to help plants within the vessel stay healthy without requiring a significant amount of attention. Further, the plant vessel offers improvements over mere water reservoirs that stagnate water and promotes bacterial growth that can significantly shortens the life span of plants, flowers (e.g., cut flowers), trees, aquatic water life, and other growing medium (collectively referred to herein as &#x201c;plant(s)&#x201d; or &#x201c;plant application(s)&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, an aeration mechanism is provided to extend the life of plant applications, such as promoting potential propagation of certain species of flowers that the cuttings may root and continue their life cycle. Using aerating of water (through a technique of hydroponics (e.g., Aeroponics, Deep Water Culture, etc.) in a vase (or any vessel containing water for the purpose of sustaining or propagating flowers) and growing of plants including transplanting a living plant into the vessel. A plant vessel may be used for plant agriculture, home gardening, indoor/outdoor gardening, planter boxes, and flower vases, etc. Further, a plant vessel may include a pot, a planter box, a vase, etc., for the hydroponic propagation and production of plants, flowers, etc., according to one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, an aeration mechanism is employed in a plant vessel to facilitate significant plant growth in the vessel having an air pump to sufficiently oxygenate the stem or root system of a plant application in the vessel for extended life, without using any soil, soil-less organic mixes, transplanted plants with soil or soil-less mix root balls, etc. The novel plant vessel is designed to promote growth and development of plant roots in a soil or soil-less growing medium mix.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a vessel employing an aeration mechanism for propagation and hydroponic growth of plant applications according to one embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, a vessel <b>100</b> is shown to have a plant application growing in deep water culture. Deep water culture gives the plant application easy access to all the necessary nutrients and a healthy supply of oxygen for maximum growth as of the plant application. Deep water culture may include a form of hydroponics gardening technique in which plants are suspended above a nutrient solution in a net and the roots <b>166</b> of the plants are fully submerged in the nutrient-rich oxygenated water below. This aeration mechanism provides for a hydroponics system that can range in size from personal indoor gardens to commercial greenhouses and is beneficial to plant applications because it gives their roots <b>166</b> easy access to the necessary nutrients these plant applications need for maximum and healthy growth.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the vessel <b>100</b> employs an embodiment of an aeration system or mechanism for various plant applications <b>132</b> including flowers, trees, aquatic water life, and other growing medium. One of the components of the vessel <b>100</b> includes an air pump <b>112</b> in the base <b>142</b> of the vessel <b>100</b>. The air pump <b>112</b> plays a vital role in providing oxygenation through air <b>114</b> and circulation of oxygenated water to prevent stagnation of water and consequently, avoid bacterial growth in the water and an early termination of plants <b>132</b>. This novel aeration mechanism of the vessel <b>100</b> is used to keep plant applications <b>132</b> (e.g., cut flowers) alive longer than those in other conventional vases by providing supply of oxygenated air <b>114</b>, circulation of oxygenated water, and all those nutrients that are necessary for continuous growth of plant applications <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the vessel <b>100</b> may be made of any number or combination of materials, such as glass, ceramic, steel, aluminum, etc. Further, the vessel <b>100</b> may come in any size or shape (e.g., the vase (or container) <b>102</b> and may hold any amount of water, such as any number of pints or quarts or gallons of water, etc., depending on the type of flowers or other plants it holds). In other words, the vessel <b>100</b>, including the vase <b>102</b>, is not limited to a particular construction material, size, or shape. For example, the vase <b>102</b> may be made of glass and be narrow or small enough to hold a single rose or constructed with steel and be wide or large enough (such as a planter box) to hold several household plants or even commercially-grown applications or greenhouse-based or retail florists-based flowers or plants, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As illustrated, the base <b>142</b> of the vessel <b>100</b> may include an air pump <b>112</b> to pump air <b>116</b> into the vase <b>102</b> to keep the plants <b>132</b> properly oxygenated. As with the size and use of the vessel <b>100</b> and the vase <b>102</b> (e.g., holding a single flower or a large plant), the air pump <b>112</b> may also vary in size and performance, such as in terms of the rate of flow or capacity of pumped air into the vase <b>102</b> depending on the plant application <b>132</b>. For example, an anti-siphon check valve may be made part of the air pump <b>112</b> to avoid any back flow of water if, for some reason, the air pump <b>112</b> fails. As illustrated, the air pump <b>112</b> may employ a pipe (or a tube-like opening) <b>114</b> to manage a proper flow of the air <b>116</b> into the vase <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the vessel <b>100</b> further employs an air diffuser <b>122</b> to evenly diffuse the air bubbles <b>118</b> caused by the pumping of the air <b>116</b> by the air pump <b>112</b> so that the oxygenated air <b>118</b> can be property distributed throughout the water to oxygenate the water. In one embodiment, the air diffuser <b>122</b> may be a simple round plate with holes throughout the plate to, as aforementioned, evenly diffuse the air bubbles <b>118</b>. In another embodiment, the air diffuser <b>122</b> may simply be an air stone (or hosing) with holes such as used in fish aquariums.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, regarding power supply <b>152</b>, in one embodiment, the vessel <b>100</b> may include a rechargeable cordless system (similar to the ones found in mobile phones, rechargeable electric razors, tablet computers, etc.) with a back-up battery-operated system (such as those found in toys, battery-operated razors, etc., that function on various types of batteries, AAA, AA, C, D, 9-volt, etc.). For example, the vessel <b>100</b> may be placed and charged up (using a wall outlet) on a kitchen counter and a bit later, it can be unplugged (from the wall outlet) and placed on a dining room table. The vessel <b>100</b> further provides a root basket <b>162</b> within the vase <b>102</b> to cut and hold a certain portion or amount of roots <b>166</b> or stems of plan applications <b>132</b> so that only a particularly desired amount or length of roots <b>166</b> and/or stems can be suspended or submerged into the oxygenated water provided within adjustable root basket <b>162</b> at or near the bottom of the vase <b>102</b>. The root basket <b>162</b> may be made of or include a holed surface <b>164</b> including a mesh or a grid, such as an aluminum wire mesh or a plastic grid, or the like, and is placed at the lower end of the vase <b>102</b> and/or hanged from the top of the vase <b>102</b> or vessel <b>100</b>. The vessel <b>100</b> may further provide one or more windows <b>172</b> at different locations on the wall of the vessel <b>100</b> to be used to check on the water level or plant health or growth, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the various components, such as vase <b>102</b>, air pump <b>112</b>, power supply <b>152</b>, air diffuser <b>122</b>, etc., collectively form the novel aeration mechanism to provide vital nutrients (e.g., oxygenated air, proper circulation of oxygenated water, other growth and sustenance nutrients, etc.) for plant applications <b>132</b>, such as flowers, plants, trees, aquatic water life, etc. Using the aeration mechanism, not only the plant applications <b>132</b>, such as cut flowers, are kept alive longer, but also, in several cases, new and existing roots <b>166</b> are promoted with sustained growth such that the flowers can be later planted in soil or with proper nutrients continue their growth in the vessel <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the aeration mechanism extends the life of and grows the plant applications <b>132</b> hydroponically (through deep water culture, aeroponically, etc.). In one embodiment, the vessel <b>100</b> is provided for growing plant applications <b>132</b> in a self-contained solution of adequate oxygen to maintain and promote extended life and propagation of plant applications <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other words, and as aforementioned, the vessel <b>100</b> employing the aeration mechanism provides for a method for extending plant life of various plant applications <b>132</b> and propagation of as well as hydroponic growing of plant applications <b>132</b> that transplants living plant applications <b>132</b> into the vessel <b>100</b> of oxygenated water such that the cut stems or roots <b>166</b> of the plant applications <b>132</b> are submerged in oxygenated water provided by the vessel <b>100</b> without having to perform the conventional technique of merely filling a vase with regular water to water the roots <b>166</b> or base of a plant where the water quickly turns stagnate and ends the life of the plant.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a section of a vessel illustrating various components of an aeration mechanism. In one embodiment, aeration mechanism <b>200</b> provides for a vessel <b>100</b> for propagation of and hydroponic growing of plant applications comprising a base <b>142</b> that houses an air pump <b>112</b> to adequately supply the necessary amount of oxygen <b>116</b> to plant applications within the vase <b>102</b>. The air pump <b>112</b> contains an opening in the shape of a pipe <b>114</b> to allow the air <b>116</b> to enter the vase <b>102</b>. The base <b>142</b> further employs an air diffuser <b>122</b> (e.g., a plastic disc with holes, an air stone that is similar to the ones used in fish tanks) to evenly distribute the air <b>116</b> within the vase <b>102</b> so that plant applications within the vase <b>102</b> can receive a sufficient supply of properly oxygenated water. The aeration <b>200</b> further provides a root basket <b>162</b> within the vase <b>102</b> to cut and hold a certain portion of roots or stems of a plan plant application so that only a particularly desired amount or length of roots and/or stems be suspended or submerged into the oxygenated water provided within the root basket <b>162</b> at the bottom or near bottom of the vase <b>102</b>.
