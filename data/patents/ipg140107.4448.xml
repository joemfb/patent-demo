<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S) AND CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) from an application entitled &#x201c;Terminal for handover using channel characteristics and control method thereof&#x201d; filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Nov. 29, 2007 and assigned Serial No. 2007-0122605, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a terminal for handover using channel characteristics.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, handover (also known as handoff; hereinafter, referred to as handover) is an important technology for a mobile communication system to switch a radio channel in use. When a user terminal moves to a radio wave arrival range of another wireless base station beyond a radio wave arrival range of one wireless base station, the handover is an operation for transferring the management of the user terminal between the two wireless base stations. Here, the wireless base station is a device that wirelessly communicates with the user terminal and may be referred to by other names. The user terminal may receive a seamless service even when moving from a serving wireless base station to another wireless base station through the handover.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To successfully perform the above-described handover, information regarding a neighboring base station should be possessed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, the handover may be based on the reception level and quality of a serving base station and the transmission power and level measured in the serving base station and may use the reception level reported from a cell of a neighboring base station along therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In measured information of neighboring base stations, only a base station identity code (BSIC), that is, base station information, and an average value of reception levels measured during a measurement period may be reported.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Four factors&#x2014;the reception power, the reception quality, the transmission power, and the transmission quality&#x2014;may be used with respect to the serving base station, but only the reception level may be measured with respect to the neighboring base station. Since quality information may not be used with respect to the neighboring base station, there is a problem in that the handover should be performed again due to actual low quality in a cell of a target base station even when the handover to the target base station is actually performed, or the handover may fail and a return to a previous channel may be disabled due to the steep degradation of quality.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, it is a primary object to provide a terminal for handover using channel characteristics and a control method thereof that can correct a reception level for a neighboring base station by extending information for neighboring base stations capable of being selected as a handover target base station (cell) and computing a bit error rate, a bad frame indication count, and/or a sync error (fail) count related to the neighboring base station in addition to a reception level value.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a terminal for handover using channel characteristics, including: a receiver that receives reception level information from a neighboring base station; a base station state measurer that measures a state of the neighboring base station having transmitted the reception level information; and a base station selector that selects a corresponding neighboring base station to which the handover is possible using a corrected reception level value by computing the corrected reception level value using a value of the reception level information received from the neighboring base station and a channel characteristic value of the neighboring base station.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When detecting the channel characteristic value of the neighboring base station, one of a frequency correction channel (FCH), a synchronization channel (SCH), and a broadcast control channel (BCCH) may be used. The channel characteristic value of the neighboring base station may use one of a bit error rate, a bad frame indication count, and a sync error count.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The base station selector may compute the corrected reception level value of (Reception Level&#xd7;Channel Characteristic Value (%)&#xd7;Preset Weight Value).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a control method of a terminal for handover using channel characteristics, including the steps of: receiving reception level information from a neighboring base station; measuring a state of the neighboring base station having transmitted the reception level information; and selecting a corresponding neighboring base station to which the handover is possible using a corrected reception level value by computing the corrected reception level value using a value of the reception level information received from the neighboring base station and a channel characteristic value of the neighboring base station.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When detecting the channel characteristic value of the neighboring base station, one of an FCH, an SCH, and a BCCH may be used. The channel characteristic value of the neighboring base station may use one of a bit error rate, a bad frame indication count, and a sync error count.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The step of selecting the corresponding neighboring base station to which the handover is possible may include the step of: computing the corrected reception level value of (Reception Level&#xd7;Channel Characteristic Value (%)&#xd7;Preset Weight Value).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a terminal for handover using channel characteristics and a control method thereof can select a better neighboring base station for the handover by applying a reception level based on detected channel characteristics (quality) of a corresponding neighboring base station even when an actually measured reception level of the neighboring base station is high.</p>

Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented in any suitably arranged wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating a configuration of a terminal for handover using channel characteristics according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. According to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the terminal <b>100</b> for handover using channel characteristics includes a receiver <b>110</b>, a base station state measurer <b>120</b>, and a base station selector <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The receiver <b>110</b> receives reception level information from a neighboring base station <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, - - - , or <b>20</b>-<i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The base station state measurer <b>120</b> measures a state of the neighboring base station <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, - - - , or <b>20</b>-<i>n </i>having transmitted the reception level information. When a channel characteristic value of the neighboring base station <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, - - - , or <b>20</b>-<i>n </i>is detected, the base station state measurer <b>120</b> can use one of an FCH, an SCH, and a BCCH, and can use one of a bit error rate, a bad frame indication count, and a sync error count. The base station selector <b>130</b> can detect a handover target base station by computing a corrected reception level value of (Reception Level&#xd7;Channel Characteristic Value (%)&#xd7;Preset Weight Value).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Here, the FCH is broadcast from the base station <b>10</b> and is used for frequency correction by the terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
