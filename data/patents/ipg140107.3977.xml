<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Owing to development of the science and technology, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) have found wide application in people's daily life. Conventional edge-lit LCDs all require use of a light guide plate, and the light guide plate must be positioned onto a backplate. Generally, in conventional positioning practices, a tab or some other positioning structure is formed at a side edge of the light guide plate by use of a computerized numerical control (CNC) machine tool, and a positioning groove or a positioning post is formed in the backplate. Thus, the light guide plate and the backplate can be assembled together through engagement of the tab and the positioning groove or positioning post. However, this adds to the manufacturing complexity of the light guide plate and reduces the product yield of light guide plates.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a schematic partial cross-sectional and perspective view of an embodiment of a liquid crystal display (LCD) according to the present disclosure. The LCD <b>1</b> of this embodiment comprises a backplate <b>10</b>, a light guide plate <b>20</b>, a plastic frame <b>30</b>, a liquid crystal panel <b>40</b> and a front frame <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is shown a schematic cross-sectional view of a part II of the LCD shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the backplate <b>10</b> comprises a bottom wall <b>11</b> and a sidewall <b>12</b> disposed at a periphery of the bottom wall <b>11</b> and extending perpendicular to the bottom wall <b>11</b>. The light guide plate <b>20</b> is disposed in a receiving space defined by the bottom wall <b>11</b> and the sidewall <b>12</b>, and is supported on the bottom wall <b>11</b>. In this embodiment, at least one positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> is disposed to be bent from the bottom wall <b>11</b>. The positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> abuts against a side edge of the light guide plate <b>20</b> to position the light guide plate <b>20</b> in a horizontal direction. In a preferred embodiment, the backplate <b>10</b> may be made of a metal sheet through stamping, and the light guide plate <b>20</b> may be made of acryl or some other transparent material through injection molding. In this embodiment, the light guide plate <b>20</b> is positioned by using the at least one positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> to abut against the side edge of the light guide plate <b>20</b>, so the light guide plate <b>20</b> may be formed into a standard rectangular structure directly to eliminate the need of disposing an additional positioning structure on the light guide plate <b>20</b>. Thus, the product yield of light guide plates <b>20</b> is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the plastic frame <b>30</b> receives the at least one positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> and is supported on a top surface of the light guide plate <b>20</b> to form a backlight module. Specifically, the plastic frame <b>30</b> comprises a plastic frame body <b>31</b>, a first partition <b>32</b> and a second partition <b>33</b>. The first partition <b>32</b> extends from the plastic frame body <b>31</b> towards the bottom wall <b>11</b> at a side of the positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> that is near the light guide plate <b>20</b>. The second partition <b>33</b> extends from the plastic frame body <b>31</b> towards the bottom wall <b>11</b> at the other side of the positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> that is opposite to the light guide plate <b>20</b>. Thus, the positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> can be inserted between the first partition <b>32</b> and the second partition <b>33</b> to position the plastic frame <b>30</b>. The first partition <b>32</b> is disposed to be supported on the top surface of the light guide plate <b>20</b> and, consequently, cooperates with the bottom wall <b>11</b> to sandwich the light guide plate <b>20</b> therebetween for positioning the light guide plate <b>20</b> in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a schematic partial enlarged view of a plastic frame <b>30</b> of the LCD shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plastic frame <b>30</b> further comprises a third partition <b>34</b> and a fourth partition <b>35</b>. The third partition <b>34</b> and the fourth partition <b>35</b> extend from the plastic frame body <b>31</b> towards the bottom wall <b>11</b> and connect with the first partition <b>32</b> and the second partition <b>33</b> respectively so that the positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> can be further inserted between the third partition <b>34</b> and the fourth partition <b>35</b>. As a result, the positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> is positioned in a positioning space formed by the first partition <b>32</b>, the second partition <b>33</b>, the third partition <b>34</b> and the fourth partition <b>35</b> to prevent movement of the plastic frame <b>30</b> relative to the bottom wall <b>11</b>. Additionally, the plastic frame <b>30</b> further comprises a first supporting wall <b>36</b> extending from the plastic frame body <b>31</b> towards the bottom wall <b>11</b> and connecting with the second partition <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bottom wall <b>11</b> is formed with a notch <b>14</b> at a periphery of the positioning bent-piece <b>13</b>. The second partition <b>33</b>, the third partition <b>34</b> and the fourth partition <b>35</b> extend through the notch <b>14</b> to be flush with a bottom surface of the bottom wall <b>11</b>. Meanwhile, the first supporting wall <b>36</b> is supported on the bottom wall <b>11</b> to improve the strength of the plastic frame <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the plastic frame <b>30</b> further comprises a second supporting wall <b>37</b>, a third supporting wall <b>38</b> and a fourth supporting wall <b>39</b>. The second supporting wall <b>37</b> extends from the plastic frame body <b>31</b> towards the bottom wall <b>11</b> and abuts against an inner edge of the sidewall <b>12</b>, and is further supported on the bottom wall <b>11</b>. The third supporting wall <b>38</b> and the fourth supporting wall <b>39</b> extend from the plastic frame body <b>31</b> away from the bottom wall <b>11</b>. The fourth supporting wall <b>39</b> also abuts against an inner edge of the sidewall <b>12</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the plastic frame <b>30</b> may be made of a plastic material through injection molding.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the liquid crystal panel <b>40</b> is supported on the plastic frame body <b>31</b>, and the front frame <b>50</b> is supported on the third supporting wall <b>38</b> and the fourth supporting wall <b>39</b> and is fixed with the sidewall <b>12</b> of the backplate <b>10</b> so as to sandwich the liquid crystal panel <b>40</b>, the plastic frame <b>30</b> and the light guide plate <b>20</b> between the front frame <b>50</b> and the backplate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this way, by using the positioning bent-piece <b>13</b> disposed on the bottom wall <b>11</b> of the backplate <b>10</b> to position the light guide plate <b>20</b>, the need of disposing an additional positioning structure on the light guide plate <b>20</b> is eliminated, so the product yield of light guide plates <b>20</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure. In view of the foregoing, it is intended that the present disclosure cover modifications and variations of this disclosure provided they fall within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
