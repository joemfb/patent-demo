<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a front pillar for an automobile and, more particularly, to an automobile front pillar having a hollow member provided with an outer panel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Left and right front pillars in an automobile are located in a front section of the automobile, and are provided in order to attach a windshield (i.e., a windscreen). Commonly, a front pillar is made as a member having a closed cross section by welding together an outer panel and an inner panel in an overlapping manner. A front pillar of such description is known from Patent Literature 1. Each of the outer panel and the inner panel requires a flange for joining the other. The flange projects outwards from the front pillar. Therefore, the size of the flange increases.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In response, front pillar development has been in progress in recent years. A front pillar using a hollow member integrally formed by hydroforming is known from Patent Literature 2. The front pillar known from Patent Literature 2 comprises the hollow member and an outer panel. The hollow member comprises a pipe formed by hydroforming. The outer panel is provided so as to cover a surface of the hollow member on the outside in the vehicle width direction, and joined. The front pillar known from Patent Literature is smaller than a common front pillar described further above. The visibility range forward of a vehicle body from a passenger compartment (i.e., the visual field) is accordingly larger.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Depending on the model of the automobile, a front pillar may have a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to an outside of a vehicle body, from the viewpoint of design. Even in an instance in which a curved front pillar is used, it is preferable that the pillar exhibits a stiffness equivalent to an instance in which a linear front pillar is used. Increasing the wall thickness or the diameter of the hollow member is one possible method for achieving this. However, there remains the possibility that the weight of the front pillar will increase. There is also a possibility that an increase in the diameter of the hollow member will result in a correspondingly narrower field of view from the passenger compartment.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">According to the present invention, there is provided a front pillar for an automobile, which front pillar comprises: a hollow member; an outer panel; and an inner panel, wherein the hollow member has a curved shape protruding in its entirety to outside of a vehicle body, the outer panel is provided to a wall section of the hollow member, the wall section being on a vehicle exterior side, and the inner panel is formed so as to lie along a wall section of the hollow member, the wall section being on a passenger compartment side, and the inner panel is provided to the wall section on the passenger compartment side.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0013">Preferably, an intermediate portion of the inner panel between the first flange and the second flange overlaps the hollow member so that joining using MIG welding is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">Preferably, the outer panel has a roof-joining outer flange section that protrudes further towards a passenger compartment relative to the hollow member; the hollow member has a roof-joining extended flange section that protrudes towards the passenger compartment along the roof-joining outer flange section; and the roof-joining extended flange section and the roof-joining outer flange section overlap a flange section of a roof so that joining by direct spot welding is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">More preferably, each of the inner panel and the outer panel has a flange overlapping and joined by direct spot welding to a portion of the hollow member that is located opposite the roof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">More preferably, the front pillar further comprises a nut into which a bolt can be screwed from the passenger compartment side, the nut positioned between the hollow member and the inner panel. The nut comprises a plate section for joining to the inner panel, and a nut section that is smaller than the plate section. The nut section projects towards an inside of the hollow member through a nut relief hole section formed on the hollow member.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">More preferably, the nut relief hole section is oriented at an incline relative to a center line of the nut section.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">Preferably, each of the outer panel and the inner panel has a first flange and a second flange. Each of the respective second flanges is joined separately to the hollow member. Each of the first flanges is positioned so as to face the other. A reinforcing member is sandwiched between and joined to the first flanges in a front end section and a rear end section of the front pillar. Between the front end section and the rear end section, each of the first flanges is overlapped with the other so that a sealing material for sealing the side door can be attached, the first flanges are partially provided with a gap therebetween, and each of the first flanges is joined to the other at a portion where the gap is not present, wherein the gap is in communication with a closed void section enclosed by the hollow member, the outer panel, and the inner panel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">More preferably, the gap comprises a concave section formed on a flange surface of at least one of the first flanges.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">More preferably, each of the front and rear reinforcing members is also joined to the hollow member within the void section.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">More preferably, the outer panel has a glass attachment flange section that is overlapped with and joined to an upper surface of the hollow member. The glass attachment flange section is formed in a flat plate shape on which a windshield can be attached. A terminal section of the hollow member in the longitudinal direction is reinforced by a reinforcing member. The reinforcing member has a joint portion that is overlapped with and joined to the upper surface of the hollow member in the terminal section. The joint portion and the upper surface of the terminal section are downwardly separated from the glass attachment flange section.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0025">More preferably, the inner panel has a stepped section for reinforcement, surrounding a rim of the opening section.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">More preferably, the stepped bead is configured so that a front end section bulges maximally from the inner panel, and the degree of bulging gradually decreases towards the rear section of the vehicle body.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">According to the present invention, the hollow member has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to the outside of the vehicle body. On the hollow member, an inner panel is overlapped with and joined to the wall section on the passenger compartment side. In other words, the hollow member is reinforced by the inner panel. The hollow member with increased stiffness can transmit impact load acting on the inner panel towards the rear section of the vehicle body in an efficient manner. There is no need to increase the thickness or the wall thickness of the hollow member in order to increase the stiffness of the hollow member. An increase in the weight of the front pillar can be minimized, and the size of the front pillar can be reduced. Reducing the size of the front pillar expands the visual field from the passenger compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the restricting concave section is fitted onto a part of the hollow member, thereby making it possible to restrict a relative displacement of the hollow member in the vehicle width direction relative to the inner panel. Therefore, the hollow member is reinforced by the inner panel. As a result, the stiffness of the hollow member can be increased. Therefore, impact load acting on the front end of the hollow member can be transmitted towards the rear section of the vehicle body in an efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the first flange of the outer panel and the first flange of the inner panel overlap each other in the vicinity of the lower section of the hollow member. The stiffness of the front pillar therefore increases. It is also possible for the respective first flanges to form a rim section of a door opening. The sealing material for sealing the door opening can be attached to the rim section. In other words, the rim section also functions as the seal attachment section. The sealing material can be adequately supported by the seal attachment section having a high stiffness.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">Furthermore, according to the present invention, neither of the second flanges overlaps the other, making it possible to reduce the size of each of the outer panel and the inner panel by a corresponding amount. Therefore, the size and the weight of the front pillar can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">Furthermore, according to the present invention, each of the first flange of the outer panel and the first flange of the inner panel can be overlapped with the other and joined by direct spot welding. The second flange of the outer panel can be joined to the hollow member by indirect spot welding from the outer panel side. The second flange of the inner panel can be joined to the hollow member by MIG welding. Welding means suitable for the configuration of each joint section can be employed as described above, and a step for joining by welding can be performed in an efficient manner; therefore, the capacity for mass production of the front pillar can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the intermediate portion of the inner panel between the first flange and the second flange can be joined to the hollow member by MIG welding. Both the second flange and the intermediate portion of the inner panel is joined to the hollow member, thereby making it possible to further increase the stiffness of the hollow member.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">Furthermore, according to the present invention, three flanges; namely, the roof-joining extended flange section, the roof-joining outer flange section, and the flange section of the roof, can be overlapped with each other and joined by direct spot welding. Therefore, despite a hollow member being used for the front pillar, the specifications of the spot welding equipment can be substantially equivalent to those required conventionally, and it becomes possible to continue reducing the size of spot welding equipment. Also, even when a hollow member is used, welding conditions required for spot welding are substantially identical to those required conventionally, and spot welding can be readily performed. Only the roof-joining outer flange section and the roof-joining extended flange section for attaching the flange section of the roof protrude towards the passenger compartment. There is no need to provide a roof-joining outer flange section and a roof-joining extended flange section to a portion of the front pillar onto which the windshield is attached. Therefore, it is possible to provide an adequate visibility range forward of the vehicle body from the passenger compartment through the windshield.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the outer panel and the inner panel are joined by overlapping respective flanges and applying direct spot welding at a position opposite the roof relative to the hollow member. Therefore, even though a hollow member is used, it is possible to employ spot welding, as conventionally employed, when joining the inner panel and the outer panel.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the nut is provided between the hollow member and the inner panel. The nut comprises the plate section that joins the inner panel, and the nut section that is smaller than the plate section. The nut section extends to the interior of the hollow member through a nut relief hole section formed on the hollow member. Therefore, even though a nut is provided between the hollow member and the inner panel, a space between the hollow member and the inner panel can be made narrower. As a result, the front pillar can be made thinner. Also, since the nut section is smaller than the plate section, the size of the nut relief hole can be made smaller by a corresponding amount.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the nut relief hole section is oriented at an incline relative to the center line of the nut section. Therefore, even when a plate nut is attached in advance when the inner panel is attached, an adequate space between the plate nut and the nut relief hole section can readily be provided, and the size of the nut relief hole section can be further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the hollow member, the outer panel, and the inner panel are combined to form a closed space section. A gap in communication with the space section is partially provided between each of the first flanges. The gap functions as a channel used when performing surface treatment on the front pillar using an electrodeposition liquid or another coating liquid. The coating liquid is caused to flow from the gap into the space section, thereby making it possible to adequately coat a wall surface of the front pillar inside the space section. Also, since a respective portion of each of the first flanges where the gap is not present is joined to the other, the first flanges can be imparted with adequate stiffness even though the gap is provided. As a result, adequate stiffness of the front pillar can be obtained. Also, the reinforcing member is provided to the front end section and the rear end section of the front pillar. Each of the reinforcing members is sandwiched between and joined to each of the first flanges. Therefore, the front end section and the rear end section of the front pillar, which require higher stiffness than an intermediate section, can be reinforced by the reinforcing member. Therefore, the hollow member having a small diameter and a small wall thickness can be used to make the front pillar extremely compact.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the gap comprises a concave section formed on the flange surface of at least one of the first flanges. Since the concave section is formed on the flange surface, the concave section can be simultaneously formed during plastic forming of the first flange. Therefore, the gap can be provided to the flange surface with extreme ease. It is also possible to readily provide a large number of gaps across a wide range on the flange surface.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0039">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the reinforcing member sandwiched by and joined to each of the first flanges and is also joined to the hollow member. Therefore, the front end section and the rear end section of the hollow member can be reinforced by both the inner panel and the reinforcing member. The stiffness of the hollow member is increased, and the stiffness of the front pillar can therefore be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0040">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the reinforcing member for reinforcing each of the terminal sections of the hollow member has a joint portion for overlapping with and joining to the upper surface of each of the terminal sections. The joint portion and the upper surface of each of the terminal sections are downwardly separated from the glass attachment flange section, and therefore do not interfere with the glass attachment flange section. Therefore, the glass attachment flange section can be given a flat configuration overall. The windshield can be readily and reliably attached to the flat glass attachment section using an adhesive or another common method of attachment, and the state of the attachment can be maintained to a sufficient degree.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0041">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the terminal section is sandwiched by and joined to the reinforcing member and the inner panel, and the joint strength is therefore increased.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0042">Furthermore, according to the present invention, each of the thickness of the hollow member and the thickness of the reinforcing member is set to a size that is suitable for joining by MIG welding. Therefore, the hollow member and the reinforcing member can be sufficiently joined, and the joint strength can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0043">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the inner panel has a stepped bead bulging towards the passenger compartment, and the stiffness of the inner panel thereby increases. As a result, the front pillar has high stiffness. Also, the opening section is positioned so as to span at least a part of the fold sections, and the upper half portion of the opening section is thereby positioned on a section corresponding to the stepped bead. Therefore, the opening section is formed so as to have a stepped shape that matches a gradation of the stepped bead. Therefore, the flexible linear member drawn out from the interior of the hollow member can be readily drawn towards the passenger compartment through the opening section.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0044">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the rim of the opening section is surrounded by the stepped section for reinforcement. Therefore, the inner panel has a large stiffness around the rim.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0045">Furthermore, according to the present invention, the degree to which the stepped bead bulges from the inner panel is larger at the front end section and gradually decreases towards the rear section of the vehicle body. Therefore, impact load acting on the front section of the vehicle body can be transmitted to the hollow member through the stepped bead in an efficient manner.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">Certain preferred embodiments of the present invention are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">A front pillar for an automobile according to a first embodiment will first be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a front section of a vehicle body <b>10</b> of an automobile Am. The front section of the vehicle body <b>10</b> is a monocoque body, mainly comprising a front bulkhead <b>11</b>, left and right front side frames <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>, left and right upper frames <b>13</b>, <b>13</b>, left and right upper side frames <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>, a front bumper beam <b>15</b>, left and right front pillars <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, left and right roof side rails <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>, and a roof <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">The front bulkhead <b>11</b> is located at a front end surface of the vehicle body <b>10</b>, and is capable of supporting a radiator (not shown). Each of the left and right front side frames <b>12</b>, <b>12</b> extends rearwards from left and right lower end sections of the front bulkhead <b>11</b>, respectively. Each of the left and right upper frames <b>13</b>, <b>13</b> extends rearwards and upwards from the left and right lower end sections of the front bulkhead <b>11</b>, respectively. Each of the upper frames <b>13</b>, <b>13</b> is located further outward in the vehicle width direction of, and above, the left and right front side frames <b>12</b>, <b>12</b> respectively. Each of the left and right upper side frames <b>14</b>, <b>14</b> extends rearwards from left and right end sections of the front bulkhead <b>11</b> respectively, and joins the left and right upper frames <b>13</b>, <b>13</b> respectively. The front bumper beam <b>15</b> bridges between respective front ends of the left and right front side frames <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0086">Each of the left and right front pillars <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> extends at an incline rearwards and upwards from a rear end of the left and right upper frames <b>13</b>, <b>13</b> respectively, and forms a part of a door opening <b>23</b> that is opened or closed by a side door (not shown). A windshield (i.e., a windscreen), not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is mounted between the left and right front pillars <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>. Each of the left and right roof side rails <b>21</b>, <b>21</b> extends rearwards from a rear end of each of the left and right front pillars <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> respectively. The roof <b>22</b> is supported by the left and right roof side rails <b>21</b>, <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">The left and right front pillars <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> are members that are bilaterally symmetrical to each other. A description will be given hereafter for the right front pillar <b>18</b> only; a description for the left front pillar <b>17</b> will be omitted. The right front pillar <b>18</b> will hereafter be referred to simply as the front pillar <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show the front pillar <b>18</b> as viewed from a side facing a passenger compartment <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>). The front pillar <b>18</b> comprises a hollow member <b>25</b>, an outer panel <b>28</b>, and an inner panel <b>29</b>. The hollow member <b>25</b> is a long material that functions as a core material of the front pillar <b>18</b>, and a front end is joined to a rear end section <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the right upper arm <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The hollow member <b>25</b> is made from, for example, a steel material, and is integrally formed by hydroforming so as to have a substantially rectangular closed cross-section. In other words, the hollow member <b>25</b> is made of a rectangular pipe. In the first embodiment, substantially rectangular refers to a rectangle, a square, or another quadrilateral.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the front pillar <b>18</b> has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to an outside of the vehicle body <b>10</b> (arrow Ou). Therefore, each of the hollow member <b>25</b>, the outer panel <b>28</b>, and the inner panel <b>29</b> has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to the outside of the vehicle body <b>10</b>. Specifically, the overall shape of the front pillar <b>18</b> is a curve that projects upward, and outward in the vehicle width direction, of the vehicle body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0090">A straight line <b>31</b> passing through the front end <b>18</b><i>a </i>and a rear end <b>18</b><i>b </i>of the front pillar <b>18</b> shall be referred to as a reference line <b>31</b>. When the vehicle body <b>10</b> is viewed from the vehicle width direction, a profile line <b>32</b> of the front pillar <b>18</b> curving upwards projects upward of the vehicle body <b>10</b> from the reference line <b>31</b> by a distance L<b>1</b>. When the vehicle body <b>10</b> is viewed from above, a profile line <b>33</b> of the front pillar <b>18</b> curving outward in the vehicle width direction projects outward in the vehicle width direction from the reference line <b>31</b> by a distance L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, the hollow member <b>25</b> is formed by four sides, namely four wall sections <b>35</b> through <b>38</b>, so as to have a rectangular cross section. The four wall sections <b>35</b> through <b>38</b> are an outer upper wall section <b>35</b> located at a top, an outer side wall section <b>36</b> located on an outside in the vehicle width direction, an inner lower wall section <b>37</b> located at a bottom, and an inner side wall section <b>38</b> located on an inside in the vehicle width direction. The outer upper wall section <b>35</b> and the outer side wall section <b>36</b> form a vehicle exterior-side wall section <b>26</b> (i.e., a wall section <b>26</b> on a vehicle exterior side) that is substantially L-shaped in cross section. The vehicle exterior-side wall section <b>26</b> is positioned on the hollow member <b>25</b> towards an exterior of the vehicle body <b>10</b>. The inner lower wall section <b>37</b> and the inner side wall section <b>38</b> form a passenger compartment-side wall section <b>27</b> (i.e., a wall section <b>27</b> on a passenger compartment <b>34</b> side) that is substantially L-shaped in cross section. The passenger compartment-side wall section <b>27</b> is positioned on the hollow member <b>25</b> towards an interior of the vehicle body <b>10</b> (i.e., towards the passenger compartment <b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0092">As described above, the hollow member <b>25</b> has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to the outside of the vehicle body <b>10</b>. As a result, the vehicle exterior-side wall section <b>26</b> has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to the outside of the vehicle body <b>10</b> (i.e., a convex curved shape). The passenger compartment-side wall section <b>27</b>, positioned towards the passenger compartment <b>34</b>, has a curved shape, the entirety of which is recessed towards the outside of the vehicle body <b>10</b> (i.e., a concave curved shape).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">Each of the outer panel <b>28</b> and the inner panel <b>29</b> is a long material extending along the hollow member <b>25</b>, and is provided to the hollow member <b>25</b>. More specifically, the outer panel <b>28</b> is provided to the vehicle exterior-side wall section <b>26</b>, and the inner panel <b>29</b> is provided to the passenger compartment-side wall section <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">The outer panel <b>28</b> is, for example, a folded molded article made of a steel plate, and comprises an outer panel body <b>41</b>, a first outer flange <b>42</b>, and a second outer flange <b>43</b>. The outer panel body <b>41</b> has a substantially U-shaped cross section, opens towards the vehicle exterior-side wall section <b>26</b>, and has the first and second outer flanges <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> provided to both ends <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the opening. One of the ends <b>41</b><i>a </i>is positioned near a corner between the outer side wall section <b>36</b> and the inner lower wall section <b>37</b>. The other end <b>41</b><i>b </i>is positioned near a corner between the outer upper wall section <b>35</b> and the outer side wall section <b>36</b>. The first outer flange <b>42</b> (i.e., the first flange <b>42</b>) extends from the end <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the outer panel body <b>41</b> towards the outside of the vehicle body <b>10</b>. A distal end of the first outer flange <b>42</b> is positioned away from the corner between the outer side wall section <b>36</b> and the inner lower wall section <b>37</b>. The second outer flange <b>43</b> (i.e., the second flange <b>43</b>) extends from the other end <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the outer panel body <b>41</b>, along the outer upper wall section <b>35</b>, towards the passenger compartment <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">The inner panel <b>29</b> is, for example, a folded molded article made of a steel plate, formed so as to enclose a lower section of the hollow member <b>25</b>. The inner panel <b>29</b> comprises an inner panel body <b>45</b>, a restricting section <b>46</b>, a first inner flange <b>47</b>, and a second inner flange <b>48</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a lower front section of the inner panel <b>29</b> is joined to a lower inner panel <b>29</b>A projecting upright from a lower section of the vehicle body <b>10</b>. The lower inner panel <b>29</b>A functions to link the lower section of the vehicle body <b>10</b> to the lower front section of the front pillar <b>18</b> as a part of a &#x201c;front pillar undersection.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5</figref>, the inner panel body <b>45</b> comprises a flat plate that is overlapped with and joined to the passenger compartment-side wall section <b>27</b>, and a predetermined welding position <b>64</b> (i.e., a welding section <b>64</b>) is welded to the inner lower wall section <b>37</b>. The restricting section <b>46</b> extends upwards from an end <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the inner panel body <b>45</b> towards the outside in the vehicle width direction, following the corner between the outer side wall section <b>36</b> and the inner lower wall section <b>37</b>. A top end <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the upward extension is provided with the first inner flange <b>47</b>. The restricting section <b>46</b> overlaps with a lower section <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the outer side wall section <b>36</b> up to a predetermined height.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">The first inner flange <b>47</b> (i.e., a first flange <b>47</b>) extends from the top end <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the restricting section <b>46</b> so as to lie along a lower surface of the first outer flange <b>42</b> of the outer panel <b>28</b>. The first inner flange <b>47</b> is caused to overlap with the first outer flange <b>42</b> of the outer panel <b>28</b> from below, and is joined by direct spot welding. The flanges <b>42</b>, <b>47</b> thus integrated by joining are capable of functioning as a member for reinforcing the hollow member <b>25</b>. As a result, the stiffness of the front pillar <b>18</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">The integrated flanges <b>42</b>, <b>47</b> form a rim section <b>52</b> of the door opening <b>23</b>. The rim section <b>52</b> functions as a seal attachment section for attaching a sealing material <b>53</b>. The rim section <b>52</b> shall hereafter be referred to as a seal attachment section <b>52</b>. The sealing material <b>53</b> is a material for sealing between the door opening <b>23</b> and a side door <b>51</b> when the door opening <b>23</b> is closed by the side door <b>51</b>. Since the flanges <b>42</b>, <b>47</b> are integrated, the stiffness of the seal attachment section <b>52</b> is increased. The sealing material <b>53</b> can be adequately supported by the seal attachment section <b>52</b> having a high stiffness.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">The second outer flange <b>43</b> of the outer panel <b>28</b> is caused to overlap with the outer upper wall section <b>35</b> of the hollow member <b>25</b>, and is joined by indirect spot welding. The second inner flange <b>48</b> of the inner panel <b>29</b> is caused to overlap with the inner side wall section <b>38</b> of the hollow member <b>25</b>, and is joined by MIG welding (metal inert gas welding). The second outer flange <b>43</b> and the second inner flange <b>48</b> are provided separately to the hollow member <b>25</b>. Therefore, there is no need to join the second outer flange <b>43</b> and the second inner flange <b>48</b> so as to overlap each other. The size of each of the outer panel <b>28</b> and the inner panel <b>29</b> can be reduced by an amount corresponding to the extent to which the second outer flange <b>43</b> and the second inner flange <b>48</b> do not overlap. Therefore, the weight of the front pillar <b>18</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">The second inner flange <b>48</b> (i.e., a second flange <b>48</b>) extends upwards from an end <b>45</b><i>b </i>of the inner panel body <b>45</b> towards the inside in the vehicle width direction so as to lie along the inner side wall section <b>38</b>. The second inner flange <b>48</b> overlaps the inner side wall section <b>38</b> up to half the height of the inner side wall section <b>38</b>. The second inner flange <b>48</b> is positioned relative to the inner side wall section <b>38</b> so that a predetermined space S is provided therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0101">The second inner flange <b>48</b> has a plurality of joint sections <b>57</b> provided to an upper end portion <b>48</b><i>a</i>. The joint sections <b>57</b> are sections at which the second inner flange <b>48</b> projects towards the inner side wall section <b>38</b> so as to contact and join the inner side wall section <b>38</b>. The joint sections <b>57</b> are arranged at a predetermined pitch along the longitudinal direction of the hollow member <b>25</b>, and an upper end <b>65</b> (i.e., a welding section <b>65</b>) of each of the joint sections <b>57</b> is joined by MIG welding to the inner side wall section <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0102">The inner panel body <b>45</b>, the restricting section <b>46</b>, and the second inner flange <b>48</b> form a restricting concave section <b>61</b>. The restricting concave section <b>61</b> is a concave section in which a part <b>25</b><i>a</i>; i.e., a lower section <b>25</b><i>a</i>, of the hollow member <b>25</b> can be fitted and accommodated. The lower section <b>25</b><i>a </i>of the hollow member <b>25</b> is sandwiched between the restricting section <b>46</b> and the joint sections <b>57</b>. The hollow member <b>25</b> is restricted from undergoing relative displacement in the vehicle width direction relative to the inner panel <b>29</b>. The hollow member <b>25</b> is therefore reinforced by the inner panel <b>29</b>. As a result, the stiffness of the hollow member <b>25</b> can be increased. Therefore, an impact load acting on a front end of the hollow member <b>25</b> can be transmitted to a rear section of the vehicle body <b>10</b> in an efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">Next, an example of welding the front pillar <b>18</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The first outer flange <b>42</b> and the first inner flange <b>47</b> are joined by spot welding as follows. Each of the overlapped flanges <b>42</b>, <b>47</b> is shaped so as to extend away from the hollow member <b>25</b>, and is outwardly exposed. As a result, the flanges <b>42</b>, <b>47</b> can be sandwiched between a pair of electrodes <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, and joining by direct spot welding can therefore be performed. The flanges <b>42</b>, <b>47</b> in a state of overlapping each other are sandwiched by a pair of electrodes <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>. Next, an electrical current is supplied between the electrodes <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, thereby joining the flanges <b>42</b>, <b>47</b> by direct spot welding.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0104">The outer upper wall section <b>35</b> and the second outer flange <b>43</b> are joined by spot welding as shall now be described. An electrode <b>73</b> is pressed against the second outer flange <b>43</b> in a state in which the second outer flange <b>43</b> overlaps the outer upper wall section <b>35</b>. Next, an electrical current is supplied between the electrode <b>73</b> and the outer upper wall section <b>35</b>, thereby joining the electrode <b>73</b> to the outer upper wall section <b>35</b> by indirect spot welding. The joining step does not require the second outer flange <b>43</b> and the outer upper wall section <b>35</b> overlapping each other to be sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. Therefore, there is no need to insert an electrode into the hollow member <b>25</b> and press the electrode against an inner surface of the hollow member <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">The inner side wall section <b>38</b> and the second inner flange <b>48</b> are joined by MIG welding as shall now be described. In a state in which the second inner flange <b>48</b> overlaps the inner side wall section <b>38</b>, a welding wire <b>75</b> is positioned in proximity with the second inner flange <b>48</b>, the welding wire <b>75</b> is used as an electrode, and the second inner flange <b>48</b> is joined to the inner side wall section <b>38</b> by MIG welding. By positioning the welding wire <b>75</b>, which functions as the electrode, in proximity with the second inner flange <b>48</b> as described above, it is possible to join the second inner flange <b>48</b> to the inner side wall section <b>38</b>. There is no need for a step for inserting an electrode into the hollow member <b>25</b>, or for a step for pressing the inserted electrode against an inner surface of the hollow member <b>25</b>. By employing welding means suitable for the configuration of each joint section as described above, a step for joining by welding can be performed in an efficient manner; therefore, the capacity for mass production of the front pillar <b>18</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0106">A wall thickness dimension T<b>1</b> of the hollow member <b>25</b> is relatively large, and a plate thickness dimension T<b>2</b> of the inner flange <b>29</b> is larger than a plate thickness dimension T<b>3</b> of the outer flange <b>28</b>. Therefore, the second inner flange <b>48</b> is joined to the hollow member <b>25</b> by MIG welding. Therefore, the second inner flange <b>48</b> can be joined more firmly to the hollow member <b>25</b>, and the stiffness of the front pillar <b>18</b> can be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">The inner lower wall section <b>37</b> and a center portion <b>45</b> of the inner panel <b>29</b> (i.e., the inner panel body <b>45</b>) are joined by MIG welding as shall now be described. In a state in which the inner panel body <b>45</b> overlaps the inner lower wall section <b>37</b>, a welding wire <b>76</b> is placed in proximity with the inner panel <b>29</b> with a laser being jointly used. Next, the welding wire <b>76</b> is moved along the welding section <b>64</b>, the welding position <b>64</b> is caused to melt onto the inner lower wall section <b>37</b>, and the inner panel body <b>45</b> is joined to the inner lower wall section <b>37</b>. In other words, the welding position <b>64</b> is caused to melt onto the inner lower wall section <b>37</b> when such MIG welding is performed, for which reason it is known as &#x201c;penetrating MIG welding.&#x201d; By using MIG welding to join the inner panel body <b>45</b> to the inner lower wall section <b>37</b>, the stiffness of the front pillar <b>18</b> can be further increased. It thereby becomes possible to support an impact load acting on the front pillar <b>18</b>, even when a relative large load is acting, such as in a case of an offset collision.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">Next, an example of an impact load acting on the front pillar <b>18</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. When the automobile Am collides head-on with an oncoming vehicle Ao (or an obstacle Ao), an impact load F<b>1</b> acts on a center of the front bumper beam <b>15</b>. Also, when the automobile Am experiences an offset collision with an oncoming vehicle Ao, an impact load F<b>2</b> acts on the front bumper beam <b>15</b> at a position offset from the center. A part of the impact load F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b> is transmitted as an impact load F<b>3</b> to the front pillar <b>18</b> from the front bumper beam <b>15</b> through the right upper arm <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the hollow member <b>25</b> has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to the outside of the vehicle body <b>10</b>. When the impact load F<b>3</b> acts on the front end of the hollow member <b>25</b> as indicated by an arrow, tensile stress is generated in the vehicle exterior-side wall section <b>26</b> of the hollow member <b>25</b>, and compressive stress is generated in the passenger compartment-side wall section <b>27</b> of the hollow member <b>25</b>. In other words, the impact load F<b>3</b> acts so as to bend the hollow member <b>25</b> towards the exterior of the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">According to the first embodiment, the inner panel <b>29</b> is overlapped with and joined to the passenger compartment-side wall section <b>27</b> of the hollow member <b>25</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, thereby reinforcing the hollow member <b>25</b>. As a result, the stiffness of the hollow member <b>25</b> is increased. Therefore, the hollow member <b>25</b> can transmit the impact load F<b>3</b> to the rear section of the vehicle body <b>10</b> in an efficient manner. Also, there is no need to increase the overall thickness or the wall thickness of the hollow member <b>25</b> in order to increase the stiffness of the hollow member <b>25</b>. Therefore, an increase in the weight of the front pillar <b>18</b> can be minimized, and the size of the front pillar <b>180</b> can be reduced. Reducing the size of the front pillar <b>18</b> expands the visual field from the passenger compartment.</p>

<p id="p-0135" num="0135">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 through 22</figref>, the front pillar <b>18</b>B comprises a hollow member <b>253</b>, an outer panel <b>217</b>, and an inner panel <b>218</b>.

The lower inner panel <b>232</b> functions to link the lower section of the vehicle body <b>10</b>B to a lower front section of the front pillar <b>18</b>B as part of a &#x201c;front pillar undersection.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0136">The front pillar <b>18</b>B has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to an outside of the vehicle body <b>10</b>B. Therefore, each of the hollow member <b>253</b>, the outer panel <b>217</b>, and the inner panel <b>218</b> has a curved shape, the entirety of which projects to the outside of the vehicle body <b>10</b>B. Specifically, the overall shape of the front pillar <b>18</b>B is a curve that projects upward, and outward in the vehicle width direction, of the vehicle body <b>10</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0137">The hollow member <b>253</b> is a long material that functions as a core material of the front pillar <b>18</b>B, and a front end is joined to a rear end section <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the right upper arm <b>13</b>. The hollow member <b>253</b> is made from, for example, a steel material, and is integrally formed by hydroforming so as to have a substantially rectangular closed cross-section. In other words, the hollow member <b>253</b> is made of a rectangular pipe. In the third embodiment, substantially rectangular refers to a rectangle, a square, or another quadrilateral.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0138">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, the hollow member <b>253</b> is formed by four sides, namely four wall sections <b>261</b> through <b>264</b>, so as to have a rectangular cross section. The four wall sections <b>261</b> through <b>264</b> are an inner lower wall section <b>261</b> located at a bottom, an outer wall section <b>262</b> located at an outside in the vehicle width direction, an inner wall section <b>263</b> located on at inside in the vehicle width direction, and an outer upper wall section <b>264</b> located at a top.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0139">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the outer panel <b>217</b> is, for example, a folded molded article made of a steel plate, and comprises an outer panel body <b>281</b>, a first outer flange <b>282</b>, and a second outer flange <b>275</b>. The outer panel body <b>281</b> has a substantially U-shaped cross section, opens towards the outside wall section <b>262</b>, and has the first and second outer flanges <b>282</b>, <b>275</b> provided to both ends of the opening. The first outer flange <b>282</b> (i.e., a first flange <b>282</b>) is positioned near a corner between the inner lower wall section <b>261</b> and the outer wall section <b>262</b>. A distal end of the first outer flange <b>282</b> is positioned away from the corner between the inner lower wall section <b>261</b> and the outer wall section <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0140">The second outer flange <b>275</b> (i.e., a second flange) extends along the outer upper wall section <b>264</b> to a vicinity of a corner between the outer upper wall section <b>264</b> and the inner wall section <b>263</b>. A windshield <b>215</b> is attached to an upper surface of the second outer flange <b>275</b> with a sealing member (not shown) interposed therebetween. In other words, the second outer flange <b>275</b> functions as a windshield attachment section (i.e., a window frame). The second outer flange <b>275</b> will hereafter be referred to as a windshield attachment section <b>275</b> or a windshield attachment flange section <b>275</b> as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0141">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the inner panel <b>218</b> is, for example, a folded molded article made of a steel plate, formed so as to enclose a lower section of the hollow member <b>253</b>. The inner panel <b>218</b> comprises an inner panel body <b>266</b>, a first inner flange <b>268</b>, and a second inner flange <b>267</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0142">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 through 22</figref>, the inner panel body <b>266</b> comprises a flat plate that overlaps and is joined to the inner lower wall section <b>261</b>. The first inner flange <b>268</b> extends from an end of the inner panel body <b>266</b> on the outside in the vehicle width direction so as to lie along a lower surface of the first outer flange <b>282</b> of the outer panel <b>217</b>. The first inner flange <b>268</b> overlaps with and joins to the first outer flange <b>282</b> of the outer panel <b>217</b> from below. The flanges <b>268</b>, <b>282</b> thus integrated by joining are capable of functioning as a member for reinforcing the hollow member <b>253</b>. As a result, the stiffness of the front pillar <b>18</b>B is increased. The integrated flanges <b>268</b>, <b>282</b> form a rim section <b>245</b> of the door opening <b>223</b>. The rim section <b>245</b> functions as a seal attachment section for attaching a sealing material <b>53</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). The rim section <b>245</b> shall hereafter be referred to as a seal attachment section <b>245</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0143">The second outer flange <b>275</b> of the outer panel <b>217</b> is caused to overlap the outer upper wall section <b>264</b> of the hollow member <b>253</b>, and is joined by indirect spot welding. The second inner flange <b>267</b> of the inner panel <b>218</b> is caused to overlap inner wall section <b>263</b> of the hollow member <b>253</b>, and is joined by MIG welding. Therefore, the second outer flange <b>275</b> and the second inner flange <b>267</b> are joined separately, and no not need to be joined so as to overlap each other. The size of each of the outer panel <b>217</b> and the inner panel <b>218</b> can be reduced by an amount corresponding to the extent to which the second outer flange <b>275</b> and the second inner flange <b>267</b> do not overlap. Therefore, the weight of the front pillar <b>18</b>B can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0144">The second outer flange <b>275</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> and the second outer flange <b>275</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> will now be compared and described. The second outer flange <b>275</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> extends further towards the passenger compartment <b>34</b> than the hollow member <b>253</b> so that a flange section <b>287</b> of the roof <b>22</b> can be joined by direct spot welding. Joining can therefore be readily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0145">Meanwhile, the second outer flange <b>275</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> also functions as the windshield attachment section <b>275</b> for attaching the windshield <b>215</b>. In other words, the windshield attachment section <b>275</b> is only used for attaching the windshield <b>215</b>, and therefore does not need to extend towards the passenger compartment <b>34</b>. Since the windshield attachment section <b>275</b> does not extend towards the passenger compartment <b>34</b>, the visibility range forwards of the vehicle body from a passenger compartment (i.e., the visual field) through the windshield <b>215</b> is larger by a corresponding amount.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0146">As described above, even through the hollow member <b>253</b> is used as the core material for the front pillar <b>18</b>B, the flange section <b>287</b> of the roof <b>22</b> can be readily and reliably joined to the front pillar <b>18</b>B while an adequate visibility range forward of the vehicle body from the passenger compartment <b>34</b> is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0147">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 through 27</figref>, the second inner flange <b>267</b> extends upwards, from an end of the inner panel body <b>266</b> located inwards in the vehicle width direction, so as to lie along an inner wall section <b>263</b>. The second inner flange <b>267</b> overlaps the inner wall section <b>263</b> up to half the height of the inner wall section <b>263</b>. The second inner flange <b>267</b> has a plurality of joint sections <b>293</b> provided to an upper end. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the joint sections <b>293</b> are arranged at a predetermined pitch P<b>1</b> along the longitudinal direction of the hollow member <b>253</b>, and are joined to the inner wall section <b>263</b> by MIG welding. A first welded metal section <b>292</b> at a portion where the joint sections <b>293</b> has been welded has a length Lw. The pitch P<b>1</b> varies as appropriate depending on the position of the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0148">A specific configuration of joining the inner panel body <b>266</b> to the inner lower wall section <b>261</b> shall now be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 through 27</figref>, the inner panel body <b>266</b> has a plurality of through-holes <b>294</b> for welding. As shown in FIG. <b>24</b>, the through-holes <b>294</b> are arranged at a predetermined pitch P<b>2</b> along the longitudinal direction of the hollow member <b>253</b>, and are joined to the inner lower wall section <b>261</b> by MIG welding. In other words, the inner panel body <b>266</b> is welded to the inner lower wall section <b>261</b> by a plurality of second welded metal sections <b>292</b><i>a</i>. The pitch P<b>2</b> varies as appropriate depending on the position of the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0149">The first welded metal section <b>292</b> and the second welded metal sections <b>292</b><i>a </i>are elongated in the longitudinal direction of the hollow member <b>253</b>. Also, the first welded metal section <b>292</b> and the second welded metal sections <b>292</b><i>a </i>are arranged along the longitudinal direction of the hollow member <b>253</b> in a staggered manner. Therefore, the strength at which the inner panel <b>218</b> joins the hollow member <b>253</b> can be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0150">In order to weld the inner panel <b>218</b> to the hollow member <b>253</b>, the second inner flange <b>267</b> thus has a plurality of the joint sections <b>293</b> provided to the upper end. Therefore, the joint formed by welding can be made stronger than when the inner panel <b>218</b> is joined to the hollow member <b>253</b> by spot welding. Therefore, the inner panel <b>218</b> can transmit loads acting on the <b>18</b><i>b </i>in a reliable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0151">Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, in order to weld the inner panel <b>218</b> to the hollow member <b>253</b>, the inner panel body <b>266</b> is provided with the through-holes <b>294</b> for welding.

The roof side rail <b>21</b> has a cross-sectional configuration that is substantially the same as that of the front pillar <b>18</b>B, and component members that are identical are therefore affixed with identical numerals. In other word, the roof side rail <b>21</b> comprises the hollow member <b>253</b>, the outer panel <b>217</b>, and the inner panel <b>218</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0161">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 through 32</figref>, the front pillar <b>18</b>B is provided with a support section <b>251</b> for supporting another member.

<p id="p-0163" num="0163">The plate section <b>317</b> is a flat plate that overlaps and is joined to the inner panel body <b>266</b>, within the gap Cr.

A nugget is a portion on a welded section that has melted and set when the plate section <b>317</b> overlaps and is welded onto the inner panel body <b>266</b>. The nut section <b>318</b> is a cylinder extending from a plate surface of the plate section <b>317</b> towards the inner lower wall section <b>261</b>, and has a female thread penetrating within.

<p id="p-0165" num="0165">In the plate nut <b>311</b> attached to the front pillar <b>18</b>B, the nut section <b>318</b> is capable of having a bolt (not shown) screwed thereinto.

The reinforcing section <b>358</b> sandwiched between and joined to the inner and outer panels is interposed between the first outer flange <b>282</b> of the outer panel <b>217</b> and the first inner flange <b>268</b> of the inner panel <b>218</b>. The three members <b>282</b>, <b>268</b>, <b>358</b> are overlapped with each other and joined to each other by spot welding. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b> has a joint section <b>361</b> provided to a front end section. The joint section <b>361</b> is joined to the lower inner panel <b>232</b> and an upper section of a dashboard (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0172">The hollow member <b>253</b> is thus sandwiched and reinforced by the rear section reinforcing member <b>243</b> or the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b> and the inner panel <b>218</b> from both left and right sides. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the wall thickness t<b>1</b> of the hollow member <b>253</b>, the wall thickness t<b>2</b> of the outer panel <b>217</b>, and the wall thickness t<b>3</b> of the inner panel <b>218</b> can be made smaller along the entirety of the front pillar <b>18</b>B. Furthermore, the height h<b>1</b> and the width h<b>2</b> of the hollow member <b>253</b> can be made smaller. The thickness of the front pillar <b>18</b>B can be dramatically reduced while ensuring an adequate stiffness of the front pillar <b>18</b>B is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0173">The wall thickness t<b>2</b> of the outer panel <b>217</b>, and the wall thickness t<b>3</b> of the inner panel <b>218</b>, the wall thickness t<b>4</b> of the rear section reinforcing member <b>243</b>, and the wall thickness t<b>4</b> of the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b> are larger than the wall thickness t<b>1</b> of the hollow member <b>253</b>. In other words, a relationship t<b>1</b>&#x3c;t<b>2</b>&#x3c;t<b>3</b>&#x3c;t<b>4</b> is valid. The stiffness of the front pillar <b>18</b>B can therefore be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0174">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b>, in the door opening <b>223</b> of the front pillar <b>18</b>B, the seal attachment section <b>245</b> has a plurality of gap channels <b>347</b>. In the front pillar <b>18</b>B, the gap channels <b>347</b> are arranged at a pitch Ph along a range Lh between the rear section reinforcing member <b>243</b> and the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b>. Specifically, a section of a flange surface <b>268</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>) of the first inner flange <b>268</b> of the inner panel <b>218</b> within the range Lh has an uneven shape. A concave part of the flange surface <b>268</b><i>a </i>has depth E. The uneven section of the flange surface <b>268</b><i>a </i>has a plurality of voids provided between the flange surface <b>268</b><i>a </i>and the first outer flange <b>282</b> of the outer panel <b>217</b>. The voids form the gap channels <b>347</b>. The depth of the gap channels <b>347</b> corresponds to the depth E of the concave part of the flange surface <b>268</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0175">As described above, the gap channels <b>347</b> are gaps that are formed so as to have a concave shape by plastic forming performed on the seal attachment section <b>245</b>. Therefore, a large number of gap channels <b>347</b> (gaps <b>347</b>) can be provided along the range Lh. Also, the flanges <b>268</b>, <b>282</b> are joined to each other between adjacent gap channels <b>347</b>. The joined portion is referred to as an inter-channel joint section <b>346</b>. The presence of the inter-channel joint section <b>346</b> makes it possible to ensure that the stiffness of the front pillar <b>18</b>B is adequate, even though the seal attachment section <b>245</b> is provided with the gap channels <b>347</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0176">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, each of the gap channels <b>347</b> functions as a channel between the closed void section <b>331</b> and an exterior, and is used when performing surface treatment on the front pillar <b>18</b>B. Specifically, when a surface treatment is performed on the front pillar <b>18</b>B, the front pillar <b>18</b>B is immersed in an electrodeposition liquid stored in a liquid tank. The electrodeposition liquid in the liquid tank flows through the gap channels <b>347</b> and into the void section <b>331</b> as shown by arrows b<b>1</b>, b<b>2</b>. The amount of the electrodeposition liquid that flows is sufficient for coating a wall surface of the front pillar <b>18</b>B within the void section <b>331</b>. Therefore, the wall surface of the front pillar <b>18</b>B within the void section <b>331</b> is sufficiently coated by the inflowing electrodeposition liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0177">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 35</figref> through <b>37</b>, at a front end <b>372</b> (i.e., a terminal section <b>372</b>) of the hollow member <b>253</b>, the outer upper wall section <b>264</b> is indented towards the inner lower wall section <b>261</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). The indented section <b>173</b> is referred to as a first concave section <b>373</b>. The first concave section <b>373</b> is located lower than an upper surface of the outer upper wall section <b>264</b>. In other words, the first concave section <b>373</b> is set apart below the upper surface of the outer upper wall section <b>264</b> by a distance corresponding to the downward indentation.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0178">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35 through 37</figref>, a rear end of the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b> has an upper end portion that is folded towards the passenger compartment <b>34</b>. The folded portion <b>355</b> is referred to as an upper flange <b>355</b>. The upper flange <b>355</b> is a flat plate. An upper surface of the upper flange <b>355</b> is on a same level as (i.e., is coplanar with) an upper surface of the outer upper wall section <b>264</b> of the hollow member <b>253</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0179">A rear end portion <b>356</b> (i.e., a joint portion <b>356</b>) of the upper flange <b>355</b> is located above the first concave section <b>373</b>. Also, the rear end portion <b>356</b> is indented so as to overlap the first concave section <b>373</b> from above. The indented portion <b>356</b> is referred to as a second concave portion <b>356</b>. The rear end portion <b>356</b> is disposed further downwards from, and separated from, the upper surface of the outer upper wall section <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0180">As described above, the wall thickness t<b>4</b> of the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is larger than the wall thickness t<b>1</b> of the hollow member <b>253</b>, making it difficult to apply spot welding. Since the wall thickness t<b>4</b> of the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b> is large, the first concave section <b>373</b> can overlap and be adequately joined to the second concave section <b>374</b> by fillet welding. In other words, the thickness t<b>1</b> of the hollow member <b>253</b> and the thickness t<b>4</b> of the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b> are ideal for joining using MIG welding. Fillet welding forms a welded section <b>376</b> having an adequate joint strength. Also, since the thickness t<b>4</b> of the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b> is large, the terminal section <b>372</b> of the hollow member <b>253</b> can be adequately reinforced.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0181">Meanwhile, as described above, the second outer flange <b>275</b> of the outer panel <b>217</b> is a flat plate portion extending along the upper surface of the outer upper wall section <b>264</b> to the upper flange <b>355</b> of the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b>. Therefore, the windshield attachment section <b>275</b> (i.e., the windshield attachment flange section <b>275</b>) is disposed so as to extend from the hollow member <b>253</b> to the lower section reinforcing member <b>244</b>, and the windshield attachment section <b>275</b> and the front section reinforcing member <b>244</b> are overlapped with and joined to each other. The windshield attachment section <b>275</b> is located higher than the first and second concave sections <b>373</b>, <b>376</b>. Therefore, the windshield attachment section <b>275</b> does not interfere with the first and second concave sections <b>373</b>, <b>376</b>. Also, the windshield attachment section <b>275</b> does not interfere with the welded section <b>376</b>. Therefore, the windshield attachment section <b>275</b> can be made to have a flat configuration across its entirety. The windshield <b>215</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) can be readily and reliably attached to the flat windshield attachment section <b>275</b> using an adhesive or another common method of attachment, and the state of the attachment can be maintained to a sufficient degree.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0182">According to the present invention, instead of a substantially rectangular shape, the hollow member <b>25</b> may have a pentagonal or another polygonal closed section, or a circular cross section, as long as a closed cross section is present.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0183">In the second embodiment, the drain hose <b>124</b> was described as an example of a flexible linear member that is pulled out of the opening section <b>126</b> of the front pillar <b>18</b>A. However, this is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, and another flexible linear member such as a wire harness may also be pulled out of the opening section <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0184">Also, in the second embodiment, the stepped section <b>148</b> formed around the rim <b>126</b><i>a </i>of the opening section <b>126</b> may be configured so as to bulge towards the passenger compartment <b>34</b> from the lower panel section <b>135</b>, instead of bulging outwards in the vehicle width direction from the lower panel section <b>135</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0185" num="0185">The present invention is suitable for an automobile having a front pillar <b>18</b>, <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B in which an inner panel <b>29</b>, <b>133</b>, <b>218</b> is provided to a hollow member <b>25</b>, <b>131</b>, <b>253</b>.</p>
