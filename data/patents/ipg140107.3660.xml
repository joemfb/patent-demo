<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The location of an electronic device can be tracked and updated in order to provide a user of the device accurate directions from the user's current location to a target location, for various types of environments. Upon detecting a trigger (e.g., detecting a QR code or detecting an access point signal), an example device can switch from using a first type of positioning element (e.g., GPS) to a second type of positioning element (e.g., using accelerometers, QR codes, etc.) in determining the user's current location. By using the appropriate type of positioning element for each environment, the device may determine the user's current location more accurately. The device may provide an overlay (e.g., arrows) for displaying the directions over images captured from the user's surroundings to provide a more realistic and intuitive experience for the user.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">People are utilizing portable electronic devices for an increasing number and variety of tasks. Oftentimes, a user of an electronic device may want to obtain information regarding objects, persons, and/or locations in the surrounding areas. For instance, the user may want to obtain directions from the user's current location to a target location. However, it can be difficult to obtain accurate directions in certain situations. Because a device relying on a conventional global positioning system (GPS) can only approximate its location to +/&#x2212;20 meters, the device may not be able to effectively guide a user situated inside a limited space. Further, the accuracy of GPS determinations typically drops off when the user is inside a building, such that GPS directions can be even less useful trying to get from one location to another location within the building. Not only would it be difficult for the device relying on GPS to accurately determine the initial location of the device, the device cannot accurately track its position and orientation as the user moves about. Further, in some instances, the maps stored on the device may be out-of-date or incorrect, thereby increasing the overall unreliability of conventional methods.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In addition to the unreliability of the directions provided by the devices while using GPS, directions are currently provided to users in a way that assumes that a user of the device has some knowledge of the area and their position and orientation within it. For example, a device may show a user that she is currently located on a certain street, but fail to show whether she is facing east or west. This hardly intuitive interface makes it difficult for the user to know which direction to proceed and tends to force the user to engage in guesswork before getting on the right path.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Systems and methods in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure may overcome one or more of the aforementioned and other deficiencies experienced in conventional approaches to presenting guidance information on an electronic device (e.g., desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, smartphone, media player, personal digital assistants (PDAs), electronic book reading devices, etc.). In particular, various embodiments enable the electronic device to obtain and display information (e.g., directions to a particular location) regarding surrounding objects, persons, and/or locations to a user of the electronic device in an intuitive manner. For instance, the electronic devices of some embodiments may provide a three-dimensional view of the user's surroundings including superimposed symbols (e.g., arrows) that provide directional guidance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to present information regarding a user's surroundings, the device of some embodiments determines the user's current location. In some embodiments, such as where greater precision is not needed, the device may determine the user's current position by using the GPS receiver on the device or a triangulation of cellular signals. Some embodiments enable the device to accurately determine its current location by using other mechanisms, either separately or in conjunction with each other and/or a GPS receiver, for example, such mechanisms may include wireless access points, quick response (QR) codes, radio-frequency identification (RFID), near-field communication (NFC), orientation determining elements (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses) on the device, triangulation or similar combinations of two or more instances of any combination of the above, etc. By enabling the device to accurately determine and track its current location, the device may provide accurate directions and orientation information to its user, even when the device is indoors or otherwise unable to obtain conventional tracking signals.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The device of some embodiments uses different location-determining elements (e.g., wireless access points, QR codes) to accurately determine the current location of the device. Although in instances where the user is driving from a building to another, the device may use GPS to provide directions that are sufficiently accurate to the user, GPS may not provide enough precision when the user is trying to get from one location to another within a building or in high-density urban areas, etc. Some embodiments may provide a trigger (e.g., a QR code, an NFC tag, a broadcasted signal) that enables the device to switch from detecting one or more types of signals (e.g., GPS signals) to detecting other types of signals (e.g., wireless access point signals) in determining its current location.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">By enabling the device to use appropriate location-determining mechanisms in certain situations, the device of some embodiments may determine and present accurate position, orientation, and/or directional guidance to the user. In some embodiments, the device may present additional information regarding the determined current location, current orientation, the target location, and/or objects, areas, and persons along the way. For example, in addition to directions to a particular location, the device may present history and background information on the current/target location and information on objects and/or persons in the current environment.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some embodiments provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for a navigation application that provides information, such as directions, to a user. The GUI may display an overlay superimposed over a display generated from surrounding images or video captured by an electronic device. The overlay of some embodiments displays information relating to objects, persons, and/or locations within the surrounding environment. In some embodiments, the overlay displays directional guidance that enables the user to follow the directional guidance in an intuitive manner. For example, the GUI may display directional arrows overlaid on captured images of the floor of the surrounding to help direct the user to a particular conference room inside an office building.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Various other applications, processes and uses are presented below with respect to the various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>1</b>(<i>c</i>) illustrate an example situation <b>100</b> of a person <b>102</b> using an electronic device <b>104</b> to obtain information on persons, objects, and/or areas captured by the electronic device. In some embodiments, the electronic device captures images of the user's surrounding and provides information regarding those objects and persons in the user's surrounding. For instance, the device may provide background information regarding a person captured and identified (e.g., using image recognition) by the user's device in the vicinity. Some embodiments enable the device to retrieve mapping information regarding a particular area (e.g., a shopping center, an office building) and use the mapping information to determine and present related information on objects, persons, and areas close to the user's current location.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the mapping information may include location information regarding various objects, persons, and areas within the particular area. For instance, the location information regarding areas such as the different conference rooms, restrooms, offices within a particular office building may include the geographical coordinates of each of these areas. The mapping information may also include other information such as profiles of persons, usage of objects, and historical significance of each of the areas, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Upon obtaining access to the mapping information (e.g., by retrieving the information from a remote server, by accessing a map of the particular area stored locally on the device), the device may identify the user's current location, determine the desired information (e.g., information on a particular object in the vicinity, directions to a particular location within the area) and present the information to the user. In some embodiments, the device captures image information (e.g., video or at least one still image) from the user's surrounding to generate a display that includes images of the user's surrounding and an overlay that provides the information on, or directions relative to, the persons or objects in the user's surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates a user <b>102</b> using an electronic device <b>104</b> to obtain information on persons, objects, or areas in the user's surroundings. As mentioned, the device may determine the user's current location and use the mapping information to provide the desired information (e.g., directions to a particular location within the area) to the user. The device may capture one or more images from the user's surrounding environment to generate a two- or three-dimensional image of the user's surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The device might utilize at least one camera or other such imaging element (e.g., charge-coupled device (CCD), a motion detecting sensor, an infrared sensor, etc. part of the device or communicatively coupled to the device) that is either on the device or on another device (e.g., using imaging elements on other users' devices, using cameras in fixed locations, etc.) to capture image information over a range of angles around the device. For example, the device may capture information over a full 360&#xb0; range around the device. In some embodiments, the device may capture the surroundings with at least two cameras of the device to construct a two-dimensional or three-dimensional view of the user's surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As described, depending on the orientation and the angle at which the user is holding the device, as well as the direction at which the user is pointing the device, the device may generate different views of the user's surroundings. In some embodiments, the device may display a planar view or bird's eye view of the user's surroundings, similar to how conventional two-dimensional maps are displayed. Some embodiments may generate a display that includes three-dimensional images captured from the surroundings. In some instances, the device displays images in a way as if the user were looking through a window, enabling the user to see an augmented reality of the user's surroundings on the display screen of the device. In this example, the user <b>102</b> is holding the device <b>104</b> with the display element of the device facing the user and the back of the device facing a hallway, enabling the device to capture images using the side and back cameras of the device in order to present a virtual reality of the user's perspective of the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates an example of what the user of the electronic device might see on a display screen <b>106</b> of the device <b>104</b> when the user is holding the device upright with the display screen substantially facing the user and another face of the device facing a hallway in some embodiments (i.e., held substantially perpendicular to the floor). By holding the device in an upright manner in at least some embodiments, the device can act like a window whereby the user can see objects &#x201c;through&#x201d; the device using images captured from the one or more cameras of the device (e.g., the side and back cameras). As shown, the device displays a three-dimensional virtual reality of the surrounding environment that the user sees (i.e., a 180&#xb0; range around the user from one side to the other). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>), however, the device also can overlay graphical elements or directional information over the displayed image information as discussed later herein. In such a situation, the user can effectively have directions presented &#x201c;over&#x201d; the user's current view, providing easily understandable directions based on the user's current environment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>c</i>) illustrates what the user of the electronic device <b>104</b> sees on the display screen <b>106</b> of the device when the user is holding the device substantially parallel to the floor (e.g., within a threshold angle). In some embodiments, the device displays a two-dimensional view (e.g., bird's eye view) of the user's location within the area and the desired information (i.e., directions to a particular location within the area). Some embodiments display the two-dimensional view when the device is held at certain angle (e.g., within 45&#xb0; range from the floor). In this example, the display screen <b>106</b> displays a two-dimensional view of an area (e.g., an office) indicating the user's current location and directions <b>108</b> to a particular location <b>110</b> (e.g., a restroom).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the device displays the three-dimensional view when the device is held beyond a threshold angle (e.g., the device is held at an angle exceeding 45&#xb0; from being parallel to the floor). The device may alternate between the two- and three-dimensional view of the user's surroundings as the user holds the device differently (e.g., displaying a three-dimensional view when the device is tilted at an angle where the back camera(s) of the device may capture the user's surroundings and displaying a two-dimensional view when the device is held within a threshold angle (e.g., +/&#x2212;20&#xb0;) where the back camera(s) is substantially facing the floor). In some embodiments, the device may not switch between the two views and continue to display a three-dimensional view of the user's surrounding regardless of the angle of the device (e.g., by enabling the device to capture the surrounding images using cameras that are on the rim or the side of the device as opposed to the back of the device when the device is tilted beyond a certain angle).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the device may display information regarding various objects and persons within a particular area, some embodiments enable the device to display directional guidance to a user of the device in an intuitive manner. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>2</b>(<i>e</i>) illustrate an example situation <b>200</b> of a user of an electronic device <b>204</b> activating a navigation feature that enables the device to guide the user toward a location in an intuitive manner. In some embodiments, the user of the electronic device may activate the feature upon entering a premise (e.g., a shopping mall, an office building, a hospital) by manually selecting to activate the feature (e.g., through a selectable user interface item, through a toggle of a component on the device). In other embodiments, a device might automatically activate this mode or application when detecting an element associated with a location, such as a QR code at the entrance of a building or base station signal from within a location. Some embodiments enable the user to download mapping information prior to approaching the premise (e.g., at home, in the parking lot of the shopping center), or upon entering the premise, through a network connection (e.g., via wireless Internet, intranet). If the device communicates with a WiFi hotspot, for example, the device can determine the appropriate mode by detecting the hotspot and also obtain the necessary mapping information from that hotspot if not already stored on the device. In at least some embodiments, the mapping information can also be updated as necessary when communicating with one of the hotspots associated with a location.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>), the user <b>206</b> has manually activated the navigation feature by selecting a selectable user interface item <b>202</b> (e.g., a button) on the device <b>204</b>. The selectable user interface item may be an application icon in some embodiments. Some embodiments enable the user to activate the navigation feature through a preference setting of the device. In some embodiments, the user manually activates the navigation feature, enabling the device to detect and receive mapping information when the navigation feature is activated. Some embodiments enable the device to receive the necessary information (e.g., mapping information) prior to activating the feature. In such instances, the device then uses the necessary information when the navigation feature is later activated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates that upon activation of the navigation feature, the device <b>204</b> of some embodiments downloads mapping information <b>208</b> of the premise (e.g., through a network connection). As described above, some embodiments may download the mapping information prior to activating the navigation feature. Some embodiments push mapping information to the user's device upon an event. In one example, a remote server may push a hospital map and additional information regarding the hospital to a user upon the user making a doctor's appointment. In another example, some embodiments may push shopping mall information (e.g., map of the shopping center, advertisements from stores within the shopping center, operating hours) to the user's device when the user approaches the shopping mall's parking lot (e.g., by detecting the user's device through a network connection).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some embodiments enable the device to download the mapping information by accessing a cloud server that includes the mapping information (e.g., through a network connection, when directed to a network address upon scanning a QR code, an NFC tag, a broadcast WiFi signal, etc.). In some embodiments, the device may access the information at the cloud server so that the device needs not download the information onto the device itself.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In various embodiments, mapping information for a particular area (e.g., a shopping mall, an office building, a school, a city) may include geographical coordinates of certain objects or locations within the particular area, the location of items with respect to other items within the particular area (e.g., map of the conference rooms with respect to office individual's mobile devices), etc. In some embodiments, the mapping information also includes additional information for the particular area, such as the company directory for a particular company or descriptions of each section within a museum, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As mentioned, mapping information for a particular area (e.g., a shopping mall, an office building, a school, a city) may include location information of objects (e.g., mobile devices, printers/copiers) and locations (e.g., bathrooms, kitchens, offices, conference rooms, etc.) within the particular area (e.g., geographical coordinates of objects and locations or the position of certain items with respect to other items). For example, mapping information of a shopping center may identify the location of different stores, the bathrooms that are in the vicinity, the food courts, the ATMs, etc. In another example, mapping information of an office building may identify the location of each person's office, the conference rooms, the bathrooms, the kitchens, the vending machines, a location of a conference room with respect to various offices or mobile devices, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition to location information, mapping information may include additional information regarding objects and persons within the area. For instance, the mapping information may include information such as the operating hours of the different stores within the shopping center, the types of food items that are within a vending machine, the company directory for a particular company, descriptions of each section within a museum, etc. Further, in some embodiments, the mapping information may include predetermined best route from one location to another.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some instances, the mapping information is created and maintained by an individual or an organization that has an interest in providing users (e.g., customers of a shopping center, visitors of an office building) an accurate and updated version of the mapping information. In some embodiments, the mapping information is constantly updated &#x201c;in the cloud&#x201d; so that users may obtain access to updated information through a network connection whenever desired. For instance, the mapping information of some embodiments includes location information of multiple mobile devices within a particular area. By having access to mapping information that is updated in real-time enables a user to be able to monitor the location and constant movement of multiple mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, prior to having access to mapping information, the device requests for user permission in order to be able to download or access the mapping information (e.g., by presenting to the user a prompt for confirmation). Some embodiments present this request upon a trigger, such as when the user is within a threshold distance of a particular premise (e.g., 20 ft. radius of around the convention center), or when the user's device detects a locally originating trigger such as a WiFi broadcast signal announcing the availability of mapping information. Some embodiments automatically download or obtain access to mapping information (e.g., through a network connection) upon the user's activating the navigation feature. In such instances, the device may detect and/or actively retrieve the mapping information upon the activation of the feature.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>), the device <b>204</b> presents a request <b>208</b> as to whether the user <b>210</b> would like to download the mapping information. Upon receiving confirmation to download the mapping information (e.g., by selecting a user interface item), the device may download the information from a remote or on-premises server (e.g., through a network connection). Some embodiments enable the device to obtain access to the mapping information by having the device scan a QR code, by enabling the device to obtain the information through another NFC device, etc. As mentioned above, the user may also obtain access to the mapping information by accessing a remote or local server without having to download the mapping information onto the device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>) illustrates that upon activating the navigation functionality, the user of the device may request for navigation information to a particular person, location, or object. In some embodiments, the device provides a user-editable entry field that enables the user to input a specific location, object, or person to which the user would like to be directed. The user may then input (e.g., via keystroke, via a cursor selection) the desired target destination, the person whom the user wants to locate, and/or the object to which the user would like to have access. Some embodiments may present the user with a menu of categories of destinations, objects, and/or people, allowing them to conveniently select the mapping target without entering text. Some embodiments enable the device to determine the location of the person, location, or object and the directions by using the mapping information.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the device determines the location of a person by locating the person's mobile device (e.g., the person's smartphone). Some embodiments use the mapping information that is updated in real-time to find the location of the person. In some embodiments, the device may use an algorithm to determine the location of the person (e.g., by factoring the length of time that the device has been immobile and within the person's designated office).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this particular instance, the user has requested to search for the nearest restroom (i.e., by inputting the request into a search box <b>212</b>). The device of some embodiments performs a search and presents a list of search results from which the user may select. In some embodiments, the device determines a best route by finding the path between the two points that has the shortest distance. Some embodiments take various parameters into account (e.g., traffic, the number of gates, the speed limit if any, the number of floors one must travel, within a particular distance, etc.) in determining the best route. The device may factor in the different parameters when determining the best route and display the different options to the user along with the estimated times and distances. The user may then select which route to take by assessing the options.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some embodiments may automatically select the best route without having the user select from a list of search results (e.g., when one route is significantly better than the others). In some instances, the user may narrow the search results by indicating personal preferences (e.g., not having to walk outdoors, taking local streets instead of the freeway, taking a scenic route, taking a route that does or does not pass by certain locations, objects, and/or persons) either before or after the user's initial search request.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the device does not permit the user to make a general search, but displays a list of options from which the user may select. The list of options (e.g., locations, objects, and/or persons) presented to the user may vary in accordance with the level of clearance granted to the user (e.g., by an administrator of the premise). The administrator of a premise may designate different clearance levels for different persons. For instance, a company may only want to disclose information that is not considered confidential (e.g., the location of the bathrooms, the location of selected conference rooms, etc.) to visitors whereas employees may receive mapping information that may provide more information regarding the premise (e.g., the lab location where certain experiments are being performed, the office location of high profile personnel within the building).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>d</i>) illustrates that upon a request for directions to a particular location (e.g., the nearest restroom), the device <b>204</b> displays a two-dimensional map <b>214</b> that shows an overview of the path <b>216</b> in getting from the user's current location <b>218</b> to the target location <b>220</b>. As shown in this figure, the device displays an overview of the route that takes the user from the user's current location to a target location. The overview map view enables the user to obtain an overall sense of what the route encompasses (e.g., the number of turns, the total distance, the number of elevators and escalators the user needs to ride in order to arrive at the target location, the offices that the user may walk pass). As shown, the overview map indicates that the user may need to take two turns to reach the target location (i.e., the restroom in this case).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, in addition to directions to the target location, the device may display additional features (e.g., in the form of additional selectable user interface items) that may be activated by the user (e.g., by selecting a selectable user interface item), such as the option to display the location of other mobile devices within the premise. The user of the device may use this information to assess the route options and determine whether to take other routes in order to bypass or to intercept or encounter certain things or persons that the user may otherwise encounter along the way. There may be functions that enable the user to adjust the current route if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>e</i>) illustrates the beginning of the navigational guidance as the user holds the device <b>204</b> such that the display element <b>222</b> of the device is substantially perpendicular to the floor. In some embodiments, the device displays three-dimensional directional guidance when the device is tilted beyond a threshold angle from the display element being parallel to the floor to being perpendicular to the floor. In this example, the device displays a three-dimensional view <b>224</b> of the user's surroundings along with an overlay that includes a symbol (e.g., an arrow <b>226</b>) for directing the user toward a particular direction. Some embodiments display three-dimensional directional guidance despite the orientation of the device. The display including the user's surrounding changes as the user tilts the device differently in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates embodiments of usages <b>300</b> of various location detection mechanisms in determining the location of an electronic device <b>304</b>. By being able to accurately determine the current location (e.g., the geospatial coordinates) of the electronic device, the device may provide accurate navigation information to the user (e.g., the distance and time from the current location the target destination). In some embodiments, the device may use different mechanisms to signal the device an appropriate mode (e.g., indoor mode, outdoor mode) in which the device should operate. By enabling the device to operate in the proper mode, the current location of the device may be more accurately tracked in some embodiments. For instance, by enabling the device to detect signals from wireless access points or similar devices (e.g., femtocells) and performing signal triangulation when the device is in an indoor location (e.g., within an office building, within a gym), the location of the device may be more accurately determined as opposed to using GPS to determine the location.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As mentioned above, the device of some embodiments receives a user request for directions to a particular object, person, or location. The device may then use the mapping information to locate the target destination and determine the directions from the device's current location to the target destination. The device of some embodiments uses one or more mechanisms to determine the location of the electronic device in order to provide the user with accurate directions from the user's current location (i.e., corresponding to the device's current location) to the target destination.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the electronic device <b>304</b> uses a location-determining element such as a GPS receiver (e.g., in the device or wirelessly connected to the device through a Bluetooth&#xae; connection) to determine the position or location of the electronic device (e.g., by receiving and analyzing signals from satellites <b>306</b>). Although in some situations (e.g., when determining what street the user is currently located, when determining which building entrance the user has taken, etc.) using GPS enables the user to obtain a fairly accurate and/or precise location information of the user's current position, it may be difficult in some situations (e.g., when the user is in a high density area) to accurately determine the user's location since the accuracy level is only up to +/&#x2212;20 meters in some instances. The device of some embodiments may then switch to using other location and/or orientation determining elements of the device such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, electronic compasses, etc. to track the user's movement.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the device uses inertial navigation sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes to track the user's movement and determine the user's position while indoors (e.g., use a software application to extrapolate the device's current location). Due to the drifts inherent to the system, the error in the estimate increases as the user's moves. Some embodiments may then use other mechanisms (e.g., signal triangulation, QR codes, etc.) to update or reposition a more accurate estimate of the current location.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Some embodiments utilize wireless access points (e.g., wireless routers <b>308</b>, femtocells, other mobile devices <b>312</b>, location beacons (i.e., devices whose sole or primary purpose is to broadcast a signal to be used in location and orientation determination), etc.) that are distributed throughout the indoor location to determine the user's location. In some embodiments, the location of the device is determined by triangulating the signals received from access points located in different parts of the indoor location. By detecting and analyzing the signals from access points, some embodiments may identify and verify the location of the user's device. The access points used in this manner may be all of the same type, or in some embodiments the device may simultaneously incorporate information from different types of sources or signals, combining the information via triangulation or other means. Some embodiments enable the device to determine its location by establishing a communication channel with other electronic devices (e.g., other smartphones) in a vicinity of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Some embodiments determine the user's location using other mechanisms such as QR codes <b>314</b>. The user may scan QR codes that contain location information to obtain an identifier, which the device may use to retrieve location information (e.g., by mapping the identifier to a corresponding location information in a lookup table). In some embodiments, the device may recognize QR codes (e.g., using a software application) that provide information regarding the user's location. Some embodiments may similarly obtain an identifier through scanning a barcode <b>316</b> and determine location information using the obtained identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The device of some embodiments may also determine location information by identifying surrounding objects (e.g., through image recognition and analysis) or by receiving audio signals (e.g., digital watermarks) from the environment. Some embodiments may match the identified objects in the user's surrounding (e.g., number on a door) with information in the mapping information to determine the user's current location. Different embodiments may use different mechanisms to determine and verify the user's location (e.g., RFID tags, NFC tags/devices, signal strength triangulation, devices that broadcast signals for this particular purpose, etc.). Some embodiments may use one or more of these mechanisms in conjunction to increase the precision in identifying the user's location.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As mentioned above, the various mechanisms may also be used to signal to the device the mode (e.g., indoor mode, outdoor mode) in which the device should operate. Upon detecting a signal from a particular mechanism (e.g., a QR code provided at a shopping mall concierge, an NFC device at the grocery store entrance, a signal broadcasted using a wireless access point), the device may switch from operating in one mode (e.g., using GPS signals to determine the device's location) to another (e.g., using QR codes, NFC tags, WAP signals, or orientation determining elements such as the device's accelerometer, to determine the device's location).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>4</b>(<i>c</i>) illustrate an example situation <b>400</b> of an electronic device <b>402</b> displaying navigation information in guiding a user to a particular location. In some embodiments, the electronic device displays the navigation information in a two-dimensional bird's eye view. Some embodiments display the navigation information in a three-dimensional view, using the images captured from one or more image capturing elements of the device to present a virtual reality of the user's surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) illustrates that upon determining the route in which to guide the user, the electronic device <b>402</b> displays on a display element <b>406</b> of the device the initial direction toward which the user should go (e.g., via an arrow <b>404</b>). In some embodiments, the device instructs the directions by displaying a symbol (e.g., an arrow, an animated bouncing ball) over the captured three-dimensional image of the user's surroundings. The symbol may point towards a particular direction in directing the user to proceed in the particular direction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this example, the user has selected to have the device direct the user to the restroom within the shortest distance. After determining the user's location and the restroom within the shortest distance from the user's current location, the device of some embodiments displays an overview of the route toward which the device will navigate the user. Other information <b>410</b> may also be displayed, such as the total distance between the user's location and the target location, the estimated time it may take the user (e.g., by foot, by car, by train, or a combination of different manners of transportation), etc. Some embodiments may skip this step and start the navigation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates that upon detecting that the user has made a movement, the device <b>402</b> displays the next instructional step (e.g., via a directive arrow <b>412</b>). Some embodiments continually check whether the user has made a movement by continually updating the position of the user and then comparing the updated position with the previous position. In some embodiments, the device displays the next instructional step by displaying another symbol. In some instances, the device may display text or other types of information (e.g., an animation effect such as a rolling coin) that may direct the user toward a particular direction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this example, the device <b>402</b> determines that the user's position has changed and depending on the user's current position, the device displays another arrow <b>412</b> to show the user what direction to proceed in order to reach the target destination. By holding up the device, the user may continue to follow the directions given by the device. In this case, the device directs the user to make a left at the corner.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>) illustrates that upon directing the user to around the corner, the device <b>402</b> displays another symbol <b>414</b> directing the user to the target destination. Some embodiments display another symbol <b>410</b> to indicate that the final destination is within sight. Here, the symbol indicating the target destination is shown by a star <b>416</b>, indicating that this is the location that the user for which the user had specified to be directed. In addition to using mapping information to determine directions for a user of the device, the device may provide directional guidance by taking additional factors into account. For example, the device may determine a best path for a user while shopping in a grocery store by assessing the user's shopping list in addition to the mapping information received from the grocery store itself (e.g., through broadcast, through downloading from the grocery store's website, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example process <b>500</b> for determining the location of a user by determining the position of the user's mobile device in accordance with various embodiments. It should be understood for the various processes discussed herein that there can be additional, fewer, or alternative steps performed in similar or alternative orders, or in parallel, within the scope of the various embodiments unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Some embodiments keep track of the user's location in order to provide accurate and updated directions to a target location for the user. In one instance, the device of some embodiments may, as the user moves, update the user the amount of time needed before the user reaches the desired destination. In another instance, the device may reroute the user when the device detects that the user has gone off its given course.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some instances, using an electronic device's GPS is not accurate enough to determine the user's position within certain locations, such as when the user is indoor or in high-density urban areas. The device of some embodiments may use other or additional mechanisms (e.g., detection of indoor wireless access point signals, scanning of QR codes) to accurately determine the user's position.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example process performed by a user's electronic device (e.g., a smartphone). In this example, the position of the device is tracked by receiving one or more signals (e.g., GPS signals) from at least a first type of positioning element (e.g., GPS) in a first mode (e.g., outdoor mode) of the device <b>502</b>. Some embodiments use a device's GPS to determine the location of a mobile device. In widespread areas and outdoor locations, using the device's GPS is often enough for determining the user's approximate location. For example, the device may determine which entrance (e.g., south, east, north, west) the user took to enter a particular building by using the device's GPS. In some instances, the mobile device may receive other types of signals such as cellular signals (e.g., from cellular base stations) and Wi-Fi signals (e.g., from wireless access points) in determining the mobile device's position (e.g., by signal triangulation methods).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A second type of positioning element may be detected upon entering a particular area <b>504</b>. Some embodiments enable the mobile device to detect a positioning element (e.g., wireless access point(s), QR code(s), RFID tag(s), femtocell(s), wireless router(s), NFC tag(s)) upon entering an area (e.g., a building, a company, a shopping center, a school). For instance, upon entering a shopping center or a supermarket, the user may cause the device to contact a near field communication (NFC) device or an NFC tag, cause the device to scan a QR code, cause the device to receive an RFID signal, cause the device to receive a signal from an access point, etc. One of ordinary skill would recognize that the positioning element detected by the device may be elements other than QR codes, wireless access points, etc. that can perform data exchange with the user's electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In response to detecting the second type of positioning element, the electronic device may be automatically switched to operate in a second mode wherein the position of the device is able to be tracked at least in part by detecting one or more positioning elements of the second type within the area <b>506</b>. As mentioned above, the second positioning element of some embodiments may be a wireless access point, a QR code, an RFID tag, etc. The electronic device may be automatically switched to operate in a different mode (e.g., an indoor mode, a city mode, a walking mode) upon detecting the second type of positioning element.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Some embodiments pre-configure the device such that the device may recognize and distinguish between the different types of positioning elements. The device of some embodiments may operate in a different mode when different positioning elements are detected. Some embodiments determine the type of mode to operate upon detection of a certain type of positioning element using a pre-configured lookup table. In some embodiments, the user may configure the device to switch to a different mode upon detection of a particular signal or may specify a ranking of types of positioning elements in an order of the user's preference.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Some embodiments track the position of the electronic device by detecting one or more positioning elements of the second type within the area. The positioning elements may enable the device to obtain various information (e.g., location information, map information) regarding the device's current location. For instance, the device may determine its location by triangulating signals from multiple access points. In another instance, the device may receive an identifier by receiving an RFID signal from an RFID tag at a particular location and then be able to map the identifier to location information. Other instances include enabling the device to obtain its coordinates by scanning a QR code.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this example, the position of the device is tracked using at least one orientation determining element of the device when at least one positioning element of the device is unable to be detected <b>508</b>. In some instances, the device uses orientation determining elements of the device, such as accelerometers, electronic gyroscopes, electronic compasses, motion sensors, level sensors, etc., to track the position of the device or make some type of determination relating to at least one of a position, orientation, and movement of the device. Some embodiments enable the device to use a combination of one or more orientation determining elements of the device and one or more positioning elements in the environment to determine the position of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Further, in some embodiments, an orientation determining element of the device may be a video recognition component of the device. Recognizing objects, locations, persons in one or more captured images (e.g., still or video images) enables the device of some embodiments to determine location information for the device. In instances where at least one positioning element is unable to be detected (e.g., due to being in an area with little reception), the device may activate and/or utilize at least one orientation determining element of the device to track the position of the device or estimate the location of the device from an initial starting point.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The tracked position of the device as determined using the at least one orientation determining element is updated upon subsequent detection of positioning element of the second type within the area <b>510</b>. Some embodiments may update the tracked position of the device using one or more positioning elements in order to adjust for drift and other errors. In some embodiments, the estimated location error increases as the user continues to use orientation determining elements such as accelerometers and gyroscopes of the device to keep track of the device's movement. As mentioned above, positioning elements may include QR codes, RFID, wireless access points (e.g., other mobile devices), etc. Upon detecting position elements of the second type (e.g., as configured by a user or pre-configured by a manufacturer), the tracked position of the device may be updated to a more accurate location.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example process <b>600</b> of enabling an electronic device to provide directions to a user through a display element of the device. It should be understood that other types of information can be displayed as well. In this example, an initial location of the electronic device is determined where the initial location corresponds to a current location of the electronic device at an initial point in time <b>602</b>. Some embodiments determine the initial location of the device upon receiving a request for directions to a particular location. The initial location of the device may be determined using various mechanisms, such as GPS on the device, signal strength triangulation, scanning a QR code, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Directions from the initial location to a target location within an area is determined <b>604</b>. In some embodiments, the device may determine one or more routes from the initial location to the target location using mapping information. As described above, mapping information for an area may include location information of objects or persons within the area. For instance, mapping information for a shopping center may include information on where a consumer can find a certain item, the location of the individual stores, etc. In another instance, mapping information for an office building may include information on where each person's cubicle is located, the location of the bathrooms and conference rooms, etc. In addition to location information, mapping information of some embodiments may also include other information regarding the objects and persons within the area, such as general information on the objects and background profiles of persons. In some embodiments, the device may present a number of routes to a user. The user may then select a desired route from the multiple routes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Then, image information of at least a viewable portion of the area around the device may be captured using at least one imaging element of the device <b>606</b>. The at least one imaging element of the device (e.g., a camera of a smartphone) may capture images over a wide range of angles, such as 180&#xb0; or more of the environment around the device. Some embodiments may capture image information using the side cameras of a device, the back camera(s) of the device, or a combination of cameras situated differently on the device to capture different angles of the environment. In some embodiments, the image information may be captured by other imaging elements of the device in addition to or other than the cameras of the device. In some embodiments, the image information may be captured by imaging elements of other devices, which may be mobile devices in the area and/or fixed-location imaging devices which make the image information available.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, the image information may include still or video images in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the device may construct a three-dimensional image simulating the user's current environment (e.g., a virtual reality of the user's current environment) using the captured image information. Some embodiments enable the device to use the mapping information in conjunction with the image information in constructing the virtual reality for display on the display element of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A composite display including an overlay representing at least a portion of the generated directions over at least a portion of the captured image information may be displayed <b>608</b>. The device of some embodiments may display, on a display element (e.g., display screen) of the device, a composite display that directs the user to the desired location. The overlay may be a symbol (e.g., an arrow), a text, and/or an animated effect (e.g., a bouncing ball, animated representation of a person or creature, etc.) that direct the user toward a particular direction. As mentioned, some embodiments display the captured imaged information of the user's environment in a three-dimensional view on the display screen of the device. Displaying an overlay (e.g., an arrow) that represents at least a portion of the generated directions (e.g., the next turn, the next move) enables the user to follow the directions in an intuitive manner that may be easily understood.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In this example, the current location of the device is updated in response to detecting one or more positioning elements with respect to the area <b>610</b>. Upon detecting one or more positioning elements, such as access points, QR codes, NFC tags, etc., the device of some embodiments may update the current location of the device. As the user moves from the initial location toward a direction, the current location of the device changes. In order to provide the user with updated directions (e.g., the amount of time still needed to reach the destination, the distance between the user and the destination), the device of some embodiments must keep track of the user's current position. Moreover, the device may keep track of the device's current location so that the device may inform the user when the user has gone off course.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The overlay in the displayed composite display is updated to include at least a portion of the generated directions from the updated current location to the target location <b>612</b>. As the user progresses towards a certain direction indicated through the overlay, the device of some embodiments updates the overlay that includes at least a portion of the generated direction based on the user's current position. The portion of the generated direction may be a portion that indicates to the user to go straight for 30 ft or a portion of the directions that indicate to the user to take a right turn at a corner, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The overlay is updated to provide an interactive and intuitive display to the user in directing the user toward a particular location. In some embodiments, the overlay may display information other than directional guidance, such as information regarding a specific item or person that is captured in the background. As mentioned, the device of some embodiments may utilize the mapping information that includes information about objects, persons, and/or locations within the area to display additional information about those objects, persons, and/or locations within the captured images.</p>
