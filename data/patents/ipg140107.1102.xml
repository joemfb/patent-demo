<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application JP 2008-009766 filed in the Japan Patent Office on Jan. 18, 2008, the entire contents of which is being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to a remote control apparatus for controlling an electric apparatus and a communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In related art, a television receiver which can be connected to the Internet is available. For example, a technique is known wherein a signal including URL (Uniform Resource Locator) information of a network service relating to a television broadcasting program is multiplexed with and transmitted together with a television image signal and a television broadcasting receiver for receiving the signal establishes a connection to an access point corresponding to the URL through the Internet to receive data and outputs and displays a corresponding homepage to and on a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube). The technique is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 9-162818.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, another technique is known wherein a television receiver which can be connected to the Internet uses information recorded on an information recording medium such as an IC (Integrated Circuit) card to carry out various data processes on the Internet. The technique is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-67412.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In such a television receiver which can be connected to the Internet as described above, an IC card is brought to a position in the proximity of a reader/writer built in or externally connected to a television apparatus body, and information which is read out from and/or is to be written into the IC card is transferred through the Internet. For example, where a user downloads and enjoys a content such as a movie or a playing game, an IC card is brought to a position in the proximity of the reader/writer and information recorded in the IC card is sent through the television receiver to pay a purchase price of the content. On the other hand, when the user carries out a normal operation for a television receiver such as sound volume adjustment or channel changeover, an operation instruction is inputted to a remote control apparatus or remote controller placed at a location spaced by a predetermined distance from the television receiver and is sent to the television receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this instance, although a normal operation instruction to the television receiver is inputted by operation of the remote control apparatus, where an IC card is applied to the television receiver for purchase of a content or the like, the user must bring the IC card to the television receiver, and this is not good in convenience in use to the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, a possible direction is to provide a remote control apparatus with a reader/writer which carries out reading out and/or writing of information from and into an information recording medium such as an IC card in order that a processing operation, in which the information recording medium is used, for payment of a price or the like through the Internet communication can be carried out using the remote control apparatus at hand at a position spaced away from a television receiver. However, a normal remote control apparatus is limited in the driving time period because it is driven by a battery, and if the remote control apparatus is provided with a reader/writer which consumes a great amount of power, then the driving time period is reduced further.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, it is desirable to provide a remote control apparatus for providing an operation instruction to an electric apparatus and a communication system including the remote control apparatus which implement optimum driving control even where the remote control apparatus is provided with a reader/writer which carries out reading out and/or writing of information from and into an information recording medium such as an IC card.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment, there is provided a remote control apparatus for communicating with an electric apparatus by radio communication, including a reader/writer for carrying out reading out and/or writing of information from and into an information recording medium, transmission/reception means for transferring a signal to and from the electric apparatus by the radio communication, and control means having a power control function for controlling the power of the reader/writer. In the remote control apparatus, the control means controls the reader/writer to the low power consumption state when the power supply to the remote control apparatus is made available.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment, there is provided a communication system including an electric apparatus, and a remote control apparatus for communicating with the electric apparatus by radio communication. The remote control apparatus includes a reader/writer for carrying out reading out and/or writing of information from and into an information recording medium, transmission/reception means for transferring a signal to and from the electric apparatus by the radio communication, and control means having a power control function for controlling the power of the reader/writer. In the remote control apparatus, the control means controls the reader/writer to the low power consumption state when the power supply to the remote control apparatus is made available.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With the remote control apparatus and the communication system, the reader/writer which consumes a great amount of power enters a low power consumption state when the power supply is made available. Consequently, reduction of the power consumption from that of a remote controller in related art when the power supply is made available can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a configuration of a communication system <b>1</b> according to an embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the communication system <b>1</b> includes a remote controlling apparatus (hereinafter referred to as remote controller) <b>100</b>, and a television receiver <b>200</b> which is an example of an electric apparatus which communicates with the remote controller <b>100</b> by radio communication.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The remote controller <b>100</b> includes a key operation section on which operation keys for inputting an operation signal based on an operation of the television receiver <b>200</b> by a user are arrayed, and a reader/writer for reading out and writing information from and into an IC card not shown. The television receiver <b>200</b> has a function as an ordinary television broadcast receiver and a function of establishing a connection to the Internet. The television receiver <b>200</b> can download a content such as a movie, an animation, a drama, a sports game, a playing game and so forth provided by a service provider through the Internet and reproduce the content.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As a short-distance radio communication method to be applied to the communication system <b>1</b>, a communication method is available which has a maximum data transfer rate of 250 kbps and a maximum transmission distance of 30 m and allows a large number of apparatus to be connected to one network and besides is low in power consumption. This short-distance radio communication method is applied to remote control of a domestic appliance and so forth, and the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) 802.15.4 is used as the interface for a physical layer and a carrier frequency band of the 2.4 GHz band same as that of the IEEE 802.11b of the radio LAN (Local Area Network) standards is divided into and used with 16 channels in Japan. It is to be noted that, in the United States, the 915 MHz band can be used, and in Europe, the 868 MHz band can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The remote controller <b>100</b> and the television receiver <b>200</b> carry out transfer of signals by bidirectional short-distance radio communication using a radio frequency (RF) signal of the carrier frequency of 2.4 GHz by the IEEE 802.15.4 communication method.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The IC card incorporates an IC chip which includes a rewritable semiconductor memory such as an EEPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory), a CPU (Central Processing Unit) and so forth, and can carry out complicated data processing. The IC card from and into which information can be read out and written by the remote controller <b>100</b> is formed from a contactless type IC card from and into which information can be read out and written without the necessity for contacting the same with the reader/writer of the remote controller <b>100</b>. The IC card thus utilizes radio waves oscillated from the reader/writer to carry out transmission and reception of a signal to and from the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Into and from the IC card from and into which information is read out and written by the remote controller <b>100</b>, information such as an electronic money which is processed for accounting upon purchase of a content or a personal identification number or a password for permitting accessing to an electric apparatus is written and read out.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a configuration of the remote controller <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the remote controller <b>100</b> includes an antenna <b>101</b> for communicating with the television receiver <b>200</b> by radio communication, an RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> for transmitting and receiving an RF signal through the antenna <b>101</b>, a CPU <b>103</b>, a memory <b>104</b> connected to the CPU <b>103</b>, a key operation section <b>105</b>, a reader/writer <b>106</b> for reading out and writing information from and into an IC card, an antenna <b>107</b> for carrying out electromagnetic interaction with the IC card, and a battery and power supply section <b>108</b> for supplying power to the components mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The reader/writer <b>106</b> carries out reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card using a technique of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). In particular, if current flows to the antenna <b>107</b>, then an alternating magnetic field is generated in the antenna <b>107</b>, and if the IC card moved to the proximity of a card information reading section of the reader/writer <b>106</b> placed in the magnetic field, then an AC voltage is induced in an antenna coil which the IC card has. This AC voltage is converted into a DC voltage in the IC card, and the IC chip operates with the DC voltage. Further, when electric current flows through the antenna of the IC card, a magnetic field is generated and has an influence on the antenna <b>107</b>. The reader/writer <b>106</b> carries out amplitude shift keying (ASK), frequency shift keying (FSK), phase shift keying (PSK) or the like for the carrier communicated with the IC card to carry out communication with the IC card. The reader/writer <b>106</b> uses such an electromagnetic induction method of the electromagnetic wave frequency of 13.56 MHz of the RFID as described above to establish magnetic coupling between the antenna <b>107</b> and the antenna of the IC card to carry out transfer of a signal to and from the IC card.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The key operation section <b>105</b> has various operation keys arrayed thereon for inputting various operation commands to the television receiver <b>200</b> based on an operation thereof by the user such as, for example, a channel selection key or keys, a sound volume key or keys and a determination key. Some of the operation keys are used also as keys necessary for processing in which information in the IC card is used.</p>

In other words, reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card carried out by the reader/writer <b>106</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> are controlled with a command received by the television receiver <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is to be noted that the television receiver <b>200</b> may further include a memory such as a HDD (Hard Disk Drive) which has a large storage capacity and allows rewriting such that a moving picture content desired by the user can be recorded into the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Now, communication operation between the remote controller <b>100</b> and the television receiver <b>200</b> in the communication system <b>1</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If the user operates any of the operation keys arrayed on the key operation section <b>105</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b>, then the CPU <b>103</b> decides that an operation instruction is inputted and outputs a corresponding command to the television receiver <b>200</b> through the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> and the antenna <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the television receiver <b>200</b>, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> discriminates the command acquired through the antenna <b>201</b> and the RF transmission/reception section <b>202</b> and carries out a control process corresponding to the command.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Where the user intends to purchase a content of a movie, an animation, a drama, a sports game, a playing game and so forth from the Internet, the user would carry out a necessary operation using the remote controller <b>100</b> while observing an operation screen image displayed on the television receiver <b>200</b> to select and determine a content to be purchased. The user would determine a method of payment using an IC card, and when the purchase price is to be paid, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> transmits information that communication should be carried out with the IC card to the remote controller <b>100</b> through the RF transmission/reception section <b>202</b> and the antenna <b>201</b> by the short-distance radio communication described above. The CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> switches on the power supply of the reader/writer <b>106</b> to cause the antenna <b>107</b> to generate electromagnetic waves necessary for reading out and writing of the IC card to carry out reading out of information stored in the IC card. The information read out from the IC card is transmitted to the television receiver <b>200</b> through the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> and the antenna <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The television receiver <b>200</b> transmits the information read out from the IC card to the corresponding server through the Internet. The remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> receives the information from the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> which receives a reply from the server and conveys the information from the server acquired by the set CPU <b>205</b> through the remote controller <b>100</b> by the short-distance radio communication through the RF transmission/reception section <b>202</b> to carry out reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card through the CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If such a procedure as described above is repeated several times until the payment process of the price using the IC card is completed and reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card become unnecessary, then the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> conveys information representing this to the CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> and the power supply of the reader/writer <b>106</b> is switched off.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, where the user carries out an ordinary operation such as sound volume adjustment, channel changeover or the like for the television receiver <b>200</b>, the CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> carries out a process only of transmitting an operation command corresponding to the inputting operation of the key operation section <b>105</b> by the user to the television receiver <b>200</b> through the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> and the antenna <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Thereupon, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> only carries out control corresponding to the operation command received from the remote controller <b>100</b>, but it is not always necessary for the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> to transmit a response signal to the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Accordingly, the power supply of the reader/writer <b>106</b> provided in the remote controller <b>100</b> remains in an off state and has no relationship to the operation in this instance.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, in the communication system <b>1</b>, since the remote controller <b>100</b> includes a reader/writer which uses the RFID communication method to carry out reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card, an operation for a process in which the IC card is used can be carried out at a position spaced away from the television receiver <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, in the communication system <b>1</b>, since the same communication method is used as the communication method in ordinary operation from the remote controller <b>100</b> to the television receiver <b>200</b> and the communication method for transmission and reception of information to and from the IC card, it is possible to prevent increase of the number of parts and increase of the cost by such increase of the number of parts without provision of a plurality of communication paths for different communication methods and to implement miniaturization of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, in the communication system <b>1</b>, since the power supply of the reader/writer <b>106</b> is in an off state during an ordinary key operation such as an operation for transmission of an operation command but is switched on only when reading out or writing of information from or into the IC card is required, it is possible to reduce the consumption on a battery.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is to be noted that, while, in the embodiment described above, the communication system <b>1</b> includes the television receiver <b>200</b> as an electric apparatus, it may include any electric apparatus which receives an operation command from a remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Now, arrangement and so forth of the components of the remote controller <b>100</b> having the configuration described above are described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> schematically shows an example of a front elevation of the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment. Meanwhile, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows an internal configuration of the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the remote controller <b>100</b> includes a box-shaped housing <b>10</b> including a front face cover <b>10</b><i>a </i>and a rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b</i>, operation key members <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>formed from a rubber material or the like and forming the key operation section <b>105</b>, and a board <b>12</b> disposed on the housing <b>10</b> and attached to the rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The front face cover <b>10</b><i>a </i>has a hole formed therein through which projections of the operation key members <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>to be operated by the user extend. The rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b </i>has an attaching portion not shown provided in the inside thereof such that the board <b>12</b> is attached to the rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b </i>through the attaching portion and accommodated in the rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b</i>. Further, the rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b </i>has a battery accommodating portion not shown provided thereon for accommodating a dry cell for the power supply. The battery accommodating portion is covered with a rear <b>11</b><i>d </i>which forms part of the rear face of the housing <b>10</b>, and when the dry cell is to be exchanged, engagement between a pawl portion of the rear <b>11</b><i>d </i>and the rear face of the housing is canceled thereby to allow the rear <b>11</b><i>d </i>to be opened.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The operation key members <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>have a power supply key <b>13</b>, selection keys <b>14</b><i>a </i>to <b>14</b><i>c</i>, an up/down channel selection key <b>15</b>, a sound volume adjustment key <b>16</b>, function keys <b>17</b>, and numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l</i>. The power supply key <b>13</b> is provided to control on/off changeover of the power supply of the television receiver <b>200</b>. The selection keys <b>14</b><i>a </i>to <b>14</b><i>c </i>include a ring-shaped direction key <b>14</b><i>a </i>having &#x201c;&#x2190;,&#x201d; &#x201c;&#x2191;,&#x201d; &#x201c;&#x2192;&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2193;&#x201d; marks indicated thereon for being operated in order to move a cursor displayed on the screen display section <b>207</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> based on a guide displayed on the screen display section <b>207</b>, a circular determination key <b>14</b><i>b </i>provided at a central position, and various display selection keys <b>14</b><i>c </i>for displaying a screen image of a program guide or the like. The up/down channel selection key <b>15</b> is used to increase or decrease the channel number for channel selection, and the sound volume adjustment key <b>16</b> is provided for adjustment of the sound volume. The numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>individually have numerals from &#x201c;1&#x201d; to &#x201c;12&#x201d; for channel selection arrayed at a substantially central location of the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, when the user wants to receive distribution of a content of a movie, an animation, a drama, a sports game, a playing game and so forth from a server of the Internet, the selection keys <b>14</b><i>a </i>to <b>14</b><i>c </i>are used to selectively determine a content or the like based on a guide displayed on the display screen of the television receiver <b>200</b> or in a like case. In particular, if a content selection screen image which includes a table of purchaseable contents distributed through the Internet is displayed on the display screen of the television receiver <b>200</b>, then the user would operate the direction key <b>14</b><i>a </i>disposed at a central portion of the remote controller <b>100</b> to move the cursor to a display position of the desired content displayed on the display screen. Then, the user would depress the determination key <b>14</b><i>b </i>at the displayed position of the desired content to determine the desired content to be distributed. Then, after a screen image for a purchase procedure is displayed, a purchase procedure of the content is entered online. Thereupon, if some change such as change of the content is required, then the selection key <b>14</b><i>c </i>on which &#x201c;return&#x201d; is indicated can be depressed to restore the content selection screen. In this manner, it is necessary to operate a selection key <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, in selection of a service or in a content purchase procedure through the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It is to be noted that the selection keys <b>14</b><i>a </i>to <b>14</b><i>c </i>are used not only upon provision of a service through the Internet but may naturally be provided as an operation system which is used in ordinary television operations of a television receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The up/down channel selection key <b>15</b> and the sound volume adjustment key <b>16</b> are operation keys having indications of &#x201c;+&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; marks thereon. If the &#x201c;+&#x201d; key is depressed, then the up/down channel selection key <b>15</b> can be operated so as to increase the channel number or the sound volume adjustment key <b>16</b> can be operated so as to increase the sound volume. On the other hand, if the &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; key is depressed, then the channel number is decreased or the sound volume is decreased conversely. It is to be noted that, when reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card are to be carried out, the up/down channel selection key <b>15</b> and the sound volume adjustment key <b>16</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> can be used as operation keys necessary for reading and writing processes of information. Details are hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>are operation keys for direct channel selection, and the numbers indicated on the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>individually correspond to channel numbers. Thus, the user would operate one of the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>which corresponds to a desired channel number to change the channel of the television broadcast to be received by the television receiver <b>200</b>. The location of the remote controller <b>100</b> at which the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>are disposed overlaps with a card reading section <b>20</b> of the IC card, and the antenna <b>107</b> of the reader/writer <b>106</b> is disposed on the same board face on which the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>are disposed. Details are hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The other function keys <b>17</b> include, for example, a screen changeover key for changing over the display screen image to a service provider selection screen image for receiving a VOD (Video On Demand) service, an input changeover key, a broadcast changeover key for selecting an analog broadcast or a digital broadcast, a recording key, a recording reservation key and so forth. However, the function keys <b>17</b> are not limited to those mentioned but are not required essentially.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the embodiment, the key operation section <b>105</b> is formed by forming projections on the operation key members <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>including such various operation keys as described above from a resin material or the like such that they can be depressed and attaching the operation key members <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>to the front face cover <b>10</b><i>a </i>which has holes formed therein such that the operation keys can be fitted therein. It is to be noted that the functions of the operation keys are not limited to those described above but are not essentially required. Further, naturally the types of the operation keys and the key arrangement on the remote controller surface are not limited to those described hereinabove, but various operation keys can be disposed on the remote controller surface.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">It is to be noted that, in the present embodiment, the state of the remote controller <b>100</b> when <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which shows a front elevation of the remote controller <b>100</b> is viewed squarely is hereinafter referred to as front direction of the remote controller <b>100</b>. It is to be noted that, when the user operates the remote controller <b>100</b>, the front direction of the remote controller <b>100</b> need not necessarily be directed toward the television receiver <b>200</b>, but, since an RF signal is used for communication between the remote controller <b>100</b> and the television receiver <b>200</b> as described above, it is possible to carry out radio communication with the television receiver <b>200</b> even if the remote controller <b>100</b> is directed in the opposite direction to the front direction.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The board <b>12</b> is attached to the rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b </i>which is a component of the housing <b>10</b> and includes an antenna <b>101</b> for communicating with the television receiver <b>200</b>, an RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> for transmitting and receiving an RF signal, a CPU <b>103</b> for controlling the remote controller <b>100</b>, a memory <b>104</b>, a circuit board of the reader/writer <b>106</b> for carrying out reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card, and an antenna <b>107</b> for generating and feeding a voltage for operating the IC chip in the IC card to carry out communication with the IC card.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> schematically shows an arrangement configuration of the components on the board <b>12</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> of the present embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> and the antenna <b>101</b> for communicating with the television receiver <b>200</b> are disposed at an end portion of the remote controller <b>100</b> in the front direction, and the circuit board of the reader/writer <b>106</b> for controlling reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card is disposed at a substantially central portion of the remote controller <b>100</b>. Meanwhile, the CPU <b>103</b> for controlling the remote controller <b>100</b> itself is disposed at a rear portion of the remote controller <b>100</b> with respect to the circuit board of the reader/writer <b>106</b>. Further, on the remote controller <b>100</b>, a loop antenna <b>19</b> formed in a loop shape from a lead wire is disposed as the antenna <b>107</b> of the reader/writer <b>106</b> in such a manner as to surround the location of the board at which the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>for direct channel selection are disposed. Furthermore, on the remote controller <b>100</b>, a battery serving as the power supply is disposed in a spaced relationship from the loop antenna <b>19</b> on the inner side of the loop antenna <b>19</b> in the form of a loop which corresponds to the antenna <b>107</b> of the reader/writer <b>106</b>. It is to be noted that the arrangement configuration on the board <b>12</b> is not limited to that described above.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The loop antenna <b>19</b> generates an alternating magnetic field for supplying power to and carrying out reading out and writing of information from and into an information recording medium such as an IC card. The loop antenna <b>19</b> is connected to the circuit board of the reader/writer <b>106</b> formed on the board <b>12</b> and functions as the antenna <b>107</b> of the reader/writer <b>106</b>. A signal received by the loop antenna <b>19</b> is transmitted to the CPU of the reader/writer <b>106</b>, and a current signal produced under the control of the CPU of the reader/writer <b>106</b> is supplied to the loop antenna <b>19</b> to carry out reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Here, on the remote controller <b>100</b>, the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>and the function keys <b>17</b> are disposed on the inner side of the loop antenna <b>19</b> provided at the end of the board in such a manner as to surround the board <b>12</b> as described hereinabove (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> or <b>6</b>). Accordingly, the location at which the loop antenna <b>19</b> is formed is used as the card reading section <b>20</b> for carrying out reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card, and by positioning the IC card in the proximity of the card reading section <b>20</b> at which a magnetic field is generated by the loop antenna <b>19</b>, reading out and writing of information are carried out by the reader/writer <b>106</b>. Then, the location described serves as an operation section of the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this manner, on the remote controller <b>100</b>, by forming the loop antenna <b>19</b> in such a manner that the lead wires pass the board end at an outer peripheral portion of the board <b>12</b>, the operation keys can be disposed on the inner side of the loop antenna <b>19</b> and can be disposed on the same plane as that of the card reading section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It is to be noted that, while, in the embodiment described above, a loop antenna is formed at an outer peripheral portion of the board <b>12</b> in such a manner as to be surrounded by the lead wires, also where a pattern formed from a copper foil or the like is formed at a location indicated virtually by an alternate long and short dashes line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an effect similar to that where a loop antenna is formed from a lead wire described hereinabove can be achieved. Further, in order to prevent deterioration of the antenna performance, more preferably the loop antenna <b>19</b> or <b>19</b><i>a </i>formed from a lead wire or a pattern is disposed in a spaced relationship by a distance as great as possible from any other pattern or electronic part.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In this manner, where the loop antenna <b>19</b> is disposed in such a manner as described hereinabove and the operation keys are disposed such that they overlap with the card reading section <b>20</b> when they are viewed in an orthogonal projection from above in the front direction of the remote controller <b>100</b>, the surface of the body of the remote controller <b>100</b> can be utilized effectively. Where the remote controller <b>100</b> is compared with such a remote controller, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> wherein it includes a card reading/writing section <b>30</b> but does not include numeric keys, easier remote controlling operation to the user can be anticipated.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, the remote controller <b>100</b> provides good convenience in use since the body thereof can be prevented from increasing in size, different from an alternative case wherein a card reading section and numeric keys are provided at different positions from each other. Further, since the loop antenna and the operation keys are disposed on the same board, the size of the board can be suppressed small and the fabrication cost of the board can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Further, since the remote controller <b>100</b> is configured such that the loop antenna <b>19</b> is formed from a lead wire or a pattern at an outer peripheral portion of the board <b>12</b> in such a manner as to surround the board <b>12</b> as described above such that information can be read out from and written into an IC card, a battery which forms the battery and power supply section <b>108</b> can be disposed on the inner side of the formed location of the loop antenna <b>19</b> without much disturbing electromagnetic waves generated from the antenna until it contacts with the loop antenna <b>19</b>. Consequently, the necessity for providing a space for disposition of a battery at a different position is eliminated, and the size of the remote controller can be reduced further. It is to be noted that, in this instance, more preferably the battery disposed on the inner side of the formed location of the antenna <b>107</b> which surrounds an outer peripheral portion of the board <b>12</b> is disposed at a location spaced by a remote absolute distance from the antenna, that is, at a central position of the antenna <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">It is to be noted that the battery which forms the battery and power supply section <b>108</b> is not necessarily disposed at the position described above, that is, on the inner side of the formed location of the loop antenna <b>19</b>, but may naturally be disposed at a spaced position on the outer side of the loop antenna <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, since the loop antenna <b>19</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> of the present embodiment is provided at the end of the board <b>12</b> in such a manner as to surround the board <b>12</b>, such a situation that the magnetic field is obstructed by a metal member disposed in the board is eliminated, and the range of the magnetic field generated from the loop antenna <b>19</b> extends to the rear face side (rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b </i>side) of the remote controller <b>100</b>, and not only reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card can be carried out from the front face side (operation key arrangement side) of the remote controller <b>100</b>, but also it becomes possible to carry out reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card from the rear face side of the remote controller <b>100</b>. This makes it possible to carry out an accounting process, an electronic settlement process or the like by holding up the card reading section <b>20</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> from the rear face side of the IC card placed on a table of a non-metal material also from the rear face side of the remote controller <b>100</b>. It is to be noted that, in this instance, an electronic part made of a metal which disturbs a magnetic field generated from the loop antenna <b>19</b> is not disposed below the loop antenna <b>19</b>, that is, on the rear face side of the body of the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It is to be noted that the loop antenna may otherwise be formed like a loop antenna <b>19</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref> show an internal configuration of the remote controller <b>100</b> according to another embodiment, and particularly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows a view of the remote controller <b>100</b> orthogonally projected from the front face side with the front face cover <b>10</b><i>a </i>removed; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows a schematic section of the remote controller <b>100</b>; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> shows the remote controller <b>100</b> orthogonally projected from the rear face side with the rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b </i>removed. More particularly, in the remote controller <b>100</b> of the present embodiment, a double-sided board having operation keys arrayed on a front face thereof has the loop antenna <b>19</b><i>b </i>formed in a pattern on a rear face thereof. The loop antenna <b>19</b><i>b </i>forms the card reading section <b>20</b>, and the operation keys are disposed such that, when they are orthogonally projected from above in the front direction of the remote controller <b>100</b>, at least one of them overlaps with the card reading section <b>20</b>. In this instance, the card reading section <b>20</b> is formed on the rear face side, that is, on the rear face cover <b>10</b><i>b </i>side, of the remote controller <b>100</b>, and if the user positions the card reading section <b>20</b> on the rear face side of the remote controller <b>100</b> with respect to the IC card, reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card are carried out by the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, if the material and arrangement or wiring of parts on the board <b>12</b> are taken into consideration, then reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card can be carried out also from the front face side of the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">By disposing the double-sided board formed from the board <b>12</b> on which the operation keys are arrayed and which has the loop antenna <b>19</b><i>b </i>formed in a pattern on the rear face thereof in the housing <b>10</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> and disposing the operation keys such that at least one of the operation keys and the card reading section <b>20</b> overlap with each other in such a manner as described above, the front face of the remote controller <b>100</b> can be utilized effectively and a sufficient number of keys and the card reading section <b>20</b> can be provided without decreasing the number of operation keys. Further, the user can operate the remote controller <b>100</b> by positioning the card reading section <b>20</b> on the rear face side of the remote controller <b>100</b> with respect to the IC card. Consequently, not all of the operation keys provided on the front face of the remote controller <b>100</b> are hidden by the IC card, and also operations necessary upon reading out and writing of the IC card can be carried out simply. It is to be noted that the loop antenna may be formed on a separate board and disposed in multi-layers with a board on which the operation keys are arrayed. Further, not a pattern may be formed as the loop antenna, but the loop antenna may be formed from a lead wire which is provided on the rear face of the board for the operation keys.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It is to be noted that, in this instance, if the battery which forms the battery and power supply section <b>108</b> is disposed in a spaced relationship from the loop antenna at a position different from the board at which the battery does not overlap with the board when it is orthogonally projected from above in the front direction of the remote controller <b>100</b>, then the influence of a metal portion of the battery on the loop antenna can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Now, a reading out/writing operation of information from and into the IC card in the remote controller <b>100</b> including the reader/writer <b>106</b> by the user is described taking a case wherein a content of a movie, an animation, a drama, a sports game, a playing game and so forth is purchased from a service provider of the Internet as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">When the user intends to purchase a content of a movie, an animation or the like from a service provider of the Internet, the user would carry out necessary operations for the remote controller <b>100</b> while observing a table of contents or an operation screen image displayed on the television receiver <b>200</b>. In particular, the user would operate a selection key <b>14</b> such as, for example, the direction key <b>14</b><i>a </i>having the &#x201c;&#x2190;,&#x201d; &#x201c;&#x2191;,&#x201d; &#x201c;&#x2192;&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2193;&#x201d; marks indicated thereon, to select a content to be purchased and then depress the determination key <b>14</b><i>b </i>to determine the purchase. Then, when the user determines a method of payment for the content using an IC card and tries to pay the price, the reader/writer <b>106</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> carries out a reading out process of information stored in the IC card and a writing operation of information into the IC card. Thereupon, the user would carry out the operations by holding up the IC card over the card reading section <b>20</b> provided on the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this manner, the user would carry out a purchasing operation of a content by operating the selection keys <b>14</b> while holding up the IC card over the card reading section <b>20</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The information read out from the IC card is sent to the television receiver <b>200</b> through the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> and the antenna <b>101</b> and is then sent from the television receiver <b>200</b> to the server through the Internet. The remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> receives a reply from the server and sends the information from the server to the remote controller <b>100</b> by the short-distance radio communication, and the CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> carries out reading out and writing of the information from and into the IC card. Then, the processes described above are repeated several times until the content purchasing process is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In related art, in such a purchasing procedure of a content of a movie or the like distributed through the Internet as described above, the user operates an IC card so as to be positioned in the proximity of a card reading/writing section of a reader/writer provided on a television receiver or a reader/writer connected to a television receiver by a USB (Universal Serial Bus) or the like to carry out reading of information stored in the IC card and so forth. Therefore, although channel control or the like of the television receiver can be carried out by an operation of the remote controller at a remote place, when reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card become required in a purchasing procedure of a content or the like, the IC card must be moved to an installation place of the television receiver and operated there.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the remote controller <b>100</b> of the embodiment described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, since the reader/writer <b>106</b> for reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card is provided in the inside of the remote controller <b>100</b>, the user can carry out operations for reading out and writing processes of information from and into the IC card by the reader/writer <b>106</b> by holding up the IC card over the card reading section <b>20</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> by hand similarly to operations for switching on/off of the power supply, channel selection and so forth of the television receiver <b>200</b>. Consequently, simpler and agreeable user operations can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Further, since the remote controller <b>100</b> is configured such that the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>having the indications of the numbers of &#x201c;1&#x201d; to &#x201c;12&#x201d; are disposed at a place same as that of the board on the inner side of the location at which the loop antenna <b>19</b> is formed, that is, at the same place as that of the card reading section <b>20</b> for executing reading out and writing processes of information from and into the IC card, when the IC card is held up over the card reading section <b>20</b> upon reading and writing of the IC card upon electronic settlement or the like, the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>are hidden by the IC card. As described hereinabove, upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card, the user would principally use the direction key <b>14</b><i>a </i>for selecting a content or the like, the determination key <b>14</b><i>b </i>for determining purchase of the content and so forth from among the operation keys of the remote controller <b>100</b> to carry out an accounting procedure. Accordingly, upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card, the frequency in which the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>which are hidden by the IC card when the IC card is held up are used is low, and such a situation that the operation of the remote controller <b>100</b> becomes inconvenient is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In this manner, in the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, even where the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>are disposed on the inner side of the location at which the loop antenna <b>19</b> of the reader/writer <b>106</b> is formed, the operation keys necessary upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card can be operated freely. In particular, since the operation keys which are necessary upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card by the reader/writer <b>106</b> such as the direction key <b>14</b><i>a </i>and so forth are disposed at a position at which they are not hidden by the IC card even if the IC card is held up over the card reading section <b>20</b>, the convenience in use by the user is not deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">On the other hand, when, for example, content purchase price setting, purchase quantity setting or like setting is carried out upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card, it may become necessary to operate the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>which are hidden by the IC card when the IC card is held up over the card reading section <b>20</b>. In such an instance as just described, if the user moves the IC card away from the card reading section <b>20</b> to stop the positioning of the IC card in the proximity of the card reading section <b>20</b> and then tries to depress the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>181</b>, then the magnetic field generated from the loop antenna <b>19</b> becomes ineffective upon the IC card, and the reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card by the reader/writer <b>106</b> are not carried out regularly any more. This may give rise to an unexpected trouble in the reading out and writing processes of information from and into the IC card in which electronic money information and so forth are stored.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Therefore, upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card by the reader/writer <b>106</b>, the CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> controls the operation keys disposed on the remote controller <b>100</b> so as to alter the functions allocated to them so that the user can carry out all operations necessary upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card using the alternative keys having the altered functions.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In particular, when the CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> recognizes upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card that the reader/writer <b>106</b> is placed into an on state, for example, the &#x201c;+&#x201d;/&#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; key portions of the up/down channel selection key <b>15</b> are automatically allocated to different functions of increasing/decreasing the amount of money while the &#x201c;+&#x201d;/&#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; key portions of the sound volume adjustment key <b>16</b> are automatically allocated to functions of operating increasing/decreasing of the quantity of goods to be purchased. Then, if the CPU <b>103</b> recognizes that the reader/writer <b>106</b> is placed into an off state, then it controls the operation keys to cancel the changed functions of them so that the operation keys may thereafter carry out the respective operation functions. Consequently, even if the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>which are hidden by the IC card when the IC card is held up over the card reading section <b>20</b> are not operated, it is possible, for example, to set the amount of money for purchase or set the quantity of items to be purchased by operating the operation keys which are not hidden by the IC card and have the respectively altered functions.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Since the remote controller <b>100</b> controls so that the functions of the operation keys are changed upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card by the reader/writer <b>106</b>, the functions of those operation keys whose operation is disabled by the IC card when the IC card is held up over the card reading section <b>20</b> can be executed by the alternative keys. Further, since the changing process of the operation key functions is automatically decided and executed by the CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b>, the operation process can be operated simply without imposing a cumbersome operation such as to use a mode key to change over the functions or to depress, while a shift key is depressed, an operation key simultaneously to change the function of the operation key upon the user.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">It is to be noted that, since the remote controller <b>100</b> can communicate with the television receiver <b>200</b> by bidirectional radio communication, when the function of an operation key is altered in such a manner as described above, upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card by the reader/writer <b>106</b>, for example, the CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> may carry out such control as to send a command for displaying a guidance for guiding an operation method of the remote controller <b>100</b> as a screen image to the television receiver <b>200</b>. This makes it possible for the user to carry out operations in accordance with the guidance by simple operations, and the user can eliminate such labor as to confirm an operation key whose function is altered while referring to an instruction manual.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Further, the remote controller <b>100</b> may include an LED (light emitting diode) which indicates, upon reading out and writing of information from and into the IC card, that the function of an operation key is altered. In this instance, since the function of the operation key may be changed over at a timing same as that of turning on or off of the reader/writer <b>106</b>, if the CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> detects turning on or off of the reader/writer <b>106</b>, then turning on or off of the LED can be controlled. Further, the turning on indication of the LED may serve also as an indication representing that the reader/writer <b>106</b> is operating.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Furthermore, since the remote controller <b>100</b> can communicate with the television receiver <b>200</b> by bidirectional radio communication and besides can grasp also turning on and off of the reader/writer <b>106</b>, the changed over state of the operation key may be displayed on the screen of the television receiver <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Now, a data format of transfer data communicated by short-distance radio communication using an RF signal between a remote controller and a device which is controlled from the remote controller and may be an electric apparatus such as a television receiver is described.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Between the television receiver <b>200</b> and the remote controller <b>100</b> described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the communication method in an ordinary remote controller operation and the communication method in transfer of information to and from the IC card are the same. For example, short-distance radio communication which uses an RF signal of the carrier frequency of 2.4 GHz by the IEEE 802.15.4 communication method. Further, between the television receiver <b>200</b> and the remote controller <b>100</b>, such data are transmitted and received using packets of the same format.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">More particularly, remote controller data, remote controller controlling commands and reader/writer commands are transmitted through packets of the same format. Here, the remote controller data are command data, that is, operation instructions to an electric apparatus, transmitted by the remote controller <b>100</b> and received by the television receiver <b>200</b> which is a device to be operated from the remote controller. The remote controller controlling commands are commands, that is, control commands to a remote controlling apparatus, used for setting, confirmation and so forth of a reader/writer function which the remote controller <b>100</b> has, and are data transferred by both of the remote controller <b>100</b> and the television receiver <b>200</b> as well as data reply data to which commands are transferred by both of the remote controller <b>100</b> and the television receiver <b>200</b>. The reader/writer commands are data transmitted from the television receiver <b>200</b>, which is a device to be operated from the remote controller <b>100</b>, and received by the remote controller <b>100</b>, and reply data to the commands are transmitted from the remote controller <b>100</b> and received by the television receiver <b>200</b> which is operated from the remote controller <b>100</b>. The reader/writer commands are command data for transmitting and receiving information to be written into and read out from an information recording medium such as an IC card which utilizes such RFID as described hereinabove where information is read out and written into the information recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In particular, the remote controller <b>100</b> sends remote controller data, remote controller controlling commands and reply data to such commands, and reply data to the reader/writer commands and receives remote controller controlling commands and reader/writer commands. The television receiver <b>200</b> which is a control target device to be controlled from the remote controller transmits remote controller controlling commands and reply data to them and reader/writer commands, and receives remote controller data, remote controller controlling commands and reply data to them, and reply data to reader/writer commands.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref> illustrate an example of a format of a packet for transmitting such remote controller data, remote controller controlling commands and reader/writer commands as described hereinabove. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref>, remote controller data, remote controller controlling commands and reader/writer commands are placed in command data cmdDATA in a packet for RF communication and are transmitted together with a header rfHID for RF communication for accommodating a parameter and so forth for RF communication, a footer rfFT for RF communication for accommodating a parity for an error check and so forth for RF communication and a command header cmdHD for accommodating a command type. The remote controller data, remote controller controlling command and reader/writer command can be distinguished from each other depending upon the command type placed in the command header cmdHD.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Here, the reader/writer command generally has a great data length and may possibly become longer than the length of a packet which can be transmitted at a time by RF communication. Therefore, transmission/reception of the reader/writer command is carried out using a format which allows division of a packet and merging of packets. Where division or merging is carried out, the data relating to the division to be placed into the RF communication header or the command header is only data which indicates whether or not the data is the last of division. As regards a reader/writer command, since retransmission is not carried out, there is no possibility that replacement of an order number may occur, and there is no necessity to carry out such management as to apply a packet ID. Further, where a parity is included in the reader/writer communication footer, even if data miss occurs during division, such data fault can be confirmed, and therefore, data transmission which eliminates complicated processing and surplus data transfer can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref>, it can be seen that the total length of the reader/writer command data rwDATA and the reader/writer communication footer rwFT (parity for an error check and so forth) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is longer than the length of the command data cmdDATA in the packet for RF communication illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref>. In particular, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref>, the reader/writer command data rwDATA and the reader/writer communication footer rwFT illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> are divided into two parts, which are placed into the command data cmdDATA in two packets for RF communication illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The remote controller and the device which is controlled by the remote controller in the present embodiment do not retransmit a remote controller controlling command. This is because, since it is not appropriate to use a communication path which provides unstable communication to enforce accessing for card settlement of accounts or the like for which the security is required and besides, where the communication is unstable, it is appropriate to notify the user of the reader/writer function from the beginning that the communication is unstable, it is not advantageous to rescue a remote controller controlling command by retransmission.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Further, the remote controller according to the present embodiment does not carry out retransmission management of a reader/writer command. Since a reader/writer command is generally greater than remote controller data, complicated buffer management for retransmission and memory compression by packet management based on an ID are avoided. Further, a reader/writer command has a determined directionality, and since the reader/writer command to be transmitted from the remote controller is limited only to reply data, the necessity for retransmission is low. Further, when the communication state becomes worse, since there is the possibility that retransmission of the reader/writer command from the remote controller overlaps with retransmission of a command from the device which is controlled by the remote controller which is the transmission side of a command and has a high allowance in its memory, the management can be prevented from being complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Now, a particular example of the data format for packet transmission described above is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref>, <b>10</b>B, <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> illustrate an example of the data format of signals transferred between the set CPU <b>205</b> and the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> in the television receiver <b>200</b> which is a device to be controlled by the remote controller. Meanwhile, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> illustrate an example of the data format of signals transferred between the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> in the television receiver <b>200</b> and the CPU <b>103</b> in the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates a particular example of the data format of a packet itself transferred between the set CPU <b>205</b> and the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> in the television receiver <b>200</b>. Of the packet illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, two bytes from the top are used for the header, and one byte next to the two bytes is used for the version. In the example described, the header always is &#x201c;abh, 25h&#x201d; (h represents a hexadecimal number), and while the version is &#x201c;10h,&#x201d; the version is not limited to this. The fourth byte from the top of the packet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> represents the category, and when it is &#x201c;e4h,&#x201d; it represents a command from the set CPU <b>205</b> to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b>, but when it is &#x201c;e5h,&#x201d; it represents a response from the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> to the set CPU <b>205</b>. The fifth to (n-1)th bytes are determined in response to the category, and the byte number or length is variable. The fifth to (n-1)th bytes are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. The last or nth byte of the packet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is a check sum (parity) of the data from the first to (n-1)th bytes of the packet.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates the fifth to (n-1th) bytes extracted from the packet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the top byte (fifth byte of the original packet) illustrated represents the length, that is, the data length, from the <b>6</b>th to (n-1)th bytes of the packet and can represent 01h (1 byte) to FFh (255 bytes). The next byte (sixth byte of the original packet) is a code representative of a data category, and the succeeding data, that is, the 7th byte to the (n-1)th byte of the original packet, are data of the data category. The data category may be reader/writer command data, remote controller controlling command data or the like. It is to be noted that the 7th to (n-1)th bytes of the packet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> correspond to the reader/writer command data rwDATA and the reader/writer communication footer rwFT described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9C</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The first to sixth bytes of the packet illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> are used as header information, and for example, the fourth byte represents control data representing the continuity and so forth of the packet. The fifth byte represents the data length from the succeeding sixth byte to the mth byte, and the sixth byte represents a code indicative of a data category. For example, the control data of the fourth byte may represent, when it is &#x201c;21h,&#x201d; that a following packet exists, but when it is &#x201c;22h,&#x201d; that the packet is the last packet, that is, that no following packet exists. The information of the data length of the fifth byte can represent 01h (1 byte) to 62h (98 bytes), and the maximum data length is smaller than 255 bytes which are a maximum length of the packet illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. Therefore, when the data length from the sixth byte to the (m-1)th byte of the packet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> exceeds 98 bytes, the packet is divided and distributed into a plurality of packets having the format illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. The information of the data category of the sixth byte of the packet illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> may be a copy of the sixth byte of the packet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. It is to be noted that the command data cmdDATA of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref> corresponds to data from the seventh byte to the mth byte of the packet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, and the portion from the first byte to the sixth byte of the packet corresponds to the command header cmdHD illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B and 9C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrates the sixth byte to the last mth byte extracted from the packet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the top byte illustrated, that is, the sixth byte of the original packet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, represents a data category. The one byte of the data category is allocated, for example, with the higher order 4 bits thereof, to a command code representative of a type of a command such as a remote controller controlling command, a reader/writer command or data for a remote controller, and with the lower order 4 bits thereof, to such a remote controller ID for identifying a remote controller as hereinafter described. If the data category represents that the succeeding data represents a remote controller controlling command, then the next byte, that is, the seventh byte of the original packet, represents a type of the command. The type of the command in this instance may be such a remote controller confirmation command, a remote controller power confirmation command, an on-state continuation command, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Therefore, in the present embodiment, a plurality of different remote controllers can be used for a device which is controlled from a remote controller, such as, for example, for a television receiver, and in order to identify the remote controllers, apparatus identification information, that is, a remote controller ID, is added to the commands described hereinabove. In particular, for example, part of the lower order 4 bits of the sixth byte, that is, the data command, of the packet illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, is used. The apparatus identification information is allocated separately from a unique ID of each remote controller and is at least added to and transferred together with a command to the reader/writer. The apparatus identification information may be allocated, for example, when a television receiver communicates with a remote controller after mutual authentication, that is, pairing, between the television receiver and the remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Popular infrared remote controllers are in most cases configured such that, only when a button or the like is operated, the power supply is made available and a command is transmitted as an infrared signal to a control object apparatus such as a television receiver and, after the transmission comes to an end, the power supply is interrupted. However, in such an RF communication remote controller as in the present embodiment, it is necessary for the power supply to be normally available in order to receive transmission data from the television receiver. However, where the power supply is normally kept in an on state, the power consumption increases, and therefore, appropriate power saving control is required. In this regard, not only power saving control of the remote controller itself is significant, but where the remote controller has a reader/writer, power saving control of the reader/writer is significant because the reader/writer exhibits particularly high power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the following, allocation of apparatus identification information where a plurality of remote controllers are used for a device such as a television receiver which is controlled by a remote controller is described. Then, power saving control of a remote controller itself is described, whereafter power saving control of a reader/writer where a remote controller includes the reader/writer is described.</p>

<p id="p-0217" num="0216">As described hereinabove, since the remote controller <b>100</b> is driven by supply of power from the battery and power supply section <b>108</b> and includes the reader/writer <b>106</b> which consumes a large amount of power in generation of electromagnetic waves, the power consumption of the remote controller <b>100</b> is very high.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment can be controlled so as to enter a low power consumption mode to enable low power consumption driving so that the power consumption can be suppressed low.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In the following, low power consumption control of the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment is described first in regard to processing operation for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into a low power consumption state and then in regard to processing operation for setting the reader/writer <b>106</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> into a low power consumption state.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">As described hereinabove, since the remote controller <b>100</b> is driven by supply of power from the battery and power supply section <b>108</b>, the power consumption can be suppressed low by enabling low power consumption driving. Normally, a characteristic of a remote controller is utilized to carry out a process of suppressing power consumption by setting the remote controller such that it operates only when an operation key thereof is depressed but is set to a low power consumption state in any other case. However, such a process as just described is not favorable for a remote controller like the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment which includes the built-in reader/writer <b>106</b> for carrying out reading out and writing processing of information from and into an information recording medium such as an IC card. In particular, since, from a characteristic of the reader/writer <b>106</b>, the timing at which a command is sent is known only to the electric apparatus side such as the television receiver <b>200</b> controlled by the remote controller <b>100</b> if the remote controller <b>100</b> enters a low power consumption state based on a decision of itself, then the remote controller <b>100</b> cannot receive a command sent from the television receiver <b>200</b> or the reading out or writing process of information from or into the IC card by the reader/writer <b>106</b> may be interrupted and result in failure. This may possibly give rise to an unintended trouble in an accounting process or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Therefore, the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment solves the problem described above by the following countermeasure. In particular, when an operation key provided on the remote controller <b>100</b> is operated, when an RF signal is received, that is, when a command is received from the television receiver, and when a command is received from the reader/writer <b>106</b>, a timer provided for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into a low power consumption state is started or reset, and a normal power state is maintained until a fixed interval of time passes.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In the following, an optimum driving control process for setting a remote controller which includes a built-in reader/writer or has a function of receiving a command from a television receiver to a low power consumption state is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 21</figref>. It is to be noted that, while it is assumed that the remote controller described particularly below has a reader/writer function in addition to a function for receiving a command from a television receiver, the driving control process into a low power consumption state described above can be applied not only to a remote controller which additionally has a reader/writer function but also, for example, to a remote controller which has a function of displaying information on a liquid crystal display screen provided on the remote controller in accordance with a command from a television receiver, to a remote controller which can receive a sound command from a television receiver and generate sub-voice or to a like remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The reader/writer <b>106</b> provided in the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment must be maintained in a command reception standby state so that it can receive a command transmitted from an electric apparatus such as the television receiver <b>200</b> and must continue to generate a magnetic field from the antenna after starting till ending of reading and writing of information in order to carry out communication for reading and writing of information from and into an information recording medium such as an IC card. Therefore, the power consumption of the reader/writer <b>106</b> is very high, and therefore, when the reader/writer <b>106</b> is not used, preferably the reader/writer <b>106</b> remains set to a low power consumption state. More preferably, not only in an ordinary operation process such as a channel selection process but also when the remote controller <b>100</b> itself is not used, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself is set to a low power consumption state to suppress the power consumption thereby to suppress the consumption of the power supplied from the battery and power supply section <b>108</b> to the reader/writer <b>106</b> and hence to suppress the power consumption by the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Generally, the user operates an operation key provided on the key operation section <b>105</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> to control an electric apparatus such as the television receiver <b>200</b> and use a reader/writer function of carrying out reading out and writing of information into and from an information recording medium such as, for example, an IC card. Accordingly, if a signal based on an operation key input of the remote controller <b>100</b> is not inputted, then none of command reception from the television receiver <b>200</b> and command reception from the reader/writer <b>106</b> occurs. Therefore, until an operation key input is carried out, the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> or the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself of the remote controller <b>100</b> is placed into a low power consumption state, and in response to an operation key input, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> is placed into a normal power state and a timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into a low power consumption state is reset. This is described particularly below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">At step S<b>31</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> starts setting for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into a low power consumption state. It is to be noted that the low power consumption state of the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> is carried out using a known technique. By setting the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state in this manner, the power consumption when the remote controller <b>100</b> is not used can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Then at step S<b>32</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides whether or not it receives a signal input based on an operation key input, that is, based on depression of a key provided on the key operation section <b>105</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b>. The operation key input includes not only, for example, an input from an operation key provided specifically for executing the reader/writer function but also operation key inputs by an ordinary operation of the remote controller <b>100</b>, that is, an operation key input of a channel changeover key for a television broadcasting program to be received by the television receiver <b>200</b> such as the numeral keys <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>l </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an operation key input of a sound volume adjustment key for adjusting the sound volume such as the sound volume adjustment key <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and a like operation key input.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">If the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> receives a signal input based on an operation key input at step S<b>32</b>, then the processing advances to step S<b>33</b>, at which the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> controls the power state so as to end the low power consumption state of the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself and now enter the normal operation state. On the other hand, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> does not receive any signal input based on an operation key input, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> maintains the low power consumption state of the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself. In other words, the processing operation at step S<b>32</b> is carried out repetitively until the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides that it receives a signal input based on an operation key input, and the signal input based on an operation key input serves as a trigger for starting the normal power state. It is to be noted that, even if the power state is controlled so as to change from the low power consumption state to the normal power state in response to an operation key input in this manner, since, if there is no input of an operation key of the remote controller <b>100</b> by the user, a command is not received from the television receiver <b>200</b>, there is no problem.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Since the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> ends the low power consumption state of the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself in response to a signal input based on an operation key input at step S<b>33</b>, the low power consumption of the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself is ended and the remote controller <b>100</b> is set to the normal power state. Then at step S<b>34</b>, a timer for counting a predetermined period of time for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> to a low power consumption state and a time number counter not shown which is hereinafter described are reset.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In this manner, the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment includes a timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into a low power consumption state after lapse of a predetermined period of time. Thus, the remote controller <b>100</b> does not enter a low power consumption state immediately after an operation key input is received but enters a low power consumption state after the predetermined interval of time elapses, and to this end, the timer is reset first and then starts counting. This process prevents such a situation that the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> enters the low power consumption state immediately after an operation key is operated for inputting and cannot regularly receive a command sent from the television receiver <b>200</b> or the reader/writer <b>106</b>. Then, within the predetermined period of time, the normal power state is maintained so that the remote controller <b>100</b> can normally receive a command such as a power confirmation command or a function confirmation command sent from the television receiver <b>200</b> or the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Then at step S<b>35</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides whether or not the timer for entering the low power consumption state reaches predetermined set time. Then, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides time-up of the preset time, then it carries out setting for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state. Consequently, when the particular key input is an operation by which a command reception process from the television receiver <b>200</b> is not carried out such as when the particular key input is, for example, a channel changeover key input of the television broadcasting, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> can enter the low power consumption state immediately after the predetermined period of time set to the timer elapses. Consequently, the power consumption of the remote controller <b>100</b> can be reduced effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">On the other hand, if the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into the low power consumption state is not in a time-up state at step S<b>35</b>, then the remote controller <b>100</b> decides at step S<b>36</b> whether or not a signal input based on an operation key input is received. Then, if it is decided that an operation key input to the remote controller <b>100</b> is received, then the processing advances to step S<b>37</b>, at which the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> executes a process of resetting the timer in the count-up state. In other words, the timer starts its counting from the beginning again. Thus, in such a case that the user carries out a plurality of operations in accordance with an instruction of the display screen of the television receiver <b>200</b> and the remote controller <b>100</b> thereafter receives a command from the television receiver <b>200</b>, the normal power state is maintained after the first key input till the command reception so that the command can be received regularly.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">On the other hand, if it is decided that a key input to the remote controller <b>100</b> is not carried out for the remote controller <b>100</b>, then the processing advances to step S<b>38</b>, at which it is decided whether or not a command is received.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">If it is decided at step S<b>38</b> that a command is received, then the processing advances to step S<b>39</b>, at which the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>, which is in the count-up state, into the low power consumption state is reset. On the other hand, if it is decided at step S<b>38</b> that no command is received, then the timer is not reset and the processing advances to step S<b>41</b>. Here, the command reception at step S<b>38</b> is described. The command in this instance includes not only a command received from the television receiver <b>200</b> through the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> such as a power confirmation command or a reader/writer packet transmission command but also a reply command or the like from the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">Then, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides at step S<b>38</b> that it receives a command from the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> through the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> or from the reader/writer <b>106</b> and then the timer is reset at step S<b>39</b>, then the processing advances to step S<b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">At step S<b>40</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> processes the received command. After the command is processed at step S<b>40</b>, the processing advances to step S<b>41</b>. It is to be noted that the command process in this instance includes, for example, a data process in accordance with a command for a function setting process or the like for the reader/writer <b>106</b>, a process for converting the received command data into data suitable for transmission and a like process.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Then at step S<b>41</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides where or not a command is sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b> or to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>. Then, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides that a command is not transmitted, then the processing returns to step S<b>35</b>, at which it is decided again whether or not the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into the low power consumption state exhibits a time-up state, and the flow of processes described above is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">On the other hand, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides at step S<b>41</b> that a command is sent, then the processing advances to step S<b>42</b>, at which the time number counter of command transmission is updated.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">This command transmission time number counter is incremented by one every time the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends a command to count the command transmission time number by which the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> transmits a command. Thus, an updating process of the command transmission time number counter is carried out at step S<b>42</b>. It is to be noted that the command transmission time number counter is reset when a command is transmitted regularly and an ACK or a reply command to the command transmission is received from the transmission destination of the command.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">In this manner, at step S<b>42</b>, based on command transmission from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> at step S<b>41</b>, the command transmission time number counter is updated by being incremented by +1 every time transmission is carried out. This time number counter has an upper limit value determined in advance, and it is decided at step S<b>43</b> whether or not the time number counter which is updated every time command transmission is carried out reaches the predetermined upper limit value.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">More particularly, the upper limit value is set, for example, to 32 in advance. If the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> transmits a command to the reader/writer <b>106</b> at step S<b>41</b>, then the command transmission time number counter is incremented by +<b>1</b> and is updated thereby at step S<b>42</b>. However, if a reply command to the command transmission is not transmitted from the reader/writer <b>106</b> of the transmission destination within a fixed period of time, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> transmits or re-sends the same command to the reader/writer <b>106</b> of the same transmission destination. Then, in response to the re-sending of the command, the command transmission time number counter is further incremented by +<b>1</b> and updated thereby. Then, this operation process is repeated, if a reply command from the reader/writer <b>106</b> of the transmission destination is not received, until the command transmission time number counter counts the value of <b>32</b> which is the upper limit determined in advance. Thus, it is decided at step S<b>43</b> that the time number counter counts more than <b>32</b> which is the upper limit value determined in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">Then, if it is decided at step S<b>43</b> that the time number counter counts more than <b>32</b> which is the upper limit value, that is, if a reply command is not received in response to the command transmission from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>, that is, in response to the re-sending until the time number counter upper limit value is reached, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sets so as to place the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">On the other hand, if the reader/writer <b>106</b> transmits a reply command to the command transmission from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>, then the time number counter is reset, and the processing returns to step S<b>35</b> to repeat the operation processes described above.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">By counting the number of times of command transmission from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> and supervising a reply command to the command transmission in this manner, if no reply is received regardless of repetitions of command transmission in such a case that, for example, a wiring line to the reader/writer <b>106</b> is broken, that is, if a command is re-sent by a number of times equal to the predetermined upper limit value and yet no reply is received, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> places itself into the low power consumption state. Consequently, such a situation that the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> cannot place itself into the low power consumption state although time passes and the power consumption increases can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">It is to be noted that, in the particular description given above of the steps S<b>41</b> to S<b>43</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends a command to the reader/writer <b>106</b> and supervises a reply command from the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the command transmission. However, a similar process can be used also where the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends a command to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>, and in such a case that some fault in RF communication occurs, if a similar process is carried out to control the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> so that the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself is placed into the low power consumption state, then a situation that power consumption continues can be prevented. It is to be noted that, in this instance, the following process may be carried out. In particular, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> issues a command for turning off the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> and setting the reader/writer <b>106</b>, which consumes much power, to the low power consumption state. Then, after the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> confirms that such setting is correctly carried out successfully, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> is controlled so as to place the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state. Details are hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">As described above, the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment controls such that, when a particular key input is received, when an RF signal is received, that is, when a command is received from the television receiver and when a command from the reader/writer <b>106</b> is received, the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into the low power consumption state is reset so that it starts time counting operation such that the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> is maintained in an on state before a predetermined period of time passes. Consequently, an interface which can be understood easily in that only the remote controller <b>100</b> which is actually carrying out its control receives an RF signal and operates can be implemented. Then, after lapse of a predetermined period of time, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> can place itself into the low power consumption state. Consequently, it is possible for the remote controller <b>100</b> to receive a command from the television receiver while suppressing power consumption and carry out a reading out and writing process of information from and into an IC card by the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Now, processing operation for setting of the remote controller <b>100</b> itself to the low power consumption state described above is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. More specifically, transfer of a command between the various apparatus and components described hereinabove, that is, transfer of a command among the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> and the reader/writer <b>106</b> built in the remote controller <b>100</b>, is described clearly.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a flow of command processes for executing a basic reader/writer function between the apparatus and the components after a mutual authentication process of the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> and the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> after a reader/writer packet is transmitted until a packet reply is received.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">First, at steps S<b>301</b> to S<b>308</b>, a mutual authentication process between the television receiver <b>200</b> and the remote controller <b>100</b> and an ID setting process for the remote controller <b>100</b> are carried out. It is to be noted that the processes at steps S<b>301</b> to S<b>308</b> correspond to steps S<b>101</b> to S<b>109</b> (or step S<b>114</b>) described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, and detailed description of the processes at steps S<b>301</b> to S<b>308</b> is omitted herein to avoid redundancy since processes at corresponding steps S<b>101</b> to S<b>109</b> are such as described hereinabove. Also it is to be noted that, in the processes at steps S<b>304</b> to S<b>308</b>, it may be confirmed whether or not the remote controller has a reader/writer function.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">After the mutual authentication process and the ID setting process at steps S<b>301</b> to S<b>308</b> are completed, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends a reader/writer starting command to the reader/writer <b>106</b> at step S<b>309</b>. This reader/writer starting command is for starting the reader/writer <b>106</b> to establish a state wherein all commands sent from the television receiver <b>200</b> and the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> can be received. However, the reader/writer started by this command does not generate an electromagnetic wave. It is to be noted that, if ID setting is carried out for a plurality of remote controllers by the processes at steps S<b>301</b> to S<b>308</b> described hereinabove, all of the remote controllers having a reader/writer function and having IDs allocated thereto start the reader/writers such that they wait in a state wherein they can receive a command. However, at a step hereinafter described, any remote controller to which a remote controller power confirmation command is not sent from the television receiver <b>200</b> enters the low power consumption state because the timer provided in the remote controller for placing the reader/writer into the low power consumption state becomes a time-up state.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">In this manner, the reader/writer <b>106</b> is started by the processes from this step S<b>309</b> to step S<b>311</b> described below.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">In particular, at step S<b>3</b> <b>10</b>, the reader/writer <b>106</b> sends an ACK regarding reception of the reader/writer starting command from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>. Then, the reader/writer <b>106</b> is started based on the reader/writer starting command from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">At step S<b>311</b>, the reader/writer <b>106</b> sends, if it is started regularly, a reply command for replying to the reader/writer starting command, that is, a starting command reply, to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> based on a starting confirmation process. On the other hand, if the reader/writer <b>106</b> is not started regularly, then it does not send back a reply command or sends a reply command for replying that the reader/writer <b>106</b> is not started regularly. It is to be noted that, if the reader/writer <b>106</b> is not started regularly, then a remote controller power confirmation command hereinafter described is sent to a different remote controller which has a different ID allocated thereto and has a reader/writer function and besides issues a reply that it can be started regularly in response to the starting command.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">It is confirmed whether or not the reader/writer <b>106</b> starts regularly by carrying out the processes at steps S<b>309</b> to S<b>311</b> in this manner. It is to be noted that, though not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, if the reader/writer <b>106</b> does not start regularly, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> may send a command including information of this to the set CPU <b>205</b> through the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Then at step S<b>312</b>, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> sends a command for confirming the power of the remote controller <b>100</b>, that is, a remote controller <b>100</b> power confirmation command, to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b>. This power confirmation command is for confirming whether or not, when reader/writer packet data is sent thereafter, the remote controller <b>100</b> has battery remaining power sufficient to process the data.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">At step S<b>313</b>, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> sends the received remote controller <b>100</b> power confirmation command to the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">At step S<b>314</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> transmits a read/write output setting command to the reader/writer <b>106</b> based on the remote controller <b>100</b> power confirmation command received from the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b>. This read/write output setting command is for causing the reader/writer <b>106</b> to generate an electromagnetic wave to be used for communication with an electronic information recording medium such as an IC card. At steps S<b>314</b> to S<b>320</b>, power confirmation response to the received power confirmation command received from the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>, that is, confirmation of whether or not the remote controller <b>100</b> has battery remaining power sufficient for the reader/writer function to carry out a process, is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">In particular, at step S<b>315</b>, the reader/writer <b>106</b> sends an ACK regarding read/write output setting command reception from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">At step S<b>316</b>, the reader/writer <b>106</b> generates an electromagnetic wave from the antenna used for communication with an IC card and so forth.

This response command includes a result of the power confirmation carried out at the preceding step and conveys a result regarding whether or not an electromagnetic wave necessary to execute a reader/writer function can be generated from the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">At step S<b>322</b>, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> sends the remote controller <b>100</b> power response command to the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Then, after such power confirmation as described above is carried out, the set CPU <b>205</b> sends a reader/writer packet to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> at step S<b>323</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0284" num="0283">In this manner, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment receives a command from the reader/writer <b>106</b> or receives a command from the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> through the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b>, then the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into the low power consumption state is reset at this point of time. Therefore, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> can regularly send a reply command or the like to the received command to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> or the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Further, where the timer is reset upon reception of a command to prolong the time at which the low power consumption state should be entered in this manner, such a situation that, in such a case that a time interval is caused by command execution of the reader/writer <b>106</b> after command transmission till reply command reception particularly like a case wherein the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends a command received from the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>, for example, a reader/writer packet, to the reader/writer <b>106</b> and the reader/writer <b>106</b> executes the command and then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> receives a command sent from the reader/writer <b>106</b>, for example, a reply command, after the execution of the command, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> is placed into the low power consumption state and consequently is in a sleep state and therefore cannot receive a reply command from the reader/writer <b>106</b>, resulting in failure to carry out processing normally, can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Now, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> in an embodiment which not only has functions of turning off the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> and setting the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into a low power consumption state but also has a different function of issuing a command for setting the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the low power consumption state is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Processes at steps S<b>350</b> to S<b>358</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> correspond to those at steps S<b>323</b> to S<b>331</b> described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, respectively, and transfer of a reader/writer packet and a reply command regarding reading and writing of information from and into an IC card is carried out similarly.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">Then at step S<b>359</b>, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> carries out a process of sending a new reader/writer packet to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">Then at step S<b>360</b>, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> carries out a process of sending the received reader/writer packet to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">However, in the sequence diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> of the embodiment, it is illustrated that RF communication between the television receiver <b>200</b> and the remote controller <b>100</b> is not carried out regularly (RF communication abnormal state), and transmission of a new reader/writer packet from the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> is not carried out regularly and a reading/writing process of information from/into the IC card is not carried out by the reader/writer <b>106</b>. At this time, although the reader/writer <b>106</b> maintains the normal power state and continues to generate an electromagnetic wave, communication thereof with the IC card is not carried out. Consequently, only power continues to be consumed because of generation of an electromagnetic wave. Further, since the RF communication abnormal state exists, also a reader/writer ending command from the television receiver <b>200</b> cannot be received, and unless the reader/writer <b>106</b> enters the low power consumption state, also the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself cannot enter the low power consumption state. As a result, the reader/writer <b>106</b> and the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> exhibit high power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Therefore, in the present embodiment, if a command is not transmitted from the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> through the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> within a predetermined period of time, then not only the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> places the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state, but also a timer is utilized to issue a reader/writer ending command to place the reader/writer <b>106</b> into the low power consumption state. Then, after it is confirmed that the reader/writer <b>106</b> enters the low power consumption state, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> controls the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">In particular, if the reader/writer <b>106</b> sends a packet reply to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> at step S<b>356</b>, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> receives the packet reply from the reader/writer <b>106</b> and sends a packet response to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> at step S<b>357</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Thereupon, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> resets, at step S<b>358</b>&#x2032;, the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state to start counting from the beginning as described hereinabove in connection with the processes at steps S<b>38</b> and S<b>39</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Further, at step S<b>359</b>&#x2032;, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> carries out a process of starting the timer for placing the reader/writer <b>106</b> into the low power consumption state.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Although the timer for placing the reader/writer <b>106</b> into the low power consumption state is reset when some command is received, where an abnormal state occurs with RF communication and a command from the television receiver <b>200</b> cannot be received as described above, no command is received and the timer is not reset and exhibits a time-up state when a predetermined interval of time elapses.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Then, when the timer enters a time-up state, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> issues a reader/writer ending command to the reader/writer <b>106</b> at step S<b>360</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">The reader/writer ending command from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> is received by the reader/writer <b>106</b>, and the reader/writer <b>106</b> transmits an ACK regarding the reception of the reader/writer ending command to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> at step S<b>361</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">It is to be noted that, when the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> receives the ACK from the reader/writer <b>106</b> at step S<b>361</b>&#x2032;, the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> whose counting was started from the beginning at step S<b>358</b>&#x2032; into a low power consumption state is reset.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Then at step S<b>362</b>&#x2032;, the reader/writer <b>106</b> sends a reply command to the reader/writer ending command to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>, and the reader/writer <b>106</b> enters the low power consumption state.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">It is to be noted that, also at this step S<b>362</b>&#x2032;, when the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> receives a reply command from the reader/writer <b>106</b>, the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into the low power consumption state again is reset.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Then at step S<b>363</b>&#x2032;, the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into the low power consumption state continues counting. Then, if the RF communication does not return to a normal state during such continuous counting, then the timer comes to a time-up state, and the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> places the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state at step S<b>364</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">It is to be noted that, if, while the counting at step S<b>363</b>&#x2032; continues, the RF communication abnormal state is canceled to restore a normal communication state and a command is sent from the set CPU <b>205</b> to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> through the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b>, then the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into the low power consumption state is reset in response to the reception of the command by the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>, and the processing continues.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">In this manner, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment controls such that, when it receives a reply command or the like from the reader/writer <b>106</b>, it resets the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state so that the timer counts from the beginning. Further, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> controls such that counting of the timer for placing the reader/writer <b>106</b> into the low power consumption state is started. Then, after the predetermined interval of time of the timer for the reader/writer <b>106</b> elapses, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> issues a reader/writer ending command to the reader/writer <b>106</b> to place the reader/writer <b>106</b> into the low power consumption state.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Consequently, where a command is not sent normally from the television receiver <b>200</b> to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> and the reader/writer <b>106</b> and the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself cannot be placed into the low power consumption state any more as in a case wherein an abnormal state occurs with RF communication, such a situation that high power is consumed can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">It is to be noted that low power consumption state setting of the reader/writer <b>106</b> is hereinafter described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">Now, the low power consumption state entering setting process of the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> in a state wherein transfer of a command is not carried out regularly like a case wherein a connection to the reader/writer <b>106</b> is broken or the like is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Similarly as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> sends a reader/writer packet to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> at step S<b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">At step S<b>401</b>, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> sends the received reader/writer packet to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Then at step S<b>402</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends the received reader/writer packet to the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">However, since the connection to the reader/writer <b>106</b> is broken or in a like state, the reader/writer packet cannot be transmitted from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> to the reader/writer <b>106</b>, and naturally any of an ACK regarding reception of the reader/writer packet and a packet reply command is not transmitted from the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">In such an instance as just described, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> controls such that it waits reception of a command from the reader/writer <b>106</b> until it places the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> cannot enter the low power consumption state until the connection to the reader/writer <b>106</b> is repaired against the break. Therefore, within the period of time, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> remains to consume the power.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">Therefore, the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment has a function of supervising a command from the reader/writer <b>106</b> and placing, when the counted number of operation cycles in which a reply to a command is not received becomes higher than a predetermined number, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> into the low power consumption state without waiting a reply result.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">In particular, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment includes a command sending time number counter for counting the number of times by which a command is sent, and at step S<b>402</b>, every time the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends a reader/writer packet to the reader/writer <b>106</b>, the command sending time number counter is updated. Then, if an ACK or a packet reply is not received from the reader/writer <b>106</b> within a fixed period of time after the command is sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b>, then the same command is re-sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b> by the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>. Consequently, the command sending time number counter is incremented by one and updated in response to the re-sending of the command.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">In this manner, if a reply from the reader/writer <b>106</b> is not received within the fixed period of time after a command is sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b> in this manner, then the same command is re-sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b> and the command sending time number counter is incremented by one and updated every time. Then, the operation processes are repeated until a reply is received from the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">An upper limit value is set in advance to the command sending time number counter, and when the counter counts up to the upper limit value, for example, set to <b>32</b>, then it is decided at step S<b>43</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> described hereinabove that the time number counter is in a time-up state. Then, the processing returns to step S<b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, at which the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> places the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state (step S<b>403</b>). It is to be noted that the upper limit value to the command sending time number counter is not limited to <b>32</b>. Further, if the remote controller <b>100</b> successfully receives a regular reply command from the reader/writer <b>106</b> before the count value of the command sending time number counter reaches the upper limit value, then the command sending time number counter is reset.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">In this manner, in the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, if, after a command is sent by the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>, a reply to the command is not received from the reader/writer <b>106</b> within the fixed period of time, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> re-sends the command and updates the command sending time number counter to count the number of times by which the command is set thereby to supervise a reply from the destination of the command transmission. Then, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides whether or not the count value of the command sending time number counter reaches the upper limit value set in advance. Then, if the count value reaches the preset upper limit value, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> places the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state. Consequently, such a situation that the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> continues to wait a reply from the reader/writer <b>106</b> and cannot enter the low power consumption state in a state wherein transfer of a command between the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> and the reader/writer <b>106</b> is not carried out regularly like a case wherein the connection to the reader/writer <b>106</b> is broken and consequently the power is consumed seriously can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">It is to be noted that such control as described is carried out not only when the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends a command to the reader/writer <b>106</b> but fails to receive a command reply from the reader/writer <b>106</b> but similar control can be carried out also where the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends a command to the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">As described above, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> sets the remote controller <b>100</b>, which is in the low power consumption state, to the normal power state and starts the timer in response to an input of an operation key of the remote controller <b>100</b>, and the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> is not set to the low power consumption state until after a predetermined period of time set to the timer elapses so that the RF transmission/reception section <b>102</b> is kept in an on state to permit command reception from the television receiver <b>200</b>. The operation key of the remote controller <b>100</b> and the process of the television receiver <b>200</b> are synchronized with each other, and the function of the television receiver <b>200</b> starts in response to an operation of the remote controller <b>100</b> through an operation key. Therefore, by such control as described above, for example, when the television receiver <b>200</b> is controlled by the remote controller <b>100</b> and the reader/writer function for carrying out reading out/writing of information from/into an information recording medium such as an IC card is required in a program stored in the memory <b>204</b> such as, for example, a ROM of the television receiver <b>200</b>, such a situation that, when a command such as a power confirmation command or a command for confirming whether or not the reader/writer function is available is issued, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> is in the low power consumption state and cannot receive the command and therefore the remote controller necessary to utilize the reader/writer function cannot be found out or the reader/writer function cannot be utilized can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Further, in the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, upon RF reception from the television receiver <b>200</b>, that is, upon command reception from the television receiver <b>200</b>, and upon command reception from the reader/writer <b>106</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> resets the timer for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state so as to start counting by the timer from the beginning again. Therefore, for example, when a command is sent from the television receiver <b>200</b> to the reader/writer <b>106</b> through the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>, even if an interval of time for execution of the command appears after the command is sent from the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> to the reader/writer <b>106</b> until the reader/writer <b>106</b> executes the command and sends a reply command to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>, such a situation that, before the reply command is sent from the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the remote controller CPU <b>103</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself is placed into the low power consumption state and fails to receive the reply command regularly and therefore fails to complete its process can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">Furthermore, in the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, a reply to a command from the reader/writer <b>106</b> is supervised, and the number of times by which a reply is not received is counted. Then, when the counted time number reaches a predetermined value, the low power consumption state is set without waiting a result from the reader/writer <b>106</b>. In particular, the remote controller <b>100</b> increments the command sending time number counter by +1 every time a command is sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b>. If the processes are repeated and a reply is not received before the predetermined count number is reached, then the command is re-sent, the command sending time number counter is incremented by one and the operation processes are repeated. Then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> is set to the low power consumption state without waiting a resulting reply from the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the command sent therefrom. Consequently, such a situation that the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> cannot enter the low power consumption state for whatever long time it waits in a state wherein no reply is obtained from the reader/writer <b>106</b> even if a command is sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b> like a case wherein the connection to the reader/writer <b>106</b> is broken can be prevented. Further, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> successfully receives a regular reply command from the reader/writer <b>106</b> during the control described above, the command transmission time number counter is reset. Therefore, when the connection is restored to enable regular operation of the reader/writer <b>106</b>, such a situation that issuance of a command to the reader/writer <b>106</b> is stopped can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">The control process of the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment for setting the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state is such as described above. By the control process, it is possible to reduce the power consumption of the remote controller <b>100</b> which is driven by a battery provided in the battery and power supply section <b>108</b> and has a limit to the driving time thereof from the life of the battery and to allow the remote controller <b>100</b> to regularly carry out processing of the function of receiving a command or the like from the television receiver <b>200</b> and controlling the reader/writer <b>106</b> or the like based on the command.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">A remote controller which includes a reader/writer like the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment described above should not originally include the reader/writer because, since the reader/writer generates an electromagnetic wave, it consumes a large amount of power and this decreases the life of the battery provided in the battery and power supply section <b>108</b>. Further, in the remote controller <b>100</b>, even if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself can be controlled to the low power consumption state efficiently as described above, if the reader/writer <b>106</b> remains in the normal power state, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself cannot be placed into the low power consumption state, and a great amount of power still continues to be consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">Therefore, in the remote controller <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, in order to efficiently control the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the low power consumption state, the reader/writer <b>106</b> is set to the low power consumption state when the power supply provided by the battery is made available.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">Further, since the remote controller <b>100</b> uses an RF signal for communication, it may possibly enter a communication disabled state abruptly. Therefore, the remote controller <b>100</b> of the present embodiment carries out control of supervising the communication state and carrying out a suitable process in accordance with the communication state.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">In the following, processing operation for setting the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the low power consumption state is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates processing operation of the remote controller <b>100</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates processing operation of the television receiver <b>200</b> in the low power consumption setting process.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">For example, when the power supply is made available, the remote controller <b>100</b> and the television receiver <b>200</b> start the low power consumption setting process for the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">At step S<b>51</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> issues a command for placing the reader/writer <b>106</b> into the low power consumption state thereby to set the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the low power consumption state. Consequently, the remote controller <b>100</b> can reduce the power consumption when the reader/writer <b>106</b> is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The television receiver <b>200</b> receives a control instruction from the remote controller <b>100</b>, and at step S<b>71</b>, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> decides whether or not the function of reading out and writing information from and into an information recording medium like the reader/writer <b>106</b> should be used based on a program stored in the ROM of the set memory <b>206</b>. The function mentioned is hereinafter referred to as reader/writer function.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">If the set CPU <b>205</b> decides at step S<b>71</b> that the reader/writer function is required, then the processing advances to step S<b>72</b>, at which the set CPU <b>205</b> issues a command for confirming whether or not a remote controller has the reader/writer function, that is, a reader/writer confirmation command, based on the program stored in the set memory <b>206</b>. Then, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> sends the reader/writer confirmation command to all remote controllers which can communicate with the television receiver <b>200</b> to inquire about whether or not they have the reader/writer function. On the other hand, if the set CPU <b>205</b> decides at step S<b>71</b> that the reader/writer function is not required, then the process at step S<b>71</b> is carried out again. It is to be noted that not such a command for inquiring only of the reader/writer function but such a function confirmation for collectively inquiring about various functions which a remote controller has may be used so that various functions including the reader/writer function can be confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">The remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides at step S<b>52</b> whether or not the reader/writer confirmation command is received from the television receiver <b>200</b>.

At step S<b>53</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> sends a reply that the remote controller <b>100</b> has the reader/writer function to the television receiver <b>200</b> and issues a command for ending the low power consumption state, that is, the low power consumption state ending command, to the reader/writer <b>106</b> in order to receive a later command for the reader/writer <b>106</b> thereby to set the reader/writer <b>106</b> to end the low power consumption state. On the other hand, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides at step S<b>52</b> that the reader/writer confirmation command is not received from the television receiver <b>200</b>, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> carries out the process at step S<b>52</b> again. It is to be noted that not the remote controller <b>100</b> but another remote controller which does not have the reader/writer function may be used. In this instance, the remote controller sends no reply or sends a reply that it does not have the reader/writer function in response to the reader/writer confirmation command.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">At step S<b>53</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> carries out setting for ending the low power consumption state of the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">The set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> decides at step S<b>73</b> whether or not a remote controller having the reader/writer function is available. If the set CPU <b>205</b> decides at step S<b>73</b> that a remote controller having the reader/writer function is available, then the processing advances to step S<b>74</b>. On the other hand, if it is decided at step S<b>73</b> that a remote controller having the reader/writer function is not available, then the processing returns to step S<b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">At step S<b>74</b>, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> decides whether only one remote controller or a plurality of remote controllers from among those remote controllers which can communicate with the television receiver <b>200</b> exist. If the set CPU <b>205</b> decides at step S<b>74</b> that only one remote controller from among those remote controllers which can communicate with the television receiver <b>200</b> has the reader/writer function, then the processing advances to step S<b>76</b>. Such one remote controller is hereinafter referred to as remote controller <b>100</b>. On the other hand, if the set CPU <b>205</b> decides at step <b>74</b> that a plurality of ones of those remote controllers which can communicate with the television receiver <b>200</b> have the reader/writer function, then the processing advances to step S<b>75</b>, at which a remote controller which should communicate with the television receiver <b>200</b> is arbitrarily selected from among the plural remote controllers. In the following description, the selected remote controller is referred to as remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">Since the reader/writer <b>106</b> consumes a great amount of power, if it becomes impossible to use the reader/writer function continually as in a case wherein the communication between the remote controller <b>100</b> and the television receiver <b>200</b> is interrupted, the reader/writer <b>106</b> should stop the outputting of the reader/writer function as quickly as possible. However, for example, when the reader/writer <b>106</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> receives an outputting instruction of a command from the program of the television receiver <b>200</b>, if the communication with the remote controller <b>100</b> is interrupted immediately after then, then the reader/writer <b>106</b> cannot drop the outputting thereof. Therefore, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> includes a timer not shown for counting a period of time set in advance and resetting the counting after lapse of the preset time period. Thus, where the reader/writer <b>106</b> is not in the low power consumption state, the predetermined period of time is normally counted, and if the count value reaches the preset time interval, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> issues a command for placing the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> itself into the low power consumption state.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">Where the reader/writer <b>106</b> is not in the low power consumption state but in a normal sate, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> resets the timer so as to start counting newly at step S<b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">If the count value reaches the preset time, then the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> issues a command for placing the reader/writer <b>106</b> into the low power consumption state. However, it is necessary to prevent the remote controller <b>100</b> from entering the low power consumption state while the remote controller <b>100</b> is operating normally. At step S<b>55</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> continues the counting, and in the meantime, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides whether or not an effective command to the remote controller <b>100</b> is received as an RF signal or whether or not a normal command is received from the reader/writer <b>106</b>. If the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides that an effective command to the remote controller <b>100</b> is received as an RF signal or a normal command is received from the reader/writer <b>106</b>, then the processing advances to step S<b>56</b>. On the other hand, if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides at step S<b>55</b> that the preset time period counted by the timer elapses before one of such commands as described above is received, then the processing returns to step S<b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">It is to be noted that, where, at step S<b>55</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> issues a command for setting the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the low power consumption state based on the program thereof or where the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> issues a command for setting the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the low power consumption state based on the program and the remote controller <b>100</b> receives the command, the processing may advance to step S<b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">At step S<b>76</b>, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> issues a power confirmation command for confirming whether or not the remote controller <b>100</b> has sufficient power to carry out processing using the reader/writer <b>106</b> and instructs the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> to send this power confirmation command to the remote controller <b>100</b>. The remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> sends this power confirmation command to the remote controller <b>100</b> to confirm whether or not the remote controller <b>100</b> has sufficient power to carry out processing using the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">At step S<b>56</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides whether or not the power confirmation command is received from the television receiver <b>200</b>. If the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides at step S<b>56</b> that the power confirmation command is received from the television receiver <b>200</b>, then the processing advances to step S<b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">At step S<b>57</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> issues a power confirmation command for carrying out power confirmation to the reader/writer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">If the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides that the power confirmation command is received from the television receiver <b>200</b>, then it decides at step S<b>58</b> whether or not it has sufficient power to carry out processing using the reader/writer <b>106</b>. At this step S<b>58</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> controls the reader/writer <b>106</b> to output an electromagnetic wave necessary for reading out and writing of data from and into an IC card once and then stop the outputting of an electromagnetic wave immediately. Within a predetermined period of time after starting till ending of outputting of an electromagnetic wave, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> measures the battery remaining amount, power and so forth of the reader/writer <b>106</b> and decides whether or not the reader/writer <b>106</b> has sufficient electric power to carry out reading out and writing of data from and into an IC card regularly. If the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides at step S<b>58</b> that the reader/writer <b>106</b> has sufficient power to carry out reading out and writing of data from and into an IC card regularly, then the processing advances to step S<b>59</b>, but if the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> decides that the reader/writer <b>106</b> does not have sufficient power to carry out reading out and writing of data from and into an IC card regularly, then the processing returns to step S<b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">At step S<b>59</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> sends a power confirmation command for replying that the reader/writer <b>106</b> has sufficient power to the television receiver <b>200</b>. Thereafter, the processing returns to step S<b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">At step S<b>77</b>, the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> decides whether or not the power confirmation command is received. If the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> decides that the power confirmation command is received, then the processing advances to step S<b>78</b>, but if the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> decides that the power confirmation command is not received, then the processing returns to step S<b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">At step S<b>78</b>, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> decides whether or not there is a command to be sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b> within a fixed period of time defined by counting of the timer. If the set CPU <b>205</b> decides at step S<b>78</b> that there is a command to be sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b>, then the processing advances to step S<b>79</b>, but if the set CPU <b>205</b> decides that there is no command to be sent to the reader/writer <b>106</b>, then the processing advances to step S<b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">At step S<b>79</b>, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> issues a command for causing the function of the reader/writer <b>106</b> to be exhibited to instruct the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> to send the command to the remote controller <b>100</b>. The remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> sends the command to the remote controller <b>100</b>, and the processing returns to step S<b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">At step S<b>80</b>, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> decides whether or not the use of the reader/writer <b>106</b> should be ended, and if it is decided that the use of the reader/writer <b>106</b> should be ended, then the processing returns to step S<b>71</b>, but if it is decided that the use of the reader/writer <b>106</b> should not be ended, then the processing advances to step S<b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">It is necessary for the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> to prevent the function of the reader/writer <b>106</b> from automatically turning off within a period of waiting time for accessing to a network or the like through the screen display section <b>207</b> or the Internet connection section <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">Therefore, the set CPU <b>205</b> of the television receiver <b>200</b> issues, at step S<b>8</b> <b>1</b>, a command for confirming whether or not the communication state is regular, that is, a communication state confirmation command, to the remote controller <b>100</b> at time intervals shorter than the period of counting carried out by the counter provided in the remote controller <b>100</b>. Then, the set CPU <b>205</b> instructs the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> to send the communication state confirmation command to the remote controller <b>100</b>, and the remote controller controlling CPU <b>203</b> sends the communication state confirmation command to the remote controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">Consequently, even if the communication situation does not have any problem, such a situation that use of the function of the reader/writer <b>106</b> is disabled on the remote controller <b>100</b> side can be prevented. Further, since the necessity for the remote controller <b>100</b> to output an RF signal for confirmation of the communication situation is eliminated, power consumption of the remote controller <b>100</b> can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">At step S<b>60</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides whether or not the communication state confirmation command is received from the television receiver <b>200</b>. If it is decided that the communication state confirmation command is received, then the processing returns to step S<b>54</b>, but if it is decided that the communication state confirmation command is not received, then the processing advances to step S<b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">At step S<b>61</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> decides whether or not a command for carrying out reading out and writing of information from and into the reader/writer <b>106</b> is received from the television receiver <b>200</b>. If it is decided that the command is received, then the processing advances to step S<b>62</b>, but if it is decided that the command is not received, then the processing returns to step S<b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">At step S<b>62</b>, the remote controller CPU <b>103</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> carries out data processing based on the command received from the television receiver <b>200</b>, for example, reading out and writing of information from and into the reader/writer <b>106</b>. Then, the processing returns to step S<b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">In this manner, in the communication system <b>1</b>, a changing command into the low power consumption state is issued to the reader/writer <b>106</b> when the power supply to the remote controller <b>100</b> is made available. Consequently, lower power consumption than that when the power supply is made available with a related-art remote controller can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">Further, in the communication system <b>1</b>, in order that the low power consumption state may not be established while the remote controller <b>100</b> is operating regularly, when an effective command to the remote controller <b>100</b> is received in the form of an RF signal, or when a regular command is received from the reader/writer <b>106</b>, the remote controller <b>100</b> resets the counting of the counter. On the other hand, when the remote controller <b>100</b> receives a command issued by itself of based on the program of the television receiver <b>200</b> for setting the reader/writer <b>106</b> to the low power consumption state and successfully executes a command process, by resetting and stopping the counting of the timer, the situation that the reader/writer function is kept in an effective state in vain by the reader/writer <b>106</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">Further, in the communication system <b>1</b>, when a command for confirming the presence of the reader/writer function is received from the television receiver <b>200</b>, the reader/writer <b>106</b> can immediately reply to the command from the television receiver <b>200</b> by issuing a command for ending the low power consumption state to the reader/writer <b>106</b>. Consequently, even where the reader/writer <b>106</b> is set to the low power consumption state, a high speed response can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">Further, in the communication system <b>1</b>, if the remote controller <b>100</b> receives a command for making the reader/writer <b>106</b> effective from the television receiver <b>200</b> which is controlled by the remote controller <b>100</b>, then the remote controller <b>100</b> outputs the function of the reader/writer <b>106</b> once to measure the power state and then stops the outputting of the function of the reader/writer <b>106</b>. By this, not in the course of processing of a command, but at a point of time at which processing of the command is started, it is possible to confirm that the power of the remote controller <b>100</b> is insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">Further, in the communication system <b>1</b>, where a power confirmation command of the reader/writer <b>106</b> is received from the television receiver <b>200</b> which is controlled by the remote controller <b>100</b>, the timer of the remote controller <b>100</b> starts counting, but where an effective command is not received from the television receiver <b>200</b> or the reader/writer <b>106</b> for a fixed period of time, a changing command into the low power consumption state is issued to the reader/writer <b>106</b>. Consequently, where the communication with the television receiver <b>200</b> is interrupted, such a situation that the function of the reader/writer <b>106</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> continues to be outputted thereby to consume the power in vain can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">Further, in the communication system <b>1</b>, since a command for instructing the reader/writer <b>106</b> to reset the timer for changing the reader/writer <b>106</b> into the low power consumption state is issued, the television receiver <b>200</b> which knows a timing at which outputting of the function of the reader/writer <b>106</b> of the remote controller <b>100</b> is required can instruct the reader/writer <b>106</b> to continue the outputting of the function. Consequently, the timing at which the reader/writer function is outputted can be controlled accurately.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present subject matter and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">For example, while, in the embodiments described hereinabove, the remote controller <b>100</b> carries out reading out and writing of information from and into an IC card of the contactless type using the RFID, another configuration may be employed wherein a remote controller carries out only reading out or writing of information from or into a magnetic card of the contact type. Further, the information recording medium of the contactless type is not limited to an IC card, but, for example, an electronic apparatus such as a portable telephone set having a function of a contactless IC card or the like may be used as described hereinabove.</p>
