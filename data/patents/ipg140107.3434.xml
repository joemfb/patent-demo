<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a method for controlling a lighting system in an aircraft cabin.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">According to the prior art, a lighting system for an aircraft cabin is generally known which comprises a multiplicity of lighting units arranged distributed in the aircraft cabin. Each of the lighting units consists of a controller and a multiplicity of RGB light-emitting diodes connected thereto. The controllers are connected to a central processor via a bus. In the central processor, a number of so-called &#x201c;scene programmes&#x201d; are stored. The &#x201c;scene programmes&#x201d; contain arithmetic instructions for continuously generating parameters which are transmitted to the controllers via the bus. On the basis of these parameters, for example, the brightness and/or the colour of the light generated by means of the RGB light-emitting diodes is changed with time by means of the controllers. This results in luminous scenarios or scenes. Such scenes can simulate, for example, a sunrise or a sunset. Furthermore, scenes can be created which have a calming or a stimulating effect on passengers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In particular, aircraft cabins of modern wide-bodied aircraft require the provision of a lighting system having a relatively large number of lighting units. In this case, processing the respective scene programmes requires the transmission of a relatively high data rate via the bus. This, in turn, leads undesirably to a reduction in the speed of the data exchange via the bus. This is undesirable especially with regard to other control data to be transmitted via the bus, especially control data relating to flight safety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is the object of the invention to eliminate the disadvantages according to the prior art. In particular, a method is to be specified by means of which a data rate for controlling a lighting system in an aircraft cabin can be reduced. According to another aim of the invention, it should be possible to execute the method without significant change in the hardware currently used for manufacturing the lighting system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As determined by the invention, a method for controlling a lighting system in an aircraft cabin with a multiplicity of lighting units arranged distributed in the aircraft cabin is proposed, each of which comprises a controller for controlling RGB light-emitting diodes connected thereto,</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">and a central processor connected to each of the controllers for the purpose of data exchange,</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">each controller comprising a storage unit having a number of scene programmes stored therein for controlling in each case one scene, a scene being a predetermined change with time of a luminous behaviour of the RGB light-emitting diodes, and</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">control data records being transmitted to the controllers from the central processor for controlling an overall luminous behaviour generated by means of the multiplicity of lighting units, each of which control data records contains at least one scene programme identification information item and one synchronization information item for controlling the sequence of the scene programme corresponding to the scene programme identification information with time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since, according to the invention, the scene programmes are now provided in the controllers, the data rate required for controlling the lighting system can be drastically reduced. It is now only required to select and, for example, to start one of the scene programmes stored in the storage units by means of control data records transmitted to the controllers from the central processor in accordance with the scene programme identification information transmitted therewith. To ensure a synchronous sequence of all scene programmes, the control data record also contains synchronization information. This synchronization information is continuously updated by the central processor. By repeatedly transmitting the control data records, synchronous processing of the scene programmes by means of the controllers can thus be ensured. Thus, the central processor now only transmits a programme selection or scene programme identification information and synchronization information via the bus for controlling the scene programmes. In comparison with previous methods, the repetitive transmission of the control data records can occur within relatively long time intervals so that loading of the bus can thus also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an advantageous embodiment, the control data record comprises a scene programme speed information for controlling a speed of a sequence of the scene generated by means of the scene programme. By this means, a predetermined speed of the sequence of the scene programme can be increased or reduced depending on requirement.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is also possible that the control data record comprises a brightness information for controlling a brightness of the scene generated by means of the scene programme. By this means, a brightness of the scene running in each case can be increased or decreased overall. In particular, a scene programme speed information and/or a brightness information can also be generated in particular by a manual input by the cabin personnel. The cabin personnel are thus able to adapt the overall luminous behaviour of the lighting system to specific requirements at any time.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the lighting systems are split into at least two groups. In this case, the control data record can contain a synchronization information item specific for each of the groups. The aforementioned groups can be combined in particular cabin sections. For example, a front cabin section can form a first group and a rear cabin section can form a second group of lighting units. The specific synchronization information provided for each of the groups can be different. Thus, a scene programme can be processed offset with time in the two groups. For example, the processing of a scene programme in the first group can lead the processing of the scene programme in the second group.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It can also be that the control data record contains a scene programme identification information item specific for each of the groups. It is thus possible to process a different scene programme in each of the groups.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a &#x201c;standard mode&#x201d;, the control data records are continuously newly generated by the central processor in accordance with a predetermined algorithm and are transmitted to the controllers at predetermined time intervals. This ensures faultless and synchronous sequence of the respective scene programmes. Even if an execution of one of the scene programmes is faulty, it can be restarted by the continuously recurring control data records and processed synchronously with the other scene programmes.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A content of the control data records can be changed by means of manually input control information. Such control information can stand the brightness or the selection of a particular scene programme. For example, a scene programme provided for emergency cases can be activated by this means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The control data records are advantageously transmitted to the controllers at time intervals of 100 to 300 ms, preferably 150 to 250 ms. By this means, the loading of a bus connecting the controllers to the central processor can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further, particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, at least one scene programme is transmitted to the controllers from the central processor in an &#x201c;update mode&#x201d;. Such an update mode can then be activated when the loading of the bus is low, for example when the aircraft is standing on the ground. Such time intervals can be used, e.g., for updating scene programmes.</p>

The control files are generated by the central processor <b>1</b> in accordance with a predetermined algorithm and transmitted, for example, at time intervals of 200 ms to the controllers <b>4</b>. Each control file comprises a scene programme identification information item PI in which the scene programme P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b> to be started in each case or running is addressed. Furthermore, the control file comprises a synchronization information item SI which specifies a programme progression for the respective scene programme P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>. This makes it possible to ensure that all scene programmes P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b> running within a group G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> have the same programme progression, i.e. there will be no different luminous behaviour of the lighting units contained in a group G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, each of the lighting units <b>3</b> can be provided with a specific identifier. A number of lighting units <b>3</b> can be combined to form groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> on the basis of their specific identifier. In this case, the control data record can additionally contain an identifier information item which provides for its transmission precisely to the lighting unit <b>3</b> having the specific identifier corresponding to the identifier information. This makes it possible to generate a specific control data record for each of the lighting units <b>3</b> and to transmit it precisely to the lighting unit <b>3</b> provided for it. In this manner, groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> of lighting units can be formed which receive different control data records. For example, a first scene programme P<b>1</b> can be started in a first group G<b>1</b> and a second scene programme P<b>2</b> can be started in a second group G<b>2</b>. However, it is also possible to start the same scene programme P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b> in the two groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> but to transmit a different synchronization signal SI to the lighting units <b>3</b> of the groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>. In this manner, a time offset of the scene programme P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b> running in the groups G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b> can be achieved, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Using manual inputs, it is also possible to change a parameter P in the control data record by means of which, for example, the brightness and/or the sequence speed of the scene programmes P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b> can be changed with respect to the previous settings predetermined in the scene programme P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, P<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Since the control data records contain relatively little information and are only transmitted at time intervals of, for example, 200 ms via the bus <b>2</b>, the loading of the bus <b>2</b> can be kept relatively low, i.e. the bus <b>2</b> has in this case sufficient capacity for transmitting other control data which, for example, are used for monitoring and/or controlling essential components of an aircraft during flight.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">By means of the present method, it is possible to transmit update information from the central processor <b>1</b> via the bus <b>2</b> to the controllers <b>4</b> at operating times with little bus loading <b>2</b>, for example when an aircraft is at a standstill. These can be changed scene programmes or the like.</p>
