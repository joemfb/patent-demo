<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates to hosting an online social game in such a manner that individual users may log into the same user account in the social game from a plurality of different social network platforms, and/or such that users that have logged into the social game from different social network platforms can still participate in the social game together.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Social online games are known. Typically, users log in to a social online game from a social networking platform. The gaming experience within the social game may be tied into the social networking platform. For example, the user interface of the social game may be presented within the user interface for the social network platform, notifications of the activity of a user may be sent back to the social network platform for presentation, other users that are linked to the user may be recommended for cooperation in the social game, and/or other features may be tied to the social networking platform.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, if a social game is provided for different social networking platforms, then the social game is provided separately to each of the different social networking platforms. As such, in order for a user to participate in the social game from two different social networking platforms, the user must have two separate user accounts for the social game (e.g., one for each social networking platform). If users log in to the social game from different social networking platforms, the typically may not be able to participate in the game with each other, but may be restricted to participation with other users that have logged in through the same social networking platform.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One aspect of the disclosure relates to a system and method for facilitating participation in an online game through a plurality of different social network platforms. This may include enabling an individual user to log in to the online game, which may take place in a virtual space, through a plurality of different social network platforms, thereby extending the accessibility of the online game with respect to the individual user. The online game may be provided to users through different social network platforms such that a first user accessing the online game through a first social network platform may access a common instance of the online game (and/or the virtual space) with a second user accessing the online game through a second social network platform. This may enable users from different social network platforms to participate in the online game together.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A system that facilitates participation in an online game through a plurality of social network platforms may include one or more servers. The server may be configured to execute computer modules including one or more of a user account module, an authentication module, a social network information module, a notification module, a space module, and/or other modules.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The user account module may be configured to manage user accounts associated with individual users. The user accounts may include a first user account associated with a first user, a second user account associated with a second user, and/or other user accounts.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first user account may include sets of social network authentication information corresponding to a plurality of social network accounts of the first user on a corresponding plurality of social network platforms. The sets of social network authentication information may include a first set of social network authentication information corresponding to a first social network account of the first user on a first social network platform and a second set of social network authentication information corresponding to a second social network account of the first user on a second social network platform. The second user account may include one or more sets of social network authentication information corresponding to one or more social network accounts of the second user on a corresponding one or more one or more social network platforms. The one or more sets of social network authentication information may include a third set of social network authentication information corresponding to a third social network account of the second user on a third social network platform.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first user account may include character information for a first character controlled by the first user in the online game. The second user account may include character information for a second character controlled by the second user in the online game. The character information may include one or more of information that defines a visual appearance of the character, a progress level of the character in the online game, a status of the character in the online game, a score of the character in the online game, or an inventory of the character in the online game.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The authentication module may be configured to receive authentication requests submitted by the users through social network platforms, and to authenticate the users in response to the authentication requests. For example, the authentication module is configured such that responsive to receiving a first authentication request submitted by the first user through either of the first social network platform or the second social network platform, the authentication module can authenticate and log in the first user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Responsive to reception of an authentication request from the first user through the first social network platform, the authentication module may identify the first user based on the inclusion of the first set of social network authentication information in the authentication request. The authentication module may then log the first user into the online game to control the first character. Responsive to receiving an authentication request submitted by the first user through the second social network platform, the authentication module may identify the first user based on the inclusions of the second set of social network authentication information in the second authentication request. The authentication module may then log the first user into the online game to control the first character.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The authentication module may be configured to receive an authentication request from the second user through the third social network platform. Responsive to reception of such a request, the authentication module may identify the second user based on the inclusion of the third set of social network authentication information in the authentication request. The authentication module may then log the second user into the online game to control the second character, thereby enabling the first user and the second user to participate in the online game together even though they have accessed the online game through separate social network platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The social network information module may be configured to receive social network information from the social network platforms about the users. This may include receiving social network information about the first user from the first social network platform and from the second social network platform. The social network information module may further be configured to aggregate social network information for the individual users that is received from the different social network platforms. This may include aggregating the social network information about the first user received from the first social network platform and the second social network platform having a type that is the same or similar, which may thereby represent the first user across both the first social network platform and the second social network platform.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The notification module may be configured to generate notifications to the social network platforms indicating activity by the users in the online game. This may include, responsive to the first user performing an action in the online game that triggers a notification, generating a first notification of the action for the first social network platform and a second notification of the action for the second social network platform. The first notification may cause an indication of the action to be displayed on a virtual wall associated with the first user in the first social network platform. The second notification may cause an indication of the action to be displayed on a virtual wall associated with the first user in the second social network platform.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The space module may be configured to execute an instance of a virtual space in which the online game is played, and to provide view information defining views of the virtual space to client computing devices to facilitate presentation of the views to the users. The space module may be configured such that responsive to the first user and the second user being logged into the online game by the authentication module, the space module (i) may implement the instance of the virtual space to determine view information that defines a first view of the virtual space for presentation to the first user, and a second view of the virtual space for presentation to the second user, and (ii) may transmit the view information to client computing platforms associated with the first user and the second user to facilitate presentation of the first view to the first user, and of the second view to the second user. The space module may be configured such that the first character under control of the first user may be viewable in the second view, and wherein the second character under control of the second user may be viewable in the first view.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a system <b>10</b> configured to facilitate play of an online game by users through a plurality of social network platforms. System <b>10</b> may enable users logging into the game from different social network platforms to play with each other in the online game. System <b>10</b> may enable an individual user to log in to the same user account for the game from any of a plurality of different social network platforms. In some implementations, system <b>10</b> may include a server <b>12</b>. Server <b>12</b> may be configured to communicate with one or more client computing platforms <b>14</b> according to a client/server architecture. The users may access system <b>10</b> and/or the online game via client computing platforms <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Server <b>12</b> may be configured to execute one or more computer program modules. The one or more computer program modules may include one or more of a space module <b>16</b>, a user account module <b>18</b>, an authentication module <b>20</b>, a social network information module <b>22</b>, a notification module <b>24</b>, and/or other modules.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Space module <b>16</b> may be configured to host a virtual space for access by users via client computing platforms <b>14</b>. The users may participate in the online game within the virtual space. Hosting the virtual space may include executing an instance of the virtual space, and implementing the instance of the virtual space to determine view information representing views of the virtual space. The view information may then be communicated from server <b>12</b> to client computing platforms <b>14</b> to facilitate presentation of the views to the users. The views may be presented to the users within user interfaces of applications being executed on client computing platforms <b>14</b> (e.g., web browsers).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some implementations, the virtual space (and/or the online game) may be accessed through one of a plurality of different social network platforms provided by one of social network servers <b>26</b>. In such implementations, accessing the virtual space through a given social network platform may include logging in to the virtual space through the given social network platform, receiving a view of the virtual space within a user interface associated with the given social network platform (e.g., within a web page hosted by the given social network platform), and/or other mechanisms for accessing the virtual space from the given social network platform.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The users may participate in the virtual space (and/or the online game that takes place therein) by inputting input commands to their respective client computing platforms <b>14</b> that request an action to be taken within the instance of the virtual space (e.g., manipulate an object, control a character, speak to another character, and/or other actions). The input commands may be transmitted from client computing platforms <b>14</b> to server <b>12</b>, and received by space module <b>16</b>. Responsive to reception of the input commands, space module <b>16</b> may initiate the requested actions in the instance of the virtual space such that the actions are reflected in the views of the virtual space determined by space module <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A virtual space may comprise a simulated space that is accessible by users via clients (e.g., client computing platforms <b>14</b>) that present the views of the virtual space to a user. The simulated space may have a simulated physical layout, express ongoing real-time interaction by one or more users, and/or be constrained by simulated physics that governs interactions between virtual objects in the simulated space. In some instances, the simulated physical layout may be a 2-dimensional layout. In other instances, the simulated physical layout may be a 3-dimensional layout. An instance of a virtual space may be persistent. That is, the instance of the virtual space may continue to exist whether or not any given user (or set of users) are currently logged in and/or receiving view information.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The above description of virtual spaces is not intended to be limiting. Space module <b>16</b> may be configured to express the virtual space in a more limited, or more rich, manner. For example, views of the virtual space presented to the users may be selected from a limited set of graphics depicting an event in a given place within the virtual space. The views may include additional content (e.g., text, audio, pre-stored video content, movable icons, avatars, and/or other content) that describes particulars of the current state of the space, beyond the relatively generic graphics. For example, a view of the virtual space may depict a given location in a relatively static manner that may or may not include representations of the characters present at the location. Text may be used to express the actions of the characters present at the location (and/or effects of the actions), and/or actions of the characters (and/or effects) may be represented with a relatively limited set of still images and/or short animations. For example, a battle, a meeting, a game, and/or other activities at the given location may be depicted in this manner. Other expressions of individual places within the virtual space are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Within the instance of the virtual space (or other virtual environment) executed by space module <b>16</b>, users may control characters to interact with the virtual space and/or each other. As used herein, the term &#x201c;character&#x201d; may refer to an object (or group of objects) present in the virtual space that represents an individual user. The character may be controlled by the user with which it is associated. The characters may move through and interact with the virtual space (e.g., non-player characters in the virtual space, other objects in the virtual space), or the characters may be relatively static visually within views of virtual space. The character representing a given user may be created and/or customized by the given user. The character may have an &#x201c;inventory&#x201d; of virtual goods and/or currency that the user can use (e.g., by manipulation of a character or other user controlled element, and/or other items), display, gift, and/or otherwise interact with within the virtual space.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">User account module <b>18</b> may be configured to manage user accounts associated with individual users. The user accounts may include information stored by server <b>12</b>, one or more of the client computing platforms <b>14</b>, and/or other storage locations. The user accounts may include, for example, information identifying users (e.g., a username or handle, a number, an identifier, and/or other identifying information) within the virtual space, security login information (e.g., a login code or password), virtual space account information, subscription information, virtual currency account information (e.g., related to currency held in credit for a user), relationship information (e.g., information related to relationships between users in the virtual space), virtual space usage information, demographic information associated with users, interaction history among users in the virtual space, information stated by users, purchase information of users, browsing history of users, a client computing platform identification associated with a user, a phone number associated with a user, and/or other information related to users.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The information included in the user accounts may include character information. For a given user, the user account may include character information for one or more characters that are associated with the user in the virtual space. The one or more characters may be persistent within the virtual space. The one or more characters may be controllable by the given user in the virtual space. Controlling the one or more characters may enable the given user to advance within the online game (e.g., as the characters progress through the game content available in the virtual space). The given user may be able to control a plurality of the characters within the virtual space simultaneously. The given user may only be able to play one of the characters in the online game in the virtual space at a time. Individual ones of the one or more characters may be unique within the virtual space (e.g., have a unique appearance, a unique name, a unique score or inventory, and/or be unique in other ways). The character(s) for which character information is saved in the user profile of the given user may be exclusive to the given user. That is, the given user may be the only user that controls those character(s). The character information included in the user account for a given character may include one or more of a progress level, a status, a score, an inventory, and/or other information.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The information included in the user accounts may include social network authentication information. Social authentication information for a given user may include authentication information used to log in to a social network platform (e.g., username, password, and/or other authentication information), an identifier or other authentication information assigned to the given user by a social network platform (e.g., without disclosing the authentication information to the given user), an authentication token or key, and/or other authentication information. User account module <b>18</b> may be configured such that an individual user may have a user account that includes social network authentication information from a plurality of different social network platforms. This may enable the user to log in to the virtual space (and/or the online game) from any one of the plurality of different social network platforms. This may enhance accessibility to the virtual space (and/or the online game) for the user, in contrast to convention systems in which a user logging in to an online game can only do so from an individual social network platform.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Authentication module <b>20</b> may be configured to authenticate users to the virtual space (and/or the online game therein). Authenticating users to the virtual space may include receiving authentication requests, determining whether individual ones of the authentication requests are valid, and logging users into the virtual space (and/or the online game) that have submitted valid authentication requests. A valid authentication request may be an authentication request that includes authentication that is valid for one of the users. Determining whether a given authentication request is valid may include referencing one or more user accounts to determine if authentication information in the given authentication request matches authentication information stored in a user account.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In implementations in which users access the virtual space (and/or the online game therein) through the social network platforms provided by social network servers <b>26</b>, authentication module <b>20</b> may be configured to receive authentication requests that are submitted by users through social network servers <b>26</b>. These authentication requests may include social network authentication information. By way of example, a social network platform may include a user interface element that is selectable by a user to initiate access to the virtual space (and/or the online game). Responsive to selection of the user interface element on the social network platform, an authentication request may be transmitted to server <b>12</b>. Authentication module <b>20</b> may be configured to receive the authentication request, and to determine whether it is a valid authentication request (e.g., corresponds to a current user of system <b>10</b>). Responsive to the received authentication request being valid, access to the virtual space (and/or the online game) may be provided to the user. This may include providing views of the virtual space to the user as described herein, and/or facilitating user participation in the online game by controlling one or more characters associated with the user (e.g., one or more characters for which character information is saved in the user account of the user).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Authentication module <b>20</b> is configured such that for an individual user, access may be provided responsive requests from a plurality of different social network platforms. Provided authentication information for the plurality of different social network platforms are included in the user account for the individual user, authentication module <b>20</b> may be configured to receive an authentication request from any of the plurality of different social network platforms and log the individual user into the virtual space through the same user account. This may provide for persistent and/or consistency for the individual user without regard for the social network platform from which the user was authenticated. For example, progress made in the game during a session initiated through a first social network platform may still be reflected in the user account during a subsequent session initiated through a second social network platform.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Space module <b>16</b>, user account module <b>18</b>, and authentication module <b>20</b> may be configured such that users that have logged in to the virtual space from different social network platforms can participate in the virtual space (and/or the online game) together. In other words, responsive to a first user logging in to the virtual space to control a first character, and a second user logging in to the virtual space to control a second character, the first user and the second user may be able to participate in the virtual space (and/or the online game) together. This may mean that the first character (under control of the first user) may appear in the views of the virtual space that are presented to the second user, and/or vice versa (e.g., in a synchronous or asynchronous virtual space).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Social network information module <b>22</b> may be configured to receive user information from social network servers <b>26</b>. The social network information may include information about the users gleaned by the social network platforms through their usage. The social network information may include, for example social graph information (indicating friends or links between users in the social network platforms), usage information (e.g., usage frequency, cumulative use, session length, material viewed, posted, or otherwise interacted with), demographic information, education information, and/or other information.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Social network information module <b>22</b> may be configured to aggregate social network information for individual users. This aggregation may include, for a given user, aggregating social network information that has the same or similar type across multiple social network platforms. As a non-limiting example, social graph information may be combined across multiple social network platforms to provide a more complete view of the social graph of the given user. This aggregated information may be implemented in providing the virtual space and/or the online game to the user. For example, the aggregated information may be implemented to suggest alliances or other relationships within the virtual space, form groups of characters to participate in the online game together, assess user value or potential user value, and/or customize other aspects of the virtual space (and/or the online game). By using aggregated information from a plurality of different social network platforms for an individual user, system <b>10</b> may provide enhanced customization over systems that only use information from a single social network platform.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Notification module <b>24</b> may be configured to generate notifications to social network platforms indicating activity by the users in the online game. This may include, responsive to a user performing an action in the online game that triggers a notification, generating notifications of the action to a plurality of social network platforms on which the user has accounts. The notifications may cause an indication of the action to be displayed on walls of the user in the social network platforms. The notifications may provide indications to users of the social network platforms that are linked with the user (e.g., through a friend relationship, through a link, and/or other relationships). The notifications may be selectable by the other users to gain access to the virtual space (and/or the online game). Generating the notifications for the individual user to a plurality of social network platforms may be enabled by the storage by user account module <b>18</b> of information related to user accounts of the individual user on the plurality of social network platforms (e.g., social network authentication information and/or other information).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Social network servers <b>26</b> may be configured to host a plurality of social network platforms. Social network platforms may include online services or and/or sites that focus on building and reflecting social networks or social relations among people. These services and/or sites may enable users to form connections between each other that signify friendships, kinship, romantic relationships, professional relationships, and/or other relationships. These services and/or sites typically enable communication between users, and may provide individual users with &#x201c;walls&#x201d;. A user's wall in a social network platform may refer to a set of content that is available for viewing by other users (e.g., users that are linked to the user), and pertains to the user. The content on the user's wall may include content posted by the user, content posted by other users (e.g., users linked to the user), and/or other content. Content from the user's wall may be provided to other users (e.g., in their &#x201c;feeds&#x201d;) in a broadcast manner.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, <b>12</b> server, social network servers <b>26</b>, and/or client computing platforms <b>14</b> may be operatively linked via one or more electronic communication links. For example, such electronic communication links may be established, at least in part, via a network such as the Internet and/or other networks.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A given client computing platform <b>14</b> may include one or more processors, and electronic display, a control interface, and/or other components. The one or more processors may be configured to execute computer program modules. The computer program modules may be configured to enable or user associated with the given client computing platform <b>14</b> to interface with system <b>10</b>, and/or provide other functionality attributed herein to client computing platforms <b>14</b>. For example, the computer program modules may include a view module configured to receive view information from server <b>12</b> (e.g., generated by space module <b>16</b>), and to present a view of the virtual game environment (e.g., as described above) based on the received view information. This may facilitate participation by the user of the given client computing platform <b>14</b> in the game taking place in the virtual game environment. By way of non-limiting example, the given client computing platform <b>14</b> may include one or more of a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a handheld computer, a tablet computing platform, a NetBook, a Smartphone, a gaming console, and/or other computing platforms.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The server <b>12</b> may include electronic storage <b>50</b>, one or more processors <b>52</b>, and/or other components. The server <b>12</b> may include communication lines, or ports to enable the exchange of information with a network and/or other computing platforms. Illustration of server <b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is not intended to be limiting. The server <b>12</b> may include a plurality of hardware, software, and/or firmware components operating together to provide the functionality attributed herein to server <b>12</b>. For example, server <b>12</b> may be implemented &#x201c;in the cloud&#x201d; by a plurality of computing platforms operating together as server <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Electronic storage <b>50</b> may comprise electronic storage media that electronically stores information. The electronic storage media of electronic storage <b>50</b> may include one or both of system storage that is provided integrally (i.e., substantially non-removable) with server <b>50</b> and/or removable storage that is removably connectable to server <b>50</b> via, for example, a port (e.g., a USB port, a firewire port, etc.) or a drive (e.g., a disk drive, etc.). Electronic storage <b>50</b> may include one or more of optically readable storage media (e.g., optical disks, etc.), magnetically readable storage media (e.g., magnetic tape, magnetic hard drive, floppy drive, etc.), electrical charge-based storage media (e.g., EEPROM, RAM, etc.), solid-state storage media (e.g., flash drive, etc.), and/or other electronically readable storage media. The electronic storage <b>50</b> may include one or more virtual storage resources (e.g., cloud storage, a virtual private network, and/or other virtual storage resources). Electronic storage <b>50</b> may store software algorithms, information determined by processor <b>52</b>, information received from server <b>12</b>, information received from client computing platforms <b>14</b>, and/or other information that enables server <b>12</b> to function as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Processor(s) <b>52</b> is configured to provide information processing capabilities in server <b>12</b>. As such, processor <b>52</b> may include one or more of a digital processor, an analog processor, a digital circuit designed to process information, an analog circuit designed to process information, a state machine, and/or other mechanisms for electronically processing information.
