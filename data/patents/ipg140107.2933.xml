<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The naturally produced spinosyn compounds consist of a 5,6,5-tricylic ring system, fused to a 12-membered macrocyclic lactone, a neutral sugar (rhamnose) and an amino sugar (forosamine) (see Kirst et al. (1991). If the amino sugar is not present the compounds have been referred to as the pseudoaglycone of A, D, etc., and if the neutral sugar is not present then the compounds have been referred to as the reverse pseudoaglycone of A, D, etc. A more preferred nomenclature is to refer to the pseudoaglycones as spinosyn A 17-Psa, spinosyn D 17-Psa, etc., and to the reverse pseudoaglycones as spinosyn A 9-Psa, spinosyn D 9-Psa, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The naturally produced spinosyn compounds may be produced via fermentation from cultures NRRL 18395, 18537, 18538, 18539, 18719, 18720, 18743 and 18823. These cultures have been deposited and made part of the stock culture collection of the Midwest Area Northern Regional Research Center, Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 1815 North University Street, Peoria, Ill. 61604.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">WO 01/19840 discloses spinosyn analogs produced by culturing <i>Saccharopolyspora </i>species LW107129 (NRRL 30141).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">WO 99/46387 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,143,526 disclose the spinosyn biosynthetic genes from <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa. </i></p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The nature of the genes involved in spinosyn biosynthesis, together with previous studies of precursor incorporation (Broughton et al., 1991), indicate that spinosyns are produced by the stepwise condensation of 2-carbon and 3-carbon carboxylic acids to generate a polyketide that is cyclized and bridged. The tetracyclic, aglycone product of these reactions is converted to the pseudoaglycone by addition of a rhamnosyl residue, and synthesis is completed by the addition of the di-N-methylated sugar, forosamine. In some aspects, this process is similar to the biosynthetic pathway by which other macrolides (such as the antibiotic erythromycin, the antihelmintic avermectin, and the immunosuppressant rapamycin) are produced. In particular, the polyketide nucleus is assembled by a very large, multifunctional protein that is a Type I polyketide synthase (spn PKS). This polypeptide complex comprises a loading module and ten extension modules, each module being responsible for both the addition of a specific acyl-CoA precursor to the growing polyketide chain, and for the degree of reduction of the &#x3b2;-keto carbonyl group. Each module performs several biochemical reactions which are carried out by specific domains of the polypeptide. All the extension modules contain an acyl transferase (AT) domain that donates the acyl group from a precursor to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain, and a &#x3b2;-ketosynthase (KS) domain that adds the pre-existing polyketide chain to the new acyl-ACP by decarboxylative condensation. Additional domains are present in some extension modules: &#x3b2;-ketoreductase (KR) domains reduce &#x3b2;-keto groups to hydroxyls, dehydratase (DH) domains remove hydroxyls to leave double bonds, and the enoyl reductase (ER) domain reduces a double bond to leave a saturated carbon. The loading module of the spn PKS is different from the extension modules in that it contains a variant KS domain (KSq), as well as AT and ACP domains. The KSq domain, which is also found in some other Type I PKS loading modules (but not all), is believed to provide the requisite starter unit by decarboxylation of an ACP-bound acyl chain (Bisang et al., 1999). The terminal extension module contains a thioesterase/cyclase (TE) domain that liberates the polyketide chain from the PKS.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The spinosyn PKS DNA region consists of 5 ORFs with in-frame stop codons at the end of some ACP domains, similar to the PKS ORFs in the other macrolide-producing bacteria. The five spinosyn PKS genes are arranged head-to-tail, without any intervening non-PKS functions such as the insertion element found between the erythromycin PKS genes AI and AII (Donadio et al., 1993). They are designated spnA, spnB, spnC, spnD, and spnE. The nucleotide sequence for each of the five spinosyn PKS genes, and the corresponding polypeptides, are identified in U.S. Pat. No. 6,143,526 and in Waldron et al., 2001. Also identified in these sources are the predicted translation products of the PKS genes, and the boundaries of the domains and modules.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">After it is synthesized, the spinosyn polyketide precursor condenses to form a macrocyclic lactone, referred to hereinafter as the polyketide nucleus. Production of insecticidally-active spinosyns requires additional processing of the polyketide nucleus. First, carbon-carbon bridges must be formed between C3 and C14, C4 and C12, and C7 and C11, to generate the aglycone intermediate. Possible mechanisms for these unusual reactions have been suggested (Waldron et al., 2001), but the structural features of the polyketide substrate that are required for them to occur are not known. Second, a tri-O-methyl rhamnose must be incorporated at C9 to generate the pseudoaglycone. It is not known if the rhamnose is normally methylated before or after its addition to the aglycone, but <i>S. spinosa </i>is capable of adding the methyl groups after the rhamnose moiety has been conjugated to the aglycone (Broughton et al., 1991). The methylations must occur in a particular sequence (2&#x2032; then 3&#x2032; then 4&#x2032;) or not all of them will take place, indicating that the methyltransferases have very specific substrate requirements. The third processing step, addition of forosamine at C17, is needed to produce the most active spinosyns. The enzymes involved in this step also have stringent substrate requirements: the forosaminyl transferase will not use the aglycone as a substrate, and the N-methyltransferase will not act on the forosamine after it has been attached to the pseudoaglycone. This substrate-specificity of later biosynthetic enzymes may be a barrier to producing novel, biologically-active spinosyns from precursors with different chemical structures.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain cases polyketide synthase (PKS) genes have previously been manipulated with the objective of providing novel polyketides. In-frame deletion of the DNA encoding part of the KR domain in module 5 of the erythromycin-producing (ery) PKS has been shown to lead to the formation of erythromycin analogues, namely 5,6-dideoxy-3alpha-mycarosyl-5-oxoerythronolide B and 5,6-dideoxy-5-oxoerythronolide B (Donadio et al., 1991). Likewise, alteration of active site residues in the ER domain of module 4 of the ery PKS, by genetic engineering of the corresponding PKS-encoding DNA and its introduction into <i>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</i>, led to the production of 6,7-anhydroerythromycin C (Donadio et al., 1993). WO 93/13663 describes additional types of genetic manipulation of the ery PKS genes that are capable of producing altered polyketides.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">WO 98/01546 discloses replacement of the loading module of the ery PKS with the loading module from the avermectin (dye) PKS, to produce a hybrid Type I PKS gene that incorporates different starter units to make novel erythromycin analogues.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, it has also been found that not all manipulations of PKS genes produce the targeted new analogues. When Donadio et al. (1993) inactivated an ER domain of the ery PKS, the resulting anhydro-derivative could not be completely processed because it was no longer a substrate for the mycarose-O-methyltransferase. Changing the polyketide starter unit prevented complete elongation and elaboration of a rifamycin analogue in <i>Amycolatopsis mediterranei </i>(Hunziker et al., 1998). Given the extensive substrate-specific processing that is required to generate insecticidally-active spinosyns, it is not obvious that genetic modifications which change the structure of a spinosyn polyketide will permit synthesis of a fully-processed molecule with useful biological activity. However, if such analogues could be made, and they had a different spectrum of insecticidal activity, they would be highly desirable because known spinosyns do not control all pests.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one of its aspects, the invention provides a hybrid spinosyn polyketide synthase that is capable of functioning in <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>to produce a biologically active spinosyn, said hybrid polyketide synthase comprising a heterologous loading module operatively associated with a plurality of <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>extender modules. In preferred embodiments, the spinosyn loading domain is replaced with the loading domain for the erythromycin PKS or avermectin PKS. The ave and ery loading domains are of particular interest because they accept a variety of starter units. Also useful are hybrid PKS genes in which the heterologous loading module incorporates an unusual starter unit, such as the loading module for rapamycin (cyclohexene carboxylic acid) or for myxathiazole (3-methyl butyric acid). The required precursors, e.g. cyclohexene carboxylic acid or 3-methyl butyric acid, may be provided in the culture medium, or the genes encoding their biosynthetic enzymes may be engineered into the organism so they are synthesized endogenously.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another of its aspects, the invention provides a hybrid spinosyn polyketide synthase that is capable of functioning in <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>to produce a biologically active 6-ethyl spinosyn compound, 16-ethyl spinosyn compound, 18-ethyl spinosyn compound, or 20-ethyl spinosyn compound, said hybrid polyketide synthase being the product produced by spinosyn biosynthetic DNA that has been modified so that the DNA for the AT domain of module 8, 3, 2, or 1, respectively, in the spinosyn PKS is replaced with DNA for an AT domain that normally incorporates ethyl malonyl-CoA. In preferred embodiments, the DNA that encodes the relevant spinosyn AT domain is replaced with the DNA that encodes the AT domain of module 5 of the tylosin PKS or module 5 of the monensin PKS. In preferred embodiments, the <i>Streptomyces cinnamonensis </i>crotonyl-CoA reductase is co-expressed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another of its aspects, the invention provides a hybrid spinosyn polyketide synthase that is capable of functioning in <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>to produce a biologically active 18-methyl spinosyn compound, or 20-methyl spinosyn compound, said hybrid polyketide synthase being the product produced by spinosyn biosynthetic DNA that has been modified so that the DNA for the AT domain of module 2 or 1, respectively, in the spinosyn PKS is replaced with DNA for an AT domain that normally incorporates methyl malonyl-CoA.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another of its aspects, the invention provides a hybrid spinosyn polyketide synthase that is capable of functioning in <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>to produce a biologically active 16-desmethyl spinosyn compound, said hybrid polyketide synthase being the product produced by spinosyn biosynthetic DNA that has been modified so that the DNA for the AT domain of module 3 in the spinosyn PKS is replaced with DNA for an AT domain that normally incorporates malonyl-CoA. In a preferred embodiment the AT domain of module 3 is replaced with the DNA that encodes the AT domain of module 2 of the rapamycin PKS</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another of its aspects, the invention provides a process for producing a 6-ethyl spinosyn compound, a 21-desethyl-21-n-propyl spinosyn compound, or a 6-ethyl-21-desethyl-21-propyl spinosyn compound which comprises culturing a transgenic host organism that coexpresses crotonyl-CoA reductase with the spinosyn biosynthetic pathway. In a preferred embodiment the host organism is transformed with DNA encoding the <i>S. cinnamonensis </i>crotonyl-CoA reductase.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another of its aspects, the invention provides a <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>strain that has been transformed with DNA encoding the <i>S. cinnamonensis </i>crotonyl-CoA reductase.</p>

Culture Characteristics
</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0102">The novel strains derived from <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>NRRL 18537 or <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>NRRL 18538 and producing the compounds of the invention had the following culture characteristics:</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0103">All cultures grew well on ISP2 and Bennett's agar and aerial hyphae were produced on all media used. The aerial spore mass was predominately white (developing a pale pink hue with age). Substrate mycelium was cream to light tan in color, no distinctive pigment was apparent. A soluble brown pigment was released into the medium. No significant differences were observed on any of the media used.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Manipulation of Spinosyn Pathway and Accessory Genes</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0104">In order to facilitate the manipulation of the spinosyn biosynthetic pathway, cosmids pRHB9A6 and pRHB3E11 were obtained and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,350 B1 and Waldron et al. (2001).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0105">It is not directly apparent from the sequence of the spinosyn biosynthetic genes how production of spinosyns is regulated. In order to avoid potential complications associated with regulation of the gene cluster, a number of heterologous promoters were used to drive all or part of the polyketide synthase portion (genes spnA, spnB, spnC, spnD and spnE). The following promoters were found to be at least as efficient in the production of spinosyn PKS as the natural promoter (judged by production of the final products spinosyn A, spinosyn D, spinosyn A C17-pseudoaglycone, and spinosyn D C17-pseudoaglycone): The actI promoter from the actinorhodin biosynthetic cluster of <i>S. coelicolor</i>, used along with its cognate activator, actII-ORF4, (as described in WO 98/01546, WO 98/01571, Rowe et al. 1998) and; The promoter for the resistance to pristinamycin. The latter has previously been reported to drive overexpression of polyketide genes from <i>S. erythraea </i>(Blanc et al. 1995; Sala-Bey et al. 1995). It is a promoter that can be induced by physiological stresses in <i>Streptomyces </i>spp. The use of heterologous promoters in <i>S. spinosa </i>is not limited to those described above, and could include others which might be expected to function in <i>S. spinosa. </i></p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Hybrid Spinosyn PKS Using Heterologous Loading Module</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0106">In one of its aspects the invention provides hybrid PKSs that are functional in <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>to generate polyketides that are processed to biologically-active spinosyns. The resulting polyketides were extended to the same length as the natural spinosyns, and processed by cross-bridging and glycosylation to generate novel insecticidal spinosyns. Preferably the hybrid PKS comprises the extension modules from the spn PKS with a heterologous loading module that leads to a spinosyn polyketide having a different starter unit. Hybrid spinosyn PKS genes that contain the spn extender modules behind a heterologous loading module can provide novel spinosyns with different side chains at C21. The nature of this side chain is determined by the starter unit which the loading module selects to initiate polyketide synthesis. Changes in the side chain may alter the physical properties or biological activity of the resulting spinosyn. It is particularly useful to provide a hybrid PKS gene in which the loading module accepts many different carboxylic acids, including unnatural acids. Such a gene can be used to generate many different spinosyns by incorporation of different starter units. For example, the loading module of the spn PKS can be replaced by the loading module of the ave PKS, which is known to accept a wide variety of starter units (Dutton et al., 1991). The loading module of the ery PKS is also known to accept alternate starter units (Pacey et al., 1998). Thus, an organism expressing such hybrid spinosyn PKS genes can produce novel spinosyns in which the nature of the side chain at C21 is determined by the carboxylic acid that is fed to the organism. The side chains can be of different lengths, with branches or cycles, and/or contain heteroatoms.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0107">More preferably, the hybrid PKS includes a loading module that accepts many different carboxylic acids so the hybrid gene assembly can be used to produce many different spinosyns. Particularly useful examples contain the spn extension modules with the loading module from the erythromycin (ery) PKS, or the loading module from the avermectin (ave) PKS.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">a. Hybrid Spinosyn PKS Using ery Loading Module</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0108">The loading module of the erythromycin biosynthetic cluster (eryATOACP0) governs the introduction of propionyl-CoA into the starter of the erythromycin molecule. It has been shown previously that alternative starters can be incorporated into the erythromycin molecule by feeding free acids to the production medium (Pacey et al. 1998).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0109">As shown in the following Examples, generation of a hybrid spnA gene in which the erythromycin loading module replaces the spinosyn loading module leads to a spinosyn PKS which can accept free acids into the starter unit. In the following illustrative Example, the erythromycin loading module was spliced to the beginning of the spinosyn KS1 just within the KS domain in the conserved region. New domain or module connections are preferably made at conserved DNA sequences within domains, or close to the edges thereof; however, an active polyketide synthase can alternatively be generated by engineering splice sites in the interdomain regions (WO 98/01546).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0110">The ery load fragment was cloned in-frame with, and upstream of, a region of spnA to allow homologous recombination with the native spn PKS. Upstream of the ery load was either the actI promoter (P<sub>actI</sub>)) or the promoter for resistance to pristinamycin (P<sub>ptr</sub>), giving rise to the plasmids pLSB61 and pLSB62 respectively. These plasmids are based on pKC1132 and are therefore apramycin-resistant. They also carry oriT for conjugal transfer of DNA into actinomycetes (Bierman et al. 1992, Matsushima et al. 1994). These constructs were transformed into <i>S. spinosa </i>NRRL 18537 by conjugation. Exconjugants were confirmed to contain the hybrid ery/spn PKS under the appropriate promoter by PCR amplification.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0111"><i>S. spinosa </i>NRRL 18537:pLSB62 was designated <i>S. spinosa </i>13E, and was used for analysis of spinosyn production.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0112">As demonstrated in the following Examples, when cultured in production media, <i>S. spinosa </i>13E produced mainly spinosyn A and spinosyn E, in approximately equal amounts. The total yield of spinosyns was estimated to be approximately 10-25% of the wild-type spinosyn A levels, which represented an increase in yield of spinosyn E of approximately 10-fold. This altered ratio of products may be a reflection of looser specificity of the ery loading module relative to the spn loading module, or a reflection of the different substrate supply in <i>S. spinosa </i>compared with <i>S. erythraea</i>, or a combination of both. Incorporation of acetate by the ery load has been observed in <i>S. erythraea </i>when the erythromycin pathway is up-regulated (Rowe et al. 1998). The increase in yield of spinosyn E in strain 13E over wild-type levels means that this would be a preferred strain for the production of spinosyn E.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0113">A number of carboxylic acids were fed to <i>S. spinosa </i>13E, leading to the production of novel spinosyn analogues with altered starter units. Among the novel spinosyns identified were 21-desethyl-21-cyclopropyl spinosyns A and D (by incorporation of cyclopropane carboxylic acid), 21-desethyl-21-cyclobutyl spinosyns A and D (by incorporation of cyclobutane carboxylic acid) and 21-desethyl-21-methylthiomethyl spinosyns A and D (from methylthioacetic acid). The novel analogues showed reasonable chromatographic retention times, characteristic UV chromophores and MS fragmentation patterns, and the predicted structures were supported by accurate mass measurements. Structural assignments of the isolated 21-cyclopropyl and 21-cyclobutyl compounds were confirmed by full NMR characterization. Compounds isolated were active in insect control assays.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0114">The use of strain <i>S. spinosa </i>13E is not limited to the production of these compounds. It is expected that a number of other spinosyn analogues can be identified by feeding other acids, such as those used to produce novel erythromycins (Pacey et al. 1998).</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Construction of pCJR81</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0115">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Plasmid pCJR81 is a vector for expression of polyketide genes under the promoter for resistance to pristinamycin. It was constructed as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0116">Two overlapping oligos were designed to perform a PCR reaction in which they act both as primers and template. They were designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site incorporating the ATG start codon, such that genes can be cloned with optimal spacing from the ribosome binding site. A SpeI restriction site was incorporated to facilitate further cloning. The oligos are PRIS1 (SEQ ID NO:1) and PRIS2(SEQ ID NO:2).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0117">Amplification to obtain the promoter fragment was performed with Pwo thermostable DNA polymerase using the manufacturer's conditions. The 112 by fragment was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and cloned into commercially-available pUC18 digested with SmaI and dephosphorylated. Plasmids containing inserts were sequenced. One plasmid containing the correct sequence was designated pRIS4.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0118">The 94 by insert from pRIS4 was excised as a SpeI/NdeI fragment (SEQ ID NO:3) and cloned into pCJR24 (WO 98/01546, WO 98/01571, Rowe et al. 1998) which had been previously digested with SpeI and NdeI. One correct plasmid was designated pCJR81.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0119">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Plasmids pLSB2 and pLSB3 were constructed for expression of polyketide genes or accessory genes in <i>S. spinosa</i>. Plasmid pLSB2 contains the actI promoter (P<sub>actI</sub>) and its cognate activator, actII-ORF4. Plasmid pLSB3 contains the promoter for resistance to pristinamycin (P<sub>ptr</sub>). These plasmids were constructed as follows:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0120">Plasmid pKC1132 (Bierman et al. 1992) contains an origin of transfer (oriT), and an apramycin resistance marker for selection in both <i>E. coli </i>and actinomycetes. It can therefore be used for DNA manipulations in <i>E. coli</i>, and permit the final plasmids to be introduced into <i>S. spinosa </i>by conjugation. The polylinker of pKC1132 was replaced by a linker of two oligos CR311 (SEQ ID NO:4) and CR312 (SEQ ID NO:5) in order to provide appropriate EcoRV/SpeI/NdeI/XbaI restriction sites.</li>
    <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0121">Plasmid pKC1132 was digested with PvuII and the ends dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The oligos CR311 and CR312 were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed and cloned into pKC1132_PvuII to generate pLSB1. A SpeI/NdeI fragment containing the actinorhodin pathway specific activator, actII-ORF4 and the actI promoter was isolated from pCJR24 (WO 98/01546, WO 98/01571, Rowe et al. 1998) and a SpeI/NdeI fragment containing the promoter for resistance to pristinamycin was isolated from pCJR81 (described above, Example 1). Each of these fragments was cloned independently into pLSB1 digested with SpeI and NdeI to generate pLSB2 (containing actII-ORF4 and P<sub>actI</sub>) and pLSB3 (containing P<sub>ptr</sub>).</li>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Construction of a Vector to Incorporate the Loading Module of the Erythromycin Polyketide Synthase into the Spinosyn Polyketide Synthase</heading>
<p id="p-0098" num="0122">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The vector to incorporate the loading module of the erythromycin polyketide synthase into the spinosyn polyketide synthase contains the erythromycin loading module (AT0ACP0), followed by a region of the first module of the spinosyn PKS to provide homology for integration. The vector is designated pLSB62 and was constructed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0123">The erythromycin loading module was amplified by PCR using pCJR26 (Rowe et al. 1998) as the template, and oligos SP28 (SEQ ID NO:6) and SP29 (SEQ ID NO:7). SP28 incorporates an NdeI site at the start codon of the ery sequence, and SP29 incorporates an NheI site at the beginning of the KS1 domain.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0124">The PCR fragment was phosphorylated, gel-purified and cloned into pUC18 which had been previously digested with SmaI and dephosphorylated. Clones were screened for the presence of inserts and sequenced. One clone containing the correct sequence was designated pLSB44. It contained the insert in the orientation with the NheI site close to the EcoRI site of the polylinker. The sequence of the erythromycin loading module fragment used, from the NdeI site to the NheI site is shown in SEQ ID NO 8.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0125">Plasmid pLSB8 (described in Example 11) contains a fragment of spnA starting with the NheI site at spnKS1. The fragment containing the erythromycin loading module was excised from pLSB44 as an NdeI/NheI fragment and cloned into pLSB8 previously digested with NdeI and NheI, to give pLSB56. The fragment contained in pLSB56 contains the erythromycin loading module spliced in-frame to the spinosyn KS1, with a region of homology to spnA which is sufficient for integration to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0126">This region was removed as an NdeI/XbaI fragment and cloned into pLSB3 to give pLSB62. This places the new ery/spn hybrid fragment under P<sub>ptr</sub>, in a vector which can be transferred into <i>S. spinosa </i>by conjugation and selected using the apramycin resistance marker.</p>

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Production of Metabolites by <i>S. spinosa </i>13E Fermentation</heading>
<p id="p-0106" num="0137"><i>S. spinosa </i>13E was cultured from a frozen vegetative stock (1:1 CSM culture:cryopreservative, where the cryopreservative is 10% lactose, 20% glycerol w/v in water). A primary pre-culture was grown in CSM medium (tryptic soy broth 30 g/l, yeast extract 3 g/l, magnesium sulfate 2 g/l, glucose 5 g/l, maltose 4 g/l; Hosted and Baltz 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,634), in a 50 mL culture in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with a steel spring, shaken at 250 rpm with a two-inch throw at 30&#xb0; C., 75% relative humidity for 3 days. This was used to inoculate a secondary pre-culture in vegetative medium (glucose 10 g/l, N-Z-amine A 30 g/l, yeast extract 3 g/l, magnesium sulfate 2 g/l; Strobel and Nakatsukasa 1993; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,634) at 5% v/v, which was cultured under the same conditions for a further 2 days. The secondary vegetative pre-culture was used to inoculate production medium (glucose 67 g/l, Proflo cottonseed flour 25 g/l, peptonized milk nutrient 22 g/l, corn steep liquor 12 g/l, methyl oleate 40 g/l, calcium carbonate 5 g/l, pH to 7.0 with sodium hydroxide; Strobel and Nakatsukasa 1993) at 5% v/v. Small scale production cultures were fermented under the same conditions as the pre-cultures, but for 7-10 days. For initial <i>S. spinosa </i>13E production, small-scale cultures were grown in 30 mL of production medium in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with springs for 7 days.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0138">For the identification of metabolites produced, a 1 mL aliquot of fermentation broth was analyzed by LC-MS as described in Example 5. By comparison to authentic standards, and to a fermentation extract from non-transformed strain <i>S. spinosa </i>NRRL 18537, the major compounds produced by <i>S. spinosa </i>13E were identified as spinosyns A and E (which are produced in approximately equal amounts) and spinosyn D (which was observed as a minor product). The titer of strain <i>S. spinosa </i>13E was &#x2dc;10-15 mg/l of total spinosyns. The ratio of products for <i>S. spinosa </i>13E was different to NRRL 18537, with the relative production of spinosyn E being significantly increased.</p>

<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Precursor-Directed Production of Novel Spinosyns from <i>S. spinosa </i>13E (Production of Compounds 1-6)</heading>
<p id="p-0108" num="0139">The ery/spn hybrid PKS was used to generate novel spinosyn metabolites by feeding carboxylic acids to production cultures. The ery loading module incorporated the carboxylic acid within the starter of the molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0140">Parallel production flasks (30 mL in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with spring) were inoculated as described in Example 6 above. After 24 h each of these was fed with a carboxylic acid (stock solutions made in water and pH adjusted to 6.5 with sodium hydroxide) at a final concentration of 2-6 mM. After 7 days a 1 mL aliquot of fermentation broth was analyzed by LC-MS as described in Example 5. The incorporation of cyclobutyl carboxylic acid, cyclopropyl carboxylic acid and methylthioacetic acid to generate novel C21 modified spinosyns was indicated by the appearance of novel peaks in the UV and MS chromatograms (Table 5). The MS spectra of the novel compounds gave ions for the [M+H]<sup>+</sup> species and for the forosamine fragment (142.3).</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0142">Frozen vegetative stocks of <i>S. spinosa </i>13E were inoculated into primary vegetative pre-cultures in CSM (50 mL incubated in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with spring). Secondary pre-cultures in vegetative medium (250 mL incubated in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask with spring) were prepared and incubated as described in Example 6, but at 300 rpm with a one-inch throw.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0143">Twelve to 14 L of production medium was prepared, as in Example 6, with the addition of 0.01% v/v Pluronic L-0101 (BASF) antifoam. Production medium was inoculated with the secondary vegetative pre-culture at 5% v/v, and allowed to ferment in a 20 L stirred bioreactor for 7-10 days at 30&#xb0; C. Airflow was set at 0.75 vvm, over pressure was set at 0.5 barg or below, and impeller tip speed was controlled between 0.39 and 1.57 ms<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in order to maintain dissolved oxygen tension at or above 30% of air saturation. Additional Pluronic L0101 (BASF) was added to control foaming, if needed. Cyclobutyl carboxylic acid was fed to the bioreactor at 25 hours, to a final concentration of 5 mM. The fermentation broth was harvested after 7 days and clarified by centrifugation to provide supernatant and cells. The cells (1 L) were extracted by mixing thoroughly with an equal volume of methanol then allowed to stand for 30 mM The cell-methanol slurry was centrifuged, and the supernatant decanted off. The procedure was repeated. The fermentation supernatant (12 L) was adjusted to pH&#x2dc;10 by addition of 5 N NaOH and stirred gently with 0.75 volumes of ethyl acetate for 8 hours. The upper phase was removed by aspiration and the extraction repeated. The ethyl acetate and methanol fractions were combined and the solvents removed in vacuo to yield a yellow-brown oil/aqueous mixture (1 L). This was mixed with ethyl acetate (2 L) and extracted with a solution of 50 mM tartaric acid (3&#xd7;1.5 L). The tartaric acid extracts were combined, adjusted to pH&#x2dc;10 with 5 N NaOH, and extracted with ethyl acetate (3&#xd7;1.5 L). The ethyl acetate extracts were combined and the solvent removed in vacuo to leave a brown oily residue (7.5 g). The residue was dissolved into ethyl acetate (500 mL) and extracted three times with 50 mM tartaric acid (350 mL). The tartaric acid fractions were combined, adjusted to pH&#x2dc;10 and re-extracted with ethyl acetate (3&#xd7;500 mL).

<p id="h-0032" num="0000">b. Hybrid Spinosyn PKS Using ave Loading Domain</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0191">The loading module of the avermectin biosynthetic cluster (aveAT0ACP0) governs the introduction of C-2 branched starter units into the avermectin molecule, derived from iso-butyryl-CoA and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA. There is precedent for the swapping of this loading domain into the erythromycin PKS pathway to give novel polyketides with the starter unit specificity of the avermectin system (WO 98/01546, WO 98/01571, Marsden et al. 1998). The avermectin loading module has also been shown to incorporate CoA-esters of a broad range of free acids from the production medium, either in its native environment, or as part of the ave/cry hybrid pathway (Pacey et al. 1998). The avermectin loading module swap described in the literature is actually a replacement of the erythromycin AT0ACP0 by the avermectin AT0ACP0. This leads to a piece of erythromycin DNA sequence upstream of the avermectin AT0 between the start codon and a SpeI site. This was included in the ave/cry experiment because the N-terminal region (upstream of the homologous AT domain) is much larger in the erythromycin loading module than in that of avermectin, and may be important for stability of the protein. Because the resulting hybrid had been productive, the same region was used for the ave/spn hybrid. In effect, the resulting hybrid gene is an ery/ave/spn hybrid, but since it transfers the specificity of the avermectin loading module to the spinosyn PKS, it has been designated an ave/spn hybrid through-out.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0192">The avermectin loading module (AT0ACP0) was cloned from pIG1 (WO 98/01546, WO 98/01571, Marsden et al. 1998) in-frame and upstream of the spnKS1, under the control of either P<sub>actI</sub>, or P<sub>ptr</sub>. The same splice site, at the beginning edge of the KS1 homologous region, was used as for the ery load experiment described above. A region of homology for integration was incorporated from pRHB3E11. The resulting plasmids, pLSB29 (with the hybrid PKS region under the control of P<sub>actI</sub>) and pLSB30 (with the hybrid PKS region under the control of P<sub>ptr</sub>) are based on pKC1132 and therefore contain the apramycin resistance marker for selection both in <i>E. coli </i>and <i>S. spinosa</i>, and the oriT for conjugal transfer of DNA from <i>E. coli </i>to <i>S. spinosa </i>(Bierman et al. 1992, Matsushima et al. 1994). These constructs were transformed into <i>S. spinosa </i>NRRL 18538 by conjugation. Exconjugants were confirmed to contain the hybrid ave/spn PKS gene under the appropriate promoter by PCR analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0193"><i>S. spinosa </i>NRRL 18538:pLSB29 was designated <i>S. spinosa </i>21K2. It produced mainly spinosyns E, A and D by incorporation of acetate and propionate into the loading module. Additional small peaks were observed in LC-MS, with masses that were consistent with the novel natural products 21-desethyl-21-iso-propyl spinosyn A and 21-desethyl-21-sec-butyl spinosyn A and the equivalent D analogues. These minor products resulted from incorporation of iso-butyrate and 2-methyl butyrate respectively into the starter. In avermectin biosynthesis itself, the ave loading module recruits only these branched starters. However, a broader spectrum of products was observed when the ave loading module was spliced upstream of the KS1 in the erythromycin PKS, indicating that such a hybrid can incorporate acetate and propionate as well. We therefore observed the expected range of products from this engineered <i>S. spinosa </i>strain.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0194">The structure of isolated 21-desethyl-21-iso-propyl spinosyn A was confirmed by NMR characterization. 21-desethyl-21-n-propyl spinosyn A was isolated as a minor component from the production culture of 21-desethyl-21-iso-propyl spinosyn A. The 21-n-propyl analogue, presumably made by the loading module taking butyrate from the medium, was also fully characterized. Both were active in insect control assays.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0195">Some of the natural versatility of the loading module of the avermectin PKS had previously been transferred to the erythromycin system, so a broad range of free acids was fed to <i>S. spinosa </i>21K2 to generate spinosyns with altered starter units. Novel spinosyn compounds were identified on the basis of UV chromophore, mass and mass spectral fragmentation, along with the knowledge of which acid was fed and therefore which compounds were expected from each experiment. To confirm the structure predictions made, a number of spinosyn analogues with novel C21 starter groups were isolated and fully characterized.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0196">Free acids which can be used in this way include, but are not limited to, the following: Cyclic organic acids including cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl and 2-methylcyclopropyl; heteroatom containing cyclic organic acids including 2-furoic acid, 3-furoic acid, thiophene carboxylic acid and methyl thiophene carboxylic acid; branched chain carboxylic acids; and some other acids which included methylthioacetic acid, chloroacetic acid, cyanoacetic acid and methoxyacetic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0197">Such feeding experiments lead to analogues of spinosyns (a spinosyn being a macrolide with a 22-membered tetracyclic nucleus of the type illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 and in Formula I) in which C21 bears a side chain other than ethyl, generally an alpha-branched C2-C5 alkyl group, a C3-C8 cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group (optionally substituted e.g. with one or more hydroxy, C1-4 alkyl or alkoxy groups or halogen atoms), or a 3-6 membered heterocycle containing O or S, saturated or fully or partially unsaturated, optionally substituted (as for cycloalkyl). Preferred candidates for the C21 substituent are the groups of carboxylate units useable as substrates by the ery or ave loading modules. Preferred substrates include cyclobutane carboxylic acid and cyclopropane carboxylic acid. Other possibilities include n-butyric acid, iso-propyl carboxylic acid, 2-(S)-methylbutyric acid, 2-methylcyclopropane carboxylic acid, 3-furoic acid and methylthioacetic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0198">Feeding the branched chain acids iso-propyl and 2-methyl butyl carboxylic acid did not alter the yield of novel natural products made due to the normal specificity of the ave load. These products were observed in all healthy cultures of <i>S. spinosa </i>21K2 in low yield.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0199">Cyclobutyl carboxylic acid was accepted by the ave loading module to give the A and D analogues, and a substantial proportion of the C17-pseudoaglycone of the A analogue. The cyclobutyl products were observed at higher levels than in the fed hybrid ery/spn system, with 21-desethyl-21-cyclobutyl spinosyn A at &#x2dc;5-10 mg/liter, 21-desethyl-21-cyclobutyl spinosyn D at lower but significant levels and 21-desethyl-21-cyclobutyl spinosyn A 17-pseudoaglycone at &#x2dc;10-15 mg/liter. The cyclopropyl carboxylic acid feed was also successful, yielding 21-desethyl-21-cyclopropyl spinosyns A and D. The two cyclobutyl analogues and the cyclopropyl A analogue were shown to be identical to the purified compounds isolated from the ery load experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0200">Methylthioacetic acid was incorporated to give the 21-desethyl-21-methylthiomethyl spinosyn A, at yields comparable to those of the cyclobutyl experiment above. This was a significant improvement in yield over production of the same compound from the ery load experiment. 2-furoic acid and methylcyclopropyl carboxylic acid were also incorporated to give the expected novel products.</p>

<heading id="h-0034" level="1">Construction of a Vector to Incorporate the Loading Module of the Avermectin Polyketide Synthase into the Spinosyn Polyketide Synthase</heading>
<p id="p-0149" num="0201">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The vector to incorporate the loading module of the avermectin polyketide synthase into the spinosyn polyketide synthase contains the avermectin loading module (AT0ACP0) followed by a region of the first module of the spinosyn PKS to provide homology for integration. The vector is designated pLSB29 and was constructed as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0202">The avermectin loading module has been previously spliced upstream of the erythromycin module 1 (WO 98/01546, WO 98/01571, Marsden et al. 1998). In this ave/ery hybrid the loading module had the DNA coding for the ery amino acid sequence at the start, followed by the AT0ACP0 of the ave PKS. This hybrid fragment conferred the specificity of the avermectin loading domain, although it included a small amount of ery sequence. The same fragment was used in this experiment, and leads to an ery/ave/spn hybrid protein. We describe it simply as an ave/spn hybrid since it is the specificity of the avermectin loading domain that is conferred on the spinosyn pathway. The fragment begins with an NdeI site incorporating the start codon, and ends with a NheI site engineered at the beginning of the KS1. This introduces a conservative amino acid change (Ile-Leu) in the spinosyn KS1 sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0203">To introduce the NheI site, the region of spnA from the beginning of the KS1 was amplified by PCR using pRHB3E11 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,350 B1, Waldron et al. 2001) as the template, and oligos SP14 (SEQ ID NO:9) and SP15 (SEQ ID NO:10). SP14 introduces an NheI site at bases 24107-24112 (numbers refer to SEQ ID NO:1 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,350). SP15 binds approximately 1500 by downstream, at a BstEII site (25646-25652). A NotI site was also incorporated into SP15 for the subsequent cloning step. The PCR was carried out using Pwo thermostable polymerase under standard conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0204">The PCR product was phosphorylated, gel-purified and cloned into pUC19 which had been previously digested with SmaI and dephosphorylated. A number of insert-containing clones were sequenced. One clone containing the insert in the orientation which places the NheI site next to the EcoRI site in the vector was designated pLSB5.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0205">To provide a large enough region of homology for integration, a fragment of approximately 2.6 kbp (from BstEII to NotI) was cloned out of pRHB3E11 into pLSB5, to yield pLSB8.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0206">The avermectin loading module was then cloned from pIG1 (WO 98/01546, WO 98/01571, Marsden et al. 1998) as an NdeI/NheI fragment and ligated into pLSB8 previously digested with NdeI and NheI. The DNA sequence of the avermectin loading module fragment used, from the NdeI site to the NheI site is shown in SEQ ID NO 11. The resulting plasmid was designated pLSB14.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0207">The fragment contained in pLSB14 contains the avermectin loading module spliced in-frame to the spinosyn KS1, with a region of homology to spnA which is sufficient for integration to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0208">This fragment was then removed as an NdeI/XbaI fragment and cloned into pLSB2 to give pLSB29. This places the new ave/spn hybrid fragment under PactI, in a vector which can be transferred into <i>S. spinosa </i>by conjugation and then selected using the apramycin resistance marker.</p>

<heading id="h-0036" level="1">Generation of a <i>S. spinosa </i>Strain Harbouring a Hybrid Polyketide Synthase Comprising the Avermectin Loading Module Fused to the KS1 of the Spinosyn PKS</heading>
<p id="p-0157" num="0209">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>NRRL 18538 was transformed by conjugation (Matsushima et al. 1994) from <i>E. coli </i>S17-1 (Simon et al., 1983) with pLSB29. Transformants were selected by resistance to apramycin and screened by Southern blot analysis. A single transformant displaying the correct hybridization pattern to show that the plasmid had integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination was designated strain <i>S. spinosa </i>21K2.</p>

<heading id="h-0038" level="1">Production of metabolites by <i>S. spinosa </i>21K2 fermentation (Production of Compounds 9-12)</heading>
<p id="p-0158" num="0210"><i>S. spinosa </i>21K2 was cultured from a frozen vegetative stock used to inoculate CSM medium (Hosted and Baltz 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,634). This pre-culture was grown in flasks shaken at 300 rpm with a one-inch throw at a temperature of 30&#xb0; C. for 3 days. This was used to inoculate vegetative medium (Strobel and Nakatsukasa 1993; U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,634) at 5% v/v and was cultured under the same conditions for a further 2 days. The vegetative culture was used to inoculate production medium (Strobel and Nakatsukasa 1993) at 5% v/v. Small-scale production cultures were fermented under the same conditions as the pre-cultures, but for 7-10 days at 250 rpm with a two-inch throw and at 75% relative humidity. Initial small-scale production cultures were grown in 6 mL of production medium in 25 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with springs for 7 days.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0211">To identify the metabolites produced, a 1 mL aliquot of fermentation broth was analyzed by LC-MS as described in Example 5. By comparison to authentic standards, and to a fermentation extract from strain <i>S. spinosa </i>NRRL 18538, the major compounds produced by <i>S. spinosa </i>21K2 were spinosyns A, D and E. Spinosyn A was the major component produced, and the total yield of spinosyns was &#x2dc;50 mg/l.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0212">In addition to the known spinosyns A, D and E, four new compounds were clearly present. The chromatographic retention time and mass spectral data for these new compounds (Table 8) were consistent with their synthesis through the incorporation of branched chain starter units (iso-propyl carboxylic acid and 2-methylbutyric acid). The MS spectra of the new compounds gave ions for the [M+H]+ species and for the forosamine fragment (142.3). The compounds derived from an iso-propyl carboxylic acid feed were present 2-3&#xd7; higher levels than those derived from 2-methylbutyric acid. The new compounds comprised no more than 5% of the total spinosyns present.</p>

<p id="p-0162" num="0214">The ave/spn hybrid PKS was used to generate novel spinosyn metabolites by feeding carboxylic acids to production cultures. The avermectin loading module incorporated the carboxylic acid within the starter of the molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0215">Parallel 6 mL production flasks were inoculated as described in Example 13 above.

The incorporation of cyclobutyl carboxylic acid, cyclopropyl carboxylic acid, 2-methylcyclopropyl carboxylic acid, methylthio acetic acid and 3-furoic acid provided novel C21-modified spinosyns, as indicated by the appearance of new peaks in the UV and MS chromatograms (Table 9). The mass spectra of the novel compounds gave ions for the [M+H]<sup>+</sup> species and for the forosamine fragment (142.3).

<heading id="h-0043" level="1">Coexpression of <i>S. cinnamonensis </i>Crotonyl-CoA Reductase</heading>
<p id="p-0180" num="0244">In another aspect, the invention provides engineered <i>S. spinosa </i>hosts which present an altered substrate supply such that the native polyketide synthase produces novel products. For Example, co-expression of the <i>S. cinnamonensis </i>crotonyl-CoA reductase with the spinosyn biosynthetic pathway leads to novel products where the loading module additionally incorporates ethyl malonyl-CoA to yield 21-desethyl-21-n-propyl spinosyns A and D, and the AT of module 8 additionally incorporates ethyl malonyl-CoA to yield 6-ethyl spinosyn A. In addition, both of these AT domains can accept ethyl malonyl-CoA to yield 6-ethyl-21-desethyl-21-n-propyl spinosyn.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0245">The spinosyn loading module comprises a KSqAT0ACP0 which predominantly decarboxylates methyl malonyl-CoA to incorporate propionate. Loading modules containing a KSq are generally more specific than those that lack them. It is therefore interesting and unusual that the spinosyn loading module occasionally accepts malonyl-CoA (naturally producing trace amounts of spinosyn E) and, as disclosed here, unexpectedly accepts ethyl malonyl-CoA when it is present.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0246">For evidence supporting this concept see Example 18 and the discussion immediately preceding Example 22.</p>
<heading id="h-0044" level="1">Hybrid Spinosyn PKS with Heterologous Extension Modules</heading>
<p id="p-0183" num="0247">In another of its aspects the invention provides hybrid spinosyn PKSs comprising a heterologous extension module or a spinosyn extension module with a heterologous AT domain.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0248">The AT domains select the extender units that are incorporated into the growing polyketide chain. In spinosyn biosynthesis, the extender is predominantly malonyl-CoA. However, the AT in module 3 is essentially specific for methyl malonyl-CoA. It occasionally incorporates malonyl-CoA, leading to the accumulation of spinosyn F as a natural minor component. The AT in module 8 shows a relaxed specificity, incorporating predominantly malonyl-CoA (to give spinosyn A) but also incorporating a significant amount methyl malonyl-CoA (to give about 15% spinosyn D). The amino acid sequence of the module 8 AT is similar to other AT domains in regions that are associated with the selection of methyl malonyl-CoA. We suggest therefore that the incorporation of predominantly malonyl-CoA at this position is a reflection of substrate supply, in combination with an AT domain that has an unusually loose specificity. The AT of the loading module is largely selective for methyl malonyl-CoA, but incorporates malonyl-CoA 5-10% of the time (leading to production of the natural minor component spinosyn E).</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0249">Replacement of an existing AT domain with a heterologous AT domain selective for a different malonyl-CoA leads to a PKS that will add, remove or replace a side chain on the spinosyn polyketide. Where the heterologous AT domain can incorporate an extender molecule which is not readily available within the cell, accessory genes are included to provide the co-substrate (Stassi et al. 1998). For Example, there is no obvious gene encoding a crotonyl-CoA reductase in the genome of <i>S. spinosa </i>(C. Waldron, unpublished observation) and therefore it is anticipated that the supply of ethyl malonyl-CoA is severely limited in this organism.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0250">A system was constructed to allow AT swaps to be carried out in module 3 of the spinosyn polyketide synthase. The AT of module 3 naturally incorporates methyl malonyl-CoA and introduces the 16-methyl branch in spinosyn. One way to effect an AT swap is by replacement, which will result in a strain with the same transcripts as in the native PKS. An alternative method is via single integration, which places the complete plasmid sequence into the spinosyn PKS genes and requires that a promoter be introduced to drive the genes downstream of the integration site.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0251">The following Examples (Examples 16-19) describe AT domain-swap experiments which involve subcloning fragments using the enzyme MscI. MscI is affected by dcm methylation due to the sequences surrounding the site. Plasmids which are required to be digested with MscI are therefore passaged through <i>E. coli </i>ET12567, a dcm<sup>&#x2212;</sup> strain, to generate DNA which is not methylated by dcm.</p>
<heading id="h-0045" level="1">A. Hybrid Spinosyn PKS Using Module 2AT of the Rapamycin PKS in Plance of Spinosyn Module 3 AT</heading>
<p id="p-0188" num="0252">Using the single integration approach, a spinosyn PKS was generated in which the module 3 AT (specific for methyl malonyl-CoA) was replaced by the rapamycin module 2 AT (malonyl-CoA specific). The resulting strain was designated <i>S. spinosa </i>7D23. The PKS genes of 7D23 contain spnA, spnB and a truncated spnC under the native spnA promoter, followed by the plasmid sequence (including the apramycin resistance marker) and the hybrid spnC and spnD and spnE under control of an introduced promoter. In 7D23 the heterologous promoter used was the promoter for resistance to pristinamycin. Alternative promoters could also be used, for example the actI promoter with its cognate activator actII-ORF4.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0253"><i>S. spinosa </i>7D23 produced the four predicted spinosyn analogues, spinosyn F, spinosyn F 17-pseudoaglycone, 16-desmethyl spinosyn D and 16-desmethyl spinosyn D 17-pseudoaglycone. The yields were unexpectedly high, being only 3-fold lower than from a non-engineered strain (see Table 12 within Example 20). The spinosyn F compounds have been identified previously, as minor components in non-engineered strains, but this manipulation of the PKS genes resulted in a dramatic increase in their yield.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0254">The abundance of the pseudoaglycone F may be a reflection of a reduced activity of the forosamine glycosyl transferase for this novel substrate. The final glycosylation occurs at C-17, so the neighboring C-16 methyl group may be important for substrate recognition.</p>

<p id="p-0191" num="0255">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i>. The spinosyn module 3 AT domain was amplified by PCR using pRHB3E11 as the template and the primers CR322 (SEQ ID NO:12) and CR323 (SEQ ID NO:13). These primers introduce MscI and AvrII sites (bp 3-8 of SEQ ID NOS: 12 and 13) flanking the AT domain. The 973 by PCR product was phosphorylated and cloned into commercially-available pUC18 which had previously been digested with SmaI and dephosphorylated. Insert-containing transformants were screened for orientation and sequenced. One transformant, carrying an insert of the correct sequence in the orientation which places the AvrII site next to the HindIII site of the polylinker, was designated pALK6.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0256">The flanking region downstream of the spinosyn module 3 AT was amplified by PCR using pRHB3E11 as the template and the primers CR324 (SEQ ID NO: 14) and CR332 (SEQ ID NO: 15). Primer CR324 introduces an AvrII site (bp 3-8 of SEQ ID NO:14) at exactly the same position as CR323, and CR332 binds downstream of a PstI site which is naturally occurring in the sequence. The 1557 by PCR product was phosphorylated and cloned into commercially-available pUC18 which had previously been digested with SmaI and dephosphorylated. Insert-containing transformants were screened for orientation and sequenced. One transformant, carrying an insert of the correct sequence in the orientation which places the AvrII site adjacent to the HindIII site of the polylinker, was designated pALK9. pALK9 was digested with AvrII and PstI. The 1525 by fragment was gel-purified and cloned into pALK6 digested with AvrII and PstI, to give plasmid pALK11.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0257">pALK12 was constructed to provide a suitable polylinker for this experiment. pALK6 was digested with NdeI and PstI and ligated with an annealed linker of oligos CR328 (SEQ ID NO:16) and CR329 (SEQ ID NO:17). The linker was designed to destroy the NdeI site and leave XbaI, EcoRV and PstI sites. Insert-containing clones were analysed by restriction enzyme digestion and a single clone displaying the correct pattern was designated pALK12.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0258">The flanking region upstream of the spinosyn module 3 AT was amplified by PCR using pRHB3E11 as the template and the primers CR330 (SEQ ID NO:18) and CR321 (SEQ ID NO:19). Primer CR330 introduces an NdeI site (bp 18-23 of SEQ ID NO:18) at the ATG start codon of the spnC gene, and CR321 incorporates an MscI site (bp 3-8 of SEQ ID NO:19) at exactly the same position as CR322. The 1729 by PCR product was phosphorylated and cloned into commercially-available pUC18 which had previously been digested with SmaI and dephosphorylated. Insert-containing transformants were screened for orientation and sequenced. One transformant, carrying an insert of the correct sequence in the orientation which places the MscI site adjacent to the HindIII site of the polylinker, was designated pALK23. pALK12 was digested with PstI and XmnI and the 601 by cloned into PstIIXmnI digested pALK23 to give pALK24. pALK11 was digested with PstI and MscI and the 2488 by fragment was ligated into the 3777 by backbone produced by digesting pALK24 with PstI and MscI, to give pALK25. To ensure sufficient homology for integration, the fragment of DNA from the PstI site (bp 39607-39612 of SEQ ID NO: 1 in U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,350 B1) to the MscI site (bp 41189-41194) was excised from pRHB3E11 and cloned into pALK25 previously digested with PstI and EcoRV to give pALK26.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0259">pALK26 is the intermediate plasmid in the experiments to generate spinosyn PKS genes with AT swaps in module 3. It contained the spinosyn AT3 with flanking restriction sites, the upstream region of spnC to the start codon, and a region downstream for homologous recombination. It was missing a 407 by MscI-MscI fragment just upstream of the MscI site at the edge of the AT, which has to be inserted after the AT swap has been achieved.</p>

<heading id="h-0049" level="1">Construction of a Vector which can be Used to Engineer the Spinosyn Biosynthetic Pathway to Produce C-16 Desmethyl Spinosyns</heading>
<p id="p-0196" num="0260">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Plasmid pALK39 was used to integrate into the chromosome of <i>S. spinosa </i>by homologous recombination. It was designed to incorporate the rapamycin AT2 into spinosyn module 3. Such an engineered <i>S. spinosa </i>strain produced C-16 desmethyl spinosyns and intermediates in this pathway. Plasmid pALK39 was constructed as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0261">The rapamycin module 2 was excised from pCJR26 as an MscI/AvrII fragment (see SEQ ID NO 20) and ligated into pALK26 which had previously been digested with MscI and AvrII, to give pALK28. The 407 by MscI fragment missing from this construct was then excised from pALK24 (Example 16) and ligated into dephosphorylated, MscI-digested pALK28. Clones were screened for the orientation of the insert, and a single clone containing the insert in the correct orientation was designated pALK32. pALK32 contains the required fragment to introduce the rap AT2 swap into module 3 of <i>S. spinosa</i>, with an NdeI site at the start codon and a downstream XbaI site just outside of the polyketide synthase sequence. This region was excised as an NdeI/XbaI fragment and cloned into pLSB3 to give pALK39. The new module 3 hybrid fragment was thereby placed under P<sub>ptr</sub>, in a vector which can be transferred into <i>S. spinosa </i>by conjugation and selected by apramycin resistance.</p>

<heading id="h-0051" level="1">Construction of a Vector Capable of Over-Expressing a Crotonyl-CoA Reductase</heading>
<p id="p-0198" num="0262">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In order to address substrate supply issues, pALK21 was constructed to over-express the crotonyl-CoA reductase (ccr) gene from <i>Streptomyces cinnamonensis</i>. pALK21 was constructed as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0263">The <i>S. cinnamonensis </i>ccr gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from <i>S. cinnamonensis </i>ATCC 15413 using primers CCRMONF (SEQ ID NO:21) and CCRMONR (SEQ ID NO:22). CCRMONF introduces an NdeI site (bp 7-12 of SEQ ID NO:21) which incorporates the ATG of the start codon of the gene, and CCRMONR introduces a BamHI site (bp 6-11 of SEQ ID NO:22) downstream of the stop codon. Amplification to obtain the ccr gene was carried out under standard conditions using Pwo thermostable DNA polymerase. The fragment was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase then cloned into commercially-available pUC18 digested with SmaI and dephosphorylated. Insert-containing plasmids were sequenced, and one plasmid containing the correct sequence was designated pLSB46. Plasmid pLSB46 contains the <i>S. cinnamonensis </i>ccr gene in the orientation which places the introduced BamHI site adjacent to the XbaI site of the polylinker. SEQ ID NO 23 shows the ccr gene from the NdeI site at the start codon to the BamHI site after the stop codon.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0264">The ccr gene was excised as an NdeI/XbaI fragment and cloned into the expression vector pLSB2 (Example 2) digested with NdeI and XbaI, to give pLSB59. Plasmid pLSB59 contains the ccr gene under control of the actI promoter, and the activator actII-ORF4. In order to co-express the ccr gene with an engineered hybrid PKS, the ccr-containing fragment, along with the actII-ORF4 activator and actI promoter, was transferred into a vector containing a second promoter (Pptr) which has restriction sites available for a hybrid PKS gene. This was achieved as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0265">Plasmid pLSB59 was digested with NdeI, and the ends were filled-in using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. This blunt-end fragment was re-circularized to give pALK19. The gene and promoter were excised from pALK19 as a SpeI/XbaI fragment and cloned into pLSB3 (Example 2) digested with SpeI. This step destroys the XbaI site at the end of the ccr gene. The resulting plasmid is designated pALK21. Plasmid pALK21 therefore contains the ccr gene under P<sub>actI </sub>with unique NdeI and XbaI sites situated for the introduction of hybrid PKS genes downstream of the ptr promoter. pALK21 is apramycin resistant and contains an oriT for conjugal transfer of DNA.</p>

<p id="p-0218" num="0294">16-Desmethyl spinosyn A 17-pseudoaglycone was previously identified and is known as spinosyn F 17-pseudoaglycone. It is found as one of the minor members of the family of spinosyns produced by <i>S. spinosa </i>strains (U.S. Pat. No. 6,274,350 B1). Described below is the process for the production of spinosyn F 17-pseudoaglycone and 16-desmethyl spinosyn D 17-pseudoaglycone from the engineered hybrid pathway of <i>S. spinosa </i>7D23.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0295">Frozen vegetative stocks of <i>S. spinosa </i>7D23 were used to inoculate primary vegetative pre-cultures of <i>S. spinosa </i>7D23 in CSM (50 mL incubated in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with spring). Secondary pre-cultures in vegetative medium (250 mL incubated in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask with spring) were prepared and incubated as described in Example 8.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0296">Four liters of production medium were prepared, as in Example 6, with the addition of 0.01% v/v Pluronic L-0101 (BASF) antifoam. Production medium was inoculated with the secondary pre-culture at 5% v/v and was allowed to ferment in a 7 L stirred bioreactor for 7-10 days at a temperature of 30&#xb0; C. Airflow was set at 0.75 vvm, and impeller tip speed was controlled between 0.68 and 1.1 ms<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in order to maintain dissolved oxygen tension at or above 30% of air saturation.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0297">For the identification of metabolites, a 1 mL aliquot of fermentation broth was analyzed by LC-MS as described in Example 5. By comparison to authentic standards, it was clear that spinosyn F, 16-desmethyl spinosyn D and their corresponding pseudoagylcones were present (Table 14).</p>

b. Hybrid Spinosyn PKS Using 5 AT Module of the Tylosin PKS in Place of Spinosyn Module 3 AT
</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0309">In an analogous way, a hybrid spinosyn PKS was generated in which the methyl malonyl-CoA specific AT domain of module 3 was replaced by the ethyl malonyl-CoA specific AT domain of tylosin module 5 (SEQ ID NO:26). The producing strain was designated <i>S. spinosa </i>36P4. Ethyl malonyl-CoA was not expected to be abundant in <i>S. spinosa</i>, so the <i>S. cinnamonensis </i>gene encoding crotonyl-CoA reductase was expressed in the same cell, under control of the actI promoter. This should significantly increase the intracellular pool of butyryl-CoA, which is a substrate for short chain fatty acid carboxylases that can provide ethyl malonyl-CoA. The PKS of <i>S. spinosa </i>36P4 contained spnA, spnB and a truncated spnC under the native spnA promoter, followed by the plasmid DNA including the apramycin resistance marker. The <i>S. cinnamonensis </i>crotonyl-CoA reductase under the actI promoter, and the actII-ORF4 activator, were also within the plasmid sequence. This was followed by the hybrid spnC (spnC*) gene under control of the promoter for resistance to pristinamycin. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the heterologous promoters could be swapped around, or indeed that a number of other promoters could be chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0310">Strain <i>S. spinosa </i>36P4 produced minor components which had the UV absorbance, chromatographic properties, masses and fragmentation patterns consistent with the expected 16-desmethyl-16-ethyl spinosyns A and D. The major products from <i>S. spinosa </i>36P4 were spinosyns A and D. Surprisingly, the predominant novel fermentation products of strain 36P4 were 21-desethyl-21-n-propyl spinosyn A and 6-ethyl spinosyn A. 21-desethyl-21-n-propyl spinosyn A was produced at levels within 10% of that of spinosyn D. These compounds were isolated and fully characterized by MS and NMR. We suggest that they were made due to an increase in the intracellular concentration of ethyl malonyl-CoA, which resulted from the introduction of the crotonyl-CoA reductase gene. The low specificity of both the loading AT and the module 8 AT allowed this novel substrate to be incorporated. 6-Ethyl-21-desethyl-21-n-propyl spinosyn A was also made by <i>S. spinosa </i>36P4, as a minor factor. These three products each have a methyl group at C16, which implies that the tylosin module 5 AT, in this system, predominantly incorporated methylmalonyl-CoA. It is therefore expected that a non-engineered spinosyn PKS (with the native AT3) would produce the 21-n-propyl and 6-ethyl spinosyn compounds in the presence of the ccr gene.</p>
<heading id="h-0058" level="1">EXAMPLE 22</heading>
<heading id="h-0059" level="1">Construction of a Vector which can be Used to Engineer the Spinosyn Biosynthetic Pathway to Produce 16-Desmethyl-16-Ethyl Spinosyns</heading>
<p id="p-0229" num="0311">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Plasmid pTB4 is a pUC18-based plasmid containing a BamHI fragment of the tylosin PKS that includes most of the tylosin module 4. The insert is from the BamHI site between by 24125 and 24130 of the deposited sequence tylG.embo, accession number U78289 (at the beginning of KS4) and the BamHI site between by 31597 and 31612 (at the beginning of KS5).</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0312">The tylosin module 5 AT was amplified by PCR using the template pTB4 and the primers AK1 (SEQ ID NO:24) and AK2 (SEQ ID NO:25). The primer AK1 introduces an MscI site (bp 3-8 of SEQ ID NO:24) at the beginning of the AT domain and primer AK2 introduces an AvrII site (bp 3-8 of SEQ ID NO:25) at the end of the AT domain. The PCR reaction was carried out under standard conditions using Pwo thermostable DNA polymerase. The fragment was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and cloned into commercially-available pUC18 digested with SmaI and dephosphorylated. Insert-containing plasmids were analysed for the orientation of the insert and sequenced. One plasmid containing the correct sequence was identified and designated pALK17. It contains the PCR fragment in the orientation which places the MscI site adjacent to the HindIII site of the polylinker. The tyl AT5 was excised from pALK17 as an MscI/AvrII fragment and cloned into pALK26 digested with MscI and AvrII to give pALK27. The 407 by MscI fragment which is missing from this construct was excised from pALK24 (Example 16) and ligated into dephosphorylated, MscI-digested pALK27. A single clone containing the insert in the correct orientation was designated pALK31. pALK31 contains the required fragment to introduce the tyl AT5 swap into module 3 of <i>S. spinosa</i>, with an NdeI site at the start codon and a XbaI site just downstream of the polyketide synthase sequence. This fragment was excised as an NdeI/XbaI fragment and cloned into pALK21 to give pALK36. This places the new module 3 hybrid fragment under P<sub>ptr</sub>, in a vector which co-expresses the ccr from the acts promoter, and can be transferred into <i>S. spinosa </i>by conjugation and selected for apramycin resistance.</p>

<p id="p-0231" num="0313">See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa </i>NRRL 18538 was transformed with pALK36. Transformants were selected for resistance to apramycin and screened by Southern blot analysis. A single transformant was designated strain <i>S. spinosa </i>36P4.</p>

<heading id="h-0063" level="1">Production and Isolation of Compounds from <i>S. spinosa </i>36P4</heading>
<p id="p-0232" num="0314">Frozen vegetative stocks of <i>S. spinosa </i>36P4 were inoculated into primary vegetative pre-cultures of <i>S. spinosa </i>36P4 in CSM (50 mL incubated in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with spring). Secondary pre-cultures in vegetative medium (250 mL incubated in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask with spring) were prepared and incubated as described in Example 8.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0315">Fourteen liters of production medium were prepared, as in Example 6, with the addition of 0.01% v/v Pluronic L-0101 (BASF) antifoam. Production medium was inoculated with the secondary pre-culture at 5% v/v and was allowed to ferment in a 20 L stirred bioreactor for 7-10 days under conditions described in Example 8.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0316">For the identification of metabolites, a 1 mL aliquot of fermentation broth was analyzed by LC-MS as described in Example 5. By comparison to authentic standards, and to a fermentation extract from strain <i>S. spinosa </i>NRRL 18538, the presence of new spinosyn metabolites was verified (Table 16). The major new component eluted with a similar&#x2014;but different&#x2014;retention time to spinosyn D and had an identical mass; this compound is identified below as 21-desethyl-21-n-propyl spinosyn A. The second significant new component eluted later and had a mass 14 units higher than spinosyn D; this compound is identified below as 6-ethyl spinosyn A. The third significant peak eluted later still and had a mass 28 units higher than spinosyn D; this compound is believed to be 6-ethyl-21-desethyl-21-n-propyl spinosyn A. The mass spectra of all of these compounds displayed a [M+H]<sup>+</sup> ion plus the forosamine fragment. In addition, several other new components were clearly present but were present in minor quantities. One of these new components eluted after the first major new component and had an identical mass to spinosyn D; this compound was probably 16-desmethyl-16-ethyl spinosyn A. Other minor new components displayed a [M+H]<sup>+</sup> ion 14 mass units higher than spinosyn D and a mass consistent with the forosamine fragment. One of these new minor components may be 16-desmethyl-16-ethyl spinosyn D.</p>

<p id="p-0249" num="0346">Hybrid PKS genes constructed by the replacement of other AT (acyltransferase) domains within spn extender modules can be used to produce novel spinosyns with altered side chains at other positions on the polyketide. For example, in analogous methods to those described above, hybrid polyketide synthases can be constructed to yield spinosyns in which C18 or C20 bears a side chain other than a hydrogen (generally a methyl or ethyl). The native AT domains that incorporate predominantly methylmalonyl-CoA (such as spn AT3) can be replaced by heterologous domains that preferentially incorporate malonyl-CoA (such as rapamycin AT2) or ethylmalonyl-CoA (such as tylosin AT5). However, one skilled in the art will recognize that donor domains or modules for these hybrid polyketide synthases could be acquired from a variety of Type I polyketide synthase clusters and that this is not restricted in any way to domains or modules from erythromycin, avermectin, rapamycin and tylosin biosynthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0347">It is also anticipated that a combination of manipulations should lead to productive biosynthetic pathways, and spinosyns with two or more regions of novelty.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0348">Additional biosynthetic genes may be required to provide an adequate supply of a precursor that is not normally incorporated into spinosyns, such as a ccr gene to increase ethylmalonyl-CoA supply. This genetic modification can also lead to the production of novel spinosyns by providing an unnatural precursor that is incorporated at other spn AT domains. The replacement of other spn AT domains could generate hybrid PKS genes which lead to the synthesis of spinosyns with an ethyl group at C6, or methyl or ethyl side chains at C18 or C20. The spn PKS domains responsible for the degree of modification of each beta-keto group (KR, DH or ER) might also be replaced by heterologous domains to generate hybrid PKS genes that result in spinosyns with different saturated bonds, hydroxyl groups or double bonds.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0349">In summary, we have demonstrated that the hybrid spinosyn PKS genes claimed herein are useful for the production of novel, insecticidally-active spinosyns. The hybrid genes are derived from the spn PKS genes combined with a portion or portions of other Type I PKS genes. The strategies described in WO 98/01546 &#x201c;Polyketides and their synthesis&#x201d; were used to select the sites where the DNAs are spliced together. The hybrid genes can be operably linked to a heterologous promoter such as that from the actinorhodin biosynthetic gene actI (along with the actII-ORF4 gene encoding its cognate activator, see WO 98/01546), or from the pristinamycin resistance gene ptr (Blanc et al., 1995). The hybrid PKS genes are expressed in an organism which also contains the non-PKS functions required to produce a biologically-active spinosyn. The modified strains provided by the invention may be cultivated to provide spinosyns using conventional protocols such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,362,634.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0350">It is contemplated that the hybrid spinosyn PKSs of the invention can be expressed not only in <i>Saccharopolyspora spinosa</i>, but also in other host organisms, for example <i>Saccharopolyspora erythaea</i>, to produce insecticidally-active spinosyns. Other prokaryotic cells belonging to the group of actinomycetes, preferably the group of streptomycetes, are also suitable host organsims. <i>Streptomyces albus </i>is a specific example.</p>
<p id="h-0064" num="0000">Pesticide Activity of New Spinosyns</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0351">The compounds claimed herein are useful for the control of insects and mites. Included are all isomers of the compounds, and any acid addition salts of the compounds and their isomers. Also included are semi-synthetic derivatives made by the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,981 to prepare other modified spinosyns.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0352">The compounds show activity against a number of insects and mites. More specifically, the compounds show activity against members of the insect order Lepidoptera such as the beet armyworm, tobacco budworm, codling moth and cabbage looper. They also show activity against members of the order Coleoptera (the beetles and weevils) and Diptera (the true flies). The compounds also show activity against members of the order Hempitera (true bugs), Homoptera (aphids and hoppers), Thysanoptera (thrips), Orthoptera (cockroaches), Siphonaptera (fleas), Isoptera (termites), and members of the Hymenoptera order Formicidae (ants). The compounds also show activity against the two-spotted spider mite, which is a member of the Arachnid order Acarina.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0353">A further aspect of the present invention is directed to methods for inhibiting an insect or mite. In one preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for inhibiting a susceptible insect that comprises applying to a plant an effective insect-inactivating amount of compound in accordance with the present invention. The claimed compounds are applied in the form of compositions, which are also a part of this invention. These compositions comprise an insect- or mite-inactivating amount of compound in an inert carrier. The active component may be present as a single claimed compound, a mixture of two or more compounds or a mixture of any of the compounds together with the dried portion of the fermentation medium in which it is produced. Compositions are prepared according to the procedures and formulas which are conventional in the agricultural or pest control art, but which are novel and important because of the presence of one or more of the compounds of this invention. The compositions may be concentrated formulations, which are dispersed in water or may be in the form of a dust, bait or granular formulation used without further treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0354">The action of the compositions according to the invention can be broadened considerably by adding other, for example insecticidally, acaricidally, and/or nematocidally active, ingredients. For example, one or more of the following compounds can suitably be combined with the compounds of the invention: organophosphorus compounds, carbamates, pyrethroids, acylureas, other types of insect growth regulators and insect hormone analogs, neonicotinoids and other nicotinics, macrolides and other insecticidal, acaricidal, mollscicial and nematocidal compounds or actives. WO 00/56156 on &#x201c;Synergistic Insecticide Mixtures&#x201d; discloses use of certain previously known spinosyn compounds in combination with agonists or antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to control animal pests. WO 00/35282 on &#x201c;Combination of Active Ingredients&#x201d; discloses use of spinosad in combination with a fungicidally active compound. WO 00/35286 on &#x201c;Combinations of Active Ingredients&#x201d; discloses use of a combination of spinosad with other compounds to control animal pests and fungi. WO 99/60856 on &#x201c;Use of Spinosyns as Soil Insecticides&#x201d; discloses use of certain previously known spinosyns for treating seeds and for application to plants via the soil or by irrigation to control insects. WO 99/33343 on &#x201c;Use of Macrolides in Pest Control&#x201d; discloses use of spinosyns to control pests in transgenic crops, use of spinosyns to protect plant propagation material and plant organs formed at a later time from attack by pests, and use of spinosyns to control wood pests and molluscs. The compounds of Formula I can also be used for these purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0355">The compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of animals to control arthropods, i.e., insects and arachnids including various flies and fly larvae, fleas, lice, mites, and ticks, which are pests on animals. Techniques for delivering ectoparasiticides are well known to those skilled in the art. In general, a present compound is applied to the exterior surface of an animal by sprays, dips or dusts. The compounds can also be delivered to animals using ear tags, a delivery method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,876.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0356">In yet another embodiment, the compounds can be used to control insects and arachnids which are pests in the feces of cattle and other animals. In this embodiment, the compounds are administered orally and the compounds travel through the intestinal tract and emerge in the feces. Control of pests in the feces indirectly protects the animals from the pests.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0357">The compounds of the invention are also useful as human pharmaceuticals to control parasites, for example, lice. The compounds can be used, for example, in the formulations for controlling lice that are disclosed in WO 00/01347.</p>

<p id="p-0261" num="0358">Biological activity of the compounds of the invention was shown by a topical assay in which the compound was applied to laboratory-reared larvae (mean weight 22 mg) at the rate of 1 microg/larva. Each compound was applied, in an acetone solution (1 mg/mL), along the dorsum of six tobacco budworm (<i>Heliothis virescens</i>) larvae and six beet armyworm (<i>Spodoptera exigua</i>) larvae. Treated larvae were then held for two days at 21&#xb0; C., 60% RH in six-well plastic culture plates. Larvae were each supplied with a 1 cm<sup>3 </sup>of agar-based lepidoptera diet for sustenance during the two-day post-exposure interval. Percent mortality was determined at the end of a two-day period (Table 18).</p>
