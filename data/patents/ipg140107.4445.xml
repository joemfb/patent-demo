<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Example embodiments of the present invention enable operation of multiple timing advance groups. Embodiments of the technology disclosed herein may be employed in the technical field of multicarrier communication systems. More particularly, the embodiments of the technology disclosed herein may relate to operation of multiple timing advance groups.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Example embodiments of the invention may be implemented using various physical layer modulation and transmission mechanisms. Example transmission mechanisms may include, but are not limited to: CDMA (code division multiple access), OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing), TDMA (time division multiple access), Wavelet technologies, and/or the like. Hybrid transmission mechanisms such as TDMA/CDMA, and OFDM/CDMA may also be employed. Various modulation schemes may be applied for signal transmission in the physical layer. Examples of modulation schemes include, but are not limited to: phase, amplitude, code, a combination of these, and/or the like.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, an LTE network may include many base stations, providing a user plane (PDCP: packet data convergence protocol/RLC: radio link control/MAC: media access control/PHY: physical) and control plane (RRC: radio resource control) protocol terminations towards the wireless device. The base station(s) may be interconnected with other base station(s) by means of an X2 interface. The base stations may also be connected by means of an S1 interface to an EPC (Evolved Packet Core). For example, the base stations may be interconnected to the MME (Mobility Management Entity) by means of the S1-MME interface and to the Serving Gateway (S-GW) by means of the S1-U interface. The S1 interface may support a many-to-many relation between MMEs/Serving Gateways and base stations. A base station may include many sectors for example: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 sectors. A base station may include many cells, for example, ranging from 1 to 50 cells or more. A cell may be categorized, for example, as a primary cell or secondary cell. When carrier aggregation is configured, a wireless device may have one RRC connection with the network. At RRC connection establishment/re-establishment/handover, one serving cell may provide the NAS (non-access stratum) mobility information (e.g. TAI-tracking area identifier), and at RRC connection re-establishment/handover, one serving cell may provide the security input. This cell may be referred to as the Primary Cell (PCell). In the downlink, the carrier corresponding to the PCell may be the Downlink Primary Component Carrier (DL PCC), while in the uplink, it may be the Uplink Primary Component Carrier (UL PCC). Depending on wireless device capabilities, Secondary Cells (SCells) may be configured to form together with the PCell a set of serving cells. In the downlink, the carrier corresponding to an SCell may be a Downlink Secondary Component Carrier (DL SCC), while in the uplink, it may be an Uplink Secondary Component Carrier (UL SCC). An SCell may or may not have an uplink carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A cell, comprising a downlink carrier and optionally an uplink carrier, is assigned a physical cell ID and a cell index. A carrier (downlink or uplink) belongs to only one cell, the cell ID or Cell index may also identify the downlink carrier or uplink carrier of the cell (depending on the context it is used). In the specification, cell ID may be equally referred to a carrier ID, and cell index may be referred to carrier index. In implementation, the physical cell ID or cell index may be assigned to a cell. Cell ID may be determined using the synchronization signal transmitted on a downlink carrier. Cell index may be determined using RRC messages. For example, when the specification refers to a first physical cell ID for a first downlink carrier, it may mean the first physical cell ID is for a cell comprising the first downlink carrier. The same concept may apply to, for example, carrier activation. When the specification indicates that a first carrier is activated, it equally means that the cell comprising the first carrier is activated.</p>

Serving cells in one TAG may use the same timing reference. For a given TAG, a user equipment (UE) may use one downlink carrier as the timing reference at a given time. The UE may use a downlink carrier in a TAG as the timing reference for that TAG. For a given TAG, a UE may synchronize uplink subframe and frame transmission timing of the uplink carriers belonging to the same TAG. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, serving cells having an uplink to which the same TA applies may correspond to the serving cells hosted by the same receiver. A TA group may comprise at least one serving cell with a configured uplink. A UE supporting multiple TAs may support two or more TA groups. One TA group may contain the PCell and may be called a primary TAG (pTAG). In a multiple TAG configuration, at least one TA group may not contain the PCell and may be called a secondary TAG (sTAG). Carriers within the same TA group may use the same TA value and the same timing reference. In this disclosure, timing advance group, time alignment group, and cell group have the same meaning. Further, time alignment command and timing advance command have the same meaning.</p>

In Example 3, pTAG includes PCell and SCell1, and sTAG1 includes SCell2 and SCell3, and sTAG2 includes SCell4. Up to four TAGs may be supported and other example TAG configurations may also be provided. In many examples of this disclosure, example mechanisms are described for a pTAG and an sTAG. The operation with one example sTAG is described, and the same operation may be applicable to other sTAGs. The example mechanisms may be applied to configurations with multiple sTAGs.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, TA maintenance, pathloss reference handling and the timing reference for pTAG may follow LTE release 10 principles. The UE may need to measure downlink pathloss to calculate the uplink transmit power. The pathloss reference may be used for uplink power control and/or transmission of random access preamble(s). A UE may measure downlink pathloss using the signals received on the pathloss reference cell. The pathloss reference downlink cell and the corresponding uplink cell may be configured to be in the same frequency band due to the required accuracy of pathloss estimation. For SCell(s) in a pTAG, the choice of pathloss reference for cells may be selected from and be limited to the following two options: a) the downlink SCell linked to an uplink SCell using the system information block 2 (SIB2), and b) the downlink pCell. The pathloss reference for SCells in pTAG may be configurable using RRC message(s) as a part of SCell initial configuration and/or reconfiguration. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, PhysicalConfigDedicatedSCell information element (IE) of an SCell configuration may include the pathloss reference SCell (downlink carrier) for an SCell in pTAG.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The downlink SCell linked to an uplink SCell using the system information block 2 (SIB2) may be referred to as the SIB2 linked downlink of the SCell. Different TAGs may operate in different bands. In another example, the signals in different TAGs may travel through different repeaters, or the signal of one SCell in an sTAG may travel through a repeater while the signal of another TAG may not go through the repeater. Having flexibility in SCell pathloss reference configuration for SCells belonging to an sTAG may result in pathloss estimation errors due to mobility of wireless device. The wireless device may autonomously change a timing reference SCell in an sTAG, but changing pathloss reference autonomously may result in confusion in the serving eNB, specially that different cells may have different transmit power. Therefore, both eNB configuration flexibility and autonomous UE pathloss selection for an SCell in sTAG may result in errors in pathloss estimation. For an uplink carrier in an sTAG, the pathloss reference may be only configurable to the downlink SCell linked to an uplink SCell using the system information block 2 (SIB2) of the SCell. No other downlink carrier may be configured as the pathloss reference for an SCell in an sTAG. This configuration may introduce accuracy in pathloss estimation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a UE may successfully complete a random access procedure from the reception of a random access response (RAR) message within the random access (RA) response window using a random access radio network temporary identifier (RA-RNTI). The UE may decode scheduling information for uplink transmission in the PDCCH common search space (CSS) with RA-RNTI. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, in addition to the time alignment command (TAC) field, RAR for a PCell and/or SCell may contain at least one of the following: a Random Access Preamble Identifier (RAPID), a UL grant, a Temporary C-RNTI, a Backoff Indicator (BI), and/or the like. RAPID may be used to confirm the association between RAR and the transmitted preamble. The UL grant may be employed for uplink transmission on the cell that the preamble was transmitted. Temporary C-RNTI may be used for contention resolution in case of contention based random access (CBRA). A backoff Indicator (BI) may be used in case of collisions and/or high load on PRACH.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To obtain initial uplink (UL) time alignment for an sTAG, eNB may initiate an RA procedure. In an sTAG, a UE may use one of any activated SCells from this sTAG as a timing reference cell. In an example embodiment, the timing reference for SCells in an sTAG may be the SIB2 linked downlink of the SCell on which the preamble for the latest RA procedure was sent. There may be one timing reference and one time alignment timer (TAT) per TA group. TAT for TAGs may be configured with different values. When the TAT associated with the pTAG expires: all TATs may be considered as expired, the UE may flush all HARQ buffers of all serving cells, the UE may clear any configured downlink assignment/uplink grants, and the RRC in the UE may release PUCCH/SRS for all configured serving cells. When the pTAG TAT is not running, an sTAG TAT may not be running. When the TAT associated with sTAG expires: a) SRS transmissions may be stopped on the corresponding SCells, b) SRS RRC configuration may be released, c) CSI reporting configuration for the corresponding SCells may be maintained, and/or d) the MAC in the UE may flush the uplink HARQ buffers of the corresponding SCells.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Upon deactivation of the last SCell in an sTAG, the UE may not stop TAT of the sTAG. In an implementation, upon removal of the last SCell in an sTAG, TAT of the TA group may not be running. RA procedures in parallel may not be supported for a UE. If a new RA procedure is requested (either by UE or network) while another RA procedure is already ongoing, it may be up to the UE implementation whether to continue with the ongoing procedure or start with the new procedure. The eNB may initiate the RA procedure via a PDCCH order for an activated SCell. This PDCCH order may be sent on the scheduling cell of this SCell. When cross carrier scheduling is configured for a cell, the scheduling cell may be different than the cell that is employed for preamble transmission, and the PDCCH order may include the SCell index. At least a non-contention based RA procedure may be supported for SCell(s) assigned to sTAG(s). Upon new UL data arrival, the UE may not trigger an RA procedure on an SCell. PDCCH order for preamble transmission may be sent on a different serving cell than the SCell in which the preamble is sent. TA grouping may be performed without requiring any additional UE assisted information.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an example message flow in a random access process in a secondary TAG as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention. eNB transmits an activation command <b>600</b> to activate an SCell. A preamble <b>602</b> (Msg1) may be sent by a UE in response to the PDCCH order <b>601</b> on an SCell belonging to an sTAG. In an example embodiment, preamble transmission for SCells may be controlled by the network using PDCCH format 1A. Msg2 message <b>603</b> (RAR: random access response) in response to the preamble transmission on SCell may be addressed to RA-CRNTI in PCell common search space (CSS). Uplink packets <b>604</b> may be transmitted on the SCell, in which the preamble was transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, initial timing alignment may be achieved through a random access procedure. This may involve the UE transmitting a random access preamble and the eNB responding to an initial TA command NTA (amount of time alignment) within the random access response window. The start of the random access preamble may be aligned with the start of the corresponding uplink subframe at the UE assuming NTA=0. The eNB may estimate the uplink timing from the random access preamble transmitted by the UE. The TA command may be derived by the eNB based on the estimation of the difference between the desired UL timing and the actual UL timing. The UE may determine the initial uplink transmission timing relative to the corresponding downlink of the sTAG on which the preamble is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">PDCCH order may be used to trigger RACH for an activated SCell. For a newly configured SCell or a configured but deactivated SCell, eNB may need to firstly activate the corresponding SCell and then trigger a RA on it. In an example embodiment, with no retransmission of an activation/deactivation command, activation of an SCell may need at least 8 ms, which may be an extra delay for UE to acquire the valid TA value on an SCell compared to the procedure on an already activated SCell. For a newly configured SCell or a deactivated SCell, 8 ms may be required for SCell activation, and at least 6 ms may be required for preamble transmission, and at least 4 ms may be required to receive the random access response. At least 18 ms may be required for a UE to get a valid TA. The possible delay caused by retransmission or other configured parameters may need to be considered (e.g. the possible retransmission of an activation/deactivation command, and/or the time gap between when a RA is triggered and when a preamble is transmitted (equal or larger than 6 ms)). The RAR may be transmitted within the RAR window (for example, 2 ms, 10 ms, 50 ms), and possible retransmission of the preamble may be considered. The delay for such a case may be more than 20 ms or even 30 ms if retransmissions are considered.</p>

The UE may transmit a MAC BSR in the uplink resources identified in an uplink grant to inform the base station about the size of the uplink transmission buffer(s). A UE BSR may be transmitted in an uplink resource identified in a received uplink grant. BSR indicates the amount of data in one or more logical channel buffers. Base station may determine the radio resources required for the UE in the uplink employing the received BSR and other parameters, e.g. link quality, interference, UE category, and/or the like. If the base station determines that radio resources of a first SCell which is uplink unsynchronized is required (the SCell may be in-active or may not be even configured yet), the base station may trigger an sTAG sync process to uplink synchronize the sTAG and the first SCell associated with the sTAG. The SCell should be in configured (e.g. using RRC messages) and be in active state (e.g. using MAC activate commands). An SCell is considered out-of-sync if it belongs to or will belong to (after RRC configuration) to an out-of-sync sTAG.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The sTAG sync process may also selectively be started by the base station if a GBR bit rate bearer with required uplink resources has been established. The Base station may determine the radio resources required for the UE in the uplink employing the received bit rate, QoS and priority requirements of the GBR bearer and other parameters, e.g. link quality, interference, UE category, and/or the like. If the base station determines that radio resources of a first SCell which is uplink unsynchronized is required (the SCell may be in-active or may not be even configured yet), the base station may trigger an sTAG sync process to uplink synchronize the sTAG and the first SCell associated with the sTAG. The SCell should be in configured (e.g. using RRC messages) and be in active state (e.g. using MAC activate commands) before uplink transmission starts.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">eNB may select to synchronize the sTAG and then activate/configure the SCell. eNB may select to first configure/activate SCell and then to uplink synchronize it. For example, if an SCell is added and assigned to a synchronized sTAG, it will be synchronize upon its (re)configuration/addition. In another example, the SCell may be configured, then the sTAG may be synchronized using another SCell in the sTAG, and then the SCell may be activated. In another example, the SCell may be configured/activated, and then sTAG synchronization may start. Different embodiments with different orders in tasks may be implemented. Random access process for an SCell can only be initiated on configured and active SCells assigned to an sTAG.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an example embodiment, in the sTAG sync process the base station may trigger random access preamble transmission on an SCell of the sTAG that the SCell belongs, or on the first SCell in which its uplink resources are required. In this example, the first SCell belongs to an sTAG which is uplink out-of-sync. In response to receiving a BSR and/or GBR bearer establishment, the eNB may, selectively and depending on a plurality of criteria, transmit a PDCCH order to the UE and may cause the UE to start a RA procedure on an SCell in the sTAG (in case of carrier aggregation). A PDCCH order may be triggered by the BSR reception due to the UL data arrival in the UE or by the establishment of GBR bearer with uplink resource requirements. Preamble transmission may be triggered in the case of UL data arrival, meaning that preamble transmission may be triggered by the BSR reception in the eNB and/or establishment of a non GBR bearer with uplink data. Upon new UL data arrival, the UE may not trigger an RA procedure on an SCell. The eNB may, selectively, trigger the RA procedure based on the BSR reception due to UL data arrival in the UE. eNB may consider many parameters in triggering an RA on an SCell. For example, parameters may include current eNB load, UE buffer size(s) in BSR report(s), UE category, UE capability, QoS requirements, GBR bearer requirements and/or the like. UE may determine that radio resources of the out-of-sync SCell may be required for uplink data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a second embodiment, in the sTAG sync process base station may transmit a MAC timing advance command with a TAG index of the out-of-sync sTAG. The UE may use an stored value of N_TA for the out of sync sTAG and apply the timing advance value in the MAC timing advance command to the stored N_TA of the sTAG. A UE may store or maintains N_TA (current timing advance value of an sTAG) upon expiry of associated time Alignment Timer of the sTAG. The UE may apply the received timing advance command MAC control element and starts associated time Alignment Timer. This process may practically put the sTAG in an in-sync state. The base station may transmit one or more MAC timing advance commands upon receiving uplink packets from the UE on the sTAG to align UE uplink transmissions in the sTAG. It is up to eNB to select the first or second embodiment for synchronizing the uplink of first SCell. For example, the eNB may operate in the second embodiment, if the SCell has not been in-sync for a long time, or the sTAG has not been in-Sync since it has been configured. In another example, the eNB may operate in the first embodiment if the sTAG has recently entered an out-of-sync state. In another example, the eNB may operate in the second embodiment if the eNB-UE distance is relatively short, for example in the range of tens or hundreds of meters.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The mapping of a serving cell to a TAG may be configured by the serving eNB with RRC signaling. The mechanism for TAG configuration and reconfiguration may be based on RRC signalling. When needed, the mapping between an SCell and a TA group may be reconfigured with RRC signaling. In an example implementation, the mapping between an SCell and a TAG may not be reconfigured with RRC while the SCell is configured. For example if there is a need to move an SCell from an sTAG to a pTAG, at least one RRC message, for example, at least one RRC reconfiguration message, may be send to the UE to reconfigure TAG configurations. The PCell may not change its TA group and may always be a member of the pTAG.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, when an eNB performs SCell addition configuration, the related TAG configuration may be configured for the SCell. In an example embodiment, eNB may modify the TAG configuration of an SCell by removing (releasing) the SCell and adding a new SCell (with the same physical cell ID and frequency) with an updated TAG ID. The new SCell with the updated TAG ID may be initially inactive subsequent to joining the updated TAG ID. eNB may activate the updated new SCell and then start scheduling packets on the activated SCell. In an example implementation, it may not be possible to change the TAG associated with an SCell, but rather, the SCell may need to be removed and a new SCell may need to be added with another TAG. This may not require employing mobilityControlInfo in the RRC reconfiguration message.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An eNB may perform initial configuration based on initial configuration parameters received from a network node (for example a management platform), an initial eNB configuration, a UE location, a UE type, UE CSI feedback, UE uplink transmissions (for example, data, SRS, and/or the like), a combination of the above, and/or the like. For example, initial configuration may be based on UE channel state measurements. For example, depending on the signal strength received from a UE on various SCells downlink carrier or by determination of UE being in a repeater coverage area, or a combination of both, an eNB may determine the initial configuration of sTAGs and membership of SCells to sTAGs.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an example implementation, the TA value of a serving cell may change, for example due to UE's mobility from a macro-cell to a repeater or an RRH (remote radio head) coverage area. The signal delay for that SCell may become different from the original value and different from other serving cells in the same TAG. In this scenario, eNB may relocate this TA-changed serving cell to another existing TAG. Or alternatively, the eNB may create a new TAG for the SCell based on the updated TA value. The TA value may be derived, for example, through eNB measurement(s) of signal reception timing, a RA mechanism, or other standard or proprietary processes. An eNB may realize that the TA value of a serving cell is no longer consistent with its current TAG. There may be many other scenarios which require eNB to reconfigure TAGs. During reconfiguration, the eNB may need to move the reference SCell belonging to an sTAG to another TAG. In this scenario, the sTAG would require a new reference SCell. In an example embodiment, the UE may select an active SCell in the sTAG as the reference timing SCell.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">eNB may consider UE's capability in configuring multiple TAGs for a UE. UE may be configured with a configuration that is compatible with UE capability. Multiple TAG capability may be an optional feature and per band combination Multiple TAG capability may be introduced. UE may transmit its multiple TAG capability to eNB via an RRC message and eNB may consider UE capability in configuring TAG configuration(s).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The purpose of an RRC connection reconfiguration procedure may be to modify an RRC connection, (e.g. to establish, modify and/or release RBs, to perform handover, to setup, modify, and/or release measurements, to add, modify, and/or release SCells). As part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be transferred from E-UTRAN to the UE. If the received RRC Connection Reconfiguration message includes the sCellToReleaseList, the UE may perform an SCell release. If the received RRC Connection Reconfiguration message includes the sCellToAddModList, the UE may perform SCell additions or modification.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The parameters related to SCell random access channel may be common to all UEs. For example PRACH configuration (RACH resources, configuration parameters, RAR window) for the SCell may be common to all UEs. RACH resource parameters may include prach-configuration index, and/or prach-frequency offset. SCell RACH common configuration parameters may also include power: power ramping parameter(s) for preamble transmission; and max number of preamble transmission parameter. It is more efficient to use common parameters for RACH configuration, since different UEs will share the same random access channel. Using dedicated parameters for SCell RACH configuration is not preferred since it will increase the size of the radio resources required for random access process, and may reduce spectral efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">eNB may transmit at least one RRC message to configure PCell, SCell(s) and RACH, and TAG configuration parameters. MAC-MainConfig may include a timeAlignmentTimerDedicated IE to indicate time alignment timer value for the pTAG. MAC-MainConfig may further include an IE including a sequence of at least one (sTAG ID, and TAT value) to configure time alignment timer values for sTAGs. In an example, a first RRC message may configure TAT value for pTAG, a second RRC message may configure TAT value for sTAG1, and a third RRC message may configure TAT value for sTAG2. There is no need to include all the TAT configurations in a single RRC message. In an example embodiment they may be included in one or two RRC messages. The IE including a sequence of at least one (sTAG ID, and TAT) value may also be used to update the TAT value of an existing sTAG to an updated TAT value. The at least one RRC message may also include sCellToAddModList including at least one SCell configuration parameters. The radioResourceConfigDedicatedSCell (dedicated radio configuration IEs) in sCellToAddModList may include an SCell MAC configuration comprising TAG ID for the corresponding SCell added or modified. The radioResourceConfigDedicatedSCell may also include pathloss reference configuration for an SCell. If TAG ID is not included in SCell configuration, the SCell is assigned to the pTAG. In other word, a TAG ID may not be included in radioResourceConfigDedicatedSCell for SCells assigned to pTAG. The radioResourceConfigCommonSCell (common radio configuration IEs) in sCellToAddModList may include RACH resource configuration parameters, preamble transmission power control parameters, and other preamble transmission parameter(s). At the least one RRC message configures PCell, SCell, RACH resources, and/or SRS transmissions and may assign each SCell to an sTAG (implicitly or explicitly). PCell is always assigned to the pTAG.</p>

Each time alignment timer value being selected, by the base station, from a finite set of predetermined values. The time alignment timer value in the sequence may be associated with a cell group index that is specified in the same element. In an example embodiment, the element may also comprise the list of cell indexes associated with the time alignment group index.</p>

A time alignment timer may start or may restart when the wireless device receives a timing advance command to adjust uplink transmission timing on a cell group identified by the cell group index. The cell group may be considered out-of-sync, by the wireless device, when the associated time alignment timer expires or is not running. The cell group may be considered in-sync when the associated time alignment timer is running.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The timing advance command may causes substantial alignment of reception timing of uplink signals in frames and subframes of all activated uplink carriers in the cell group at the base station. The time alignment timer value may be configured as one of a finite set of predetermined values. For example, the finite set of predetermined values may be eight. Each time alignment timer value may be encoded employing three bits. TAG TAT may be a dedicated time alignment timer value and is transmitted by the base station to the wireless device. TAG TAT may be configured to cause configuration of time alignment timer value for each time alignment group. The IE TAG TAT may be used to control how long the UE is considered uplink time aligned. It corresponds to the timer for time alignment for each cell group. Its value may be in number of sub-frames. For example, value sf500 corresponds to 500 sub-frames, sf750 corresponds to 750 sub-frames and so on. An uplink time alignment is common for all serving cells belonging to the same cell group. In an example embodiment, the IE TAG TAT may be defined as: TAG TAT::=SEQUENCE{TAG ID, ENUMERATED {sf500, sf750, sf1280, sf1920, sf2560, sf5120, sf10240, infinity}.

This is an example and other configurations are also possible. In an example embodiment, no SCell in pTAG is configured with PRACH resources. In another example embodiment, PRACH resources for an SCell in pTAG may be configured, but eNB is not configured to trigger a preamble transmission on PRACH resources of an SCell in pTAG. Basically, PRACH resources in SCells in pTAG cannot be used for preamble transmissions by a UE.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">During the connection establishment process, an eNB may transmit a first control message to a wireless device (UE) on a primary downlink carrier of a PCell to establish a first signaling bearer with the UE on the primary cell. The UE may transmit radio capability parameters from to the base station. The radio capability parameters may be transmitted on the first signaling bearer on a primary uplink carrier of the primary cell. In this process a wireless device (UE) may transfer UE radio access capability information from the UE to E-UTRAN (e.g. base station). If the UE has changed its radio access capabilities, the UE may request higher layers to initiate the necessary procedures that would result in the update of UE radio access capabilities, e.g., using a new RRC connection. In an example, a base station may initiate the procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED when it needs (additional) UE radio access capability information.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, radio capability parameters may include a parameter indicating support for multiple time alignment (MTA). Support for MTA may be considered an optional feature in release 11, and an eNB may not know if a UE supports MTA capabilities until it receives a UE capability message from the UE indicating that the UE supports MTA feature. Before eNB configures pTAG and sTAG(s), eNB may receive and process UE capability regarding UE multiple time alignment capabilities. Supporting MTA capability may require that UE includes new hardware and/or software features that provide such a capability. Multiple time alignment capability may be an optional capability for Rel-11 UE and its support may depend on UE's hardware, DSP and software designs. A UE may send at least one time alignment capability parameter to the eNB. eNB may configure UE's sTAG(s) and pTAG within the UE capability. For example, a UE may indicate how many sTAGs it may support. eNB may configure UE sTAG(s) based, at least in part, on the number of supported sTAGs in a UE. In another example, UE may explicitly or implicitly indicate if it supports inter-band or intra-band multiple TA, or both. In an example embodiment, support for MTA may be provided per band combination for one or more band combinations supported by a wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, multiple-TAG capability may be explicitly or implicitly communicated to eNB. In an example embodiment, inter-band and/or intra-band carrier aggregation may be configured with multiple TAGs. UE may send multiple TAG capability based on each supported band combinations. UEs that could be configured with inter-band carrier aggregation may need MTA (multiple time alignment or multiple-TAG) configuration. Carriers in a band may experience a different delay compared with a different band and a band may need its own TAG configuration. A TAG configuration for carriers for a band may be required. In a multiple band UE, multiple TAGs may be configured, for example one TAG per band. UE may comprise a plurality of RF chains to support inter-band carrier aggregation. A UE may support multiple TAGs if the UE support inter-band carrier aggregation.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">UE transceiver architectures may support non-contiguous and/or contiguous carrier aggregation in intra-band.

In an example embodiment, a UE may communicate its multiple TAG capability to the eNB for intra-band communication. A UE may transmit the MTA capability information for contiguous intra-band CA and/or non-contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation.

MTA capability IE may be ordered (indexed) according to a band combination index determining the order of a band combination in a sequence of one or more band combinations. The eNB may employ an internally stored look-up table to interpret the index of MTA capability and a band combination. UE may transmit MTA capability including a sequence of MTA capability to the eNB. The eNB may use a set of configuration options (for example in a look-up table, information list for band combinations, and/or the like format) to identify the band combination corresponding to an MTA capability (supported/not-supported) in a first sequence of one or more MTA capabilities.

The UE capability information may comprise an information element comprising a wireless device LTE radio capability parameters. The LTE radio capability parameters may comprise a plurality of parameters indicating various capability of the wireless device LTE radio. The plurality of radio capability parameters may comprise a second sequence of one or more band combinations. Each band combination IE parameter in the second sequence of one or more band combinations may comprise a list of one or more band identifier(s). An example band combination IE may be {(band-id1, band-parameters1), (band-id2, band-parameters2), (band-id3, band-parameters3). The example band combination IE comprises a sequence of band identifier(s): band-id1, band-id2, band-id3, and a sequence of band parameters. Band parameters may be uplink parameter(s) and/or downlink parameter(s). Each of the band identifier(s) may be one of a finite set of numbers, for example from a set of (1.64). Each of the numbers in the set may identify a specific band, for example number 14 may refer to 1950 MHz band-A, 23 may refer to 2100 MHz band-D, 24 may refer to 2100 MHz band-E. If band-id1=14, the band-id2=23, and band-id3=24, the wireless device supports band combination of these three bands. A second band combination in the second sequence may include band-id1=14 and band-id4=43. In the example, the second sequence of one or more band combinations are considered an array of one or more band combination IEs. In the example embodiment, two band combinations are in the second sequence of one or more band combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the example embodiment, a first sequence of one or more radio configuration parameters for example could be 1(TAG-not-supported, other parameters1),(TAG-supported, other parameters2)}.

TAG configuration is supported for band combination=(band-id1=14, the band-id2=43).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The example embodiments provides a solution for network, base station, UE signaling to reduce signaling overhead required for configuring wireless devices in a network. The example embodiments for communication of radio capability parameters provide flexibility in providing TAG capability for one or more band combinations. It reduces the required overhead for communicating this information by indexing TAG capability according to band combination IE. This increases radio efficiency. Furthermore, by including this information in UE signaling parameters, eNB is able to selectively configure multiple UEs for capable UEs without introducing new signaling messages. This improvement would have minimal impact in the UE and eNB messaging system. eNB does is not required to receive this information from UE subscription information in the core, and this simplifies core network signaling and requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to some of the various embodiments, SCell(s) belonging to an sTAG may need to perform random access process in order to achieve UL synchronization. For example, this may happen when an SCell belonging to an un unsynchronized sTAG is activated. The UE may be uplink out-of-synch for that SCell, but is uplink synchronized for the pTAG and other sTAG(s). eNB may trigger RACH on an SCell to let a UE to acquire uplink synchronization. Random access process may also be initiated on a synchronized sTAG, for example, for acquiring uplink timing of an SCell, and/or the like. Random access on an SCell may be initiated while the UE is schedule to transmit other uplink data or control packets. In an example embodiment, a random access on a pCell may be initiated by a UE and/or eNB. A random access on a pCell for example may be initiated by an eNB to acquire uplink timing for a pCell. Random access on a pCell may be initiated while the UE is scheduled to transmit other uplink data and/or control packets.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">When random access preamble is transmitted, for example, on an SCell of an sTAG, there is the possibility of transmission of: a) PUSCH, SRS, and/or PUCCH on PCell, and/or b) PUSCH and/or SRS on other serving cells belonging to pTAG and/or other sTAGs. When random access preamble is transmitted, for example, on a pCell of the pTAG, there is the possibility of transmission of PUSCH and/or SRS on other serving cells belonging sTAGs.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">According to some of the various embodiments, other uplink transmissions may be possible while RACH (random access channel) transmission is carried out. Possible simultaneous transmission of PRACH (physical random access channel) preamble and other UL channel signals on other serving cells may be considered. UE may support parallel PRACH and PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions. This issue may not apply to LTE release 10, since no uplink transmission may be allowed when random access preamble is transmitted on a PCell uplink random access resource.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Parallel transmission of other UL packets during the time the random access preamble is sent may require special solution. There could be more than one TA group and hence one TA group may already be in sync while another TA (time alignment) group may not be in-sync. This means that UL transmission may be on-going on other cells while the UE receives a PDCCH order to transmit a preamble on a cell. Parallel transmission of a preamble, and other UL transmissions on cells in other TAGs may happen. Parallel and/or simultaneous transmission in this specification may imply that transmissions are substantially parallel and/or substantially simultaneous, and/or transmissions may overlap during a time period. The overlap time period may be greater than a threshold, for example: zero, half a symbol, a symbol, 30 us, and/or the like. Parallel and/or simultaneous transmissions may imply that transmissions are in the same subframe, include the same subframe and/or may overlap during a time period. Minor inaccuracies/errors in transmission time within a limited range may be accepted.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to some of the various embodiments, parallel transmission of a preamble and of other UL data, control packets and/or SRS transmission on cells in other TA groups could have many advantages. The network may not need to coordinate the time when an RA is ordered on a cell of a TAG and with other UL transmissions in other TAGs. This may slightly increase UE complexity and it may make the power handling of the UE a bit more complex, but radio resources may be used more efficiently if parallel transmission is allowed. Supporting parallel transmission of a preamble and transmission of other UL data or control messages may reduce the complexity in an eNB and increase uplink radio efficiency. Allowing parallel PRACH and PUSCH/PUCCH/SRS transmissions may reduce scheduling restrictions in an eNB. In the example embodiment, a limitation applies that when a random access preamble is transmitted in a random access channel of a cell of a given TAG, no other parallel transmission is allowed in the cells belonging to the same TAG. For example, when a preamble is transmitted on an SCell of an sTAG no other PUSCH packet and/or SRS signal may be transmitted in parallel with the preamble in the sTAG.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to some of the various embodiments, a UE configured with N active carriers and supporting multiple-TAG configuration may transmit some of following signals in parallel: k&#xd7;PRACH; m&#xd7;PUCCH; p&#xd7;PUSCH; q&#xd7;SRS signals. The values of k, m, p, q depends on UE capability and configuration. In an example, K may be equal to zero or one; m may be equal to zero or one; p may be equal or less than N; and q may be equal or less than N. Transmission rules may be define to constraints some parallel transmissions of the above signals.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In an example embodiment, if a UE is configured to transmit in parallel PUCCH packet and PUSCH packet(s) (some UEs may not be capable of PUSCH and PUCCH transmission) then the following conditions may apply. K may be equal to 1 or zero. Meaning that one random access preamble may be transmitted at a given time. If the random access is transmitted then k=1, and if the random access is not transmitted then k=0. Random access preamble may have a higher power priority compared with other uplink signals transmitted by a UE. If a random access preamble is transmitted in a given TAG with c cells, then upto p=N-c PUSCH can be transmitted in parallel in the uplink on carriers that are active, uplink synchronized, and do not belong to the given TAG. If the preamble is transmitted on the pCell, PUCCH packet may not be transmitted in parallel in pCell. If the preamble is transmitted on an sCell, PUCCH packet may be transmitted in parallel in pCell. SRS transmission may have a lowest priority compared with uplink signals: PRACH, PUCCH, PUSCH. If any of the PUCCH, PUSCH, and PRACH transmissions in a given TAG coincides with an SRS symbol transmission in a symbol of the given TAG, then SRS may be dropped. Therefore, no parallel transmission of SRS is allowed in a symbol of a given TAG, if any other signal is carried in the given TAG. Avoiding parallel transmission of a preamble with any other signal in the same TAG, and avoiding parallel transmission of an SRS signal with any other signal in the same TAG may simplify UE transmission operation. A preamble may have a higher transmission priority compared with other uplink signals (PUCCH/SRS/PUSCH), and therefore may not be dropped because of other parallel transmissions. SRS may have a lower transmission priority compared with other uplink signals (PUCCH/Preamble/PUSCH), and therefore may be dropped because of other parallel transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In an example embodiment, if a UE is not configured to transmit in parallel PUCCH packet and PUSCH packet(s) then the above conditions may apply except that no parallel PUCCH and PUSCH transmission is allowed in the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In an example embodiment, when there is no SRS transmission, PRACH transmitted in a TAG with c cells, can be transmitted in parallel with one PUCCH and up to (N-c) PUSCH packets. If PRACH preamble is transmitted in pTAG, no parallel transmission of PUCCH packet and the preamble is allowed. In general no uplink signals may be transmitted with preamble in the TAG that is used for preamble transmission. If a UE is not configured with parallel PUCCH and PUSCH channel transmission, then this limitation may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">According to some of the various embodiments, if SRS transmission is configured, then SRS transmission is dropped in a given TAG, if SRS transmission symbol coincides with an uplink transmission symbol (any of the preamble, PUCCH packet, and PUSCH) in the given TAG. Multiple SRS signals may be transmitted in different cells of a given TAG in parallel with each other (assuming no PUCCH, PUSCH, and preamble is transmitted in parallel in the given TAG).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In an example, a shortened format of PUCCH may not coincide with SRS transmission, since a shortened PUCCH packet is not transmitted in the last symbol of a subframe. For example, if UE transmits in parallel an SRS signal, a preamble, and a PUSCH packet, then each of the SRS signal, the preamble, and the PUSCH packet is transmitted on a different cell group. In another example, if a UE transmits in parallel an SRS signal, a preamble, and a PUCCH packet, then PUCCH packet is transmitted on pTAG, preamble is transmitted on a first sTAG, and SRS signal is transmitted on a TAG different from pTAG and the first sTAG. In another example, if UE transmits in parallel an SRS signal and a PUSCH packet, then each of the SRS signal and the PUSCH packet is transmitted on a different cell group. Other examples could be provided based on the rules disclosed in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In another example embodiment, when UE supports simultaneous PUSCH and PUCCH, power scaling may be applied when the UE is in power limited scenario, for example when UE is in poor coverage areas. With the introduction of multiple TA, RACH preamble may be transmitted on an SCell. Hence there will be TTI where RACH preamble transmission or retransmissions may coincide with either PUCCH or PUSCH on PCell/SCell or both. The following simultaneous PRACH on SCell with other UL transmissions may occur in a UE:</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">UE behaviour may be defined when total power is not sufficient. There may be multiple solutions to address this issue. The priorities for power scaling between different channels may be determined. According to the priorities the powers may be scaled to ensure transmit power is less than or equal to {circumflex over (P)}<sub>CMAX</sub>(i). In case that total transmit power of the UE might exceed the maximum power {circumflex over (P)}<sub>CMAX</sub>(i), the PRACH may be assigned the highest priority. The priority of transmission power for UL channels may be:</p>

<p id="p-0130" num="0129">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, the order of priorities may be PRACH, PUCCH, PUSCH with UCI, and then PUSCH (PRACH has the highest priority).</p>

In case there is no PUCCH transmission in subframe i {circumflex over (P)}<sub>PUCCH</sub>(i)=0. {circumflex over (P)}<sub>PRACH</sub>(i) may be the linear value of {circumflex over (P)}<sub>PRACH</sub>(i) or could be another function of the preamble transmission power on an uplink SCell. If there is no uplink preamble transmission, then {circumflex over (P)}<sub>PRACH</sub>(i)=0. In an example, w(i) values may be the same across serving cells when w(i)&#x3e;0 but for certain serving cells w(i) may be zero. P<sub>PUSCH</sub>(i) includes carriers that could transmit uplink PUSCH. For example, if PUSCH transmission on a carrier is not allowed, then PUSCH transmission power for that carrier may not be included in the formula (power=0), since no signal would be transmitted on that carrier. For example, if carrier c is in an sTAG, which is uplink unsynchronized, then no signal would be transmitted on that PUSCH.</p>

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, the Random Access procedure may be performed as follows: Flush the Msg3 buffer; set the PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER to 1; set the backoff parameter value in the UE to 0 ms; for the RN (relay node), suspend any RN subframe configuration; proceed to the selection of the Random Access Resource. There may be one Random Access procedure ongoing at any point in time. If the UE receives a request for a new Random Access procedure while another is already ongoing, it may be up to UE implementation whether to continue with the ongoing procedure or start with the new procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, the Random Access Resource selection procedure may be performed as follows. If ra-PreambleIndex (Random Access Preamble) and ra-PRACH-MaskIndex (PRACH Mask Index) have been explicitly signalled and ra-PreambleIndex is not zero, then the Random Access Preamble and the PRACH Mask Index may be those explicitly signalled. Otherwise, the Random Access Preamble may be selected by the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The UE may determine the next available subframe containing PRACH permitted by the restrictions given by the prach-ConfigIndex, the PRACH Mask Index and physical layer timing requirements (a UE may take into account the possible occurrence of measurement gaps when determining the next available PRACH subframe). If the transmission mode is TDD and the PRACH Mask Index is equal to zero, then if ra-PreambleIndex was explicitly signalled and it was not 0 (i.e., not selected by MAC), then randomly select, with equal probability, one PRACH from the PRACHs available in the determined subframe. Else, the UE may randomly select, with equal probability, one PRACH from the PRACHs available in the determined subframe and the next two consecutive subframes. If the transmission mode is not TDD or the PRACH Mask Index is not equal to zero, a UE may determine a PRACH within the determined subframe in accordance with the requirements of the PRACH Mask Index. Then the UE may proceed to the transmission of the Random Access Preamble.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">PRACH mask index values may range for example from 0 to 16. PRACH mask index value may determine the allowed PRACH resource index that may be used for transmission. For example, PRACH mask index 0 may mean that all PRACH resource indeces are allowed; or PRACH mask index 1 may mean that PRACH resource index 0 may be used. PRACH mask index may have different meaning in TDD and FDD systems.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The random-access procedure may be performed by UE setting PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER to preambleInitialReceivedTargetPower+DELTA_PREAMBLE+(PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER&#x2212;1)* powerRampingStep. The UE may instruct the physical layer to transmit a preamble using the selected PRACH, corresponding RA-RNTI, preamble index and PREAMBLE_RECEIVED_TARGET_POWER.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, once the random access preamble is transmitted and regardless of the possible occurrence of a measurement gap, the UE may monitor the PDCCH of the PCell for random access response(s) identified by the RA-RNTI (random access radio network identifier) a specific RA-RNTI defined below, in the random access response (RAR) window which may start at the subframe that contains the end of the preamble transmission plus three subframes and has length ra-ResponseWindowSize subframes. The specific RA-RNTI associated with the PRACH in which the Random Access Preamble is transmitted, is computed as: RA-RNTI=1+t_id+10*f_id. Where t_id is the index of the first subframe of the specified PRACH (0&#x2266;t_id&#x3c;10), and f_id is the index of the specified PRACH within that subframe, in ascending order of frequency domain (0&#x2266;f_id&#x3c;6). The UE may stop monitoring for RAR(s) after successful reception of a RAR containing random access preamble identifiers that matches the transmitted random access preamble.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, if a downlink assignment for this TTI (transmission tme interval) has been received on the PDCCH for the RA-RNTI and the received TB (transport block) is successfully decoded, the UE may regardless of the possible occurrence of a measurement gap: if the RAR contains a backoff indicator (BI) subheader, set the backoff parameter value in the UE employing the BI field of the backoff indicator subheader, else, set the backoff parameter value in the UE to zero ms. If the RAR contains a random access preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted random access preamble, the UE may consider this RAR reception successful and apply the following actions for the serving cell where the random access preamble was transmitted: process the received riming advance command for the cell group in which the preamble was transmitted, indicate the preambleInitialReceivedTargetPower and the amount of power ramping applied to the latest preamble transmission to lower layers (i.e., (PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER&#x2212;1)*powerRampingStep); process the received uplink grant value and indicate it to the lower layers; the uplink grant is applicable to uplink of the cell in which the preamble was transmitted. If ra-PreambleIndex was explicitly signalled and it was not zero (e.g., not selected by MAC), consider the random access procedure successfully completed. Otherwise, if the Random Access Preamble was selected by UE MAC, set the Temporary C-RNTI to the value received in the RAR message. When an uplink transmission is required, e.g., for contention resolution, the eNB may not provide a grant smaller than 56 bits in the Random Access Response.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, if no RAR is received within the RAR window, or if none of all received RAR contains a random access preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted random access preamble, the random access response reception may considered not successful. If RAR is not received, UE may increment PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER by 1. If PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER=preambleTransMax+1 and random access preamble is transmitted on the PCell, then UE may indicate a random access problem to upper layers (RRC). This may result in radio link failure. If PREAMBLE_TRANSMISSION_COUNTER=preambleTransMax+1 and the random access preamble is transmitted on an SCell, then UE may consider the random access procedure unsuccessfully completed. UE may stay in RRC connected mode and keep the RRC connection active eventhough a random access procedure unsuccessfully completed on a secondary TAG. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, at completion of the random access procedure, the UE may discard explicitly signalled ra-PreambleIndex and ra-PRACH-MaskIndex, if any; and flush the HARQ buffer used for transmission of the MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer. In addition, the RN may resume the suspended RN subframe configuration, if any.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, The UE may have a configurable timer timeAlignmentTimer per TAG. The timeAlignmentTimer is used to control how long the UE considers the Serving Cells belonging to the associated TAG to be uplink time aligned (in-sync). When a Timing Advance Command MAC control element is received, the UE may apply the riming advance command for the indicated TAG, and start or restart the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the indicated TAG. When a timing advance command is received in a RAR message for a serving cell belonging to a TAG andif the random access preamble was not selected by UE MAC, the UE may apply the timing advance command for this TAG, and may start or restart the timeAlignmentTimer associated with this TAG. When a timeAlignmentTimer associated with the pTAG expires, the UE may: flush all HARQ buffers for all serving cells; notify RRC to release PUCCH/SRS for all serving cells; clear any configured downlink assignments and uplink grants; and consider all running timeAlignmentTimers as expired. When a timeAlignmentTimer associated with an sTAG expires, then for all Serving Cells belonging to this TAG, the UE may flush all HARQ buffers; and notify RRC to release SRS. The UE may not perform any uplink transmission on a serving Cell except the random access preamble transmission when the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the TAG to which this serving cell belongs is not running. When the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the pTAG is not running, the UE may not perform any uplink transmission on any serving cell except the random access preamble transmission on the PCell. A UE stores or maintains N_TA (current timing advance value of an sTAG) upon expiry of associated timeAlignmentTimer. The UE may apply a received timing advance command MAC control element and starts associated timeAlignmentTimer. Transmission of the uplink radio frame number i from the UE may start (N<sub>TA</sub>+N<sub>TA offset</sub>)&#xd7;T<sub>s </sub>seconds before the start of the corresponding downlink radio frame at the UE, where 0&#x2266;N<sub>TA</sub>&#x2266;20512.

<p id="p-0192" num="0191">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, upon reception of a timing advance command for a TAG containing the primary cell, the UE may adjust uplink transmission timing for PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS of the primary cell based on the received timing advance command. The UL transmission timing for PUSCH/SRS of a secondary cell may be the same as the primary cell if the secondary cell and the primary cell belong to the same TAG. Upon reception of a timing advance command for a TAG not containing the primary cell, the UE may adjust uplink transmission timing for PUSCH/SRS of secondary cells in the TAG based on the received timing advance command where the UL transmission timing for PUSCH/SRS is the same for all the secondary cells in the TAG.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The timing advance command for a TAG may indicates the change of the uplink timing relative to the current uplink timing for the TAG as multiples of 16Ts (Ts: sampling time unit). The start timing of the random access preamble may obtained employing a downlink synchronization time in the same TAG. In case of random access response, an 11-bit timing advance command, TA, for a TAG may indicate NTA values by index values of TA=0, 1, 2, . . . , 1282, where an amount of the time alignment for the TAG may be given by NTA=TA&#xd7;16. In other cases, a 6-bit timing advance command, TA, for a TAG may indicate adjustment of the current NTA value, NTA,old, to the new NTA value, NTA,new, by index values of TA=0, 1, 2, . . . , 63, where NTA,new=NTA,old+(TA&#x2212;31)&#xd7;16. Here, adjustment of NTA value by a positive or a negative amount indicates advancing or delaying the uplink transmission timing for the TAG by a given amount respectively. For a timing advance command received on subframe n, the corresponding adjustment of the uplink transmission timing may apply from the beginning of subframe n+6. For serving cells in the same TAG, when the UE's uplink PUCCH/PUSCH/SRS transmissions in subframe n and subframe n+1 are overlapped due to the timing adjustment, the UE may complete transmission of subframe n and not transmit the overlapped part of subframe n+1. If the received downlink timing changes and is not compensated or is only partly compensated by the uplink timing adjustment without timing advance command, the UE may change NTA accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Downlink frames and subframes of downlink carriers are time aligned (by the base station) in carrier aggregation and multiple TAG configuration. Time alignment errors may be tolerated to some extend. For example, for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, time alignment error may not exceed 130 ns. In another example, for intra-band non-contiguous carrier aggregation, time alignment error may not exceed 260 ns. In another example, for inter-band carrier aggregation, time alignment error may not exceed 1.3 &#x3bc;s.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The UE may have capability to follow the frame timing change of the connected base station. The uplink frame transmission may take place (N<sub>TA</sub>+N<sub>TA offset</sub>)&#xd7;T<sub>s </sub>before the reception of the first detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink frame from the reference cell. The UE may be configured with a pTAG containing the PCell. The pTAG may also contain one or more SCells, if configured. The UE may also be configured with one or more sTAGs, in which case the pTAG may contain one PCell and the sTAG may contain at least one SCell with configured uplink. In pTAG, UE may use the PCell as the reference cell for deriving the UE transmit timing for cells in the pTAG. The UE may employ a synchronization signal on the reference cell to drive downlink timing.

The antenna port(s) used for transmission of physical channel(s) or signal(s) may depend on the number of antenna port(s) configured for the physical channel(s) or signal(s).</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, cell search may be the procedure by which a wireless device may acquire time and frequency synchronization with a cell and may detect the physical layer Cell ID of that cell (transmitter). An example embodiment for synchronization signal and cell search is presented below. A cell search may support a scalable overall transmission bandwidth corresponding to 6 resource blocks and upwards. Primary and secondary synchronization signals may be transmitted in the downlink and may facilitate cell search. For example, 504 unique physical-layer cell identities may be defined using synchronization signals. The physical-layer cell identities may be grouped into 168 unique physical-layer cell-identity groups, group(s) containing three unique identities. The grouping may be such that physical-layer cell identit(ies) is part of a physical-layer cell-identity group. A physical-layer cell identity may be defined by a number in the range of 0 to 167, representing the physical-layer cell-identity group, and a number in the range of 0 to 2, representing the physical-layer identity within the physical-layer cell-identity group. The synchronization signal may include a primary synchronization signal and a secondary synchronization signal.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">According to some of the various embodiments, physical downlink control channel(s) may carry transport format, scheduling assignments, uplink power control, and other control information. PDCCH may support multiple formats. Multiple PDCCH packets may be transmitted in a subframe. According to some of the various embodiments, scheduling control packet(s) may be transmitted for packet(s) or group(s) of packets transmitted in downlink shared channel(s). Scheduling control packet(s) may include information about subcarriers used for packet transmission(s). PDCCH may also provide power control commands for uplink channels. PDCCH channel(s) may carry a plurality of downlink control packets in subframe(s). Enhance PDCCH may be implemented in a cell as an option to carrier control information. According to some of the various embodiments, PHICH may carry the hybrid-ARQ (automatic repeat request) ACK/NACK.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Other arrangements for PCFICH, PHICH, PDCCH, enhanced PDCCH, and/or PDSCH may be supported. The configurations presented here are for example purposes. In another example, resources PCFICH, PHICH, and/or PDCCH radio resources may be transmitted in radio resources including a subset of subcarriers and pre-defined time duration in each or some of the subframes. In an example, PUSCH resource(s) may start from the first symbol. In another example embodiment, radio resource configuration(s) for PUSCH, PUCCH, and/or PRACH (physical random access channel) may use a different configuration. For example, channels may be time multiplexed, or time/frequency multiplexed when mapped to uplink radio resources.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, the physical layer random access preamble may comprise a cyclic prefix of length Tcp and a sequence part of length Tseq. The parameter values may be pre-defined and depend on the frame structure and a random access configuration. In an example embodiment, Tcp may be 0.1 msec, and Tseq may be 0.9 msec. Higher layers may control the preamble format. The transmission of a random access preamble, if triggered by the MAC layer, may be restricted to certain time and frequency resources. The start of a random access preamble may be aligned with the start of the corresponding uplink subframe at a wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">According to an example embodiment, random access preambles may be generated from Zadoff-Chu sequences with a zero correlation zone, generated from one or several root Zadoff-Chu sequences. In another example embodiment, the preambles may also be generated using other random sequences such as Gold sequences. The network may configure the set of preamble sequences a wireless device may be allowed to use. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, there may be a multitude of preambles (e.g. 64) available in cell(s). From the physical layer perspective, the physical layer random access procedure may include the transmission of random access preamble(s) and random access response(s). Remaining message(s) may be scheduled for transmission by a higher layer on the shared data channel and may not be considered part of the physical layer random access procedure. For example, a random access channel may occupy 6 resource blocks in a subframe or set of consecutive subframes reserved for random access preamble transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">According to some of the various embodiments, the following actions may be followed for a physical random access procedure: 1) layer 1 procedure may be triggered upon request of a preamble transmission by higher layers; 2) a preamble index, a target preamble received power, a corresponding RA-RNTI (random access-radio network temporary identifier) and/or a PRACH resource may be indicated by higher layers as part of a request; 3) a preamble transmission power P_PRACH may be determined; 4) a preamble sequence may be selected from the preamble sequence set using the preamble index; 5) a single preamble may be transmitted using selected preamble sequence(s) with transmission power P_PRACH on the indicated PRACH resource; 6) detection of a PDCCH with the indicated RAR may be attempted during a window controlled by higher layers; and/or the like. If detected, the corresponding downlink shared channel transport block may be passed to higher layers. The higher layers may parse transport block(s) and/or indicate an uplink grant to the physical layer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a random access procedure may be initiated by a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) order and/or by the MAC sublayer in a wireless device. If a wireless device receives a PDCCH transmission consistent with a PDCCH order masked with its radio identifier, the wireless device may initiate a random access procedure. Preamble transmission(s) on physical random access channel(s) (PRACH) may be supported on a first uplink carrier and reception of a PDCCH order may be supported on a first downlink carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Before a wireless device initiates transmission of a random access preamble, it may access one or many of the following types of information: a) available set(s) of PRACH resources for the transmission of a random access preamble; b) group(s) of random access preambles and set(s) of available random access preambles in group(s); c) random access response window size(s); d) power-ramping factor(s); e) maximum number(s) of preamble transmission(s); f) initial preamble power; g) preamble format based offset(s); h) contention resolution timer(s); and/or the like. These parameters may be updated from upper layers or may be received from the base station before random access procedure(s) may be initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a wireless device may select a random access preamble using available information. The preamble may be signaled by a base station or the preamble may be randomly selected by the wireless device. The wireless device may determine the next available subframe containing PRACH permitted by restrictions given by the base station and the physical layer timing requirements for TDD or FDD. Subframe timing and the timing of transmitting the random access preamble may be determined based, at least in part, on synchronization signals received from the base station and/or the information received from the base station. The wireless device may proceed to the transmission of the random access preamble when it has determined the timing. The random access preamble may be transmitted on a second plurality of subcarriers on the first uplink carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, once a random access preamble is transmitted, a wireless device may monitor the PDCCH of a primary carrier for random access response(s), in a random access response window. There may be a pre-known identifier in PDCCH that identifies a random access response. The wireless device may stop monitoring for random access response(s) after successful reception of a random access response containing random access preamble identifiers that matches the transmitted random access preamble and/or a random access response address to a wireless device identifier. A base station random access response may include a time alignment command. The wireless device may process the received time alignment command and may adjust its uplink transmission timing according the time alignment value in the command. For example, in a random access response, a time alignment command may be coded using 11 bits, where an amount of the time alignment may be based on the value in the command. In an example embodiment, when an uplink transmission is required, the base station may provide the wireless device a grant for uplink transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">If no random access response is received within the random access response window, and/or if none of the received random access responses contains a random access preamble identifier corresponding to the transmitted random access preamble, the random access response reception may be considered unsuccessful and the wireless device may, based on the backoff parameter in the wireless device, select a random backoff time and delay the subsequent random access transmission by the backoff time, and may retransmit another random access preamble.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a wireless device may transmit packets on an uplink carrier. Uplink packet transmission timing may be calculated in the wireless device using the timing of synchronization signal(s) received in a downlink. Upon reception of a timing alignment command by the wireless device, the wireless device may adjust its uplink transmission timing. The timing alignment command may indicate the change of the uplink timing relative to the current uplink timing. The uplink transmission timing for an uplink carrier may be determined using time alignment commands and/or downlink reference signals.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a time alignment command may indicate timing adjustment for transmission of signals on uplink carriers. For example, a time alignment command may use 6 bits. Adjustment of the uplink timing by a positive or a negative amount indicates advancing or delaying the uplink transmission timing by a given amount respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">For a timing alignment command received on subframe n, the corresponding adjustment of the timing may be applied with some delay, for example, it may be applied from the beginning of subframe n+6. When the wireless device's uplink transmissions in subframe n and subframe n+1 are overlapped due to the timing adjustment, the wireless device may transmit complete subframe n and may not transmit the overlapped part of subframe n+1.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, control message(s) or control packet(s) may be scheduled for transmission in a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) and/or physical uplink shared channel PUSCH. PDSCH and PUSCH may carry control and data message(s)/packet(s). Control message(s) and/or packet(s) may be processed before transmission. For example, the control message(s) and/or packet(s) may be fragmented or multiplexed before transmission. A control message in an upper layer may be processed as a data packet in the MAC or physical layer. For example, system information block(s), radio resource control messages, and data traffic may be scheduled for transmission in PDSCH.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a wireless device may be preconfigured with one or more carriers. When the wireless device is configured with more than one carrier, the base station and/or wireless device may activate and/or deactivate the configured carriers. One of the carriers (the primary carrier) may always be activated. Other carriers may be deactivated by default and/or may be activated by a base station when needed. A base station may activate and deactivate carriers by sending an activation/deactivation MAC control element. Furthermore, the UE may maintain a carrier deactivation timer per configured carrier and deactivate the associated carrier upon its expiry. The same initial timer value may apply to instance(s) of the carrier deactivation timer. The initial value of the timer may be configured by a network. The configured carriers (unless the primary carrier) may be initially deactivated upon addition and after a handover.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, if a wireless device receives an activation/deactivation MAC control element activating the carrier, the wireless device may activate the carrier, and/or may apply normal carrier operation including: sounding reference signal transmissions on the carrier (if the carrier is uplink time aligned), CQI (channel quality indicator)/PMI(precoding matrix indicator)/RI(ranking indicator) reporting for the carrier, PDCCH monitoring on the carrier, PDCCH monitoring for the carrier, start or restart the carrier deactivation timer associated with the carrier, and/or the like. If the device receives an activation/deactivation MAC control element deactivating the carrier, and/or if the carrier deactivation timer associated with the activated carrier expires, the base station or device may deactivate the carrier, and may stop the carrier deactivation timer associated with the carrier, and/or may flush HARQ buffers associated with the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">If PDCCH on a carrier scheduling the activated carrier indicates an uplink grant or a downlink assignment for the activated carrier, the device may restart the carrier deactivation timer associated with the carrier. When a carrier is deactivated, the wireless device may not transmit SRS (sounding reference signal) for the carrier, may not report CQI/PMI/RI for the carrier, may not transmit on UL-SCH for the carrier, may not monitor the PDCCH on the carrier, and/or may not monitor the PDCCH for the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">A process to assign subcarriers to data packets may be executed by a MAC layer scheduler. The decision on assigning subcarriers to a packet may be made based on data packet size, resources required for transmission of data packets (number of radio resource blocks), modulation and coding assigned to data packet(s), QoS required by the data packets (i.e. QoS parameters assigned to data packet bearer), the service class of a subscriber receiving the data packet, or subscriber device capability, a combination of the above, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, packets may be referred to service data units and/or protocols data units at Layer 1, Layer 2 and/or Layer 3 of the communications network. Layer 2 in an LTE network may include three sub-layers: PDCP sub-layer, RLC sub-layer, and MAC sub-layer. A layer 2 packet may be a PDCP packet, an RLC packet or a MAC layer packet. Layer 3 in an LTE network may be Internet Protocol (IP) layer, and a layer 3 packet may be an IP data packet. Packets may be transmitted and received via an air interface physical layer. A packet at the physical layer may be called a transport block. Many of the various embodiments may be implemented at one or many different communication network layers. For example, some of the actions may be executed by the PDCP layer and some others by the MAC layer or PHY layer.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a radio bearer may be a GBR (guaranteed bit rate) bearer and/or a non-GBR bearer. A GBR and/or guaranteed bit rate bearer may be employed for transfer of real-time packets, and/or a non-GBR bearer may be used for transfer of non-real-time packets. The non-GBR bearer may be assigned a plurality of attributes including: a scheduling priority, an allocation and retention priority, a portable device aggregate maximum bit rate, and/or the like. These parameters may be used by the scheduler in scheduling non-GBR packets. GBR bearers may be assigned attributes such as delay, jitter, packet loss parameters, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, the transmitter in the disclosed embodiments of the present invention may be a wireless device (also called user equipment), a base station (also called eNodeB), a relay node transmitter, and/or the like. The receiver in the disclosed embodiments of the present invention may be a wireless device (also called user equipment-UE), a base station (also called eNodeB), a relay node receiver, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, the MAC layer in some wireless device(s) may report buffer size(s) of either a single Logical Channel Group (LCG) or a group of LCGs to a base station. An LCG may be a group of logical channels identified by an LCG ID. The mapping of logical channel(s) to LCG may be set up during radio configuration. Buffer status report(s) may be used by a MAC scheduler to assign radio resources for packet transmission from wireless device(s). HARQ and ARQ processes may be used for packet retransmission to enhance the reliability of radio transmission and reduce the overall probability of packet loss.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In this specification, &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; and similar phrases are to be interpreted as &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more.&#x201d; In this specification, the term &#x201c;may&#x201d; is to be interpreted as &#x201c;may, for example,&#x201d; In other words, the term &#x201c;may&#x201d; is indicative that the phrase following the term &#x201c;may&#x201d; is an example of one of a multitude of suitable possibilities that may, or may not, be employed to one or more of the various embodiments.
