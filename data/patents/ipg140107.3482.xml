<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a recharging or connection tray for portable electronic devices and to assemblies containing such trays. The trays and assemblies are especially useful in vehicles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Portable electronic devices are common place and many people carry one or more. Portable electronic devices require recharging and often need to be placed in communication with another, system which uses and/or generates information. In order to recharge or allow a portable electronic device to communicate with other information generating or using systems, direct connections utilizing one or more specially designed cords may be generally required. Each device uses a different cord and may use different cords for recharging and for communicating with information using or generating systems. In many locations, such as a vehicle, the presence of the cords is unsightly and may cause safety problems, because the cords can interfere with the function of other devices or controls of the host. Portable electronic devices also have connections for direct connection to other information using or generating systems and each portable device generally has a unique connection system. Recently, systems for wirelessly charging the batteries of portable electric devices have become available. Such systems utilize a device which generates an electromagnetic field. The portable electronic device requires a device which when located in close proximity to the electromagnetic field can transform the energy of the electromagnetic field into a charge to recharge the battery of the portable electronic device. Examples of such systems are disclosed in Baarman et. al. US Patent Publication 2008/0001572; Baarman et. al US Patent Publication 2009/0212637; Baarman et. al. US 2009/0106567; Arai US Patent Publication 2008/0122297; and Azancot et. al. WO 2009/040807 all incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The problems presented to the user of portable electronic devices in a host system, such as a vehicle, are many. One problem is the need to recharge portable electronic devices using unique cords for each device. Another problem is that such devices have unique direct connection systems which prevent the use of a universal connection system in a host system. Another problem is the need for one or more cords which can be strung in inconvenient places or can present safety problems due to their location, for instance in or around vehicle shift controls or other vehicle controls. Another problem associated with the use of portable electronic devices is the need for the user to view one or more displays associated with the portable electronic devices and the lack of a place for locating the portable electronic devices to facilitate easy viewing of the displays, for instance in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">What is needed is a system which allows a portable electronic device to be charged and/or connected to a hosts power system or information use or generation system without the need for a separate power cord. What is further needed is such a system which allows a user to easily view a display on the portable electronic device.</p>

US Patent Publication 2008/0001572; Baarman et. al US Patent Publication 2009/0212637; Baarman et. al. US 2009/0106567; and Arai US Patent Publication 2008/0122297 and Azancot et. al. WO 2009/040807; all incorporated herein by reference. In a preferred embodiment, the battery recharging system comprises i) a control module connected to the connecting means; ii) a means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field; iii) a second connecting means adapted to connect the control module with the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field; iv) a shield located between the control module and the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field; and v) a securing means for holding the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field on or near the non-visible side of the display panel. The control module functions to control the flow of electricity to the means for converting electricity to an electromagnetic field. Typically the control module is connected to the electrical contacts of the tray and to the means for converting electricity to an electromagnetic field. Typically, the control module contains a circuit board and/or a computer chip adapted to control the function of the battery recharging system. The control module is preferably located within the tray. It can be located in any place within the tray. Preferably, the control module is located on the base panel. In a preferred embodiment, the control module is affixed to the base panel. The control module may be affixed to the base panel to protect it from being damaged as a result of moving around within the tray. The battery recharging system contains a second connecting means adapted to connect the control module with the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field. Generally, the second connecting means can be any means which functions to conduct electricity and/or information between the control module and the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field. In a preferred embodiment it is two or more wires, a wire harness pigtail, and the like. Preferably, the second connecting means is a pair of wires which conduct electricity. The means for converting electricity to an electromagnetic field can be any means which converts electricity to an electromagnetic field wherein the electromagnetic field is capable of providing electricity to a properly equipped portable electronic device capable of converting the electromagnetic energy to electricity to charge the battery of the portable electronic device. In a preferred embodiment, the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field comprises a circular coil of conductive wire. Such coil of wire is preferably located near or adjacent to the inside surface (non-visible surface) of the display panel. The circumference, thickness of the wires and the number of wires in the coil are selected in a manner such that the desired electromagnetic field is produced when connected to a source of electricity. The battery recharging system further comprises a securing means for holding the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field on or near the non-visible side of the display panel. Such securing means can comprise any method of securing the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field in the desired location. Such securing means can comprise a panel affixed to the inside of the display panel, springs, elastic bands, one or more armatures, wherein if there are more than one they are interconnected and the like. Such securing means can be arranged to allow the recharging means to move in the x and y direction parallel to the display panel, as disclosed in copending commonly owned patent application filed concurrently herewith titled &#x201c;Movable Magnet and Panel Assembly&#x201d; Serial Number claiming priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/290,348 filed Dec. 28, 2009. In the embodiment wherein the securing means is one or more armatures, such armatures can be arranged as described below. The armatures are rotatably attached to a bridge component and the bridge component is attached to a panel of the tray. The means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field is secured to the end of the lower arm. This configuration allows for the movement of the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field almost anywhere (x and y movement) within the span of the interconnected armatures, when the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic is subjected to a tangential force. It is also contemplated that the armatures may include geometric features (e.g. tabs, projections, or the like) that may function to limit the relative movement of a given armature (e.g. to less than 360 degrees rotation). In a preferred embodiment, the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field is located substantially parallel to the plane of the display panel. The securing means can be free floating or can be fixed in place once the securing means is located in the desired location. The means for fixing the securing means in place are well known to the skilled artisan. The shield located between the control module and the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field functions to shield the control module from the electromagnetic field generated by the means for converting electrical energy to an electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic field can interfere in the function of the control module. The shield is located between the control module and the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field. The shield can be located adjacent to the control module or the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field. The shield can be fabricated from any material that does not allow electromagnetic radiation to pass through the shield or allows only an amount of electromagnetic radiation to pass through the shield that does not interfere in the functioning of the control module. The shield can be fabricated from iron containing materials, such as steel, and the like. In one embodiment where the means for holding the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field on or near the non-visible side of the display panel is fabricated from a material that does not transmit electromagnetic or insignificant amounts of electromagnetic radiation (that amount which does not interfere in the functioning of the control module) such means can also serve as the shield. The shield can be of a size such that the control module is protected from electromagnetic radiation. In a preferred embodiment, the shield is affixed to the control module between the control module and the means for holding the means for converting electrical energy of an electromagnetic field near the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The tray further comprises one or more display panels adapted such that one or more portable electronic devices can rest on the display panel. In a preferred embodiment, the display panel is arranged so as to allow one or more users of the one or more electronic devices to access the electronic devices easily and to see any displays integrated into the portable electronic devices. The display panel can have more than one surface, each surface being disposed in different planes. When the display panel has more than one surface disposed in different planes the relative location of the surfaces is chosen to allow the displays on the portable electronic devices to be seen by more than one user at one time. In the embodiment wherein the host is a vehicle, the different surfaces may be arranged to allow different occupants in the vehicle in different locations to see different displays of different portable electronic devices. The entire display panel or a portion of the display panel may be moveable into different locations to allow the users to adjust the direction from which one or more displays on one or more portable electronic devices may be viewed. The moveable portion of the display panel may have a variety of fixed locations. The locations may be fixed by any known means for fixing a movable part in place such as slots, projections, detents and the like. In one embodiment, a part of the display panel can be rotatable on an axis, and the like. In the embodiment, wherein the display rotates about an axis, the display panel and the panels attached to the display panel can create pivot points where they meet so as to allow the display panel to rotate. A rod can be disposed in the display panel which projects from each end of the display panel and seats in hole in the adjacent panels to hold the display panel in place and allow it to rotate around the axis created by the rod.
