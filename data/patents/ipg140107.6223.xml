<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to methods, systems, and computer program products for providing a program viewing indicator.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various technologies were developed in order to utilize the limited bandwidth offered by media conveying networks. A first technology is known as switched digital video and includes selecting which programs out of a larger set of programs to broadcast to end users. Another technology utilizes the Internet Protocol to unicast (and additionally or alternatively to broadcast) programs to end users.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In both cases, the transmission of programs that are not being watched by the end user is regarded as a waste of bandwidth. It would have been better to transmit other programs than those that are not being watched.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">End users tend to leave their set top box on after turning their television off. In this case, the monitoring of the status of the set boxes alone will not indicate that the program is not watched.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One prior art solution aimed to improve the utilization of bandwidth involves sending, by a remote monitor, to end users that did not perform a channel change for several hours, a request to respond. If the end user does not respond to the request then the remote monitor determines that the end user does not watch the program and it can determine not to transmit the program. The remote monitor can be located in various locations and can be used to monitor one or multiple end users.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a growing need to provide efficient systems, methods and computer program products for efficient utilization of bandwidth.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method for providing a program viewing indicator, the method includes: (i) receiving a display power consumption level indicator; (ii) determining, in response to the display power consumption level indicator, whether a program that is sent to a signal converter that is connected to the display, is being displayed on the display; and (iii) transmitting to a remote system, by the signal converter, and in response to the determining, a program viewing indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method for transmitting a program, the method includes: (i) receiving at least one program viewing indicator from at least one signal converter, wherein each program viewing indicator is generated in response to a power consumption of a display connected to a signal converter; (ii) determining a program transmission scheme in response to the at least one program viewing indicator; and (iii) transmitting at least one program according to the program transmission scheme.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates system <b>100</b> and its environment according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">System <b>100</b> includes sensor <b>40</b> and signal converter <b>20</b>. Sensor <b>40</b> is adapted to monitor a display power consumption level.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates sensor <b>40</b> as being included within signal converter <b>20</b>. Alternatively, sensor <b>40</b> can be integrated with signal converter <b>20</b> without being included within it.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Sensor <b>40</b> is connected between display <b>10</b> and a power source (illustrated by power outlet <b>30</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates second power line <b>44</b> that is connected between power outlet <b>30</b> and signal converter <b>20</b> and also illustrates first power line <b>42</b> that is connected between signal converter <b>20</b> and display <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Sensor <b>40</b> is connected to first power line <b>42</b> and can monitor the power level consumption of display <b>10</b>. It is noted that second power line <b>44</b> supplies power to signal converter <b>20</b>, sensor <b>40</b> and display <b>10</b>. It can be connected to a splitter that distributes the power between the components of signal converter <b>20</b>, sensor <b>40</b>, and display <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Signal converter <b>20</b> can be a set top box but this is not necessarily so. Signal converter <b>20</b> includes interface <b>21</b>, media unit <b>23</b>, and controller <b>25</b>. Interface <b>21</b> receives media signals and control signals from remote system <b>50</b>. Signal converter <b>20</b> also includes media unit <b>25</b> that converts the media signals (in response to the control signals) to content that is displayed on display <b>10</b>. It can facilitate conditional access by decoding. Media unit <b>23</b> can also decrypt encrypted information. Controller <b>25</b> can determine to trigger a response from an end user.

<claim-text>receiving by a remote system at least one program viewing indicator from at least one signal converter, wherein each program viewing indicator is generated in response to a power consumption of a display coupled to a signal converter;</claim-text>
<claim-text>determining a program transmission scheme for transmission over a network; wherein the network couples between the remote system and the at least one signal converter and wherein the remote system is located in either one of a hub, a headend, and a Video Service Office (VSO);</claim-text>
<claim-text>transmitting at least one program over the network according to the program transmission scheme, wherein the network couples between the remote system and the at least one signal converter and wherein the remote system is located in either one of a hub, a headend, and a Video Service Office (VSO); and</claim-text>
<claim-text>discontinuing to transmit an unwatched program to the to the at least one signal converter from the remote system in response to determining that the program is not being provided to the display based on the at least one program viewing indicator received from the at least one signal converter.</claim-text>

<claim id="CLM-00020" num="00020">
<claim-text>20. A system for transmitting a program, the system comprises:
<claim-text>a receiver of a remote system that is adapted to receive at least one program viewing indicator from multiple signal converters, wherein each program viewing indicator is generated in response to a power consumption of a display coupled to a signal converter;</claim-text>
<claim-text>a processor, adapted to determine a program transmission scheme for a transmission over a network in response to the at least one program viewing indicator; wherein the network couples between the remote system and the at least one signal converter and wherein the remote system is located in either one of a hub, a headend, and a Video Service Office (VSO);</claim-text>
<claim-text>a transmitter that is adapted to transmit at least one program over the network according to the program transmission scheme wherein the network couples between the remote system and the at least one signal converter and wherein the remote system is located in either one of a hub, a headend, and a Video Service Office (VSO); and</claim-text>
<claim-text>wherein the transmitter is operable to discontinue to transmit an unwatched program to the to the at least one signal converter from the remote system in response to determining that the program is not being provided to the display based on the at least one program viewing indicator received from the at least one signal converter.</claim-text>
