<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-105392, filed on Apr. 30, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FILED</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a wire used in a semiconductor device gets finer and finer, copper (Cu) has recently been employed as material of the wire instead of aluminum (Al). In the semiconductor device with a multi-layered wire structure, it is common that an upper wire is made of Al and a lower wire is made of Cu. This is because it is possible to form a bonding pad for connecting to an external terminal in a package assembling process using the upper wire at the same time as in forming the upper wire.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A surface of a bonding pad made of Cu may tend to be naturally oxidized, thereby causing reduction of bonding strength in a bonding process. For this reason, there is a need to form a contact plug which interconnects the upper Al wire and lower Cu wire. As a method for forming the contact plug, an aluminum reflow method has been known which forms the contact plug using the upper Al wire material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In such an aluminum reflow method, the Al and Cu may easily diffuse into each other and be alloyed with each other with thermal energy, resulting in a high resistance layer made of the alloy thereof. For this reason, in interconnecting the upper Al wire and lower Cu wire through the contact plug formed using the aluminum reflow method, there is highly required a barrier layer for preventing the Al and Cu from diffusing into each other.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-091835 discloses an example in which a metal oxide layer such as TiO<sub>x </sub>(titanium oxide) is employed as the barrier layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1997-213660 discloses a method for forming the contact plug in which a film for the contact plug is formed in a contact hole with good coverage using a long throw sputtering method.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The invention will be now described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many alternative embodiments can be accomplished using the teachings of the present invention and that the invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated for explanatory purpose.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Exemplary Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, first interlayer insulating film <b>2</b> is formed on semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> using oxide silicon (SiO<sub>2</sub>) or low-dielectric material. Using a damascene method, Cu wire <b>3</b> is formed so as to be buried in first interlayer insulating film <b>2</b>. Second interlayer insulating film <b>4</b> is formed on first interlayer insulating film <b>2</b> using oxide silicon (SiO<sub>2</sub>) or low-dielectric material.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Using anisotropic dry etching, contact hole <b>5</b> is formed so as to penetrate through second interlayer insulating film <b>4</b>. A depth of contact hole <b>5</b> is approximately 400 nm for example in case of 50 nm generation DRAM device and an aspect ratio of contact hole <b>5</b> becomes 1.5 to 3. A diameter of contact hole <b>5</b> preferably is approximately 250 to 400 nm. When the diameter of contact hole <b>5</b> is approximately 250 to 400 nm in that way, each of a plurality of films may be reliably formed within the contact hole in a subsequent process.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a top face of Cu wire <b>3</b> is exposed in a bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> and then is naturally oxidized, thereby forming a CuO layer (not shown) in a form of a thin film. Semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> is subjected to an annealing process at temperature equal to or higher than 300&#xb0; C. under hydrogen atmosphere, so that the CuO layer at the top face of Cu wire <b>3</b> in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> is removed away and thus the clean top face of Cu wire <b>3</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Thereafter, by sputtering Ti material using a conventional sputtering apparatus not exhibiting improvement of the film forming coverage in a step region, first Ti film <b>6</b> is formed on an entire surface of the second interlayer insulating film so that a portion (corresponding to a second portion) of first Ti film <b>6</b> on the second interlayer insulating film has approximately 20 nm thickness. In this case, the film forming coverage in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> becomes equal to or less than 5% and accordingly a portion (corresponding to a first portion) of first Ti film <b>6</b> deposited on the top face of Cu wire <b>3</b> in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> has film thickness equal to or smaller than 1 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by sputtering TiN material using a sputtering apparatus exhibiting the improvement of the film forming coverage in the step region, TiN film <b>7</b> is formed on an entire surface of first Ti film <b>6</b> so that a portion (corresponding to a fourth portion) of TiN film <b>7</b> over the second interlayer insulating film has approximately 30 nm thickness. A specific example of the sputtering apparatus exhibiting the improvement of the film forming coverage in the step region may include a long-throw type sputtering apparatus, a collimator type sputtering apparatus, or an ionization sputtering apparatus. In this case, the film forming coverage in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> becomes equal to or more than 10% and accordingly a portion (corresponding to a third portion) of TiN film <b>7</b> deposited over the top face of Cu wire <b>3</b> in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> has film thickness equal to or larger than 3 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, by sputtering Ti material using a sputtering apparatus exhibiting the improvement of the film forming coverage in the step region, second Ti film <b>8</b> is formed on an entire surface of TiN film <b>7</b> so that a portion (corresponding to a sixth portion) of second Ti film <b>8</b> over the second interlayer insulating film has approximately 20 nm thickness. A specific example of the sputtering apparatus exhibiting the improvement of the film forming coverage in the step region may include a long-throw type sputtering apparatus, a collimator type sputtering apparatus, or an ionization sputtering apparatus, In this case, the film forming coverage in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> becomes equal to or more than 10% and accordingly a portion (corresponding to a fifth portion) of second Ti film <b>8</b> deposited over the top face of Cu wire <b>3</b> in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> has film thickness equal to or larger than 2 nm. Second Ti film <b>8</b>, when performing a subsequent aluminum reflow method, serves as a wetting layer for improving reflowing rate of an aluminum film within contact hole <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, by sputtering Al material at room temperature using a sputtering apparatus exhibiting the improvement of the film forming coverage in the step region, first Al film <b>9</b> is formed on an entire surface of second Ti film <b>8</b> so that a portion (corresponding to a eighth portion) of first Al film <b>9</b> over the second interlayer insulating film has approximately 150 nm thickness. A specific example of the sputtering apparatus exhibiting the improvement of the film forming coverage in the step region may include a long-throw type sputtering apparatus, a collimator type sputtering apparatus, or an ionization sputtering apparatus, In this case, the film forming coverage in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> becomes equal to or more than 10% and accordingly a portion (corresponding to a seventh portion) of first Al film <b>9</b> deposited over the top face of Cu wire <b>3</b> in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b> has film thickness equal to or larger than 15 nm. First Al film <b>9</b>, when performing the subsequent aluminum reflow method, serves as a seed Al film.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, using the aluminum reflow method, second Al film <b>10</b> is formed on an entire surface of first Al film <b>9</b> so that a portion of second Al film <b>10</b> over the second interlayer insulating film has approximately 1 &#x3bc;m thickness. To be specific, Al material is sputtered while semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> is heated to 400 to 500&#xb0; C., and thus the Al material reflows with the thermal reaction, thereby filling the Al material into contact hole <b>5</b>. At this time, first Al film <b>9</b> as the seed layer and second Ti film <b>8</b> as the wetting layer react on each other with the thermal reaction, thereby forming Al<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>y </sub>alloy film <b>15</b> (corresponding to an aluminum titanium alloy film), and, at the same time, Al<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>y </sub>alloy film <b>16</b> is formed with first Ti film <b>6</b> and Cu wire <b>3</b> on the top face of Cu wire <b>3</b> in the bottom region of contact hole <b>5</b>. Contact hole <b>5</b> is filled with Al film <b>10</b>, resulting in forming the contact plug.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this exemplary embodiment, first Ti film <b>6</b> is first formed by the sputtering exhibiting the film forming coverage equal to or less than 5% in the bottom region of the contact hole and therefore the reaction between first Ti film <b>6</b> and Cu Wire <b>3</b> is retarded. Meanwhile, first Ti film <b>6</b> on second interlayer insulating film <b>4</b> has the sufficient film thickness of approximately 20 nm and thus crystalline growth of second Al film <b>10</b> through TiN film <b>7</b> formed thereon may be effectively enhanced. As a result, the reliable Al wire layer may be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, Al wire <b>20</b> is formed by patterning the conductive films on second interlayer insulating film <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to check out the effect of this exemplary embodiment, a sample is manufactured in which a Ti film, a barrier layer, and an Al film formed using a conventional sputtering method without using the reflow method are deposited sequentially as conductive films, on silicon oxide formed on a semiconductor substrate. Measured is a sheet resistance (Rs) rising rate of the conductive films before/after an annealing process at the temperature 420&#xb0; C. corresponding to the reflowing temperature. The sheet resistance (Rs) rising rate is represented as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>{(A sheet resistance after the annealing process)&#x2212;(a sheet resistance before the annealing process)}/(the sheet resistance before the annealing process)&#xd7;100(%)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Speaking specifically, there are prepared two sample, i.e., a sample (first exemplary embodiment) in which a Ti film with the thickness equal to or smaller than 1 nm, a barrier layer made of a TiN film and an Al film are formed sequentially, and a comparison sample in which a conventional Ti film with approximately 10 nm thickness, a barrier layer made of TiO<sub>x </sub>(titanium oxide) film and a TiN film, and an Al film are formed sequentially. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the sheet resistance measurement results of a plurality of the samples which have different film thickness of the barrier layer made of the TiN film from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A broken line A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> represents the sheet resistance rising rate in case the barrier layer is not formed and the Al film is directly deposited on the Cu film. In this case, Al/Cu alloy is formed with the annealing process at 420&#xb0; C. and the sheet resistance Rs comes into rising more than two times. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the degree of inter-diffusion between the Al and Cu materials depends on the film thickness of the barrier film. To be specific, destruction of the barrier due to the thermal energy in the annealing process may occur in a thin barrier film region and hence the Al and Cu may easily diffuse into each other and be alloyed with each other with thermal energy, resulting in considerably enhancing the sheet resistance Rs. On the other hand, in a region at which the thickness of the barrier layer becomes equal to or larger than a given thickness, the barrier layer is not destroyed but remains after the annealing process. Therefore, the Al and Cu may not diffuse into each other and not be alloyed with each other with thermal energy, resulting in suppressing the rising of the sheet resistance Rs.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Regarding the comparison between the first embodiment and the comparison example, entire shapes of the curves are substantially similar with each other and the barrier layer effectively functions against the thermal reaction in the conductive films according to the first embodiment. Moreover, in a region at which the film thickness of the barrier layer is small, the sheet resistance Rs rising rate is lower in the first exemplary embodiment of the invention than in the comparison example. This is because in the first embodiment, Cu&#x2014;Ti alloy is hardly formed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As mentioned above, in accordance with the first exemplary embodiment, it is possible to provide, the semiconductor device in which the rising of the contact resistance may be suppressed without adding an extra process.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is apparent that the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, but may be modified and changed without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
