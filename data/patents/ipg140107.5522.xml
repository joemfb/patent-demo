<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/002,016, filed on Dec. 14, 2007, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to a system and method for electronic contracting, and more particularly, electronic contracting in indirect financing transactions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past, the process for generating, assigning, discounting and funding contracts in indirect financing transactions, such as automobile financing and other consumer credit transactions, was driven by the completion and processing of pre-printed paper forms. A dealer would complete the required pre-printed forms, enter into the contract with the customer, assign the contract and related documents to the finance source, e.g., a bank or other financing company, and then physically bundle and deliver the paper contract package (via courier or mail) to the finance source's sales branch. Once the documents were received, the sales branch would manually enter the required data from the contract packages into a computer system. Once data and plan validation were complete, and any remaining issues were resolved, the contract would be released for funding. After the contract was funded, the sales branch would then re-bundle the contract package and forward it to another application or supplier to scan or image the paper contract for account servicing purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recent advances in the computer and telecommunication technologies, however, have had a significant impact on the way financing transactions are conducted. For example, electronic exchange of information, including faxing, emailing, and the like, between dealership finance and insurance staff has enabled dealers to electronically initiate financing transactions for their customers with various independent finance sources, thereby enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy associated with securing consumer financing. However, current e-contracting solutions are only partially automated due to security concerns and lack of integration and cooperation between dealerships and various finance sources. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved e-contracting system that facilitates electronic contract creation, execution and storage and makes available the contracts and related information to dealers and various finance sources in a secure and reliable manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Computer-implemented systems and methods for electronic contracting in indirect financing transactions described herein provide an improved e-contracting environment in which a customer may acquire an asset (such as, for example, an automobile) from a dealer or other vendor with financing for the transaction provided by an independent finance source.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the following description is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other embodiments will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure. Reference will now be made in detail to implementations of the example embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The same reference indicators will be used to the extent possible throughout the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or like items.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the interest of clarity, not all of the routine features of the implementations described herein are shown and described. It will, of course, be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made in order to achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with application- and business-related constraints, and that these specific goals will vary from one implementation to another and from one developer to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of engineering for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with this disclosure, the components, process steps, and/or data structures described herein may be implemented using various types of operating systems, computing platforms, computer programs, and/or general purpose machines. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature, such as hardwired devices, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or the like, may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herein. Where a method comprising a series of process steps is implemented by a computer or a machine and those process steps can be stored as a series of instructions readable by the machine, they may be stored on a tangible medium such as a computer memory device (e.g., ROM (Read Only Memory), PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory), EEPROM (Electrically Eraseable Programmable Read Only Memory), FLASH Memory, Jump Drive, and the like), magnetic storage medium (e.g., tape, magnetic disk drive, and the like), optical storage medium (e.g., CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, paper card, paper tape and the like) and other types of program memory.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As will be understood, for purposes of clarity of exposition, the illustrative embodiments described herein in connection with the drawing figures relate to system and methods for facilitating electronic contracting in the context of indirect financing transactions, such as buying or leasing an automobile offered for sale or lease by an automobile dealership with financing provided by one or more independent finance sources. In some example embodiment, however, the financing may be direct whereby the dealer may act as a finance source when the dealer provides financing for the transaction. Furthermore, example embodiments described herein, are not limited to such automobile retail environments and automobile vehicle financing applications, but may be implemented in myriad other commercial transaction environments and asset financing transactions, including both unsecured and secured credit applications and financing. Furthermore, vehicle financing transactions may involve vehicles other than automobiles (e.g., including cars and trucks), such as boats and other watercraft vehicles, recreational vehicles, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, aircraft and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A financing transaction, as used herein, may be a lease transaction, a loan transaction, or any other transaction in which a finance source provides financing for a party to obtain use of, and possibly also legal title to, an asset, which asset includes, for example, one or more items such as automobiles (e.g., cars, trucks, and the like), marine, recreational vehicles (RV), aircraft, motorcycles, off-road vehicles, consumer goods, real estate, contract rights, intangible property rights, home furnishings, home improvement, office equipment, inventory, manufacturing equipment, livestock, farm equipment, financial interests, and so on. Additionally, the term &#x201c;acquisition&#x201d; used in connection with an asset (e.g., an &#x201c;asset acquisition&#x201d; or &#x201c;acquiring an asset&#x201d;) may involve a purchase (i.e., buying or a corresponding sale) or a lease of the asset, and thus a financing transaction relating to an acquisition may be a lease transaction, a loan transaction, or any other transaction in which a finance source provides financing for a party to obtain use of, and possibly also legal title to, the asset.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additionally, while some example embodiments are described in connection with a transaction involving personal communication (e.g., face-to-face, telephonic, and the like) between a customer and a dealer at a brick-and-mortar dealership, alternative embodiments may be implemented in an e-commerce or online shopping environment (e.g., an online automobile dealer), where a customer may remotely browse an online retailer's website for locating and buying or leasing inventory offered for sale or lease by the online retailer, though such e-commerce or online shopping may also involve some communication between customer and an employee or human agent of the online dealer (e.g., to obtain additional information and/or effect all or part of the transaction). Furthermore, a dealer is not limited to an automobile dealer, but is any individual or entity (e.g., commercial dealership, third party brokers, vendors, retailers, and manufacturers) in the business of selling or leasing assets, including merchandise, to customers, and in doing so may communicate with lenders as well as customers.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A contract, as used herein, may be a document prepared in connection with a transaction for the purchase or financing of a vehicle offered for sale by the dealer with financing provided by a finance source. The contract may include a plurality of document each having various contact provisions, information describing the customer, information describing an automobile, information describing a financing program, and a plurality of signature fields. The contract may be considered executed when it is signed by all contracting parties at the appropriate signature fields. Thus, in one example embodiment, the contract may be executed (e.g., signed) by the customer and the dealer, and then transferred (e.g., assigned) by the dealer to the finance source. In alternative embodiments, the contract may be executed by the customer, the dealer and the finance source. Once executed, the contract becomes a legal instrument that binds the contracting parties to the contract provisions contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one example embodiment, the contract may be generated in an electronic form (i.e., electronic contract) and printed by the dealer for review and execution by the contracting parties. The electronic contract may be created as a text document, postscript document, image file or other type of electronic document. The printed copy of the electronic contract may be executed in the following manner. In one example embodiment, a paper copy of the contract may be signed by the contracting parties, the signature may be scanned by a signature capture device and appended to the electronic version of the contract (i.e., electronic contract), as will be described in a greater detail hereinbelow. In alternative example embodiment, an electronic signature pad may be used to sign an electronic version of the contract and the captured electronic signature may be appended to the electronic contract. The captured image of a handwritten signature will be referred to herein as a holographic or electronic signature.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one example embodiment, the captured holographic signatures of contracting parties may be appended to the electronic contract document. To that end, each captured holographic signature may include signature identification information, such as a contract identifier and a signature identifier. The contract identifier may be a unique number used to associate the captured signature to a specific electronic contract. The signature identifier may be a unique number used to associate the captured signature with a particular signature field within the specific electronic contract. The contract and signature identifiers may be assigned to each newly generated contract. In one example embodiment, contract and signature identifiers may be embedded into the electronic contract. For example, the contract identifier may be placed into the margin of the contract and the signature identifiers may be placed into or next to the associated signature fields. In another example, the contract and signature identifiers may be embedded into the contract document as unique dot patterns, barcodes, numeric sequences and the like, which may be captured by the signature capture device during contract execution.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one example embodiment, a special digital paper may be used to print contract documents. Digital paper is patterned paper used in conjunction with a signature capture devices, such as a digital pen, to create handwritten digital documents. The printed dot pattern uniquely identifies the position coordinates on the paper. In one example embodiment, a digital paper having Anoto dot pattern may used, such paper is manufactured by a Swidish company Anoto Group AB. The Anoto pattern can be printed onto almost any paper, using a standard printing process of at least 600 dpi resolution and carbon-based black ink or the like. In one example embodiment, the one or more unique dot patterns printed on the paper may be associated with a contract identifier and/or signature identifiers for purpose of identification of captured holographic signatures. In particular, the signature capture device may be used to take photo images of the dot pattern within a signature field and identify location of the captured signature. The location coordinates may then be correlated to the corresponding signature identifier. In this manner, the captured holographic signature may be associated with a particular electronic contract and, more specifically, with a particular signature field within the contract.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts one example embodiment of a system for implementing financing transactions in connection with an acquisition of an asset such as an automobile. System <b>100</b> includes automobile dealership computer systems <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>, finance source (FS) systems <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b</i>, <b>104</b><i>c</i>, and a credit management system (CMS) <b>108</b>. Communications between the various dealerships <b>102</b>, FS systems <b>104</b> and CMS system <b>108</b> are provided via network <b>105</b>, which may include any configuration of private and/or public communication networks, packet switched local area networks (LAN) and wide area networks (WAN). In one example embodiment, network <b>105</b> includes the Internet or a data communications network providing similar functionality. Dealership, FS systems, and CMS systems may communicate using messaging formats and protocols known in the art, such as XML-based messaging according to STAR (Standards for Technology in Automotive Retail), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example embodiment, FS systems <b>104</b> provide processing platforms for processing credit applications for financing (e.g., loans and/or leases) an automobile being offered for sale by a dealer to a customer. Examples of finance sources include Lexus Financial Bank&#xae;, BMW Financial Services, General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC&#xae;) Financial Services and others. Embodiments of the present invention, however, are not limited to such automobile retail environments and automobile vehicle financing applications, but may be implemented in myriad other commercial transaction environments and asset financing transactions, including both unsecured and secured credit applications and financing. Accordingly, a finance source (also referred to herein as a lender) may be considered as any entity providing financing for asset (e.g., automobiles in an example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) transactions, e.g., banks and credit unions, manufacturer-related financing companies, financial institutions, and other credit granting institutions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one example embodiment, dealerships <b>102</b> may be independent automobile dealerships (e.g., separately owned businesses) and, as schematically depicted, each including a computer network comprising one or more computer devices <b>103</b> communicably coupled to a Dealer Management System (DMS) <b>101</b>, which may be operating on one or more servers on the dealership's computer network. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the illustrative dealership computer devices <b>103</b> are not limited to personal computers, terminals, or workstations, nor limited to wired network connections within the dealership, but may include any computing device that may communicably connect (e.g., wirelessly; via a WAN, via a virtual private network (VPN) connection, via the Internet, etc.; via one or more hardware devices, such as routers, switches, hubs, etc.; and using any of a variety of communication protocols; etc.) to the Dealer Management System <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As known to those skilled in the art, a typical DMS <b>101</b> (e.g., such as provided by ADP, Inc. or Reynolds and Reynolds, Inc.) or similar system stores and manages dealership data such as that related to inventory, sales, parts, service, customers, etc. In use, the DMS <b>101</b> allows salespersons, management, and other authorized users to access stored dealership data. For example, a salesperson may access DMS <b>101</b> via a computer device (e.g., <b>103</b><i>a</i>) to determine whether the dealership has a certain vehicle in its existing inventory. In addition, as will be further understood below, in various embodiments of the invention, a dealer assisting a customer in arranging for financing to complete the automobile transaction (e.g., lease or sale) may use a dealership computer <b>103</b> to access the DMS <b>101</b> to acquire vehicle information (and possibly also information for a return customer), and may also access (e.g., navigating via a web browser) Credit Management System (CMS) <b>108</b> (e.g., which may be a web-based application) to arrange for financing of the vehicle from finance sources <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one example embodiment, the credit management system (CMS) comprises one or more computer servers connected to the communication network <b>105</b>. CMS system <b>108</b> may be provided by an independent application service provider (ASP), though in various embodiments such a system may be provided, for example, by one or more affiliated dealers. In an embodiment of the invention, CMS <b>108</b> is operable to assist automobile dealers in obtaining automobile financing for customers from disparate finance sources <b>104</b>. To that end, CMS <b>108</b> maintains secure, separate accounts for each independent dealership participant (e.g., subscriber) of the credit management system, which automobile dealer may access via communication network <b>105</b> (e.g., via a secure (e.g., encrypted) communication link). As indicated above, while CMS computer system <b>108</b> is depicted as a computer server <b>108</b>, generally, CMS <b>108</b> may be implemented as, or be part of, a multi-server environment having access to multiple databases to provide such a platform (e.g., including geographically dispersed servers to provide service to geographically dispersed dealers).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">To facilitate electronic execution of indirect financing transactions between customers and various finance sources, CMS <b>108</b> comprises a credit aggregation management system (CAMS) <b>110</b> and a database <b>114</b> in accordance with one example embodiment. CAMS <b>110</b> may be implemented as a web-based application, providing independent dealerships (e.g. <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>) a common platform for electronically submitting automobile financing applications to one or more finance sources (e.g., finance sources <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b</i>, <b>104</b><i>c</i>) with which they do business. Although CAMS <b>110</b> is illustrated as being hosted by the web server <b>108</b>, system <b>110</b> may reside in other locations in the system <b>100</b>. In some example embodiments, one or more of these modules, or portions thereof, may be incorporated into a dealership's local DMS (e.g., DMS <b>101</b><i>a</i>). Additionally, in various embodiments, DMS <b>101</b>, or portions thereof, may be implemented as a web-based service, similar to CMS <b>108</b>, and in some implementations such a web-based DMS system, or portions thereof, may be bundled or included with, or otherwise operate as part of, the web-based CMS <b>108</b>. In short, the particular details of the system <b>100</b> may vary depending upon the particular application or embodiment thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one example embodiment, CAMS <b>110</b> facilitates collection of information about available automobile financing programs from FS systems <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating one example embodiment of a database <b>114</b> for a credit aggregation management system <b>110</b>. As depicted, the collected information may be stored in the finance source (FS) profiles <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, finance source profile information stored in FS profiles <b>210</b> may include, but is not limited to, application worksheets <b>202</b>, which may include applicant worksheets for collecting personal information about the customer and deal worksheets for collecting financial information and vehicle information. FS profiles <b>210</b> may also include financing programs information <b>206</b>, which may include information on the term of available loan and lease programs, including their amortization and interest rates and other financial information. FS profiles <b>210</b> may also store supplemental forms <b>208</b>, which may include retail loan agreements, lease agreements and other financial forms, that may be provided to the customer in connection with the financing of the vehicle. FS profiles <b>210</b> may also include various application validation rules <b>212</b>, which may be used to check validity of application data entered by the dealer before it is being submitted to the finance source for approval. FS profiles <b>210</b> may also include contract templates <b>204</b>, which are used to generate electronic contracts based on approved credit application data. Various example embodiments of the configuration and operation of CAMS <b>110</b> are described in a commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/006,016, entitled &#x201c;System and Method for Electronic Contracting&#x201d;, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To facilitate storage of executed electronic contracts, CAMS database <b>114</b> further includes an e-contract vault <b>220</b> according to one example embodiment. Vault <b>220</b> is configured to store a plurality of electronic contract packages <b>222</b>. Each package may include the original electronic contract <b>224</b>, supplemental forms <b>232</b> and various ancillary documents <b>234</b>, such as co-buyers agreement, insurance verification, service contract, GAP waiver, odometer statement, vehicle title, after market products and state-specific forms and others. Each electronic contract <b>224</b> may include a text document, postscript document, image file or other type of electronic document. In addition, each electronic contract <b>224</b> may include one or more holographic signatures <b>228</b>, which indicate execution of the contract by the contracting parties. The holographic signatures <b>228</b> may include customer signature, dealers signature and finance source representative's signature. A holographic signature <b>228</b> may be a photo image of the original signature captured during contract execution by the signature capture devices <b>115</b>, as will be described in a greater detail hereinbelow. Each holographic signature <b>228</b> may include signature information (not shown) associating each signature to one or more signature fields within the contract <b>226</b>. Such information may include a signature identifier associated with one or more signature fields. In one example embodiment, each e-contract package <b>222</b> may be signed with a digital signature to indicate authenticity of the contents of each EC package <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A digital signature is data that binds a user's identity to the information being stored. A digital signature may be bundled with any message, file, or other digitally encoded information, or transmitted separately. Digital signatures are used in public key environments and provide authentication and integrity services. A digital certificate is a digitally signed statement that contains information about an entity and the entity's public key, thus binding these two pieces of information together. A certificate may be issued by a trusted organization (or entity) called a certification authority (CA) after the CA has verified that the entity is who it says it is. Certificates can contain different types of data. For example, it can include the format of the certificate, the serial number of the certificate, the algorithm used to sign the certificate, the name of the CA that issued the certificate, the name and public key of the entity requesting the certificate, and the CA's signature. In one example embodiment, CMS <b>108</b> may use an independent digital certificate vendor, such as VeriSign Inc. or a similar vendor, to issue the certificates used in storage of electronic contracts.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depict one example embodiment of a process for electronic contracting in indirect financing transactions in which a customer may acquire an asset (such as, for example, an automobile) from a dealer or other vendor with financing for the transaction provided by an independent finance source. At step <b>405</b>, e-contracting application <b>112</b> generates an electronic contract for vehicle financing. Several example embodiments of contract generation process are described in a commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/002,016, filed on Dec. 14, 2007, entitled &#x201c;System and Method for Electronic Contracting&#x201d;, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In one example embodiment, e-contracting application <b>112</b> may assign a unique contract identifier to the newly created contract. This contract identifier may be used to identify and properly route the data in all communications and messaging that may occur between CMS <b>108</b>, dealership computer systems <b>102</b> and finance source systems <b>104</b> in connection with execution of this electronic contract.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one example embodiment, e-contracting application <b>112</b> may store a newly created (unexecuted) contract in a contract vault <b>220</b>, step <b>410</b>. One example embodiment, of a structure for storing a newly created e-contract is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As shown, data structure <b>600</b> may include an e-contract <b>405</b> and a plurality of signature blocks <b>610</b>-<b>630</b>, where holographic signatures of contracting parties may be inserted once the contract is executed. When an e-contract <b>605</b> is first created in the contract vault <b>220</b> it may be secured with a digital signature <b>640</b>, as will be described in a greater detail herein below. In one example embodiment, e-contracting application <b>112</b> may assign a transaction number or other identifier to each new contract created in contract vault <b>220</b>. The transaction number or other identifier may be used as the primary key in storing contract documents in the contract vault <b>220</b>. In one example embodiment, the transaction number may be the same as contract identifier described above. In another example, embodiment the transaction may be different from the contract identifier</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, e-contracting application <b>112</b> may generate an EC Package by systematically merging the electronic contract with various supplemental forms and ancillary documents, step <b>415</b>. Each finance source may be responsible for creating its own supplemental forms and ancillary documents and ensuring that each is accurate and compliant with all applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations. E-contracting application <b>112</b> may access these forms from FS profiles <b>210</b>. For each applicable deal type, the finance source may identify the contract forms and other supplemental forms to be used. For example, the deal type may be determined based on the six deal type parameters selected by the dealer: finance source, application type (e.g., individual, individual with co-buyer), transaction type (e.g., retail), product type (e.g., simple interest, actuarial), state, and sale class (e.g., new, used). The supplemental forms may be customized based on the collected customer data, such as with the customer's name, address etc. Each contract form may explicitly indicate that the customer is agreeing to conduct the transaction electronically and agreeing to use electronic records and electronic signatures to document the contract. The dealer may also ask the customer to provide various ancillary documents, which may then be faxed or transmitted to CMS <b>108</b> using mail or other means. The received documents are then appended to e-contract.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, e-contracting application <b>112</b> may provide the dealer with a copy of the EC package documents for review and execution by the contracting parties, step <b>420</b>. To that end, e-contracting application <b>112</b> may extract from the contract vault <b>220</b> and/or FS profiles <b>210</b> a copy of the forms and documents making up the EC package <b>222</b>. E-contracting application <b>112</b> may render each document and present it to the dealer in the electronic form. The dealer may then print all documents constituting the EC package <b>222</b>, including the electronic contract <b>224</b>, supplemental forms <b>232</b> and ancillary documents <b>234</b>. In one example embodiment, before or during printing of these documents, e-contracting application <b>112</b> may embed the contract identifier and various signature identifiers into the contract document and other documents and forms. For example, the contract identifier may be placed into the margin of the contract and the signature identifiers may be placed into or next to the associated signature fields. In another example, the contract and signature identifiers may be embedded into the contract document as unique dot patterns, barcodes, numeric sequences or in other graphic or numeric formats. The contract package is then reviewed and executed by the contracting parties. One example embodiment of a contract execution process is described herein below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Once electronic contract is executed by all contracting parties, e-contracting application <b>112</b> is configured to collect captured holographic signatures of the contracting parties, so that they can be appended to the electronic contract stored in the in the vault <b>220</b>, step <b>425</b>. In one example embodiment, e-contracting application <b>112</b> may use signature identification information, such as contract identifier and signature identifiers, provided along with the holographic signatures to associate each holographic signature to the pre-designated line on the e-contract in the vault <b>220</b>. The signatures may be affixed in such a way that the date and time of each signature capture, as well as the authenticity of each unique signature is embedded in the e-contract. At this point, the dealer is able to save and exit the contract generation process if necessary in order to return at a later time for the remaining party(s) to complete all required signatures. After all required signatures have been obtained, e-contracting application <b>112</b> may update the electronic contract from a signatures-in-process status to an Authoritative Copy (AC).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Once the AC of the e-contract has been created, the dealer may assign and distribute the electronic contract to the finance source, step <b>430</b>. To that end, the dealer may invoke the &#x201c;Assign Contract&#x201d; function provided by e-contracting application <b>112</b>. The system will display the finance source as the assignee to which the contract will be sent, and state that by clicking the &#x201c;Assign&#x201d; button the dealer is assigning the contract to the finance source under the terms and conditions of the dealer agreement governing such assignments. Once this is completed, the e-contracting application will enable the &#x201c;Distribute&#x201d; function to the dealer. The offer and acceptance of such assignment shall be affected electronically and recorded by the e-contracting application <b>112</b>. After the contract assignment is accepted by the finance source, the ownership logs will be updated and the finance source will become the assignee of record.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">E-contracting application <b>112</b> may then permanently seal the electronic contract using a designated digital certificate that is reserved solely for signing the Authoritative Copy of a contract, step <b>435</b>. The presence of this digital certificate, as obtainable through the digital signature, will identify it as the Authoritative Copy. Upon saving the Authoritative Copy in the contract vault <b>220</b>, step <b>440</b>, the e-contracting application <b>112</b> may update contract ownership logs (not depicted) with the dealer ownership information. E-contracting application <b>112</b> may enable the dealer to print the entire signed electronic contract package once all required signatures have been affixed thereto. The printed contract documents may be marked in the margin(s) as a non-authoritative copy. It is the dealer's responsibility to ensure that the customer is provided with a printed copy of the signed EC package before leaving the dealership.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts one example embodiment of a process for contract execution. As indicated above, the dealer may initiate the contract execution process by retrieving a copy of the EC package from the contract vault via user interface of the e-contracting application. The dealer may then print all documents in the EC package and provide them to the customer for review, step <b>505</b>. In one example embodiment, the contract may be printed on a digital paper, as described above. In another example embodiment, contract identification information, such as contract identifier and one or more signature identifiers, may be embedded in the designated locations in the printed contract document. For example, the contract identifier may be placed in the margin of the contract and the signature identifiers may be placed into or next to the associated signature fields. In another example, the contract and signature identifiers may be embedded into the contract document as unique dot patterns, barcodes or numeric sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The dealer may then provide a signature capture device to the customer, step <b>510</b>. In one example embodiment, the signature capture device may be a digital pen. When the user uses the pen to sign paper copy of the contract, the pen is configured to capture a handwritten signature of the contracting party, step <b>515</b>. For example, the digital pen may take one or more digital photographs of the handwritten signature and save them as a holographic signature. In case the signature field also includes a signature identifier embedded therein in the form of a dot pattern, barcode or numeric sequence, the digital pen also captures the image of the embedded signature identifier and stores it along with the corresponding holographic signature, step <b>520</b>. In addition, the pen may be used to capture contract identifier, which may be located in a margin of the document or as a barcode to be scanned by the pen. Furthermore, the pen may record the date and time when the signature was captured. In case the contract is printed on the digital paper, the pen may be configured to captures signature location information encoded in the printed dot pattern. The captured location information may be associated with appropriate contract and signature identifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the digital pen in docked in the base unit, the captured holographic signatures and signature identification information may be transferred to the e-contracting application for processing, step <b>525</b>. The e-contracting application uses signature identification information, and, in particular, the captured contract identifier to locate in the contract vault an electronic contract associated with the captured holographic signatures. Once such contract is located, the e-contracting application determines based on the signature identifiers, which captured holographic signatures are associated with which contract signature fields, step <b>530</b>. Once signature/field associations are established, the e-contracting application may append captured holographic signatures of contracting parties to the e-contract document in the EC package in the contract vault, step <b>535</b>. The e-contracting application may then permanently seal the electronic contract as Authoritative Copy using a designated digital certificate.</p>
