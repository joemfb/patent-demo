<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/886,086 filed on Jan. 22, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure herein generally relates to designs for a high pressure food package and system and, more particularly, to designs for a modified atmosphere food package that is capable of retaining a high internal pressure and designs for a system for using such package(s). Various embodiments are described, some of which incorporate features for the automatic release of excessive internal pressure that might be caused by heating, pressure differentials, internal fermentation of the product contained, or other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modified atmosphere packaging generally refers to the practice of modifying the composition of the internal atmosphere or headspace of a package in order to improve the shelf-life of the product. The product is typically a food product but may also include pharmaceuticals or other types of products. The modification usually involves attempts to lower the amount of oxygen in order to slow down the growth of aerobic organisms and the speed of oxidation reactions. The removed oxygen is typically replaced with nitrogen, commonly known as an inert gas, or carbon dioxide, which can lower the pH or inhibit the growth of bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the context of food products, modified atmosphere packaging is generally considered a technique used for prolonging the shelf-life of fresh or minimally processed foods. In this preservation technique, the air surrounding the food in the package is changed to another composition using, for example, a gas-flush process. The initial fresh state of the food may be prolonged by slowing the natural deterioration of the food product. Respiring foods such as fruits and vegetables continue to take in oxygen and give off carbon dioxide as they continue to respire and ripen after harvest. Refrigeration and controlled atmosphere storage methods may be used to retard the ripening process. Reducing temperature slows the produce metabolism, including the rate of respiration. Under controlled atmosphere storage, respiration and ripening may be reduced further by lowering the oxygen content of the air, which normally consists of approximately 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, and 1% other elements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A recent need for using modified atmospheres, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2), is to enhance the flavor of foods by creating an effervescent character during tasting (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5,968,573, which is incorporated herein by reference). This method involves the generation of positive CO2 pressure within a sealable container filled with food such that the CO2 diffuses by osmosis into the water content of the food. The development of carbonated foods (e.g. FIZZY FRUIT&#x2122; branded carbonated fruit products) has created a need for a safe and convenient package to distribute single servings.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One example of a package directed to retaining a positive pressure atmosphere within the package is a tennis ball can (or tennis ball tube). The air pressure inside a tennis ball is typically 12 psi (pounds per square inch) greater than the ambient air pressure at sea level. Over time, air escapes from the inside of the ball causing a decrease in the amount of air pushing on the inside of the ball and, consequently, decreasing the bounce characteristics of the ball. To prevent the ball from becoming &#x201c;flat,&#x201d; the ball is packaged in a positive pressure tube, with the tube pressurized to around 12 psi, which is enough to prevent air from escaping from the inside of the ball. Another example of a positive pressure package is the ubiquitous soda bottle, which is directed to maintaining carbon dioxide saturated liquid under pressures of up to 50 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Designs for a high pressure food package and system that provides a sufficiently pressurized and controllable gaseous environment are desirable. Such designs may be applicable for use with the carbonated fruits or vegetables products described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,968,573, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/857,043, or U.S. application Ser. No. 11/454,814, all commonly owned or licensed by The Fizzy Fruit Company and each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments. However, those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details, that the present invention is not limited to the depicted embodiments, and that the present invention may be practiced in a variety of alternate embodiments. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, components, and systems have not been described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various operations may be described as multiple discrete steps performed in turn in a manner that is helpful for understanding the preferred embodiments. However, the order of description should not be construed as to imply that these operations are necessarily performed in the order they are presented, nor even order dependent. Lastly, repeated usage of the phrase &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d; does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, although it may.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As an overview, the present inventors determined that designs for a high pressure food package and system are needed that provide a package with a sufficiently pressurized and controllable gaseous modified atmosphere for a quantity of product, such as, for example, fresh-cut fruits or vegetables, yet at the same time remains safe, easy to open and use, re-sealable, and portable. However, the present inventors discovered that some types of packaging are less desirable because: the package may have too small of an opening to allow for easy access to food pieces (i.e. the package was designed (by others) for other types of (liquid) products); the package is not capable of maintaining the positive pressure levels necessary to effectively enhance the flavor of foods (i.e. effervescence); and/or the package comprises materials and methods that do not readily fit into the recycling stream. For example, one package under development for carbonating foods uses an aluminum lid seamed to a plastic cup. This makes recycling more difficult because of the tight weld between the two materials, which cannot be separated easily enough using existing reclaiming methods. This aluminum/plastic type of package may also create potentially dangerous metal edges if the package were to burst open from too much internal pressure, for example from internal fermentation of the food product. Consequently, the present inventors determined that not only is it desirable that the new package hold sufficient internal pressure, but it is desirable that the new package be capable of automatically releasing excessive internal pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present inventors discovered that for some types of packaging, once a container with a fixed amount of food is initially pressurized to its maximum level with gas and then sealed, the gas in the head space will gradually diffuse into the tissues of the food product and reduce the overall internal pressure within the package. The reduced internal pressure level may not be sufficient to produce the intended strongly enhanced or effervescent flavor profile for the particular food product. In testing one embodiment of the aluminum/plastic type package described above, after the initial gas pressurization to the package's maximum capability (i.e. approximately 35 psi), the pressure equilibrates after diffusion into the tissues of the food product so as to reduce the internal pressure of the package to only about 20 psi, resulting in weaker effervescence than desired.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present inventors further discovered that with various other methods for enhancing food flavor with carbon dioxide, the level of carbonation (or absorbed carbon dioxide) varies with the internal pressure of carbon dioxide during the step of maintaining the internal pressure within the package or container. The inventors discovered that this relationship can be controlled by pressure devices that are capable of setting a specific internal pressure level of carbon dioxide, and that this resulted in an effervescent (or &#x201c;fizzy&#x201d;) tasting intensity that can be reproduced more reliably. A &#x201c;fizziness&#x201d; scale from 1 to 5 is currently being developed by the inventors to qualitatively describe this relationship to internal CO2 pressure. However, the inventors determined that existing packaging systems are not capable of controlling and maintaining the internal pressure level at specific levels, especially high levels.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present inventors invented a high pressure food package and system that provides, in one embodiment: a high pressure food package comprising a sealable container having a wide mouth cup and lid, the sealable container suitably designed for holding a quantity of non-liquid food product, and an integral or separate gas seal within the sealable container capable of retaining and maintaining a positive pressure within the sealable container, the gas seal configured so that the positive pressure inside the container energizes (i.e. makes stronger) the seal; and a collar and apparatus capable of holding the container and filling the container through its seal during partial closure of the lid onto the cup with a desired quantity of gas to create a specific sensory level of effervescence.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the package is capable of providing a pressurized carbon dioxide rich atmosphere, initially to approximately 60 psi, and equilibrating to approximately 40 psi, for carbonating or maintaining the carbonation of a quantity of food, such as fruits or vegetables. In one embodiment, an optimum amount of oxygen is provided in the gas mixture to avoid dangerous anaerobic conditions if the food product is not itself inherently toxic (e.g. acidic) to such pathogens. The gas mixture may comprise a predetermined combination of CO2 and O2. For example, the gas mixture may comprise 95% CO2 and 5% O2 in order to provide an effervescent character to the food product yet prevent anaerobic microbial growth (e.g. <i>C. botulinum</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, a collar apparatus holds the cup down with a vacuum while filling through the threaded seal and partially closed lid the desired volume and composition of gasses internally. The desired volume is detected by a pressure sensor which stops the filling and releases the vacuum after the lid is tightened to a specific torque level. In one embodiment, an apparatus fills the package mechanically with the desired modified atmosphere to a controllable level of pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the high pressure food package comprises a sealable container having a wide mouth cup and lid, the lid having on its surface a one-way valve through which gas may be injected into the container, and a foil liner or other membrane suitably designed so as to burst when internal pressure within the container exceeds a predetermined level. For example, the high pressure food package may comprise a plastic cup and screw-on type threaded lid within which a quantity of product, such as a portion or a serving of fresh-cut fruits or vegetables, may be retained in a modified atmosphere (comprising, in part, pressurized carbon dioxide), the lid having a one-way membrane type valve as well as a foil liner. In one embodiment, the foil liner is sealed to the rim of the cup whereafter gas may be injected into the container through the one-way valve. In one embodiment, a hand operated gas filling device may be used for injecting the gas into the sealed container (through the one-way valve).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a sectional side view of an exemplary high pressure food package and system, it can be seen that one embodiment of the package system <b>100</b> includes a polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE) plastic wide mouth cup <b>102</b> and polypropylene (PP) lid <b>104</b> joined with four (12 pitch, 0.083&#x2033;) interrupted threads <b>105</b> and a built in one or more point seal <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> inside the lid which comes into contact with the top rim <b>112</b> of the cup during tightening. Preferably, the rim <b>112</b> defines an opening into the cup <b>102</b> that is wide enough to allow finger access to chunks or pieces of non-liquid food product previously introduced into the cup <b>102</b>. Other materials may be used for the cup <b>102</b> and lid <b>104</b>, and the one or more point seal <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may be formed integral to the cup <b>102</b> or lid <b>104</b> or may comprise separate components suitably fit to the cup <b>102</b> or lid <b>104</b> so as to provide a sealing function. As shown, seal <b>106</b> comprises a flap of material, annular in shape, formed integral to the lid <b>104</b>, and allows for gas to flow into the cup interior space <b>114</b> but prevents gas from flowing back out of the interior space <b>114</b> when the pressure in the space <b>114</b> exceeds an opposing pressure external to the cup <b>102</b> and lid <b>104</b> (and acting through the threads <b>104</b>). The lid <b>104</b> may include a one or more point seal <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> that engage with surfaces proximate to the rim <b>112</b> when the lid <b>104</b> is tightened downward upon the cup <b>102</b>. The threads <b>105</b> may or may not be interrupted type threads and may comprise other configurations in terms of pitch, size, and count.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A pressure chamber <b>116</b> is formed by collar housing <b>118</b>, support block <b>120</b>, bottom O-ring <b>124</b> and base plate <b>122</b>, which together hold the (as shown, partially closed) cup <b>102</b> and lid <b>104</b> assembly down by means of a vacuum <b>126</b> created in the pressure chamber <b>128</b> against the barrier of the cup and lid touching the upper <b>130</b> and lower O-rings <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the vacuum <b>126</b> is applied, the cup and lid assembly is held down while the desired gas <b>134</b> (e.g. CO2) is pumped into the package through the threads <b>105</b> apposing and joining the cup <b>102</b> and lid <b>104</b>. The detail view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the path of the gas by the arrow <b>134</b>. As shown, a plug <b>136</b> may be used to block off additional access to the flow path <b>138</b> for the gas <b>134</b>. A flap of lid material <b>106</b> acts as a one-way valve allowing pressure to build within the interior space <b>114</b> of the package. When a desired internal pressure is detected, the pressurization stops and is removed, and the same flap <b>106</b>&#x2014;due to its elasticity&#x2014;acts to seal the pressure inside the package by way of its apposition against the cup rim <b>112</b>. The internal pressure itself acts to energize this seal <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In various embodiments the package may comprise a screw lid which can hold pressure by means of an integral or separate pressure energized seal. The seal, such as the material flap <b>106</b> shown, is forced against the edge of the cup <b>102</b> and lid <b>104</b> (proximate to the rim <b>112</b>) in such a way as to provide a very low torque required to open the cup and lid package. Other screw cap designs require a compression force between the lid/seal and cup/seal, but in the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref> the material flap seal <b>106</b> provides a greater sealing force as the pressure is increased within the cup. The gas filling method may use a partially engaged seal and still allow pressure to build inside the cup because the differential pressure between the collar chamber and the package would flex the material flap seal <b>106</b> inward, creating a gas flow path <b>134</b>. An adhesive strip may be applied over the junction of the cup <b>102</b> and lid <b>104</b> to prevent inadvertent lid rotation and to provide indication of product tampering.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Several different embodiments of a pressure energized seal, using one or multiple points of contact between the lid <b>104</b> and the cup <b>102</b>, may be used. The seal may be integral (part of the lid <b>104</b>) or separate (such as an O-ring) or applied as a different material coated onto the lid <b>104</b>. For example, the seal may be a soft but durable substance such as silicon sprayed onto the surface of the lid. Additional material might be added to the screw threads <b>105</b> (on either or both of the cooperatively sized threads on the lid <b>104</b> and cup <b>102</b>) to assist in sealing.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Another embodiment may include curved fitted forms at the edge of the lid <b>104</b> and cup <b>102</b>, such that internal pressure inside the package holds the lid and cup together by means of the apposition of the forms, which fit together like two spoons.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the lid <b>104</b> after package pressurization (i.e. after filling the package with gas) is tightened (to a specific torque) against the cup <b>102</b> by means of a torque wrench fitted to grab the lid using small fins protruding from the lid exterior surface for traction/grip. Preferably, opening the pressurized container (or depressurization) is accomplished by turning the lid to allow pressurized gas within the package to vent through the screw threads <b>105</b>. Re-tightening or re-sealing the lid <b>104</b> after opening the package may provide extended retention of the modified atmosphere in product remaining in the package. Preferrably, the re-sealed package is capable of retaining a positive internal pressure (as gas escapes from the food product and into the internal space <b>114</b> within the package or if additional gas is injected into the re-sealed package) so as to extend, maintain, or improve the effervescent character of the remaining product.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, PETE plastic may be used for one or both of the cup <b>102</b> and lid <b>104</b> and may be &#x201c;oriented&#x201d; such that overpressure first stretches and then rips longitudinally to prevent shrapnel. Preferably, materials used for the cup <b>102</b> and lid <b>104</b> comprise food-grade materials suitable for holding food product and are recyclable using currently available reclaiming/recycling methods. Preferably, the materials and designs used for the cup and lid package are such that the package is able to safely maintain internal pressures (measured as the differential pressure above ambient or external pressure, at sea level) of up to 90 psi so as to handle varied market conditions, for example, hot days, air travel, and dropping the package.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, different colors of material may be used for one or both of the cup <b>102</b> and lid <b>104</b> to indicate the specific content of the package. For example, different colors may be used for particular types or combinations of fresh cut or minimally processed fruits or vegetables that may comprise the packaged product. As another example, a particular color may be used for packaged carbonated fresh fruit, and a different color may be used where the non-liquid food product comprises high viscosity sauces or smoothies.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exemplary schematic for a pneumatic system for use with the high pressure food package and system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is provided. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> provide an exemplary flow chart showing method steps for operating the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the package system <b>100</b> may be controlled by a series of valves and switches so that the simple action of dropping a partially closed cup and lid assembly into the housing <b>118</b> while pressing a foot switch results in a sequence of events that holds the package down by vacuum, pressurizes the internal space <b>114</b> of the package through the threads <b>105</b> and one-way or material flap seal <b>106</b>, allows for tightening of the lid <b>104</b> to the cup <b>102</b>, and then releases the pressurized package by reversing the vacuum <b>126</b> underneath the package to a positive pressure which ejects the filled package.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, a foot switch (not shown) starts a vacuum pump VP, which when the vacuum is sufficient (determined using pressure gauge #<b>3</b> PG<b>3</b>) to hold the cup down activates pressure switch #<b>1</b> PS<b>1</b> to open valve #<b>5</b> V<b>5</b>, which begins filling the package with gas from a gas cylinder GC. When the desired internal package pressure is reached (e.g. 50 psi) and detected by gauge #<b>2</b> PG<b>2</b>, pressure switch #<b>2</b> PS<b>2</b> activates five valves, valve #<b>1</b> V<b>1</b>, valve #<b>2</b> V<b>2</b>, valve #<b>3</b> V<b>3</b>, valve #<b>4</b> V<b>4</b>, and valve #<b>6</b> V<b>6</b>, which cycle and reset the system as described in the flow chart detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the pressure through the seal is discontinued, the remaining internal pressure inside the package energizes the seal <b>106</b> and maintains the internal pressure while the step of tightening the lid occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The package is filled with a desired gas mixture to a preset pressure through the threaded lid during sealing, resulting&#x2014;after equilibration of the gas into the product&#x2014;in a desired level of effervescence in the product. If a scale is described from 1 to 5, where 1 is barely detectable effervescence, and 5 is visible and auditory effervescence (bubbles bursting from the product), the system preferably is capable of consistently reproducing any level of effervescence required in the product.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To achieve the desired effervescence and, therefore, the corresponding internal equilibrium pressures, the initial pressure is preferably greater than the subsequent equilibrium pressure in order to allow for the diffusion of gas into the product over time (e.g. a number of hours). The relationship of the initial to equilibrated pressure is a function of the mass of gas added and the headspace volume existing outside of the product within the package, according to the following equation:</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0055">However, for a given volume of product inside a cup, if you increase the headspace or the volume of the cup, V<sub>1</sub>, it will increase the initial number of moles of CO2, i.e., n<sub>1 </sub>or the mass of CO2 inside the cup. In this way one can increase the fizziness level at the same pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0056">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a cut side view of an exemplary high pressure food package that involves an overpressure feature is provided. In one embodiment, CO2 to pressurize the package <b>400</b> and generate the desired effervescence is forced through a nipple <b>402</b> in the center of the plastic cap <b>404</b> through a one-way membrane valve <b>406</b> covering a central hole in a foil induction seal liner <b>408</b> that has been electrothermally welded to the edge or rim <b>410</b> of the plastic bottle <b>412</b>. A production method for such package may comprise of first filling an interior space <b>414</b> of the bottle <b>412</b> with a quantity of food product, then torquing the cap <b>404</b> including the foil liner <b>408</b> and one-way valve <b>406</b> onto the cup or bottle <b>412</b> at a predetermined force, putting the cap <b>404</b> and bottle <b>412</b> through a device to electrothermally weld the foil liner <b>408</b> to the cup edge <b>410</b> thus creating the seal, and finally filling the package <b>400</b> with CO2 gas through the nipple <b>402</b> on the cap <b>404</b>. The cap <b>404</b> is preferably torqued to the bottle at a predetermined force that is low enough for easy hand removal of the cap (i.e. for use by children). The foil liner <b>408</b> provides an overpressure safety feature. If the internal pressure within the package exceeds a predetermined threshold, for example due to excessive heating of the pressurized package, the foil liner <b>408</b> is preferably designed to burst, typically near the rim <b>410</b>, or separate slightly from the rim <b>410</b> thereby releasing pressure from within the package. Other materials, such as a membrane liner or a plastic film, may be used for the overpressure safety feature, and such materials may be applied using a process other than an electrothermal (i.e. induction or radio frequency (RF) heating) process to seal the material to the rim <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0057">In various embodiments, the bottle <b>412</b> may comprise a cup <b>102</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> or share one or more of the characteristics of the cup <b>102</b> previously described. Likewise, the cup <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> may comprise one or more of the characteristics of the bottle (or cup) <b>412</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Similarly, the lid <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and the cap (or lid) <b>404</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> may share one or more characteristics. For example, in one embodiment, the bottle <b>412</b> comprises threads <b>416</b> which cooperatively mate with threads <b>418</b> formed on the cap <b>404</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the cooperatively mating threads <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> are shaped differently than the threads <b>105</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Other thread shapes may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a cut bottom view of the lid portion of the high pressure food package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. As viewed from the bottom of the lid (or cap) <b>404</b>, according to a preferred embodiment, a one-way membrane valve <b>406</b> is centered about the nipple <b>402</b> so that an opening <b>440</b> in the nipple is aligned with an opening <b>426</b> in the foil liner <b>408</b> and an opening <b>424</b> in the membrane valve <b>406</b>. Gas injected into the nipple opening <b>440</b> passes through the foil liner opening <b>426</b>, into the membrane valve opening <b>424</b>, and the channel <b>420</b> between channel sides <b>422</b>, <b>423</b> before beginning to fill the interior space <b>414</b> of the package <b>400</b>. Preferably, the foil liner opening <b>426</b> has a dimension (or diameter) <b>432</b> that is at least as large as the dimension <b>442</b> of the nipple opening <b>440</b>. Preferably, the valve opening <b>424</b> has a dimension <b>430</b> at least as large as the dimension <b>432</b> of the foil liner opening <b>426</b>. In one embodiment, the membrane valve <b>406</b> comprises a channel <b>420</b> between channel sides <b>422</b>, <b>423</b> having a width dimension <b>428</b> that is larger than the valve opening dimension <b>430</b> so that membrane material in the bottom layer <b>438</b> is able to flex upward (as internal pressure within the interior space <b>414</b> of the package builds) to seal the channel <b>420</b> and the valve opening <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a cut side view of the lid of the high pressure food package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> showing in greater detail the foil liner <b>408</b> with one-way membrane valve <b>406</b> loaded into the lid (cap) <b>404</b>, according to one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a detail sectional view of the one-way valve region of the lid of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and shows more clearly the layers comprising the valve and liner, in one embodiment. The component layers, from top to bottom, of the plastic cap <b>404</b> with a central nipple <b>402</b>, an induction seal foil liner <b>408</b>, and a one-way valve <b>406</b>, which itself consists of three membrane layers <b>434</b>, <b>422</b>/<b>423</b>, <b>438</b>. A channel in the middle layer <b>422</b>/<b>423</b> of the one-way valve <b>406</b> is forced open slightly by positive pressure applied from the nipple opening <b>440</b> and directed toward the center of the valve <b>406</b> to allow gas to flow in one direction, in this case, into the bottle <b>412</b>. Back pressure on the bottom layer <b>438</b> of the one-way valve <b>406</b> collapses at least the bottom layer <b>438</b> to prevent back flow of gas out of the bottle <b>412</b> and nipple <b>402</b>. In one embodiment, a small amount of viscous fluid, such as, for example, a drop of food-grade oil, may be placed in the valve opening <b>424</b> (which may then migrate into the channel <b>420</b>) to help seal the channel <b>420</b> as back pressure deflects the bottom layer <b>438</b> to close the one-way valve.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0060">The induction seal foil liner <b>408</b> may comprise a foil liner material coated on one side with a plastic material that heats when passed through the induction (or RF) energy field associated with induction sealing processes. The heated plastic coating then adheres to the surface in contact with the coating. Preferably, the plastic coating is oriented so as to adhere to the rim <b>410</b> of the bottle <b>412</b>, and the foil liner <b>408</b> or the weld joint between the rim <b>410</b> and foil liner <b>408</b> is suitably designed so as to fail at a predetermined pressure. For example, the foil liner <b>408</b> may be designed to fail at 90 psi internal pressure. Preferably, the foil liner <b>408</b> is suitably designed so as to burst (or develop a leak at the weld joint with the rim <b>410</b>) as the lid <b>404</b> of the package <b>400</b> is twisted off/open. In a preferred embodiment, as the lid <b>404</b> is opened, the seal fails and begins to release pressure. Once the lid <b>404</b> is removed, the foil liner <b>408</b> remains on the edge/rim <b>410</b> of the bottle <b>412</b> and may be peeled off by pulling back a tab of liner material that extends just beyond the edge/rim <b>410</b> of the bottle <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0061">The present inventors discovered that if the foil liner seal weld is too strong, the seal may not fail soon enough when the cap is removed, resulting in a &#x201c;pop&#x201d; as the seal bursts abruptly. In a preferred embodiment, the strength of the weld between the foil liner <b>408</b> and the edge of the cup <b>410</b> is controlled such that the seal it creates is the weak link in the pressure integrity of the package. That is, the foil liner <b>408</b> detaches from the edge <b>410</b> of the cup <b>412</b> when the internal pressure reaches a predetermined value, e.g. 90 psi. At this point the package can no longer hold excess internal pressure and becomes incapable of preserving the effervescent effect. This safety feature addresses situations when a package may be thermally abused by a consumer resulting in internal fermentation of the food. Instead of excess pressure potentially bursting the package in uncontrolled or undesirable ways, the liner seal material is suitably designed to fail first and thereby allow pressure to escape through the threads between the cup <b>412</b> and lid <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0062">In one embodiment, after initial removal of the lid <b>404</b> from the pressurized package <b>400</b>, the foil seal will have been broken but may be kept in place (e.g. by only partially peeling back the foil liner <b>408</b>) so that re-closing the lid <b>404</b> over the bottle <b>412</b> once again provides a package capable of retaining internal pressure. Additional CO2 may be injected into the package <b>400</b> to further extend the effervescence desired, for example, to maintain a higher fizziness level for the food product contained in the package.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exemplary system <b>600</b> for use with the high pressure food package of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. The pressure required to achieve a desired level of effervescence is a function of head space volume and time as described above. In one embodiment, the fill pressure is about 65 psi, which equilibrates after the food absorbs the CO2 gas to a final pressure of about 40 psi. As shown, a hand device <b>602</b> may be used to inject the gas (e.g. CO2 or a CO2-O2 mixture) into each package <b>400</b> through its nipple <b>402</b>. The hand device <b>602</b> preferably is suspended by a retractable mechanism <b>604</b> and includes pressure sensors or switches for automatically stopping the flow of additional gas when the internal pressure of the package <b>400</b> reaches a predetermined level (e.g. about 65 psi).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0064">Preferably, the cup <b>102</b> (or <b>412</b>) may be sized for one, two, or three servings. In one embodiment, a single serving size is in the range of 2 oz to 3 oz. In one embodiment, a single serving package has a cup size of 2.6 oz (75 grams). One, two, or three servings may correspond with 2 oz, 4 oz, and 6 oz cup sizes, respectively. Cup sizes for one, two, or three services may correspond with cup sizes within ranges of 2-2.6 oz, 4-5.2 oz, and 6-7.8 oz, respectively. Other serving sizes, corresponding cup sizes, and ranges of cup sizes may be used. Preferably, the package is portable by hand and capable of being held in one hand.</p>
