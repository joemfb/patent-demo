<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to the number references of the above mentioned figures, the spiral heat exchanger according to the invention, which has been generally indicated by the reference number <b>1</b>, comprises an outer duct <b>2</b> preferably though not exclusively made of a thermally conductive material and having a contoured or shaped cross-section, in which may be arranged a second inner duct <b>3</b>, also preferably, though not exclusively, made of a thermally conductive material.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Advantageously the outer duct <b>2</b> has a combined pear shape configuration defined by two adjoining coupled circumferences of respective radii R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, arranged at a distance D, this novel and inventive pear shape allowing the inventive heat exchanger to highly efficiently operate, since the heat exchanger, being devoid of flat surfaces, will provide an improved thermal exchange between the primary and secondary fluids contacting the heat exchanger itself.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As shown, the inner duct <b>3</b> has, preferably though not exclusively, a circular or an elliptical or a polygonal cross-section and provides with the outer duct <b>2</b> either &#x201c;double&#x201d; spiral configuration duct arrangement <b>4</b> having a diameter substantially larger than that of each single duct, thereby substantially providing a hollow cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">On the outer duct <b>2</b> are formed at equal spacings, preferably with a constant pitch, for example by pressing, a plurality of bosses forming on the outer duct a plurality of inward directed indentations or cavities <b>10</b>, thereby slightly spacing the spiral coils by a constant spacing gap <b>5</b> substantially less than the coil pitch, to also greatly improve the heat exchanger, since said bosses increase the turbulence of the secondary fluid circulating through the heat exchanger duct or cylinder arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In fact, in operation, through said &#x201c;double&#x201d; duct construction, providing two different characteristic circuits of two different secondary fluids <b>6</b>, for example heating water or sanitary water are conveyed, wherein the primary fluid <b>7</b>, which is a high temperature gaseous fluid, is expanded in said hollow cylinder, thereby flowing to the outside through the coil gaps <b>5</b>, while giving its heat to the secondary fluids <b>6</b> circulating in the heat exchanger ducts.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Advantageously, in said cylinder are further arranged one or more premixed burners <b>9</b>, either of a blown or catalytic type, for gaseous, solid and liquid fuels, operating as a heat exchanging burning chamber having burning chamber walls directly refrigerated by the secondary fluids <b>6</b>, thereby preventing polluting thermal NOx from being generated in the burning process.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, since the subject heat exchanger arranged in an enclosing envelope, preferably though not exclusively made of a metal material, and having preferably a circular base cylindric configuration, said heat exchange provides a heat generator which can also operate based on a condensation principle.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In fact, by arranging a plurality of inner separating elements <b>15</b> in the hollow cylinder, it is possible to suitably deviate the primary fluid, thereby greatly improving the operating efficiencies of the heat exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As stated, another novel feature of the heat exchanger construction according to the invention is that the adjoining spiral coils do not have parallel flat faces, and the coil gaps are arranged with a non constant arrangement, but with a pattern arrangement decreasing in the primary fluid conveying direction.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As further stated, the geometrical construction of the outer duct, in particular, can be considered as a combined construction achieved by coupling two circumferences having a respective radius R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>, arranged at a spacing D, and coupled by a coupling arrangement having either a constant or variable radius R<b>3</b>, which is better shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, the possibility of achieving a thermal exchange between a first gaseous fluid and a second liquid fluid, while providing a high turbulence of the second fluid, a high contact surface, and efficient thermal radiation exchange, and the possibility of directly arranging at the top of the heat exchanger body a burner, make the inventive heat exchanger suitable to operate with boilers preferably though not exclusively designed for producing heating and/or sanitary hot water, the gaseous status primary fluid having a starting very high volume and temperature, as is shown on the right part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and, in passing through the spiral coils, releasing its thermal energy thereby reducing its volume, according to the Boyle's Law, even if such a volume reduction could cause a lowering of the fluid pressure, with a consequent deterioration of the thermal exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In actual practice this does not occur since the heat exchanger narrowing cross-section allows the primary fluid to be always held at a pressure suitable for greatly improving the thermal exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Finally, the above disclosed configuration of the outer duct provides a further important advantage, since the inner sides of the spiral coils are directly facing one another on the burner <b>9</b> thereby the surface exposed to the radiation heat transmission will be a very large one, thereby providing a high efficiency heat exchanger, which may be easily made of different materials such as stainless steel, common steel, copper, aluminium, and plastics materials.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Moreover the provision of said inner separating elements <b>15</b> allows to properly deviate the primary fluid thereby optimizing the heat exchanger operation, as a conventional heat source, or a condensation, power heat exchanger.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As stated, one of the main features of the spiral heat exchanger <b>1</b> according to the present invention is that its adjoining spiral coils <b>2</b> do not have parallel flat faces, and the gap between adjoining coils is a non constant gap decreasing in the conveying direction of the primary fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">This feature will greatly favor the flow of the primary fluid through the heat exchanger <b>1</b>, while greatly improving the thermal exchange, since, as stated, said primary gaseous fluid has, at a starting condition thereof (see the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), a high volume and temperature and, as it is conveyed through the spiral coils, it will release its heat thereby reducing its volume.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Moreover, the narrowing of the fluid passage cross-sections allows the primary fluid to be held at a proper pressure, thereby greatly improving, as stated, the thermal exchange efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It has been found that the invention fully achieves the intended aim and objects.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In fact, the invention provides a heat exchanger to be used as a thermal source or generator for heating systems and/or hot and sanitary water producing systems having an improved thermal exchange between a gaseous fluid and a liquid fluid or fluids since the heat exchanger provides a very high turbulence of said liquid fluid, a high contact surface, an efficient thermal radiation exchange, with the possibility of directly integrating into the top of the heat exchanger body a burner.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In practicing the invention, the used materials, as well as the contingent size and shapes, can be any, depending on requirements.</p>
