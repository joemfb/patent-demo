The disclosure of the prior applications is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a protein refolding method, in particular, relates to the method of protein refolding with ion exchange resins and the application of the same. The invention belongs to the technical field of protein refolding in biotechnology.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the early 1970s, the rapid development of biotechnology has greatly propelled the mass production of recombinant proteins. To produce a recombinant protein, <i>Escherichia coli </i>(<i>E. coli</i>) is usually the preferred choice as the host because it has many advantages, such as simple plasmid construct, low nutrient requirement, fast growth, high level of expression, and ease of separation. Many of the over-expressed target proteins accumulate as inclusion body in <i>E. coli</i>. The inclusion body has correct primary structure but no high-level structure. Thus, it has no biological activity and has to be refolded to achieve its native bioactivity. Because of the complicated protein structure, refolding is a difficult technology during the production of biological pharmaceutical proteins in the gene project. A major challenge in protein refolding is the aggregation of folding intermediates, which is parallel to the on-pathway folding method and is the leading cause of low refolding yield. Therefore, the inhibition of the aggregation is the great challenge for protein refolding in industrial production.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One strategy to inhibit the formation of the aggregation is to use folding additives in the refolding system. However, additive-assisted methods bring the trouble of further separation due to the presence of additives, and most of folding additives are not reusable. Moreover, protein chaperones are too expensive for industrial applications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On-column refolding by chromatography is another approach to inhibiting aggregation of folding intermediates. But there is no report about the method for protein refolding with ion exchange resins as an additive. Protein refolding by chromatography is usually carried out in two modes, flow-through mode (size exclusion chromatography) and adsorptive mode (hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and affinity chromatography). Unfolded proteins are adsorbed in the chromatographic columns by hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, or specific affinity and thus hydrophobic interaction between protein molecules can effectively be inhibited. However, chromatography is low throughput, facilities of chromatography are rather expensive and need high-cost maintenance, columns are prone to blockage by protein aggregation, high-quality degassed and filtrated mobile phases are needed, and operation is relatively complex. In addition to these problems, it is usually difficult to achieve refolding products with high concentrations by the on-column method. So far, no application of ion exchange resins with the same sign of charge as the proteins to be refolded has been reported for protein refolding.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To overcome the drawbacks of refolding with additives and chromatography, the present invention provides a method for protein refolding with the ion exchange resins as an additive. The method provided has several advantages over other methods for protein refolding including no requirement for chromatographic facilities, simple operation and no additional contaminant introduced during the process of refolding. Finally, the ion exchange resins can be recycled via solid-liquid separation and regeneration.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention introduces a method for efficient refolding of proteins by suppressing protein aggregation. In the present invention, it is achieved by electrostatic repulsion between the unfolded protein and/or folding intermediates and ion exchange resins carrying like-charged groups with the protein to be refolded. The method provided herein has several advantages over other methods for protein refolding including no requirement for chromatographic facilities, simple operation and no additional contaminant introduced during the process of refolding. Finally, the ion exchange resins can be recycled via solid-liquid separation and regeneration.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0019">The method, wherein said refolding buffer contains inorganic salt and the concentration thereof is no higher than 0.05 mol/L.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0020">The method, wherein the step b further comprises the following sub-steps: firstly, transferring the ion exchange resin into a sintered glass filter funnel so as to drain the liquid by suction; then washing the said resin 3-8 times successively with 0.2-2 mol/L NaCl solution and deionized water; the volume of NaCl solution and deionized water in each washing cycle is 20-30 times as that of the resin.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0021">The method, wherein in step c, the concentration of said ion exchange resin in the refolding buffer is 0.025-0.5 g/ml; the mixture is put in the thermostatic water bath at a temperature of 20-37&#xb0; C., and shaken to be pre-equilibrated until the temperature of the mixture is stable; then the protein to be refolded is added, and the final concentration of the protein in the refolding buffer is 0.07-4 mg/ml; after being thoroughly mixed, the mixture is put into the thermostatic water bath and shaken at 50-170 rpm for refolding, wherein, the temperature for refolding is the same as that for pre-equilibration.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">An application of the method, wherein, the method can be applied to the refolding of aggregation-prone proteins, including the proteins without disulfide bonds, and the proteins with disulfide bonds that are not reduced or incorrectly matched, in addition to the proteins with disulfide bonds that are reduced or incorrectly matched.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">According to the present invention, the method for protein refolding with the ion exchange resin as a refolding additive was generally accomplished as follows. An ion exchange resin, which is like-charged with that of the protein to be refolded at the refolding pH, was used in the protein refolding. After the resin was drained in a sintered glass filter funnel, the resin was washed 3-8 times with 0.2-2 mol/L NaCl and then washed 3-8 times with deionized water. In each washing cycle, the volume of NaCl solution and deionized water was 20-30 times as that of the settled resin. Then the ion exchange resins processed was transferred into the refolding buffer containing 0.02-0.1 mol/L Tris, 0-0.003 mol/L EDTA-Na<sub>2</sub>, 0-2.0 mol/L urea, and having a pH value between 7.5 and 9.0. The concentration of the ion exchange resins in the suspension was 0.025-0.5 g/ml. The suspension was incubated in a thermostatic water bath and pre-equilibrated until the temperature of the suspension is stable. The temperature of thermostatic water bath ranged from 20&#xb0; C. to 37&#xb0; C. Then, the reduced and denatured protein to be refolded was mixed with the suspension. The final protein concentration in the refolding buffer ranged from 0.07 mg/ml to 4.0 mg/ml. After mixing thoroughly, the mixture was transferred and shaken in the thermostatic water bath at 50-170 rpm, and the temperature for refolding was the same as that for pre-equilibration of the refolding buffer. After that, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation or gravity settlement, and the settled ion exchange resin was further washed 3-5 times with washing buffer. The washing buffer was the refolding buffer, and in each washing cycle, the volume of the refolding buffer used was 1.5 to 3 times as that of the settled ion exchange resin. After washing, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation or gravity settlement, and the collected supernatant was pooled to achieve refolded protein solution. Furthermore, the ion exchange resin could be recycled by washing successively with 0.5-2 mol/L NaCl solution and deionized water.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">The present method for protein refolding with a like-charged ion exchange resin can be applied to refolding of proteins at high concentration. It can also be applied to the refolding of aggregation-prone proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">The method can be used to facilitate refolding of proteins with or without disulfide bond. For proteins without disulfide bond, the pH value of refolding solution can be deviated from the isoelectric point by more than 1.0. For proteins with reduced disulfide bond, a preferred pH value is deviated from the isoelectric point by more than 1.0, but no lower than 7.5.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0026">The method of the invention can be used with urea in the refolding buffer to facilitate folding cooperatively, since the anti-aggregation effect of like-charged ion exchange resins and urea are synergetic.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0027">There are four key techniques in the invention. Firstly, it refers to the selection of an ion exchange resin: selecting an ion exchange resin that is like-charged with the protein to be refolded, and the charge repulsion between the ion exchange resin and protein can inhibit aggregation effectively; secondly, it refers to the preparation of the resin: washing with sodium chloride solution to remove heterogeneous ions, and then washing with deionized water to remove salt so as to avoid weakening of the electrostatic interaction between a protein and the ion exchange resin in the course of protein refolding; thirdly, it refers to the order of adding the ion exchange resin and the denatured protein into refolding buffer: the ion exchange resin should be added before the denatured protein because the aggregation of protein is the most serious at the initial stage of refolding; finally, it refers to the recycling of the ion exchange resin after refolding: in virtual of the charge repulsion between the protein and the resin, protein separation can be achieved by centrifugation or settlement and the resin can be recycled.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0028">Compared with other chromatographic technologies in protein refolding, this invention for using an ion exchange resin that is like-charged with the protein to be refolded as an additive in protein refolding has the advantages described as bellow: (1) the ion exchange resin used as the addictive is insoluble so that it may prevent protein from being contaminated; (2) it is easy to separate the resin from the protein mixture by gravity settlement or centrifugation after protein refolding; (3) the invention requires no expensive chromatographic facilities, and thus, it is easy to operate at a low cost and suitable for large scale production.</p>

In each washing cycle, 40 ml of the said NaCl solution was added, and the mixture was stirred thoroughly with a glass stick; after that, the solution was drained by suction. The resin was further washed five times with 200 ml deionized water, and in each of these washing cycles, 40 ml of deionized water was added and the mixture was stirred thoroughly; then the solution was drained by suction; finally, the resin was washed with deionized water, and the water solution was drained by suction for 10 minutes and then the resin was stored in a refrigerator at 4&#xb0; C.</p>
