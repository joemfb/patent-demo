<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the invention relate to techniques for training workers to install and maintain electric transmission lines. More particularly, the invention relates to techniques for using a mobile training system to train workers to work with and install electric transmission lines.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Problems are encountered when attempting to train workers and especially helicopter pilots for work on electrical transmission lines. The training requires a helicopter pilot having sufficient pre-training as needed to fly and control a helicopter. Once the pre-training is complete, the pilot may be trained to work in a high-voltage wire environment. The high voltage wire environment may be numerous configurations for electric transmission lines and the underlying types of services which must be performed to construct or maintain power lines that exist in the field. For example, in the past, the helicopter training needed to sufficiently train a helicopter pilot to fly in and around high voltage wires and to perform such services may encompass four to five years of training to teach every type of service that can be performed. Further other workers in the high voltage wire environment may be required to train on existing equipment. Training the workers on the existing equipment may be extremely time consuming and dangerous. Therefore a need exists for a mobile training system that allows workers to train in a simulated high voltage wire environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The description that follows includes exemplary apparatus, methods, techniques, and instruction sequences that embody techniques of the inventive subject matter. However, it is understood that the described embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic diagram depicting a mobile training system <b>100</b>. The mobile training system <b>100</b> may be used to train workers such as pilots, linemen, emergency rescue workers, and the like. The workers may be trained to work with, near, and/or to install electric transmission lines. The mobile training system <b>100</b> may have a mobile platform <b>102</b> and one or more training aids <b>104</b>. The one or more training aids <b>104</b> may be configured to substantially replicate the function of wire, or electric transmission line, carriers. For example, the training aids <b>104</b> may replicate a transmission tower and/or a pole, as will be discussed in more detail below. The mobile training system <b>100</b> is shown in a transport position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In the transport position, the one or more training aids <b>104</b> may be collapsed, or placed, proximate the mobile platform <b>102</b>. In the transport position, the training aids <b>104</b> may be in a position wherein, the mobile platform <b>102</b> may be transported on a road or highway.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The mobile platform <b>102</b> may be a trailer configured to couple to a truck <b>106</b>. The truck <b>106</b> may be any suitable truck for pulling the mobile platform <b>102</b> including, but not limited to, a semi tracker trailer, a pick-up truck, a van, a car, and the like. The trailer, as shown is a goose neck trailer having one or more wheels <b>108</b>. The trailer may couple and uncouple to the truck <b>106</b> for training and/or transport as needed. Although the mobile platform <b>102</b> is shown as a trailer it should be appreciated that the mobile platform <b>102</b> may be any suitable system or device for transporting the mobile training system <b>100</b> including, but not limited to a rail car, a boat, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic view of the mobile training system <b>100</b> in the training position. In the training position, the training aids <b>104</b> may be placed upright on the mobile platform <b>102</b>. In the upright position, the training aids <b>104</b> may be similar to a transmission line carrier. In the training position, the truck <b>106</b> may be uncoupled from the mobile platform <b>102</b> and moved to a location away from the mobile platform <b>102</b>. Further, it should be appreciated that the truck may remain coupled to the mobile platform <b>102</b> in the training position. The mobile platform <b>102</b> may be stabilized, as will be described in more detail below, to allow for one or more workers <b>200</b> to safely train on the mobile training system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The mobile training system <b>100</b> may have a helicopter <b>202</b> and one or more training lines. The helicopter <b>202</b> may be used to train the workers <b>200</b> to work with and around wire carriers. The training aids <b>104</b> may simulate the function of the wire carriers (for example towers or poles) that carrier electric transmission lines, and other cables. The training aids <b>104</b> may be used to train the workers <b>200</b> without having dangerous live electric wires.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although the mobile training system <b>100</b> is shown as having a helicopter <b>202</b>, it should be appreciated that any suitable aerial vehicle may be used for training with the mobile training system <b>100</b>. The aerial vehicle may include, but is not limited to, a drone, a remote control helicopter, a remote control plane, a plane, a hovercraft, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The mobile training system <b>100</b> may be transported by the truck <b>106</b> in the transport position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, to a training location. The truck <b>106</b> may then be uncoupled from the mobile platform <b>102</b>. The mobile platform <b>102</b> may then be stabilized in order to prevent the mobile platform <b>102</b> from moving during the erection of the training aids <b>104</b> or during the training operations. The workers <b>200</b> may then erect the training aids <b>104</b>. The helicopter <b>202</b> may be used to assist the erection of the training aids <b>104</b>. Once the training aids <b>104</b> are in the training position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the workers <b>200</b> may perform training operations including, but not limited to, building the wire carriers, clipping the wires, installing travellers, installing insulators, pulling lines, performing rescue operations, pilot training, lineman training, helicopter training for accessing transmission lines, towers and poles, material procurement and staging, installation of conductors, pulling, needlework, installing spacers, installing marker balls, installing vibration dampeners, installing bird discouragers, splicing wires, clipping dead ending full-tension conductors, dead ending static wires, maintenance, repair and replacement of all items listed herein, inspection training, patrol training, and the like. Because the mobile training system <b>100</b> may be used in remote areas without having to use live wires, the workers <b>200</b> may be trained more expeditiously than traditional in field training with installed wires.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the mobile training system <b>100</b> in the training position according to one embodiment. The mobile platform <b>102</b> is shown as a trailer <b>300</b>. The training aids <b>104</b> are shown as a wood pole <b>302</b> and a tower <b>304</b>. The trailer <b>300</b> may be stabilized by one or more stabilizers <b>306</b> and/or the wheels <b>108</b>.

Thus, the mobile training system <b>100</b> is a self-contained and mobile training center. The workers <b>200</b> may be trained to build and clip wires, travelers, and insulators, to pull lines/transfers among any and all of the above mentioned services. The conductive line work includes training for all types of transmission lines such as static, optical &#x26; fiber, and ground lines. The training is preferably performed by the helicopter <b>202</b> (but not necessarily so) with emphasis placed upon enhancing confidence and safety. Since the training can be performed at other than an actual tower location in the field, it can be performed without wires including without actual live wires, i.e. without high voltage transmission lines. This greatly enhances the ability to train the workers <b>200</b> with confidence and safety. The helicopter <b>202</b> may fly in and around the training aids <b>104</b>, or towers <b>304</b> and wood poles <b>302</b>, without the risks associated with actual wires and live wires. However to simulate line tension the training line <b>204</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) may be tied between the training aids <b>104</b>, for example the wood pole <b>302</b> and/or tower <b>304</b>, and the truck <b>106</b>.
