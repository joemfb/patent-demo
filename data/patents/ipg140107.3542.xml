<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In one embodiment, a method includes, at a first input of a comparator, receiving from an analog multiplexer one of multiple first voltages. Each of the first voltages results at least in part from an interaction between an object and an electrode of each of one or more nodes of a capacitive touch sensor. The method includes, at a second input of the comparator, receiving a second voltage across a measurement capacitor that has a first terminal coupled to the second input of the comparator. The method includes charging the measurement capacitor at least in part through a measurement resistor coupled in series to the first terminal of the measurement capacitor and monitoring an output of the comparator during the charging of the measurement capacitor. The output of the comparator changes state when the second voltage becomes approximately equal to or greater than the one of the first voltages. The method includes determining an amount of time from a start of the charging of the measurement capacitor to a change in state of the output of the comparator.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure generally relates to measuring voltage.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An array of conductive drive and sense electrodes may form a mutual-capacitance touch sensor having one or more capacitive nodes. The mutual-capacitance touch sensor may have either a two-layer configuration or single-layer configuration. In the two-layer configuration, drive electrodes may be disposed in a pattern on one side of a dielectric substrate and sense electrodes disposed in a pattern on another side of the substrate. An intersection of a drive electrode and a sense electrodes in the array may form a capacitive node. At the intersection, the drive and sense electrodes may come near each other, but they do not make electrical contact with each other. Instead, the sense electrode is capacitively coupled to the drive electrode. In the single-layer configuration, drive and sense electrodes may be disposed in a pattern on one side of a substrate. In such a configuration, a pair of drive and sense electrodes capacitively coupled to each other across a space or dielectric between electrodes may form a capacitive node.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A pulsed or, in some cases, alternating voltage applied to the drive electrode may induce a charge on the sense electrode, and the amount of charge induced may be susceptible to external influence (such as a touch by or the proximity of an object). When an object, separated from drive and sense electrodes by a dielectric layer, comes within proximity of the drive and sense electrodes, a change in capacitance may occur at that capacitive node and a controller may measure the change in capacitance as a change in voltage. By measuring voltages throughout the array and applying an algorithm to the measured signal, the controller may determine the position of the touch or proximity on the touch sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a single-layer configuration for a self-capacitance implementation, an array of vertical and horizontal conductive electrodes of only a single type (e.g. drive) may be disposed in a pattern on one side of the substrate. Each of the conductive electrodes in the array may form a capacitive node, and, when an object touches or comes within proximity of the electrode, a change in self-capacitance may occur at that capacitive node and a controller may measure the change in capacitance as a change in voltage or a change in the amount of charge needed to raise the voltage to some pre-determined amount. As with a mutual-capacitance touch screen, by measuring voltages throughout the array, the controller may determine the position of the touch or proximity on the touch sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a touch-sensitive display application, a touch screen may enable a user to interact directly with what is displayed on a display underneath the touch screen, rather than indirectly with a mouse or touchpad. A touch screen may be attached to or provided as part of, for example, a desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), smartphone, satellite navigation device, portable media player, portable game console, kiosk computer, point-of-sale device, or other suitable device. A control panel on a household or other appliance may include a touch screen.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b> for measuring voltage. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>100</b> includes a controller <b>102</b> with an analog multiplexer <b>104</b> and a comparator <b>106</b>. Controller <b>102</b> is coupled to one or more sense lines Y<b>0</b>-Yn, one or more sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn, a measurement resistor RM, and a measurement capacitor CM. Each of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn has a terminal coupled to a corresponding one of sense lines Y<b>0</b>-Yn and another terminal coupled to a corresponding one of inputs M<b>0</b>-Mn to analog multiplexer <b>104</b>. The output of analog multiplexer <b>104</b> is coupled to one of the inputs of comparator <b>102</b>, and a terminal of measurement capacitor CM is coupled through terminal REF to another one of the inputs to comparator <b>106</b>. That same terminal of measurement capacitor CM is also coupled through measurement resistor RM to terminal MEAS of controller <b>102</b>. The other terminal of measurement capacitor CM is coupled to ground. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates a particular arrangement of particular components for system <b>100</b>, this disclosure contemplates any suitable arrangement of any suitable components for system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Controller <b>102</b> may be coupled to a touch sensor through one or more sense lines Y<b>0</b>-Yn. In particular embodiments, the touch sensor may be a mutual-capacitance touch sensor that includes an array of drive electrodes and sense electrodes coupled to one of corresponding drive lines and sense lines Y<b>0</b>-Yn, respectively. Each intersection of a drive electrode and sense electrode forms a capacitive node. In other particular embodiments, the touch sensor may be a self-capacitance touch sensor. The self-capacitance touch sensor includes one or more electrodes in horizontal and vertical directions, where each electrode may be coupled to one of corresponding sense line Y<b>0</b>-Yn (otherwise referred to as SNS or SNSK in self-capacitance touch sensor applications). Self-capacitance touch sensor detects a presence of an object as an interaction between an object (not shown) and an electric field generated by one or more electrodes of self-capacitance touch sensor. Although this disclosure describes a particular controller having particular functionality with respect to particular touch sensors, this disclosure contemplates any suitable controller having any suitable functionality with respect to any suitable application without use of touch sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Controller <b>102</b> may detect and process a change in capacitance to determine the presence and location of a touch or proximity input. Controller <b>102</b> may then communicate information about the touch, detecting a touch position without surface contact (&#x201c;hovering&#x201d;), or proximity input to one or more other components (such one or more central processing units (CPUs) or digital signal processors (DSPs)) of a device, which may respond to the touch or proximity input by initiating a function of the device (or an application running on the device) associated with it. Controller <b>102</b> may be one or more integrated circuits (ICs), such as for example general-purpose microprocessors, microcontrollers, programmable logic devices or arrays, application-specific ICs (ASICs). Although this disclosure describes and illustrates a particular controller in the device, this disclosure contemplates any suitable controller in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Sense lines Y<b>0</b>-Yn are configured to communicate one or more voltages to inputs M<b>0</b>-Mn of analog multiplexer <b>104</b>. The analog multiplexer <b>104</b> selects one of the voltages from sense lines Y<b>0</b>-Yn stored across sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn and transmits the selected voltage to one of the inputs of comparator <b>106</b> for comparison with the voltage across measurement capacitor CM, as discussed below. In particular embodiments, analog multiplexer <b>104</b> selects the voltage across each sampling capacitor CS<b>0</b>-CSn in accordance with a predetermined sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As discussed above, comparator <b>106</b> compares the voltage across measurement capacitor CM to the voltage across selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn. The voltage across the measurement capacitor CM is increased by providing charge through measurement resistor RM. Charging of measurement capacitor CM may be initiated by coupling measurement resistor RM to terminal MEAS of controller <b>102</b>. In particular embodiments, terminal MEAS is configured to alternatively provide ground or a supply voltage. Since the supply voltage, resistance of measurement resistor RM, and capacitance of measurement capacitor CM are constant, the voltage across measurement capacitor CM is a function of time.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The output of comparator <b>106</b> is monitored during charging of measurement capacitor CM. When the voltage across measurement capacitor CM is substantially equal or greater than the voltage across the selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn, the output of the comparator <b>106</b> changes state. The voltage across selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn, or a value proportional to the voltage, may be determined from an amount of time elapsed from a start of charging measurement capacitor CM until the change in state of the output of comparator <b>106</b>. After determining the amount of time from the start of the charging of the measurement capacitor CM until a change in state of the output of the comparator <b>106</b>, measurement capacitor CM may be discharged in preparation for subsequent voltage measurement. The amount of time may be then determined for the voltage across another one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn.</p>

As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, example system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be further configured to measure voltages from mutual-capacitance touch screen <b>108</b>. In particular embodiments, controller <b>102</b> includes a driver <b>110</b> coupled to one or more drive lines X<b>0</b>-Xm. Mutual-capacitance touch screen <b>108</b> includes an array of drive electrodes and sense electrodes coupled to one of corresponding drive lines X<b>0</b>-Xm and sense lines Y<b>0</b>-Yn, respectively. Each intersection of a drive electrode (electrode<sub>i</sub>) and sense electrode (electrode<sub>j</sub>) forms a capacitive node C<sub>x00</sub>-C<sub>xnm </sub>(C<sub>ji </sub>(i=0 . . . n, j=0 . . . m)).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Driver <b>110</b> transmits a drive signal to one or more columns of drive electrodes through drive lines X<b>0</b>-Xm.

Steps 11-15 measures voltage across each sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn by measuring the amount of time elapsed from the start of charging measurement capacitor CM until the voltage across measurement capacitor CM through terminal REF is substantially equal or higher than the voltage across the selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn, as discussed above.

As discussed above, self-capacitance touch sensor <b>112</b> includes one or more electrodes coupled to corresponding one of sense lines Y<b>0</b>-Yn. An interaction between an object and an electric field generated by one or more horizontal and vertical electrodes of self-capacitance touch sensor <b>112</b> is measured as a voltage stored on sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn. The voltage results from a difference in capacitance formed between the object and the electrode compared to a free space capacitance of the electrode. As discussed above, voltages across sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn are measured from the amount of time from the start of charging measurement capacitor CM until the voltage across measurement capacitor CM through terminal REF is substantially equal or higher than the voltage across the selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn. In particular embodiments, measuring voltages from self-capacitance touch sensor <b>112</b> may be performed using operations 11-13 of TABLE 1 discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an example system for measuring voltage using capacitive charging through a single capacitor. In practical terms, the rate in which the operations of TABLE 1 may be performed may be limited by the amount of time elapsed between the start of charging measurement capacitor CM until the voltage across measurement capacitor CM is substantially equal or higher than the voltage across the selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn. Reducing the amount of time required to change the state of the comparator <b>106</b> increases the rate in which measuring voltages across sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a predetermined amount of charge may be transferred from an additional capacitor CZ coupled in series with the measurement capacitor CM prior to resistive charging through measurement resistor RM. As discussed above, the voltage across selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn may be transmitted to comparator <b>106</b> through corresponding input M<b>0</b>-Mn of multiplexer <b>104</b>. Providing the supply voltage to terminal MEAS initiates charging of the measurement capacitor CM and forms a capacitive voltage divider with capacitor CZ and measurement capacitor CM. Resistive charging of measurement capacitor CM through measurement resistor RM predominates the charging process after capacitive charging from capacitor CZ. In other particular embodiments, the capacitance of capacitor CZ is smaller than the capacitance of measurement capacitor CM.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an example system for measuring voltage using capacitive charging through multiple capacitors. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, an amount of charge may be transferred from each additional capacitor C<b>1</b><i>z</i>-Cnz coupled in series with the measurement capacitor CM prior to resistive charging through measurement resistor RM. As discussed above, the voltage across selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn is transmitted to comparator <b>106</b> through corresponding input M<b>0</b>-Mn of multiplexer <b>104</b>. Charging of the measurement capacitor CM may be performed by providing a voltage from one of terminals CANCEL<b>1</b>-CANCELn coupled to a terminal of capacitors C<b>1</b><i>z</i>-Cnz. Each capacitor C<b>1</b><i>z</i>-Cnz in turn transfers charge to measurement capacitor CM. The amount of charge transferred by each depending on the relative capacitance of each additional capacitor C<b>1</b><i>z</i>-Cnz to measurement capacitor CM. As discussed above, resistive charging of measurement capacitor CM through measurement resistor RM predominates the charging process after charge transfers from capacitors C<b>1</b><i>z</i>-Cnz.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates example voltage across the measurement capacitor in the example system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> over time. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, initial charging of the measurement capacitor is predominantly from charge transfer through the additional capacitor CZ coupled in series with the measurement capacitor. The amount of charge transferred from additional capacitor CZ, as well as voltage <b>110</b> at terminal REF, may be determined from supply voltage applied to the capacitor CZ, as well as the relative values of CZ and CM. As discussed above, after the charge transfer, further charging of the measurement capacitor beyond voltage <b>110</b> arises predominantly from resistive charging through the measurement resistor. The rate of increase in the voltage across the measurement capacitor may be determined by the resistance of the measurement resistor. As illustrated by the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the addition of capacitive charging to resistive charging of the measurement capacitor achieves a reduction of elapsed voltage measurement time compared to resistive charging alone.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example system for measuring voltage using adaptive charge cancellation. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, controller <b>102</b> may be configured in a similar fashion to the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, except of measurement capacitor CM may be coupled between terminal REF and terminal CLAMP. In particular embodiments, terminal CLAMP may be configured to alternately provide either ground or a high-impedance state, e.g., float, to one terminal of measurement capacitor CM. For each charging cycle, an amount of charge will be transferred from additional capacitor CZ to the measurement capacitor CM, as discussed below.</p>

Steps 1-10 (not shown) transfer charge induced on the sense electrode to the associated sampling capacitor CS<b>0</b>-CSn, as discussed in TABLE 1.

In particular embodiments, step 20 performs step 11-19 for predetermined number of charge transfers. In other particular embodiments, the predetermined number of charge transfers may be equal to a burst length of a touch sensor.

After each charge transfer from capacitor CZ, the incremental increase in the voltage at terminal REF may be determined by the supply voltage transmitted by terminal MEAS and the relative capacitances of capacitor CZ and the measurement capacitor. After predetermined number of charge transfers, further charging of the measurement capacitor from voltage <b>120</b> arises predominantly from resistive charging through the measurement resistor. As illustrated by the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, capacitive charging through adaptive charge cancellation in addition to resistive charging of the measurement capacitor achieves a reduction of elapsed time for the voltage of terminal REF to substantially equal the voltage of selected sampling capacitor over resistive charging alone.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates an example system for measuring voltage using resistive charging through a single additional resistor.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">TABLE 3 illustrates an example sequence of operations for measuring voltage using resistive charging using a single resistor. A voltage, e.g., a power supply voltage, for injecting charge to the measurement capacitor CM is transmitted to resistor RF by controller <b>102</b> through terminal FAST. Steps 1-10 (not shown) transfer charge induced on the sense electrode to the associated sampling capacitor CS<b>0</b>-CSn, as discussed in TABLE 1. Steps 11-16 measure voltages across sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn by measuring the amount of time elapsed for a state of output of the comparator <b>106</b> to change. Steps 12-13 measure voltage across the selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn by measuring the amount of time elapsed from the start of charging measurement capacitor CM until the voltage across measurement capacitor CM through terminal REF is equal or higher than the voltage across the selected one of sampling capacitors CS<b>0</b>-CSn, as discussed above. Step 12 initiates charging of the measurement capacitor CM by transmitting a voltage to terminal MEAS and FAST. Step 13 discontinues resistive charging through resistor RF and at this time, resistive charging through measurement resistor RM predominates charging of measurement capacitor CM. In particular embodiments, step 14 performs steps 11-13 for each input M<b>0</b>-Mn of multiplexer <b>104</b>. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates a particular sequence of steps in TABLE 3, this disclosure contemplates any suitable sequence of steps in system <b>100</b> for measuring voltages.</p>
