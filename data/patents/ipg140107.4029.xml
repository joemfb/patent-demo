<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to determining equivalence ratio of a gas-fuel mixture and more particularly to a system and method of measuring an equivalence ratio of the gas-fuel mixture in a gas turbine engine in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In order to reduce NO<sub>x </sub>emissions and increase lifetime for gas turbine engines for power and propulsion systems, a lean premixed combustion is widely preferred. In lean flames, the dominant NO<sub>x </sub>formation mechanisms depend on the local flame temperature. The gas turbine engines that operate at lean fuel/air equivalence ratios significantly reduce NO<sub>x </sub>production due to lower flame temperatures. In addition, lower flame temperatures reduce maintenance requirements for gas turbine components such as combustion liner. Thus, equivalence ratio is a key parameter for operations of a gas turbine engine. However, the lean premixed combustion is susceptible to thermoacoustic instabilities and lean blowout, thereby, reducing efficiency and increasing emissions. This further leads to hardware damage and causes safety hazards.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, thermoacoustic instability is a self-sustained combustion oscillation near the acoustic frequency of the combustion chamber, which is the result of the closed loop coupling of unsteady heat release to pressure oscillations. Intensive experimental and theoretical work has been performed to understand the driving mechanisms of thermoacoustic instabilities, and to suppress these instabilities in laboratory-scale and full-scale combustors. It is well understood that heat release fluctuations can produce pressure oscillations; however, the mechanisms whereby pressure oscillations result in heat release fluctuations are not well known. Equivalence ratio fluctuation is considered to be one of the most important driving mechanisms for thermoacoustic instabilities in fuel-lean gas turbine combustion systems. Because of the complex physical and chemical interactions involved in thermoacoustic oscillations, it is difficult to predict this unstable combustion behavior. Therefore, measurement of the equivalence ratio fluctuation during unstable combustion is of great importance for monitoring thermoacoustic instabilities in the gas turbine engines. In addition, measured flame transfer function between the equivalence ratio fluctuation and the heat release fluctuation can be used as direct input to the analytical model to predict combustion instabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Equivalence ratio has been measured using infrared (IR) methane absorption of the 3.39 &#x3bc;m wavelength output of a He&#x2014;Ne laser to study its effect on heat release during premixed unstable combustion (lab scale). Local fuel-to-air ratio was also measured by laser absorption at the same wavelength to study the effect of mixing on NOx emissions in premixed burner. The same IR laser absorption technique has been also used to measure fuel concentration in pulse detonation engines and internal combustion engines. However, He&#x2014;Ne lasers are sensitive to ambient conditions and simultaneously emit diffuse radiation and coherent light at multiple discrete wavelengths. In addition, the absorption at 3.39 &#x3bc;m wavelength is the carbon-hydrogen (CH) asymmetric stretch bond common to all hydrocarbon fuels, while different hydrocarbons have different absorption coefficients. Therefore, the sensor needs to be calibrated for each fuel mixture encountered during operation. Thus, the IR absorption method has limitations for practical application in gas turbine engines.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, the current gas turbine operations rely on overall flow splits to estimate the average flame temperature, and adjust fuel/air ratio for optimal operation in terms of combustion stability and emissions like CO and NOx. However, the capability of this method is limited due to uncertain nozzle-to-nozzle and can-to-can flow variations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for accurately and rapidly measuring an equivalence ratio of the gas-fuel mixture in real time in practical gas turbine engines.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As discussed in detail below, embodiments of the invention are directed towards a non-intrusive measurement of an equivalence ratio in gas-fuelled gas turbine engines. As used herein, the phrase &#x2018;equivalence ratio&#x2019; refers to the ratio of the fuel-to-oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-to-oxidizer ratio. The present invention addresses a system and method of a real-time monitoring of an equivalence ratio of a gas-fuel mixture of an engine.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present invention, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; and &#x201c;said&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a sensor system <b>10</b> for monitoring of an equivalence ratio of a gas-fuel mixture <b>11</b> of an engine combustor in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. It is to be noted that the sensor system <b>10</b> may also be employed to monitor equivalence ratio of gas-fuel mixture and thereby observe combustion conditions of a variety of low-emission, high performing combustion chambers for gas turbines, boilers, heaters and furnaces. A cross-sectional view of the engine combustor <b>12</b> is shown having a burner tube <b>14</b> and a center-body <b>16</b> near the end of the combustor <b>12</b> proximate to the flame. The system <b>10</b> includes multiple optical probes (<b>18</b>, <b>20</b>) arranged proximate to the engine nozzle for transceiving signal beams <b>21</b> directly through a gas-fuel mixture <b>11</b>. In one embodiment, the optical probes <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> are fiber-coupled sensor probes mounted on multiple locations on the burner tube <b>14</b>. The system <b>10</b> further includes a tunable diode laser (TDL) <b>22</b> for generating the laser beam <b>21</b> which is directed through the gas-fuel mixture <b>11</b> using one of the optical probes <b>18</b> that acts as a laser pitcher. In one embodiment, the TDL <b>22</b> is a near infrared TDL to provide an absorption sensor based on fixed wavelength laser absorption of methane near 1.65 micrometer and takes advantage of the large methane mole fraction in unburned gas-fuel mixture. The wavelength range of the laser beam <b>21</b> may vary from about 1000 nm to about 4000 nm. As shown, the optical probe <b>20</b> acts as a catcher probe and receives the laser beam <b>21</b>. The system <b>10</b> also includes a beam splitter or optical switch for splitting and transmitting the laser beam <b>21</b> through the fuel-air mixture of multiple fuel nozzles in the engine. The system <b>10</b> further includes a laser controller <b>24</b> for modulating the laser wavelength to generate an optimum modulation depth of the laser wavelength. Furthermore, the system <b>10</b> includes a laser mount (not shown) for mounting the TDL sensor <b>22</b>. The system <b>10</b> is also configured to have one light path being transmitted through a static cell filled with calibration gas (CH<sub>4 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>mixture). This calibration of the TDL absorption sensor is carried out to determine the line strength and the laser set point. The system <b>10</b> also includes a detector <b>26</b> that senses the laser beam <b>21</b> and directs the signal to a lock in amplifier <b>28</b> for demodulating the sensed signal to simultaneously recover first harmonic (1f) and second harmonic (2f) signals. Thus, the lock in amplifier <b>28</b> improves signal to noise ratio and automatically corrects transmission variation due to vibrations or window fouling. In one embodiment, the sensed signal is demodulated by a Perkin-Elmer lock-in amplifier (model 7280) to simultaneously recover the 1f and 2f signals with a time constant of 0.5 milliseconds. In another embodiment, the sensor system <b>10</b> bandwidth may be improved by using two lock-in amplifiers or a software lock-in. The sensed signal beam is further processed by a data acquisition (DAQ) system <b>30</b>. This processing of received signal beams includes using a technique of fixed wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) with second harmonic detection for measuring the real-time equivalence ratio of the fuel-air mixture of a gas turbine engine. The wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) incorporates a transmission coefficient &#x3c4;(&#x3bd;) of monochromatic radiation through a uniform gas medium of a engine combustor of length L (cm) given by the Beer-Lambert's law

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For WMS detection, the lock-in amplifier <b>28</b> is used to measure the second-harmonic (2f) signal by multiplying the detector signal by a sinusoidal reference signal at frequency 2&#x3c9;. This technique is sensitive to absorption line shape curvature and is insensitive to low frequency noise. Thus, WMS 2f detection offers benefits over direct absorption in terms of noise resistance and sensitivity. The lock-in amplifier <b>28</b> acts as a band-pass filter and rejects noise outside the lock-in bandwidth. In addition, WMS measurements eliminate the need of problematic baseline fitting required in scanned-wavelength direct absorption measurements, especially in the case of weak absorbance. Finally, normalization of the WMS-2f signal with the 1f signal removes the need for calibration and account for the laser transmission variations due to beam steering, scattering, and window fouling. Such normalization is important for practical applications in gas turbine combustor to account for intrinsic laser transmission variations.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The measured 2f/1f ratio is directly proportional to the partial pressure of absorption species if the line shape function does not vary with test conditions.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">By way of a non-limiting example, a graphical representation of a methane absorption spectrum <b>220</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The absorption spectrum <b>220</b> is simulated for a typical lean premixed gas turbine combustor conditions (pressure of 1 atmosphere, 6% methane in air, gas medium length L=7 cm and temperature=700K). The x-axis <b>222</b> represents wavenumber in inverse centimeter (cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) units. The Y-axis <b>224</b> represents absorption. In the present invention, the real time TDL sensor for equivalence ratio is based on near-IR absorption of methane around 1.65 &#x3bc;m (6047 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>wavenumber) as shown by the curve <b>226</b>. There is minimum interference for methane absorption measurements from other species in air. The line around 1653.725 nm is well isolated at atmospheric pressure, and thus is selected for the present TDL sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">There are several advantages of the present TDL sensor compared to previous sensors based on infrared (IR) absorption of He&#x2014;Ne lasers. First, the near-IR fiber-coupled TDL sensor takes advantage of mature technology for distributed-feedback (DFB) telecom diode lasers, near-IR fibers and optics, and thus has much higher signal to noise ratio (SNR). Second, the DFB diode laser output wavelength and power are very stable, and laser wavelength is readily tuned with temperature and injection current. Wavelength modulation spectroscopy is combined with second-harmonic detection to improve the TDL sensor sensitivity and accuracy. Third, the near-IR TDL sensor is not sensitive to transmission loss from window fouling or beam steering by using 1f normalization. The methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) absorption level at near-IR is more suitable for line-of-sight applications to ensure sufficient transmission and absorption. The absorbance near 1.65 &#x3bc;m stays around 3-4%, which is ideal for WMS-2f measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, in one embodiment, the calibration of the present TDL sensor is carried out in a well controlled environment using a static cell with a mixture of 5.44% CH<sub>4 </sub>in N<sub>2 </sub>to determine the linestrength and find the laser setpoint. For direct absorption measurement, the laser wavelength is tuned with a linear current ramp at a frequency of 100 Hz. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a non-limiting example of a graphical representation <b>250</b> showing the measured methane absorption line shape around 1653.725 nm in the static cell (pressure of 1 atmosphere, temperature of 297 K, gas medium length L=4.5 cm) in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The experimental profile is best fit using a Voigt profile, and the residual (difference between data and fit normalized by the peak absorbance) is shown in the upper panel <b>252</b>. The linestrength for this absorption feature can be inferred using the integrated absorbance area.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For WMS measurement, the laser wavelength is sinusoidally modulated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a non-limiting example of the measured WMS-1f and -2f spectra when the injection bias current is varied from 65 to 85 miliampere (mA) in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The 1f signal has a large offset due to amplitude modulation. Since the 2f signal peaks at the absorption line center, the laser wavelength can be locked by maximizing the 2f signal for fixed-wavelength WMS measurement. This process is repeated before each combustion test to ensure correct laser setpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">By way of another non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a graphical representation <b>270</b> of a measured WMS-1f and -2f signals under steady conditions in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A time resolution of 0.5 ms is achieved for the TDL sensor with a lock-in time constant of 0.5 ms. The measured ratio <b>280</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, is not steady, probably due to unsteady turbulent mixing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows non-limiting example of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum of data <b>290</b> for steady conditions. No distinct frequency is found on the FFT spectrum, indicating random equivalence ratio fluctuation along the sensor line-of-sight.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">By way of a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a non-limiting example of a graphical representation <b>300</b> of a measured WMS-1f and -2f signals for air flow of 0.177 kg/s and inlet air temperature of 297 K under forced flame conditions. In this non-limiting example, the fuel flow rate is constant, so the equivalence ratio near combustor exit is changing due to varying airflow rate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates the measured time history of WMS-1f and 2f signals for the forcing frequency of 42 Hz (mean &#x3c6;=0.63). It can be seen from the 1f signal that the laser transmission signal is fluctuating, probably due to the vibrations of windows and test rig. This result clearly demonstrates the advantage of the TDL sensor with automatic laser transmission correction using 1f normalization. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows non-limiting examples of measured equivalence ratio <b>310</b> and a fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectrum <b>320</b> for the forced flame. The dominant oscillation mode (42 Hz) and the harmonics can be clearly seen from the FFT spectrum. The zero-to-peak equivalence ratio oscillation of the fundamental mode is about 0.069. Without 1f-normalization, the peak equivalence ratio oscillation would be 0.075 (9% higher than actual value). This result demonstrates that the rapid TDL sensor can be used to accurately characterize equivalence ratio fluctuations in gas turbine combustor.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a flow chart of a method <b>400</b> of monitoring real-time equivalence ratio of a gas-fuel mixture of an engine in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At step <b>402</b>, the method includes transceiving a signal beam through a gas-fuel mixture using a plurality of optical probes arranged proximate to a fuel nozzle of the engine. The signal beams are laser beams generated by a rapid near infrared tunable diode laser (TDL). The method also includes calibrating the TDL absorption sensor to determine line strength and a laser setpoint. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the optical probe <b>18</b> is mounted on the burner tube of the engine combustor and transmits a laser beam through the gas-fuel mixture to another optical probe <b>20</b>. At step <b>404</b>, the method includes sensing the signal beam transmitted directly through the gas-fuel mixture or indirectly by reflecting from a surface of the nozzle by one or more detectors (shown as detector <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The sensed signal beam is further acquired by a data acquisition subsystem (DAQ system <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at step <b>406</b>. Prior to the step <b>406</b>, the sensed signal beams are modulated by a lock in amplifier. Finally at step <b>408</b>, the method <b>400</b> includes processing the signal to determine the equivalence ratio of the gas-fuel mixture in real time.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Advantageously, the present method and system enables direct measurement of gas-fuel ratio for each turbine combustor in real-time, and thus provides the flame temperature directly. In-situ real time measurement of gas-fuel ratio (and its fluctuation) can provide valuable information for combustor optimization and control, especially for gas turbine engines with multiple nozzles in a combustion can. In addition, this method can provide online data to monitor part-to-part and engine-to-engine component variations. In addition, this invention also provides practical sensor arrangement for gas turbine applications. Thus, the present invention provides sensor for real time active control of gas turbine combustors to optimize efficiency and reliability. For example, a real-time equivalence ratio data can be used to control firing temperature to improve engine efficiency. In the case of combustion dynamics with equivalence ratio fluctuation, this real-time information can provide feedback control signal for the active control system to suppress instabilities.</p>
