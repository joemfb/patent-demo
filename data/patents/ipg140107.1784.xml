<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a gastrostomy tube extension device for inserting or removing a gastrostomy tube used for feeding fluid substances such as liquid food into a stomach of a patient into/from the patient' body.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hitherto, feeding of the fluid substances such as the liquid food or nutrient preparation using the gastrostomy tube has been carried out for persons whose capability to take food orally by their own abilities is deteriorated due to aging or diseases (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;patient&#x201d;). The gastrostomy tube includes a stomach interior fixing member to be installed on the inside of a stomach wall at a hole (a gastric fistula) for dietary intake formed on the abdomen of the patient, and a tube member connected to the stomach interior fixing member at the distal portion thereof and extends through the hole toward the outside of the patient at the proximal portion. When inserting the gastrostomy tube into the hole formed on the patient's body, the operation for insertion is performed by a rod-shaped extender, such as that disclosed in JP-A-2003-275325.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The stomach interior fixing member of the gastrostomy tube is formed into a bowl shape, with a through hole through which the extender can be passed through a part in the vicinity of a joint member joining the extender with the tube member. When the extender is passed through the through hole of the gastrostomy tube from the outside and is pushed toward the distal portion of the stomach interior fixing member, the distal portion of the extender is hooked on the inner side of the stomach interior fixing member, and is used to push the interior fixing member into an elongated and narrowed state. Since the stomach interior fixing member in the narrowed state can pass through the hole formed on the abdominal part of the patient, the gastrostomy tube can be placed in the hole simply by inserting the stomach interior fixing member into the stomach. After inserting the stomach interior fixing member into the stomach, the extender is removed from the body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the gastrostomy tube is to be removed from the body, the user simply by pulls on the tube member. In this case, the stomach interior fixing member is bent and contracted in a certain direction by the through hole, allowing it to be removed from the hole.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the gastrostomy tube described above, resistance of the stomach interior fixing member is significant and hence the removal is difficult, painful, and likely to cause damage to the abdominal part of the patient. In addition, when inserting the gastrostomy tube into the hole formed on the patient's body, it is necessary for the user to manually press the extender against the stomach interior fixing member, and maintain this pressure constantly throughout the procedure. Complexity places a large burden on the operator.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the above-described problems, it is an object of the present invention to provide a gastrostomy tube extension device which can easily be inserted or taken out.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the above-described object, the gastrostomy tube extension device includes: an extender formed of a rod-shaped member which can be inserted into a tube member of the gastrostomy tube and can elongate and narrow the stomach interior fixing member of the gastrostomy tube by pushing the distal end of the stomach interior fixing member in the distal direction with the distal end of the extender. A fixing member is fixed to the outside end of the tube member and inserted into the tube member which is capable of moving along the longitudinal direction of the extender. An engaging portion is engageable with the fixing member; and an engaging member having a holding portion, to be held by hand, elongates and narrows the stomach interior fixing member when pulled in the direction of the outside end of the tube in a state in which the extender is inserted into the tube member and the engaging portion is engaged with the fixing member fixed to the outside end of the tube member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The fixing member is to be fixed on the outside end of the tube member which is located out of the body, and the engaging member having an engaging portion, is capable of being engaged to the fixing member. The fixing member is capable of moving along the longitudinal direction of the extender. When the extender is inserted into the tube member and the tube member and the fixing member are engaged with each other, the stomach interior fixing member can be narrowed by holding the holding portion and pulling the engaging member in the proximal direction</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The gastrostomy tube can be removed easily without damaging the abdomen of the patient. When the gastrostomy tube is inserted into the hole on the patient, the thickness of the stomach interior fixing member can be easily held constant, since the holding portion is provided on the engaging member. In this manner, the operator who performs the insertion or removal of the gastrostomy tube need concentrate only on the insertion or removal operation itself, without paying attention to the extended state of the gastrostomy tube, even when using only one hand, thus facilitating insertion and removal of the gastrostomy tube. The holding portion may be of various shapes as long as it can be hand-held for operation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another structural characteristic of the gastrostomy tube extension device according to the present invention is that the fixing member is hollow cylindrical, capable of moving along the longitudinal direction of the extender when surrounding the outer peripheral surface of the extender, and the cylindrical member is provided with a fixed portion to be fixed at the outside end of the tube member, and an engaged portion to be engaged the engaging portion of the engaging member. In this arrangement, since the fixing member moves precisely along the longitudinal direction of the extender, the direction of extension of the gastrostomy tube and the longitudinal direction of the extender are aligned in a straight line. Therefore, deformation in the direction of extension of the gastrostomy tube is prevented, and the insertion or removal operation can be performed while keeping the gastrostomy tube in a proper state.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another arrangement the fixed portion is formed with a projection which is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical member so as to be capable of being press-fitted into the tube member. In other words, the fixed portion can be fixed to the tube member merely by inserting the cylindrical member into the tube member, which improves the ease of use.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">By employing a longer cylindrical member, the contact surface with respect to the cylindrical member increases, and hence excessive extension of the tube member does not occur, and a force exerted to the extender or the engaging member is efficiently used for extension of the stomach interior fixing member. The projection formed on the cylindrical member may be either single or plural.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The projection which comprises the fixed portion may be formed on the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical member all along the circumference thereof, having a tapered portion with a diameter which is smaller toward the distal end when press-fitted into the tube member and gradually increases toward the proximal end. In this arrangement, the fixed portion can be more easily inserted into the tube member, and after fixing the tube member and the fixed portion, it is difficult to disconnect the fixed portion from the tube member. Therefore, the gastrostomy tube can be extended in a stable state.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another arrangement, the engaged portion may comprise a projection which constitutes the fixed portion, and the engaging portion of the engaging member is adapted to engage the outer peripheral surface of the tube member, through which the cylindrical member is press-fitted to fix the fixed portion, at a portion corresponding to the engaged portion. In this arrangement, the fixed portion to be fixed to the tube member of the fixing member and the engaged portion to be engaged to the engaging member are a unitary structure, thus simplifying the device. In addition, since the engaging portion of the engaging member engages the outer peripheral surface of the tube member which fixes the fixed portion, the engaging portion presses the tube member to ensure fixation between the tube member and the fixed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A positioning portion may be provided on the peripheral surface of the proximal portion of the extender, and a positioned portion which can engage the positioning portion may be provided on the engaging member so that with the extender inserted into the tube member, the stomach interior fixing member is elongated and narrowed when the fixing member is engaged with the engaging portion and the positioning portion is engaged with the positioned portion respectively. In this arrangement, after engagement of the fixing member with the engaging portion and the positioning portion with the positioned portion respectively, even when the operator releases his/her hand from the holding portion of the engaging member, the stomach interior fixing member is maintained at a constant narrow width. Therefore, the operator who performs the inserting or removal operation of the gastrostomy tube can concentrate only on the insertion or removal operation without paying attention to the extended state of the gastrostomy tube.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A plurality of positioning portions may be formed along the axial direction of the extender. In this arrangement, the extended state of the gastrostomy tube can be modified by selecting the positioning portion of the extender to which the positioned portion of the engaging member is engaged as needed. Accordingly, versatility is provided, and hence one type of gastrostomy tube extension device may be sufficient. In this arrangement, adaptation can be made to change in the expansion or other physical properties of the gastrostomy tube.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, when inserting the gastrostomy tube into the hole on the patient, the positioned portion of the engaging member is engaged with the positioning portion which provides the minimum extension of the gastrostomy tube before operation. Then, when the gastrostomy tube is taken out from the hole on the patient after having been left in the patient's body for a predetermined period, the operation can be performed with the positioned portion engaged with another positioning portion. Accordingly, the operation can be performed with the gastrostomy tube expanded optimally for each operation.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The extender may comprise a rod-shaped member which can be inserted into the tube member and can elongate and narrow the stomach interior fixing member by pushing the distal end of the stomach interior fixing member toward the distal side by the distal end of the extender.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this arrangement, the structure of the fixing portion can be greatly simplified. For example, a structure in which a cylindrical or ring-shaped member is fixed on the outer peripheral surface of the tube member may be sufficient. It is also possible to provide a recess or the like on the outer peripheral surface of the tube member as a fixing portion. Therefore, manufacturing of the fixing portion is facilitated, and the cost of the gastrostomy tube extension device can be reduced. In this case, the operator can operate the device by holding the fixing portion formed on the tube member by hand while the extender is inserted in the gastrostomy tube. It is also possible to provide an engaging member including an engaging portion capable of engaging the fixing member and the holding portion for holding by hand to operate the device, elongating the stomach interior fixing member when the holding portion is pulled in the direction of the outside portion of the tube member when the extender is inserted into the tube member and the engaging portion is engaged with the fixing member fixed to the outside end of the tube member.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this case as well, it is possible to form a positioning portion on the peripheral surface of the proximal portion of the extender, and provide a positioned portion, which is capable of engaging the positioning portion, on the engaging member, so that when the extender is inserted into the tube member, the stomach interior fixing member can be elongated and narrowed when the fixing portion is engaged with the engaging portion and the positioning portion is engaged with the positioned portion respectively. In addition, a plurality of positioning portions can be provided along the axial direction of the extender.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The device may include a movable fixing member comprising a fixing portion which is capable of being fixed to the outside end of the tube member and a holding portion to be held by hand for operation of the device, and which is movable along the longitudinal direction of the extender inserted into the tube member.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this case, the fixing portion to be fixed to the outside end of the tube member and the holding portion held by hand for operation of the device are provided on a single movable fixing member. The movable fixing member is movable along the longitudinal direction of the extender. Therefore, when the extender is inserted into the tube member, by holding the holding portion and pulling the movable fixing member in the direction opposite to insertion of the extender, the stomach interior fixing member can be narrowed. In this arrangement as well, the gastrostomy tube can be taken out without damaging the abdomen of the patient, and the insertion of the gastrostomy tube into the hole on the patient or the removal operation of the gastrostomy tube from the hole can be performed easily. In this case, since the number of members which constitute the gastrostomy tube extension device is reduced, manufacture can be facilitated and the cost is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, the fixing portion of the movable fixing member may be hollow cylindrical, movable along the longitudinal direction of the extender when surrounding the outer peripheral surface of the extender, and the cylindrical member can be provided with the fixed portion to be fixed on the outside end of the tube member. Also, the fixed portion may be formed on the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical member, comprising projections which can be press-fitted into the tube member. In addition, a projection which constitutes a fixed portion may be formed on the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical member all along the circumference thereof, and may be formed of a tapered portion with a cross section diameter which is smaller toward the distal end when press-fitted into the tube member and gradually increases toward the proximal end. The projection may be single or plural.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In this arrangement, since the direction of movement of the movable fixing member matches the longitudinal direction of the extender, there is no difference between the direction of extension of the gastrostomy tube and the direction of movement of the movable fixing member, and hence the insertion or removal-operation can be performed with the gastrostomy tube extended in an adequate state. Also, a stable fixation between the tube member and the fixed portion of the movable fixing member is further ensured. In addition, when fixing the tube member to the fixed portion, the cylindrical member can easily be inserted into the tube member, and after having inserted the cylindrical member into the tube member and fixing the tube member to the fixed portion, it is difficult to disconnect the cylindrical member from the tube member.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The gastrostomy tube extension device according to the present invention may comprise a tightening member for tightening the outer peripheral surface of the tube member through which the cylindrical member is press-fitted in order to strengthen the fixation of the fixed portion to the tube member. The tightening member in this case may be provided by forming a threaded portion on the cylindrical member of the fixed portion, and providing a round tubular member formed with a thread at the upper portion of the inner periphery thereof which can be attached to and detached from the above threaded portion, and the outer peripheral surface of the tube member can be tightened by the lower portion of the inner peripheral surface of this member. It is also possible to provide a tightening member in the form of a clip. The tightening member if of particular significance when the length of the cylindrical member is set to be short.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Where a movable fixing member is provided with a positioned portion which can engage the positioning portion, which may be a plurality of fixing portions, the positioning portions are a plurality of projections formed along the axial direction of the extender and the positioned portion is constituted of the cylindrical member formed of resilient material, so that the positioned portion can be engaged to one specific positioning portion.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this arrangement, the stomach interior fixing member can be maintained in a constant narrow width, thus improving the ease of operation. Also, the narrowness of the gastrostomy tube can be modified. In addition, since engagement between the positioned portion and the positioning portion can be achieved simply by inserting the cylindrical member formed with the positioned portion onto the positioning portion on the extender, the ease of operation is further increased, and the structure is simple and low-cost.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to drawings <b>1</b> through <b>6</b>, a first embodiment of the present invention will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a state in which a gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention is mounted to a gastrostomy tube <b>10</b>. The gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> includes a tube member <b>11</b> formed of polyurethane as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and a stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> connected to the lower end of the tube member <b>11</b>. In the following description, the side of the tube member <b>11</b> is referred to as the upper side, and the side of the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> is referred to as the lower side.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The interior of the tube member <b>11</b> is formed into a feed path <b>13</b> of a hole for allowing fluid substances such as liquid food to pass through. The tube member <b>11</b> has elasticity, and hence is extended when pulled, and returns to its original state when the pulling force is removed. The tube member <b>11</b> has a function to block the hole by being fixed in the hole when the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> is placed in the hole (not shown) formed on the abdominal part of a patient, and prevent the liquid or the like from leaking from inside the stomach.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> includes a cylindrical joint member <b>14</b> joined to the lower end of the tube member <b>11</b>, and an inner holding strip <b>15</b> joined to the opening edge at the lower end of the joint member <b>14</b>. The joint member <b>14</b> is formed into a cylindrical shape so as to cover the lower end portion of the outer peripheral surface of the tube member <b>11</b>, and is fixed to the tube member <b>11</b> in a state in which the lower end of the tube member <b>11</b> is inserted in the joint member <b>14</b>. The upper portion of the inner holding strip <b>15</b> is joined to the periphery of the lower end of the joint member <b>14</b>, and constitutes a contact portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>of substantially dome shape which comes into contact with the stomach wall when the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> is positioned inside the stomach. The lower portion of the inner holding strip <b>15</b> is comprised of four band-shaped joint members <b>15</b><i>b </i>joined to the lower edge of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>and a connecting portion <b>15</b><i>c </i>for connecting the distal end of the respective joined members <b>15</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Formed at the center portion of the upper surface of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>is a hole which communicates with the feed path <b>13</b> of the tube member <b>11</b>. The center portion of the upper surface of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>with which the stomach wall comes into contact is formed into a flat shape. The four joint members <b>15</b><i>b </i>are provided at regular intervals in the circumferential direction at the lower end of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>a</i>, and are separated into four directions from the lower edge of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>downward respectively, and then converged at a position below the center axis of the tube member <b>11</b> to constitute the connecting portion <b>15</b><i>c</i>, and are there fixed together.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In other words, the connecting portion <b>15</b><i>c </i>connects the respective joint members <b>15</b><i>b </i>with each other by joining the lower end portions of the respective joint members <b>15</b><i>b, </i>and is positioned at a lower location of the center axis of the tube member <b>11</b> by the respective joint members <b>15</b><i>b. </i>Therefore, the inner holding strip <b>15</b> is formed into substantially a spherical shape as a whole with the pairs of opposing joint members <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, and the outline of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>forms a circle respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The contact portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>and the respective joint members <b>15</b><i>b </i>are formed of soft elastic material having flexibility, and are maintained in a substantially spherical shape as a whole as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in the normal state by this elasticity. However, when the connecting portion <b>15</b><i>c </i>is pressed downward, it is expanded to a straight elongated state. In comparison with the portions of the contact portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>which correspond to the respective joint members <b>15</b><i>b</i>, the portions other than the above-described portions are thinner from the lower end to the upper end.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, the contact portion <b>15</b><i>a </i>is constructed of the portions extending from the joint members <b>15</b><i>b </i>and the thinned portions therebetween, and hence when the connecting portion <b>15</b><i>c </i>is pulled downward, it is folded to specified shape and is easily narrowed into an elongated shape. The connecting portion <b>15</b><i>c </i>is formed at the center thereof with a hole, and an engaging portion <b>16</b> of a short cylindrical shape is fixed to this hole. The engaging portion <b>16</b> is formed at the center thereof with a hole <b>16</b><i>a </i>for positioning the distal portion of a rod (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) <b>21</b> described later. The stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> configured as described above has a function to be fixed to the inner surface of the stomach wall of the patient and prevent the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> from being separated from the patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b> according to the first embodiment includes a rod <b>21</b> as the extender, a fixing member <b>22</b>, and an engaging member <b>23</b> according to the present invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b> in this arrangement is used for inserting the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> into the hole formed on the abdomen of the patient or taking out the same from the hole. The case of taking out the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> from the hole will first be described here. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b><i>a </i>in use. The gastrostomy tube <b>10</b><i>a </i>has a long tube member <b>11</b><i>a </i>and includes a connecting member <b>17</b> for connecting a feeding tube (not shown) for feeding nutrient preparation into the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b><i>a </i>connected to the upper end thereof. The connecting member <b>17</b> includes two feeding ports <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b</i>, and the feeding ports <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>are openable and closable by corresponding lids <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The lower portion of the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b><i>a </i>constitutes the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> described above, with the lower portion of the tube member <b>11</b><i>a </i>positioned at the hole formed between the abdominal wall and the stomach wall of the patient and the stomach interior, and with fixing member <b>12</b> placed in the patient's stomach. When feeding fluid substance such as liquid food or nutrient preparation to the patient, the predetermined feeding ports <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>at the connecting member <b>17</b> at the proximal end of the tube member <b>11</b><i>a </i>extending toward the outside the body are opened and the feeding tube is connected to the feeding ports <b>17</b><i>a, </i><b>17</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this state, nutrient preparation is fed to the patient with this feeding tube and the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b><i>a</i>. In this case, the fluid substance fed out of the lower opening of the tube member <b>11</b><i>a </i>enters into the stomach from the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> passing through the spaces between the joint members <b>15</b><i>b</i>. After use, the feeding tube is disconnected from the connecting member <b>17</b>, and the feeding ports <b>17</b><i>a</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>are closed with the lids <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b</i>. When replacement of the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b><i>a </i>is necessary after a predetermined period of use, the tube member <b>11</b><i>a </i>is cut at a position indicated by a broken line &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Accordingly, the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> remains in the patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rod <b>21</b> provided with the fixing member <b>22</b> attached thereto is inserted downward from the upper opening <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the tube member <b>11</b>. In this case, the operator holds the holding portion <b>22</b><i>b </i>with his/her hand and presses the main body <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the fixing member <b>22</b> into the tube member <b>11</b> so that the engaging projection <b>25</b> is fixed to the upper end of the tube member <b>11</b>. Then, the push-insertion piece <b>29</b><i>b </i>of the rod <b>21</b> is aligned with the engaging portion <b>16</b> of the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> and pushed into the hole <b>16</b><i>a</i>. Subsequently, the holding strip <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the lower engaging portion <b>26</b> is engaged with the outer peripheral surface of the tube member <b>11</b> at the engaging projection <b>25</b>, and the engaging member <b>23</b> is connected to the rod <b>21</b> to which the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> and the fixing member <b>22</b> are attached, in a state in which the main body <b>21</b><i>a </i>is positioned in the engaging recess <b>27</b><i>a </i>to obtain the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Subsequently, in a state in which the operator holds the upper surface of the holding portion <b>21</b><i>b </i>by hand to prevent the push-insertion piece <b>29</b><i>b </i>from separating from the hole <b>16</b><i>a</i>, the operator hooks his fingers with the lower surface of the upper engaging portion <b>27</b> and pulls the engaging member <b>23</b> upward, so that the edge of the engaging recess <b>27</b><i>a </i>is engaged with the predetermined engaging stepped portion <b>24</b><i>a</i>, for example, the engaging stepped portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>located at the center. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> extends straight and is narrowed, and hence the tube member <b>11</b> and the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> form the shape similar to one single rod. In this case, not only the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b>, but also the tube member <b>11</b> is brought into an extended state.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> and the gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b> are assembled in a state in which the engaging projection <b>25</b> is prevented from separating from the holding strip <b>26</b><i>a </i>by the curved portion at the distal end of the holding strip <b>26</b><i>a</i>, and the engaging stepped portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>21</b> is prevented from coming apart from the engaging recess <b>27</b><i>a </i>by the projections <b>27</b><i>b</i>. Then, the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> is taken out from the hole on the patient by pulling the rod <b>21</b> in a state in which the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> is extended as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this case, since the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> is elongated and narrowed, the removal of the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> can be performed smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> has been taken out from the patient, the operator hooks his/her fingers with the lower surface of the upper engaging portion <b>27</b>, and pulls the engaging member <b>23</b> upward, whereby the engaging recess <b>27</b><i>a </i>is removed from the engaging stepped portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the holding strip <b>26</b><i>a </i>is removed from the engaging projection <b>25</b>, so that the engaging member <b>23</b> is removed from the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> and the rod <b>21</b>. Then, the rod <b>21</b> is taken out from the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> to complete the removal operation. The used gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> is disposed, and the gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b> is used again for the next process.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Since the gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b> according to the present embodiment is configured as described above, the rod <b>21</b> including the fixing member <b>22</b> attached thereto is inserted into the tube member <b>11</b> of the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b>, so that the engaging projection <b>25</b> of the fixing member <b>22</b> is fixed to the upper end of the tube member <b>11</b>. Then, the engaging member <b>23</b> is pulled upward in a state in which the lower engaging portion <b>26</b> is engaged with the outer peripheral surface of the tube member <b>11</b> at the engaging projection <b>25</b> to cause the upper engaging portion <b>27</b> to be engaged the predetermined engaging stepped portion <b>24</b><i>a</i>, whereby the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b> is maintained in an narrowed state. Therefore, the operator who conducts a surgical operation can concentrate on the insertion or removal operation without paying attention to the extended state of the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> for treatment. Consequently, the operation to insert the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> into the hole on the patient or to take out the same from the hole is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this case, since the fixing member <b>22</b> is formed into a cylindrical shape, and hence moves along the longitudinal direction of the main body <b>21</b> of the rod <b>21</b>, the operation can be facilitated, and an adequate extension of the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> is achieved. In addition, since the fixing member <b>22</b> is fixed to the tube member <b>11</b> by the engaging projection <b>25</b>, and the holding strip <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the engaging member <b>23</b> engages the engaging projection <b>25</b> so as to clamp the tube member <b>11</b>, fixation of the fixing member <b>22</b> to the tube member <b>11</b> is further ensured. Furthermore, since the tube member <b>11</b> is brought into a firm contact with the outer peripheral surface of the main body <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the fixing member <b>22</b> when it is extended to a certain extent, and hence is prevented from excessively extending, a force to push the rod <b>21</b> is efficiently used for extension of the stomach interior fixing member <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also, the distal end of the holding strip <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the lower engaging portion <b>26</b> is curved upward and hence it is hard for the engaging projection <b>25</b> to separate from the lower engaging portion <b>26</b>, and the pair of the projections <b>27</b><i>b </i>are provided on the opening edge of the engaging recess <b>27</b><i>a </i>at the front portion of the upper engaging portion <b>27</b>, so that it is hard for the engaging stepped portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the rod <b>21</b> to separate from the upper engaging portion <b>27</b>. Therefore, the gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b> maintains the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> in the extended state stably without accidental disconnection of the gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b> from the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, since the three of the engaging stepped portions <b>24</b> are provided at regular intervals, the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b> can be extended in three-step lengths. Therefore, versatility is provided, and hence insertion or removal operation of various types of gastrostomy tubes can be performed by one type of gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b>. Since the engaging stepped portion <b>24</b><i>a </i>for engaging the engaging recess <b>27</b><i>a </i>can be selected according to the expansion or other physical properties of the gastrostomy tube <b>10</b>, operation in the optimal state is achieved.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The structures of other portions of the gastrostomy tube extension device <b>30</b> are the same as the corresponding portions of the gastrostomy tube extension device <b>20</b>.
