<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods, systems and apparatus for reducing apparent latency in content-delivery networks are provided. Sources multicast certain &#x2018;preview multicast streams&#x2019; to multiple subscribers. These preview multicast streams provide pre-recorded content of multicast streams. When a subscriber switches to a desired multicast stream, pre-recorded content of the desired multicast stream is reconstructed from a preview multicast stream. Thereafter, the pre-recorded content is played during the setup of the new multicast distribution tree to minimize latency. Once the distribution tree is setup, live content of the desired multicast stream is made available to the subscriber.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Present Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention relate, in general, to networking. More specifically, the embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and a system for reducing latency in a multicast content-delivery network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a typical content-delivery network, sources transmit streaming content, such as a television channel instance, to selected multiple subscribers that have joined a multicast group. As used herein, subscriber refers to the device or mechanism that presents the streaming content in a human perceptible manner. Each source has to generate only a single data stream and a multicast-enabled router forwards a multicast to a particular network only if there are multicast receivers on that network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Membership in a multicast group is dynamic; hosts can join and leave at any time. There is no restriction on the location or number of members in a multicast group. A host can be a member of more than one multicast group at a time. How active a multicast group is and what members it has can vary from group to group and from time to time. A multicast group can be active for a long time, or it may be very short-lived. Membership in a group can change constantly. A group that has members may have no activity.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Routers executing a multicast routing protocol, such as Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM), maintain forwarding tables to forward multicast datagrams. Routers use Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) to learn whether members of a group are present on their directly attached subnets. Hosts join multicast groups by sending IGMP report messages.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Many multimedia applications involve multiple participants. IP multicast is naturally suitable for this communication paradigm.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To join a multicast, a subscriber transmits a multicast-group join message to a multicast router operated by a service provider. The join message includes a control packet such as an IGMP join message. Subsequently, the router transmits a control packet such as a PIM join message to a Rendezvous Point (RP) in the content-delivery network. Thereafter, the RP transmits the PIM join message to the source of the multicast stream. In this way, a multicast distribution tree is set up after which the subscriber is able to receive the multicast stream. The process of setting up the multicast distribution tree is known as &#x2018;control packet processing&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Setting up the multicast distribution tree requires processing the control packet, a process that can involve a considerable amount of time. Thus, there is often substantial latency for the subscriber to receive the transmission of the multicast primarily because of the need to process the control packets.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the subscriber switches from one multicast stream to another, a new multicast distribution tree must be set up. For each multicast stream, state must be maintained and routers sitting in the path from the source of the multicast stream to the subscriber must process the control packets.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">If the subscriber switches between a number of multicast streams within a time window, then the control packet processing would also have to scale to match the number of multicast streams subscribed to by the subscriber within the time window. This leads to a substantial amount of additional processing by the routers in the multicast distribution tree. Additional bandwidth may need to be allocated if the selected multicast stream is not already in the set of multicast streams.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Processing the control packets, specifically, the IGMP reports and PIM joins, takes a substantial amount of time, thus resulting in a noticeable delay when switching from one channel instance to another. It is clearly undesirable to subject a viewer to many seconds of delay when switching from one channel instance to another. What is needed is a method and a system for lessening the delay when switching from one multicast channel to another before the contents of the channels are displayed for the viewer.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of the present invention provide a method, a system, and machine-readable media for reducing latency in a network. In the description herein for embodiments of the present invention, numerous specific details are provided, such as examples of components and/or methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize, however, that an embodiment of the present invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other apparatus, systems, assemblies, methods, components, materials, parts, and/or the like. In other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not specifically shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a typical multicast network, various multicast streams are transmitted to various subscribers. There can be a plurality of sources that transmit the multicast streams to subscribers. For each source in the multicast network, a multicast distribution tree is maintained. The multicast distribution tree is based on join messages received from subscribers interested in receiving the multicast stream. The multicast distribution tree is a distributed system that includes the source of the multicast stream, subscribers of the multicast stream, and the routers between the source and the subscribers. The subscribers in the multicast distribution tree are collectively termed as the multicast group. The source uses the multicast distribution tree to multicast the multicast stream to all the subscribers in the multicast group.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">When a subscriber switches from one multicast stream to another, the multicast distribution trees of these multicast streams are modified. This leads to extra processing on routers in the multicast distribution trees. A substantial delay in the set up of the multicast distribution trees occurs, resulting in latency in the transmission of the desired multicast stream to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments of the present invention provide a method that reduces latency in a multicast network. Specifically, sources multicast certain &#x2018;preview multicast streams&#x2019; to their subscribers while the multicast tree is being set up. A preview multicast stream multicast by a source provides pre-recorded content of multicast streams provided by that source or a group of sources. When a subscriber switches to a desired multicast stream, the pre-recorded content of the desired multicast stream is played during the setup of the new multicast distribution tree to minimize latency. Once the distribution tree is setup, live content of the desired multicast stream is made available to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the drawings, particularly by their reference numbers, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a network environment <b>100</b> for implementing embodiments of the present invention. Network environment <b>100</b> includes a network <b>102</b>, a plurality of sources designated as sources <b>104</b>, a plurality of routers designated as routers <b>106</b>, and a plurality of subscribers designated as subscribers <b>108</b>. Each subscriber comprises means for displaying the streaming content in a human perceptible manner. Network <b>102</b> can be a collection of individual networks, interconnected with each other and functioning as a single large network. Examples of network <b>102</b> include, but are not limited to, Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), and the Internet. Further, network <b>102</b> may be a wireless or wired network. Network <b>102</b> provides a communication medium to sources <b>104</b> and subscribers <b>108</b> for transmitting content from one or more sources to one or more subscribers. Further, sources <b>104</b> can be any part or region of network <b>102</b>, such as network devices, processes, network links or resources, controlled or owned domains, Universal Resource Locators (URLs), content-delivery sites, and so forth. Examples of sources <b>104</b> and subscribers <b>108</b> include, but are not limited to, computers, servers, and network management stations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A subscriber interested in receiving content provided by a particular multicast stream transmits a request to a router that is associated with the subscriber. Subsequently, the router transmits the request to the source of the multicast stream. The request is transmitted through various routers included in the path of the multicast distribution tree of the multicast stream. Once the request is received by the source, the subscriber is included in the multicast group of the multicast stream. Consequently, the multicast stream is multicast to the subscriber through a path in the multicast distribution tree.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, sources <b>104</b> can provide their multicast streams to various edge sites included in network <b>102</b>. These edge sites store the content provided by sources <b>104</b> and provide it when requested. For example, a subscriber makes a request for certain content to a router associated with it. Thereafter, the router transmits the request to an edge site located in its vicinity. The edge site can be an Internet Service Provider (ISP), a web host, and a cable company, among others. Subsequently, the edge site provides the requested content to the router. Finally, the router transmits the requested content to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One skilled in the art will appreciate that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is merely a representation of a simplified network for the purpose of illustrating the present embodiment and the present invention is not to be limited by the number of illustrated sources <b>104</b>, routers <b>106</b> and subscribers <b>108</b>. It is to be understood that the specific designation of sources <b>104</b>, routers <b>106</b> and subscribers <b>108</b> is for the convenience of the reader and is not to be construed as limiting network environment <b>100</b> to a specific number of sources <b>104</b>, routers <b>106</b> and subscribers <b>108</b> or to specific types of sources <b>104</b>, routers <b>106</b> and subscribers <b>108</b> present in network environment <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, network <b>102</b> is a multicast network, where sources <b>104</b> transmit multicast streams to subscribers <b>108</b>. Subscribers <b>108</b> can have access to different kinds of content provided by sources <b>104</b>. Therefore, subscribers <b>108</b> subscribe to sources <b>104</b> for receiving content they are interested in. For example, subscribers <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, and <b>108</b><i>c </i>subscribe to a multicast stream provided by source <b>104</b><i>a</i>. Subsequently, source <b>104</b><i>a </i>transmits the multicast stream to router <b>106</b><i>a</i>, which then transmits the multicast stream to routers <b>106</b><i>c </i>and <b>106</b><i>d </i>through network <b>102</b>. Thereafter, router <b>106</b><i>c </i>creates a copy of the multicast stream and transmits the multicast stream to subscribers <b>108</b><i>a </i>and <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Router <b>106</b><i>d </i>transmits the multicast stream to subscriber <b>108</b><i>c</i>. Examples of content in a multicast stream include, but are not limited to, data files, audio and video.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When a subscriber from subscribers <b>108</b> switches between various multicast streams provided by sources <b>104</b>, the multicast distribution trees of the multicast streams are modified. This involves a substantial delay in the set up of the multicast distribution trees, thereby resulting in latency in the transmission of the desired multicast stream to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates various elements of a system <b>200</b> for reducing latency in network <b>102</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. System <b>200</b> includes a plurality of sources designated as sources <b>202</b>, a plurality of multicast streams (provided by sources <b>202</b>) designated as multicast streams <b>204</b>, a plurality of subscribers designated as subscribers <b>208</b>, and network <b>102</b>. Sources <b>202</b> transmit multicast streams <b>204</b> to subscribers <b>208</b> across network <b>102</b>. Sources <b>202</b> can transmit one or more multicast streams.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, system <b>200</b> includes a plurality of &#x2018;First Hop Multicast Routers&#x2019; (FHMRs) (associated with subscribers <b>208</b>) designated as FHMRs <b>210</b>. An FHMR is a network infrastructure device in network <b>102</b> that is one hop away from a subscriber. Therefore, the subscriber communicates with other network infrastructure devices in network <b>102</b> through the FHMR. Examples of network infrastructure devices include, but are not limited to, routers, switches, hubs, gateways, repeaters and bridges. The FHMR receives a multicast stream that the subscriber has subscribed to and then transmits it to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, it should be noted that an FHMR from FHMRs <b>210</b> is not limited to an association with only a specific number of subscribers. For example, a single FHMR can be associated with a plurality of subscribers present in a LAN.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, network <b>102</b> is a multicast network running Protocol-Independent Multicast&#x2014;Sparse Mode (PIM-SM). As mentioned before, subscribers <b>208</b> can subscribe to multicast streams <b>204</b> provided by sources <b>202</b>. For example, subscriber <b>208</b><i>a </i>can subscribe to any multicast stream from multicast streams <b>204</b>. For subscription to a particular multicast stream, subscriber <b>208</b><i>a </i>transmits an Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) join message to FHMR <b>210</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, subscribers <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c</i>, <b>208</b><i>d</i>, <b>208</b><i>e </i>and <b>208</b><i>f </i>can subscribe to any multicast stream from multicast streams <b>204</b>. Once FHMR <b>210</b><i>a </i>receives the IGMP join message, it transmits a Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) join message to a Rendezvous Point (RP) in network <b>102</b>. The RP is a router in network <b>102</b>, where PIM join messages from FHMRs <b>210</b> for joining sources <b>202</b> are received. In an embodiment of the present invention, there are different RPs for different multicast groups in network <b>102</b>. Further, the RP transmits the PIM join messages to sources <b>202</b>. The PIM join messages can also be transmitted by FHMRs <b>210</b> to sources <b>202</b>, through certain shortest paths that do not include the RP. Based on the PIM join messages received, multicast distribution trees are formed. A multicast distribution tree of a multicast stream provided by a source includes paths from the source to the subscribers, and is used to multicast the multicast stream. A multicast distribution tree can be a shared distribution tree or a source-based distribution tree.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">After a multicast distribution tree for a multicast stream is formed, the source of the multicast stream transmits an instance of the multicast stream to the RP. Thereafter, the instance of the multicast stream is transmitted to the subscribers of the multicast stream such that a copy of the instance is created each time that the branches of the multicast distribution tree split.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When a subscriber switches from one multicast stream to another, there is a change in the setup of the multicast distribution trees of these multicast streams. This process involves a considerable amount of time, resulting in latency in the transmission of the desired multicast stream to the subscriber. In an embodiment of the present invention, sources <b>202</b> generate one or more preview multicast steams from multicast streams <b>204</b>. The preview multicast streams provide the content of multicast streams <b>204</b> that was recorded during a predefined recording-time period. The content recorded during the predefined recording-time period is hereinafter referred as &#x2018;pre-recorded content&#x2019;. The preview multicast streams have multicast addresses of their own.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment of the present invention, sources <b>202</b> generate the preview multicast streams in a predefined frame format. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the predefined frame format is defined by a system administrator of sources <b>202</b> that are generating the preview multicast streams. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the system administrator defines the predefined frame format as interleaved frames of multicast streams <b>204</b>. This is hereinafter referred as &#x2018;interleaved frame format&#x2019;. Details regarding the interleaved frame format have been provided with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In system <b>200</b>, source <b>202</b><i>d </i>generates a preview multicast stream <b>206</b>, which provides the pre-recorded content of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d</i>, and <b>204</b><i>e</i>. Further, the pre-recorded content is multicast repeatedly for a predefined preview-time period. The predefined recording-time period and the predefined preview-time period can be configured as the same. For example, for preview multicast stream <b>206</b>, the predefined recording-time period and the predefined preview-time period are configured as 20 minutes. Therefore, preview multicast stream <b>206</b> provides content of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d</i>, and <b>204</b><i>e </i>that was recorded during the last 20 minutes. Preview multicast stream <b>206</b> provides five minutes of the pre-recorded content such that it provides one minute content each for multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d</i>, and <b>204</b><i>e</i>. Therefore, the five minutes of the pre-recorded content is multicast four times in the 20 minutes of the predefined preview-time period.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When a subscriber subscribes to a multicast stream, the subscriber is automatically subscribed to a preview multicast stream that includes the multicast stream. Continuing from the above example, subscriber <b>208</b><i>a </i>subscribes to multicast stream <b>204</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, subscriber <b>208</b><i>a </i>is automatically subscribed to preview multicast stream <b>206</b>. Subsequently, both multicast stream <b>204</b><i>a </i>and preview multicast stream <b>206</b> are multicast to subscriber <b>208</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the multicast addresses of the preview multicast streams provided by sources <b>202</b> can be pre-configured on subscribers <b>208</b>. For example, a preview multicast stream can be selected by a subscriber by clicking a link on a website. Consequently, the multicast address of the preview multicast stream is pre-configured on the subscriber, which implies that the subscriber is subscribed to receive the preview multicast stream. Subsequently, the preview multicast stream is multicast to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the subscriber switches to another multicast stream included in the preview multicast stream, the pre-recorded content of the switched multicast stream is reconstructed from the preview multicast stream. Subsequently, the reconstructed content is played with a message indicating that the played content is a pre-recorded content. Continuing from the previous example, subscriber <b>208</b><i>a </i>switches to multicast stream <b>204</b><i>b</i>. Consequently, one minute of pre-recorded content of multicast stream <b>204</b><i>b </i>is reconstructed from preview multicast stream <b>206</b>. Subsequently, the one minute of the reconstructed content is played with a message that the played content is the pre-recorded content of multicast stream <b>204</b><i>b </i>recorded during the last 20 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Meanwhile, the setup of the multicast distribution trees of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>b </i>are changed. Subsequently, the live content of multicast stream <b>204</b><i>b </i>is made available to the subscriber, and is played, instead of the pre-recorded content.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment of the present invention, a preview multicast stream is generated by a source providing certain multicast streams. This preview multicast stream provides the pre-recorded content of the multicast streams provided by the source. For example, if a source provides four multicast streams, the source generates a preview multicast stream containing the pre-recorded content of the four multicast streams.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, a single source can be configured to generate preview multicast streams of various multicast streams multicast by a set of sources in the same domain. A domain is defined as an area that is under a single point of control. For example, a plurality of network devices within a LAN can be considered as a domain. It should be noted that preview multicast streams can also be generated across various domains. A single source can be configured to generate preview multicast streams of multicast streams multicast by sources from different domains.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Consider, for example, sources <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>202</b><i>b</i>, <b>202</b><i>c </i>and <b>202</b><i>d </i>are included in the same domain. Consequently, source <b>202</b><i>d </i>generates preview multicast stream <b>206</b> that provides the pre-recorded content of multicast stream <b>204</b><i>a </i>provided by source <b>202</b><i>a</i>, multicast streams <b>204</b><i>b </i>and <b>204</b><i>c </i>provided by source <b>202</b><i>b</i>, and multicast streams <b>204</b><i>d </i>and <b>204</b><i>e </i>provided by source <b>202</b><i>c</i>. However, it should be noted that a source can generate a preview multicast stream providing pre-recorded content of a selected set of multicast streams. Continuing from the above example, source <b>202</b><i>d </i>can generate another preview multicast stream providing the pre-recorded content of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b </i>and <b>204</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As mentioned before, a preview multicast stream is generated by a source in the interleaved frame format. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the interleaved frame format of preview multicast stream <b>206</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Preview multicast stream <b>206</b> includes various frames of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d</i>, and <b>204</b><i>e </i>in an interleaved manner. The frames include content in the form of packets.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, frames <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, <b>302</b><i>c</i>, <b>302</b><i>d </i>and <b>302</b><i>e </i>correspond to frames of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d</i>, and <b>204</b><i>e</i>, respectively. Therefore, a frame of multicast stream <b>204</b><i>b </i>follows a frame of multicast stream <b>204</b><i>a</i>, which follows a frame of multicast stream <b>204</b><i>e</i>, and so forth. In this way, frames of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d</i>, and <b>204</b><i>e </i>are interleaved. The frames can be, for example, of two seconds size each. Therefore, a subscriber does not have to wait for playing pre-recorded content of a desired multicast stream. Continuing from the previous example, if preview multicast stream <b>206</b> was not generated in the interleaved frame format, subscriber <b>208</b><i>a </i>would have had to wait till the pre-recorded content of multicast stream <b>204</b><i>b </i>is multicast on preview multicast stream <b>206</b>. Further, the frame size can be defined by a system administrator of the source that is generating the preview multicast stream.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, appropriate control information is provided in preview multicast stream <b>206</b>, to delineate the starting and the ending points of packets corresponding to multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d</i>, and <b>204</b><i>e</i>. This helps in the reconstruction of pre-recorded content of a desired multicast stream from preview multicast stream <b>206</b>. For example, the reconstruction of the pre-recorded content of multicast stream <b>204</b><i>b </i>can be performed by checking header information of its frames.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As mentioned before, the pre-recorded content of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d</i>, and <b>204</b><i>e </i>is multicast repeatedly. This implies that the frames of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d </i>and <b>204</b><i>e </i>are multicast repeatedly in an interleaved manner. Since the same pre-recorded content is multicast repeatedly, it is desired that the pre-recorded content be cached at a cache associated with the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates various elements of subscribers <b>208</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A subscriber from subscribers <b>208</b> includes a cache <b>402</b> for caching pre-recorded content provided by preview multicast streams subscribed to by the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Continuing from the previous example, preview multicast stream <b>206</b> provides the content of multicast streams <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>c</i>, <b>204</b><i>d</i>, and <b>204</b><i>e </i>that was recorded during the last 20 minutes. Preview multicast stream <b>206</b> provides five minutes of the pre-recorded content, which is multicast four times in the 20 minutes of the predefined preview-time period. If the subscriber caches the five minutes of the pre-recorded content, a repeat multicast of the pre-recorded content would not be required. Further, the cache can be refreshed with new pre-recorded content in every 20 minutes of the predefined recording-time period.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the subscriber includes a media player <b>404</b>. When the subscriber switches to a multicast stream included in a received preview multicast stream, media player <b>404</b> switches to the received preview multicast stream and reconstructs the pre-recorded content of the multicast stream. Subsequently, media player <b>404</b> plays the reconstructed content with an appropriate message. Thereafter, when the live content of the multicast stream is received, media player <b>404</b> switches over to the live content from the pre-recorded content. Media player <b>404</b> can be an application such as Windows&#x2122; media player and stream player. In an alternative embodiment, subscribers <b>208</b> may be an IP enabled entertainment device capable receiving multicast streams, caching the stream and then presenting the stream on a screen for viewing by one or more viewers.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of a method for reducing latency in network <b>102</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At <b>502</b>, preview multicast streams are generated from various multicast streams. As mentioned before, the preview multicast streams can be individually generated by the sources of the multicast streams. In addition, a single source can also generate the preview multicast streams from the multicast streams provided by other sources in the same domain.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, the preview multicast streams provide the content of the multicast streams that was recorded during the predefined recording-time period. Therefore, every time that the predefined recording-time period is completed, the previous pre-recorded content is replaced by the new pre-recorded content. For a preview multicast stream, the predefined recording-time period can be defined by a system administrator of the source that is generating the preview multicast stream. As mentioned before, the preview multicast streams are generated by the sources in the interleaved frame format. Details of the interleaved frame format have been provided in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">After the generation of the preview multicast streams, at <b>504</b>, the preview multicast streams are multicast to various subscribers that have subscribed to these preview multicast streams. As mentioned before, pre-recorded content in a preview multicast is multicast repeatedly for the predefined preview-time period. The predefined preview-time period can be defined by a system administrator of the source that is generating the preview multicast stream.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A subscriber can choose to subscribe to a set of preview multicast streams, based on a set of multicast streams the subscriber is interested in. After the subscription to the set of preview multicast streams, the subscriber receives each of the preview multicast streams included in the subscribed set of preview multicast streams. Thereafter, the subscriber can switch between various multicast streams provided by these preview multicast streams, without experiencing any latency in the transmission of the multicast streams. This has been explained in detail in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of a method for reducing latency in network <b>102</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At <b>602</b>, a subscriber subscribes to a preview multicast stream. As mentioned before, the subscriber is automatically subscribed to the preview multicast stream when the subscriber subscribes to a multicast stream included in the preview multicast stream. The subscriber can also pre-configure the preview multicast stream and subscribe to it. After subscribing to the preview multicast stream, at <b>604</b>, the subscriber receives the subscribed preview multicast stream.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Thereafter, at <b>606</b>, the subscriber caches the received preview multicast stream. As mentioned before, the pre-recorded content provided by the received preview multicast is cached at cache <b>402</b> such that none of the frames are repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the subscriber switches to a multicast stream included in the preview multicast stream, media player <b>404</b> switches to the preview multicast stream. Subsequently, at <b>608</b>, media player <b>404</b> reconstructs the pre-recorded content of the switched multicast stream from the preview multicast stream. Thereafter, at <b>610</b>, media player <b>404</b> plays the reconstructed content.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">While <b>608</b> and <b>610</b> are performed, the multicast distribution tree of the switched multicast tree is set up. Subsequently, the live content of the switched multicast stream is made available to the subscriber. Once the live content is received, media player <b>404</b> starts playing the live content. Therefore, there is no undue delay when the subscriber switches between various multicast streams.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a system for reducing latency in a multicast network is provided. The system includes various sources, which are adapted for providing various multicast streams. These sources include means for generating one or more preview multicast streams from the multicast streams; and means for multicasting the generated preview multicast streams. Further, the system includes various subscribers that further include means for subscribing to the generated preview multicast streams; means for receiving the subscribed preview multicast streams; a cache for caching the received preview multicast streams; and a media player for: reconstructing pre-recorded content of a required multicast stream from a received preview multicast stream, which includes the required multicast stream, and playing the reconstructed content.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method for reducing latency in a multicast network is provided. The method comprises generating one or more preview multicast streams from a plurality of multicast streams, each preview multicast stream providing pre-recorded content of two or more multicast streams in a predefined frame format; and multicasting the generated preview multicast streams to one or more subscribers.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a method for reducing latency in a multicast network is provided. The method comprises subscribing to a preview multicast steam; receiving the preview multicast stream from a source, the preview multicast stream providing pre-recorded content of two or more multicast streams in a predefined frame format; reconstructing pre-recorded content of a multicast stream selected by a subscriber, from the received preview multicast stream; and playing the reconstructed content. The method further comprises caching the preview multicast stream.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the latency in the transmission of a switched multicast stream to a subscriber is reduced. A preview multicast stream providing one or more multicast streams along with the switched multicast stream is multicast to the subscriber. When the subscriber switches to a multicast stream included in the preview multicast stream, the pre-recorded content of the switched multicast stream is reconstructed from the preview multicast stream. Thereafter, the reconstructed content is played. Meanwhile, the multicast distribution tree of the switched multicast stream is set up and the live content is made available to the subscriber.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Embodiments of the present invention facilitate the reconstruction of the pre-recorded content of the switched multicast stream without any delay. As the pre-recorded content of the multicast streams in the preview multicast stream is provided in the interleaved frame format, media player <b>404</b> does not have to wait for playing the pre-recorded content of the switched multicast stream.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Embodiments of the present invention facilitate an updated preview of a switched multicast stream to a subscriber. For example, preview multicast stream <b>206</b> provides the content that was recorded in the last 20 minutes. In an embodiment of the present invention, pre-recorded content of various multicast streams in a preview multicast stream is updated from time-to-time.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is no need to multicast the same pre-recorded content repeatedly in the predefined preview-time period. The subscriber caches the pre-recorded content provided by the preview multicast stream. Subsequently, media player <b>404</b> reconstructs the pre-recorded content of the switched multicast stream from the cached pre-recorded content.</p>
