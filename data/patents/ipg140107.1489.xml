<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority of German Patent Application No. 10 2009 042 336.2, filed Sep. 21, 2009, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a self-piercing hollow press-in element, to a component assembly consisting of a press-in element and a sheet metal part and also to a method of manufacturing a self-piercing press-in nut and also to a method for the attachment of a self-piercing press-in nut.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the manufacture of motorcar bodies and parts it is absolutely usual to operate with fastener elements which are present in the form of rivet elements, piercing elements or press-in elements.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With a rivet element the element is inserted into a pre-pierced sheet metal part and riveted to the sheet metal part by beading over the rivet section of the fastener element. The fastener element itself has a fastener part, i.e. either an internal thread or a bolt shaft with an external thread, whereby a further component can be secured to the sheet metal part using a bolt or a nut respectively. Piercing elements, which can be formed either as rivet elements or press-in elements are termed self-piercing elements i.e. the element itself cuts a hole in the sheet metal part and is subsequently secured to the sheet metal part. With the known press-in elements the sheet metal part can be pre-pierced or the press-in element can, as indicated above, be made in self-piercing manner, i.e. so that an attachment to a sheet metal part itself cuts a hole in the sheet metal part under the forces that are applied. The element is passed through the hole and the sheet metal part is pressed so that sheet metal material flows into undercuts of the press-in element. The press-in element is thus locked to the sheet metal part in this way so that it is securely fastened to the sheet metal part and cannot be straightforwardly pressed axially out of the sheet metal part or rotated relative to the sheet metal part with the usual torques which arise on attaching a bolt or a nut. Press-in elements are, in contrast to rivet elements, not deformed on attachment to the sheet metal part or essentially not intentionally deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such fastener elements have generally replaced the weld elements in the construction of motor vehicles which were previously welded to sheet metal bodywork and the like. The welding on of elements can, on the one hand, only be poorely integrated into the process of manufacture of individual sheet metal parts by mechanical deformation and leads also to an undesired contamination of the sheet metal part. Furthermore weld elements cannot be used with diverse sheet metal parts such as, for example, sheet metal parts which are pre-painted or which consist of two sheet metal layers, optionally with a plastic membrane disposed between them. They can also not be used when the sheet metal part is a high strength sheet metal part since the heat which arises during the welding leads to an unacceptable reduction of the characteristics of the sheet metal in the region of the weld position. In the manufacture of sheet metal parts for motor vehicles large numbers are required and the sheet metal thicknesses which enter into question normally lie in the range from 0.6 mm to 2.5 mm, occasionally beyond this up to 3 mm or somewhat more.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">DE 10 2007 034 987 A1 describes a press-in element which can be formed as self-piercing element and which is suitable for attachment in thick sheet metal parts. The press-in element shown there has a head part having a ring surface confronting the sheet metal part and a neck part which projects away from the ring surface i.e. away from the sheet metal contact surface, with the head part furthermore having a ring shaped projection surrounding the neck part with a radial spacing and projecting away from the ring surface. The neck part also has a radially outwardly projecting ring bead which can be formed as a continuous ring bead and also as a locally interrupted ring bead. The tip of the bead has an axial spacing from the ring surface which is larger than the axial spacing of the tip of the ring-shaped projection from the ring surface. The ring bead lies radially within this projection and forms with the latter a pocket which takes up material of the sheet metal part. A press-in element of this kind certainly has its justification but is however relatively complicated in its manufacture. Furthermore, the design in the region of the ring surface and directly below the ring surface at the neck part can under some circumstances lead to greater difficulties during the attachment of the sheet metal part as the desired form-fitted locking which aimed at with the sheet metal part cannot be ensured under some circumstances to the desired level.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">At this point reference should be made also the European patent EP-B-1 690 913. Here a further functional element is described which has a sheet metal contact surface of ring shape at the underside of a head part and a neck part projecting away from the latter which is here designed as a piercing section. This functional element is characterized in that it can be used with sheet metal parts of various thicknesses. For this purpose a ring-like bead is provided at the piercing section between the ring-like sheet metal contact surface and the free end of the piercing section and furthermore a ring recess is provided between the bead and the free end of the piercing section around the piercing section. In addition, ribs providing security against rotation are provided which extend in raised manner within a further ring groove between the sheet metal contact surface and the bead in the axial direction up to the bead. An element of this kind is entirely able to satisfy its task is however relatively complicated and is also not well suited to be used in a self-piercing manner in really thick sheet metal parts in the range from 4 mm thickness and above.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In EP-B-1 690 013 it is brought out that the element can be used with sheet metal thickness in the range between 0.6 mm and 4 mm, with sheet metal thickness above 3 mm being relatively rare in motorcar construction. Fastener elements are however also used in the manufacture of trucks but to a much smaller degree. Essentially it is only the use of rivet elements from the manufacture of motorcars which is known. These are also used in thinner sheet metal parts in trucks, for example in the area of the driver's cabin. More stable sheet metal parts of a truck, i.e. with sheet metal thicknesses greater than 3 mm and usually greater than 4 mm and even larger are&#x2014;if at all&#x2014;only provided in the rarest cases with rivet elements because the available rivet elements are simply not designed for such thick sheet metal parts. Furthermore, many fewer trucks are manufactured in comparison to motorcars. In the manufacture of trucks, weld elements are currently been used to a large extent.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the present invention is to propose a self-piercing press-in element and a component assembly consisting of a press-in element and a sheet metal part as well as a method for the manufacture of such a press-in nut and such a component assembly which can be manufactured at favorable price or carried out even with small numbers of parts and can be rationally used. In order to satisfy this object a self-piercing press-in element is provided in accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, in particular a nut element for attachment to a sheet metal part, wherein the press-in element has a flange part of a larger diameter and a shaft part of a smaller diameter, with the shaft part extending away from the flange part and having a circular piercing edge at its end face remote from the flange part, wherein the side of the flange part facing the shaft part forms a sheet metal contact surface in ring shape and features providing security against rotation are provided at the shaft part which extend approximately from the level of the sheet metal contact surface over a part of the length of the shaft part along the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Through this design a sharper transition can be provided between the ring-like sheet metal contact surface and the shaft part, whereby the element can be introduced in self-piercing manner into the sheet metal part and it is ensured that the flange part closely contacts the sheet metal part and that no disturbing radii or features are provided in the transition region which could hinder a firm seat of the ring-like contact surface at the sheet metal part. In this way the element can be firmly pressed into engagement with the sheet metal part without a spacing resulting between the sheet metal contact surface and the side of the sheet metal part facing it.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this way settlement effects can be avoided reliably in operation whereby the bolt screwed into the hollow press-in element always retains the preset tension and the bolted connection does not become prematurely loose or fail, for example due to settlement effects. In the claimed design one press-in element can be used with various sheet metal thicknesses.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a preferred embodiment features providing security against rotation are provided which are formed by noses or ribs providing security against rotation and which extend in the axial direction of the shaft part along the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is particularly favorable with a design of this kind when the said ribs or noses arise during manufacture of the features providing security against rotation such that a tool having corresponding grooves is placed over the shaft part of the press-in element and material is displaced from the region between the ribs and the noses partly into the ribs and noses and partly axially shifted up to and into the ring-like recess in the flange part where, so to say, the excess material can be hidden and indeed without preventing a sharp transition from the ring-like sheet metal contact surface into the outer side of the shaft part.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with a further aspect of the invention there is provided a self-piercing hollow press-in element, in particular a nut element for attachment to a sheet metal part, wherein the press-in element has a flange part of larger diameter and a shaft part of smaller diameter, with the shaft part extending away from the flange part and having a circular piercing edge at its end remote from a flange part, with the side of the flange part facing the shaft part forming a sheet metal contact surface of ring shape with the special characterizing feature that the diameter D<b>2</b> amounts to approximately 50 mm for an M6 nut element, to approximately 16 mm for an M8 nut element, to approximately 17 mm for an M10 nut element, to approximately 18 mm for an M12 nut element and to approximately 19.5 mm for an M14 nut element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The above quoted diameters of the shaft part straightforwardly suffice to produce a piercing slug in sheet metal parts having a thickness of 8 mm providing that the sheet metal parts have a moderate strength in the range of 280 to 320 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with a further aspect of the invention a self-piercing press-in element is provided, in particular a nut element for attachment to a sheet metal part, with the press-in element having a flange part of larger diameter and a shaft part of smaller diameter, and with the shaft part extending away from the flange and having a circular piercing edge at its end remote from the flange part, and with the side of the flange part adjacent to the shaft part forming a sheet metal contact shoulder, with the special characterizing feature that the press-in element does not have any features of shape formed as an undercut which are designed to receive sheet metal material to achieve an axial press-out resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A design of the press-in element of this kind must first of all be regarded as surprising because one has to ask the question as to how the axial resistance against press-out load is achieved relative to the sheet metal part if no undercuts are provided. The answer to this lies in the fact that a special component assembly is provided, i.e. consisting of a fastener element and the sheet metal part, with the fastener element having a flange part of larger diameter and a shaft part of smaller diameter which extends away from the flange part and has a circular piercing edge at its free end remote from the flange part with the diameter of the piercing edge corresponding to or being fractionally larger than the diameter of the shaft part and with the side of the flange part facing the shaft part forming a sheet metal contact surface of ring shape with the special characterizing feature that the fastener element is designed for use with sheet metal parts having thicknesses in the region of 3 mm and larger and that the shaft part is located within a pierced hole in the sheet metal part which contacts the shaft part closely in a first region adjacent to the sheet metal contact surface and also in a second region adjacent to the piercing edge and in that in a third region between the first region and the second region the hole wall of the sheet metal part has a spacing from the shaft part.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">This embodiment relates to the concept that the sheet metal part is first conically pierced in the sense that the hole diverges conically away from the piercing side of the element and after the full insertion of the press-in element into the conical pierced hole the sheet metal material is crushed at the side of the sheet metal part opposite to the flange part of the element around the pierced hole so that it moves radially inwardly and closely contacts the piercing section of the press-in element in the named second region. Because a close contact is in any event present in the first region of the piercing section the press-in element is retained well aligned in the sheet metal part and the fact that a gap is present in the third region does not have any disadvantageous effect on the stability of the installation of the press-in element at the sheet metal part. Through the close contact of the sheet metal part in the named second region the material of the sheet metal part engages into the unevenness of the surface of the piercing section in any event present there and causes an extremely pronounced stranglehold of this region, whereby the required security against rotation and security against press-out is established. The fact that the piercing section must itself be made relatively thick in its radial dimension in order to achieve the required piercing action in the sheet metal part and thus offers a large resistance against the radially inwardly moving sheet metal material also favors this stranglehold. A construction of this kind is also not obvious because the person averagely skilled in the art has to expect that with a conical piercing of the sheet metal part the element would be absolutely inadequately held in the sheet metal part and indeed especially when no undercut features are present. For thick sheet metal parts it is in any event difficult to adequately fill such undercuts with sheet metal material.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">If necessary the required security against rotation and security against press-out can also be achieved in that an adhesive is present between the sheet metal parts and the hollow press-in element and indeed especially between the sheet metal part and the sheet metal contact surface and/or between the sheet metal part and the first region of the shaft part and/or between the sheet metal part and the second region of the shaft part and/or between the sheet metal part and the third region of the shaft part. The adhesive is preferably an adhesive which cures under pressure. Such pressure arises in all of the above-named regions during the press-in of the press-in element. They also arise in the third region of the shaft part because the originally large space provided here is reduced to the creation of the stranglehold in the second region of the shaft part whereby the pressure prevailing there arises.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Even if an adequate security against press-out can be achieved even without features providing security against rotation, features providing security against rotation can be provided at the shaft part and extend from approximately the level of the sheet metal contact surface over a part of the length of the shaft part along the latter. In a component assembly the sheet metal part is contacted in form-fitted manner, in the named first region by the features providing security against rotation there.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The component assembly which arises on the attachment of the press-in element is further characterized in that the sheet metal part has at its side remote from the sheet metal contact shoulder a ring-shaped recess around the piercing edge. To this extent the sheet metal part lies, at least in the region of the attachment of the fastener element, in one plane prior to and after the attachment of the fastener element, apart from the ring recess. This favors the bolted up situation when a further component is secured to the sheet metal part.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The features providing security against rotation are preferably formed by noses or ribs which extend in the axial direction of the shaft part along the shaft part. Recesses, which correspond to the noses or ribs providing security against rotation are then present in the sheet metal part. The press-in element is preferably a fastener element having a hollow shaft part with a central thread which extends through the flange part and the shaft part. Through the pronounced radial thickness of the shaft part it need not be feared that the shaft part will be compressed during the attachment to the sheet metal part so that the fastener element does not become excessively tall when providing an adequate length of the thread and thus is not excessively heavy.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A method for the manufacture of a self-piercing press-in nut having a flange part of larger diameter and a shaft part of smaller diameter extending away from the flange part, wherein the shaft part has a circular piercing edge at its end remote from the flange part is characterized in that one takes a blank having a cross-sectional shape corresponding to that of the flange part and the shaft part, with the shaft part having a smaller diameter in the region of the free end in the blank than in the region adjacent to the flange part, in that an axial recess is formed in the flange part adjacent to the shaft part and in that material in the region of the shaft part having the larger diameter is scraped away at a plurality of positions spaced apart around the periphery by means of a scraper with the scraped away material being introduced into the axial recess of the flange part and with noses or ribs remaining in the region between the scraped away regions which form features of the element providing security against rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The method in accordance with the invention for the attachment of a self-piercing element in accordance with the invention to a sheet metal part is characterized in that a sheet metal part is supported on a die button which has a cylindrical opening having a diameter larger than the diameter of the shaft part in the region of the circular piercing edge; in that the shaft part of the press-in element is pressed by pressure on the flange part of the self-piercing press-in element through the sheet metal part to form a pierced opening of the sheet metal part, with the pierced opening diverging approximately conically in the press-in direction in relation to the longitudinal axis of the pierced opening and, after formation of the corresponding piercing slug, the sheet metal material in the region around the piercing edge is pressed to form a ring-like recess in the sheet metal part by means of a ring nose of the die button whereby the sheet metal material is deformed radially inwardly and contacts the shaft part of the press-in element in the region of its free end.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> show a self-piercing hollow press-in element <b>10</b> in the form of a nut element in attachment to a sheet metal part. The press-in element <b>10</b> has a flange part <b>12</b> of a larger diameter D<b>1</b> and a shaft part <b>14</b> of smaller diameter D<b>2</b>, with the shaft part <b>14</b> extending away from the flange part <b>12</b> and having a circular piercing edge <b>18</b> at its end <b>16</b> remote from the flange part <b>12</b>. The side of the flange part <b>12</b> adjacent the shaft part <b>14</b> forms a sheet metal contact surface <b>22</b> of ring-shape and features <b>24</b> providing security against rotation are provided at the shaft part. These features extend from approximately the level of the sheet metal contact surface <b>22</b> over a part of the length of the shaft part <b>14</b>, for example over about 40% of the length of the shaft part <b>14</b> along the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A ring-shaped recess <b>26</b> is provided in the flange part <b>12</b> radially within the sheet metal contact surface <b>22</b> of ring shape. The ring recess <b>26</b> can also be recognized in the blank in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 1E</figref>. The ring recess <b>26</b> receives excess material <b>28</b> of the shaft part <b>14</b> which arises during the manufacture of the ribs providing security against rotation, i.e. the excess material <b>28</b> is located within the ring-like recess <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method for the manufacture of the self-piercing press-in nut in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> is carried out in such a way that one first takes a blank <b>2</b> in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> having a cross-sectional shape corresponding to that the flange part <b>12</b> and the shaft part <b>14</b> or manufactures it by cold heading. The blank <b>2</b> is so designed that the shaft part <b>14</b> has a diameter D<b>2</b> in the region of the free end but a larger diameter D<b>2</b>&#x2032; in a region adjacent to the flange part which extends over the length L of the desired features <b>24</b> providing security against rotation. Then (or previously) the axial recess <b>26</b> is formed in the flange part <b>12</b> adjacent to the shaft part <b>14</b> and material is subsequently axially scraped away from the region of the shaft part with the larger diameter D<b>2</b>&#x2032; at a plurality of peripherally spaced apart positions, with the scraped away material <b>28</b> being brought partly into the axial recess <b>26</b> of the flange part <b>12</b>. In the regions between the scraped away regions the noses or ribs remain which form features <b>24</b> providing security against rotation of the element. The diameter D<b>2</b>&#x2032; of the region of the shaft part with a somewhat larger diameter (larger than D<b>2</b>) must not be so large as D<b>2</b> plus twice the radial height of ribs <b>24</b> providing security against rotation but can rather be made somewhat smaller (but larger than D<b>2</b>) with the ribs providing security against rotation then partly being formed from the material displaced between the ribs and thus achieving the full radial height.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As is evident the features <b>24</b> providing security against rotation which are formed by the noses or ribs extend in the axial direction <b>32</b> of the shaft part <b>14</b> along the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The self-piercing hollow nut element is so designed that, for an M6 nut element the diameter D<b>2</b> is approximately 15 mm, for an M8 nut element the diameter D<b>2</b> is approximately 16 mm, for an M10 nut element the diameter D<b>2</b> is approximately 17 mm, for an M12 nut element the diameter D<b>2</b> is approximately 18 mm and for an M14 nut element the diameter D<b>2</b> is approximately 19.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">These values for the diameter D<b>2</b> apply particularly for use with a sheet metal part of steel of moderate strength of 280 to 320 MPa and a thickness of about 8 mm. For higher sheet metal strengths, the diameters given must be made correspondingly larger. The same applies for sheet metal thicknesses greater than 8 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">One can also consider the self-piercing nut element <b>10</b> in accordance with the invention for attachment with the sheet metal part in such a way that there are no features of shape formed as an undercut which are designed to accommodate sheet metal material in order to achieve an axial press-out resistance. Instead of this the transition from the sheet metal contact surface <b>22</b> of ring shape into the piercing section <b>14</b> can be regarded as a sharp right angle if one ignores the ring recess <b>26</b> and the material <b>28</b> hidden therein which in any event are not disturbing because they are set back relative to the sheet metal contact surface <b>22</b> of the shape.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The method for the attachment of the self-piercing press-in nut in accordance with the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> to the sheet metal part <b>40</b> will now be described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2E</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows the starting situation in which the press-in nut <b>10</b> is held with its flange part in the mount <b>41</b> of a plunger <b>42</b> of a piercing head <b>43</b> which for example is attached to the upper tool of a press (not shown). Beneath the sheet metal part <b>40</b> there is located a die button <b>44</b> which, for example, can be supported at the lower tool of a press or at an intermediate plate of the press. If the die button <b>44</b> is attached to the lower tool of the press and if an intermediate plate is present, then the piercing head can be attached to the intermediate plate instead of to the upper tool of the press.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should also be pointed out that it would also be possible to attach the die button to the intermediate plate of the press and the plunger in the upper tool of the press or to attach the plunger to the lower tool of the press and to mount the die button above the plunger at the upper tool of the press or at the intermediate plate of the press. The plunger could also be attached to the intermediate plate of the press and the die button to the upper tool of the press. Furthermore the possibility exists of mounting the die button and the plunger in a so-called C-frame and effecting the piercing of the sheet metal part by corresponding hydraulic loading of the one or other part, i.e. of the die button or of the plunger. The plunger can be formed as a part of a setting and/or piercing head in accordance with EP-B-755 749.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As can also be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> the sheet metal part <b>10</b> is clamped in the press between the die button <b>44</b> in the lower tool of the press and the plunger of the piercing head in the upper tool of the press or in the intermediate plate of the press, initially between the free end face <b>16</b> of the shaft part <b>14</b> of the press-in nut <b>10</b> and the ring nose <b>46</b> of the upper side <b>48</b> of the die button. Not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, but entirely customary, is be the provision of a hold-down member, for example of a right-cylindrical hold-down member which is arranged around the plunger <b>42</b> and is pressed by spring-pressure against the sheet metal part <b>40</b> and holds the sheet metal part against the ring nose <b>46</b> of the die button <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The die button <b>44</b> has a bore <b>52</b> having a diameter which is somewhat larger than the diameter D<b>2</b> of the piercing section <b>14</b>. On closing of the press the piercing section is pushed through the sheet metal part <b>40</b> and a piercing slug <b>50</b> arises which is pressed through the bore <b>52</b>, <b>52</b>&#x2032; of the die button and disposed off. Since the diameter D<b>3</b> of the bore <b>52</b> of the die button in the region of the end face <b>48</b> of the die button <b>44</b> is significantly larger than the diameter D<b>2</b> a conical opening or hole <b>58</b> arises in the sheet metal part which diverges in the axial direction <b>32</b> starting from the punching in side. The conicity which corresponds for example to an included cone angle arranged from 4 to 15&#xb0;, preferably about 7&#xb0; is determined by the ratio of the diameter D<b>3</b> to D<b>2</b> and the respective sheet metal thickness. The bore <b>52</b>, <b>52</b>&#x2032; of the die button <b>44</b> is preferably designed as a stepped bore with a lower region <b>52</b>&#x2032; being of larger diameter in comparison to the upper region with reference numeral <b>52</b>. In this way it is ensured that the piercing slug falls through the bore <b>52</b>&#x2032; and is thus easy to disposal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The shaft part <b>14</b> of the fastener element <b>10</b> is pressed through the upper cylindrical region <b>56</b> of the piercing hole <b>58</b> which simultaneously corresponds to an upper region of the shaft part, until the ring-like sheet metal contact surface or sheet metal contact shoulder <b>22</b> of the flange part <b>12</b> contacts the upper side <b>55</b> of the sheet metal part in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> and the features providing security against rotation or the noses <b>24</b> providing security against rotation have been pressed into the upper cylindrical region <b>56</b> of the pierced hole <b>58</b> of the sheet metal part.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">One notes from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> that the sharp-edged transition <b>55</b> from the sheet metal contact surface <b>22</b> into the piercing section <b>14</b> ensures that the sheet metal contact surface <b>22</b> sits fully on the top side <b>54</b> of the sheet metal part whereby settling effects in operation need not be feared (provided that the ring-like sheet metal contact surface <b>22</b> is made adequately large).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">On closing of the press the fastener element is so moved in a position above the sheet metal part <b>40</b> that the shaft part <b>14</b> of the fastener element moves through the hole <b>58</b> that arises until the ring nose <b>56</b> of the die button has formed a ring groove <b>60</b> in the lower side <b>62</b> of the sheet metal part <b>40</b> around the pierced hole <b>58</b>. In this way the sheet metal material is forced to flow radially inwardly and it comes in a second region <b>64</b> adjacent to the free end of the piercing section to the above-mentioned intimate contact of the sheet metal material and to the stranglehold with the lower region of the piercing section <b>14</b>. Between the first region <b>56</b> and the second region <b>64</b> in which the sheet metal material closely contacts the piercing section or the shaft part <b>14</b> there is a third region <b>66</b> where the hole wall of the sheet metal part has a spacing from the shaft part <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The press (or the possibly used C-frame) delivers the required force in order to press the noses <b>24</b> providing security against rotation through the side wall <b>58</b> of the hole, whereby grooves extending in the axial direction are formed in the cylindrical region <b>56</b> of the side wall of the pierced hole <b>58</b> by the noses <b>24</b> providing security against rotation and also delivers the force which is required in order to form the ring groove <b>60</b> and to reshape the sheet metal material in the second region <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">One notes apart from this that the shaft part <b>14</b> is located in this thick sheet metal part within the pierced hole <b>58</b> in the sheet metal part, with the end face <b>16</b> or the end side of the free end of the piercing section <b>14</b> having a pronounced spacing from the lower side <b>62</b> of the sheet metal part. This spacing is also evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> as is the fact that the hole wall of the sheet metal material in the region of the piercing edge <b>18</b> projects cylindrically beyond the piercing edge <b>18</b>. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> also shows how the flange part <b>12</b> of the press-in nut lies fully against an upper side <b>54</b> of the sheet metal part <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3D</figref> correspond largely to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2C</figref> to <b>2</b>E respectively but show that the same element <b>10</b> can also be used with a somewhat thinner thick sheet metal part. The series of drawings <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>D has no drawing corresponding to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> because <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> actually applies for two sheet metal thicknesses. The series of drawings <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>D is however otherwise largely identical to the series of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2E</figref> which is why the same reference numerals have been used for the individual components. The same description also applies for the figures of the series of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3D</figref> and will therefore not be repeated. The only important differences lies in the fact that the spacing between the free end <b>16</b> of the piercing part <b>14</b> and the sheet metal underside is likewise smaller as a result of the smaller sheet metal thickness. This has the consequence that the base <b>70</b> of the ring groove <b>60</b> lies slightly above the piercing edge <b>18</b> of the shaft part <b>14</b>. Here also the end <b>16</b> lies above the lower side <b>62</b> of the sheet metal part <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be briefly mentioned that an adhesive can be inserted between the sheet metal part and the hollow press-in element and indeed between the sheet metal part <b>40</b> and the sheet metal contact surface <b>22</b> and/or between the sheet metal part <b>40</b> and the first region of the shaft part <b>14</b> and/or between the sheet metal part <b>40</b> and the second region of the shaft part <b>14</b> and/or between the sheet metal part <b>40</b> and the third region of the shaft part <b>14</b>. The adhesive can also be used additionally to or instead of the ribs <b>24</b> providing security against rotation and can also make a contribution to the security against press-out.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore it is evident in the drawings that the sheet metal part <b>40</b> lies in one plane at least in the region of the attachment of the fastener element prior to and after attachment of the fastener element apart from the said ring groove <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The press-in element is shown here as a finished nut element <b>10</b> with the internal thread <b>11</b>, i.e. the fastener element <b>10</b> has a hollow shaft part with a central thread <b>11</b> which extends through the flange part <b>12</b> and the shaft part <b>14</b>. The element could however also be formed without a thread and for example serve as a bearing sleeve. It could however also be provided with a smooth bore to accept a holding or cutting screw.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore it should be mentioned that the field of application of the press-in elements claimed here is not restricted to the manufacture of trucks but rather includes all areas where sheet metal parts of corresponding thickness are used which have to be provided with fastener elements.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In all embodiments all materials can be named as an example for the material of the fastener elements which, in the context of cold deformation achieve the strength values of class 8 in accordance to the ISO standard or higher, for example a 35B2 alloy in accordance with DIN 1654. The so formed fastener elements are also suitable for all commercially available steel materials for drawing quality sheet metal parts and also for aluminum or its alloys. Aluminum alloys including those of higher strength can also be used for the fastener elements, for example AlMg<sub>5</sub>. Fastener elements of higher strength magnesium alloys such as for example AM50 can also be considered.</p>
