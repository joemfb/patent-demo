<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. provisional application entitled &#x201c;Useful Electrical Power from Thermally Generated Carrier Pairs&#x201d;, having application Ser. No. 61/381,984, filed Sep. 11, 2010, and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Heat is a readily available source of energy. Heat may be available from ambient sources, such as the atmosphere, flowing water, the sun, or geothermal fluids. Heat may also be a byproduct of a process such as steam-powered electrical generation, or industrial manufacturing, operating semiconductor devices, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, it has been difficult to convert available heat energy into electrical power. For example, heat may be used to generate power using a secondary fluid, such as steam or the like, which drives a generator turbine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Often, such as at electrical power generation stations and industrial manufacturing facilities, heat is considered as a waste byproduct that must be eliminated. When heat is a waste byproduct, for example, the waste heat is dissipated into the atmosphere using cooling towers or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, at least to improve thermal efficiency and perhaps to reduce systems complexity, there is a need in the arts to derive electrical power from available heat.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Systems and methods of direct thermal electric conversion are disclosed. An exemplary embodiment includes at least a first recombination material having a first recombination rate, a second recombination material adjacent to the first recombination material and having a second recombination rate, wherein the second recombination rate is different from the first recombination rate, and a third recombination material adjacent to the second recombination material and having a third recombination rate substantially the same as the first recombination rate. Application of heat generates at least first charge carriers that migrate between the first recombination material and the second recombination material, and generates at least second charge carriers that migrate between the third recombination material and the second recombination material. The second charge carriers are opposite in polarity from the first charge carriers. The migration of the first charge carriers and the migration of the second charge carriers generates an electrical current.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a direct thermal electric converter <b>100</b>. Embodiments of the direct thermal electric converter <b>100</b> are configured to receive heat from a heat source <b>102</b>, and are configured to generate electrical power from the received heat. The electrical power (current and voltage) is deliverable to a load <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the generated electrical power is output in a direct current (DC) form. In other embodiments which include power condition equipment, the generated electrical power may be output in an alternating current (AC) form.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The various semiconductor embodiments are configured to capture the &#x201c;built-in&#x201d; potential (V<sub>D</sub>) of diodes by pitting the depletion regions of different materials against each other. The overall formula for carrier densities in semiconductors is demonstrated in Equation 1.

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In Equation 1, n and p are electron and hole concentrations respectively, C is a material-specific constant, T is temperature (in Kelvins), Eg is the bandgap, and kb is Boltzmann's Constant. At ambient, kb*T is approximately 0.025 eV.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary semiconductor embodiment <b>200</b> of the direct thermal electric converter <b>100</b>. The exemplary semiconductor embodiment <b>200</b> comprises alternating layers of a low recombination material <b>202</b> (interchangeably referred to as a low recombination semiconductor material) and a high recombination material <b>204</b> (interchangeably referred to as a high recombination semiconductor material). The low recombination material <b>202</b> and the high recombination material <b>204</b> join at a heterojunction.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The high recombination material <b>204</b> may be doped with a positive doping material to form a positive doped layer <b>206</b><i>a </i>at one end and adjacent to the heterojunction. The high recombination material <b>204</b> may doped with a negative doping material to form a negative doped layer <b>208</b><i>a </i>at the other end and adjacent to the other heterojunction. Accordingly, a layer of high recombination material <b>204</b> remains that is not doped (and is thus on opposing sides of the positive doped layer <b>206</b><i>a </i>and the negative doped layer <b>208</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The low recombination material <b>202</b> may also be doped with a positive doping material to form a positive doped layer <b>206</b><i>b </i>at one end and adjacent to the heterojunction. The low recombination material <b>202</b> may also be doped with a negative doping material to form a negative doped layer <b>208</b><i>b </i>at the other end and adjacent to the another heterojunction. Accordingly, a layer of low recombination material <b>202</b> remains that is not doped.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the high recombination material <b>204</b> and the low recombination material <b>202</b> are separated by either a positive doped layer <b>206</b><i>a/b </i>or a negative doped layer <b>208</b><i>a/b</i>. Electrons may migrate across the heterojunction through the negative doped layer <b>208</b><i>a/b</i>. Holes may migrate across the heterojunction through the positive doped layer <b>206</b><i>a/b</i>. Electron and/or hole drift, diffusion, and thermionic emission (indicating crossing the heterojunction) may be interchangeably used for the term &#x201c;migrate&#x201d; herein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A positive terminal <b>210</b> and a negative terminal <b>212</b> provide attachment points (a Schottky contact or the like) for delivery of the generated DC electric power. In alternative embodiments, an optional positive doped layer <b>214</b> and/or an optional negative doped layer <b>216</b> may be included at the ends of the low recombination material <b>202</b> and/or the high recombination material <b>204</b>, respectively, to provide an ohmic type contact with the terminals <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Any suitable low recombination material <b>202</b> and high recombination material <b>204</b> may be used. Any suitable doping material type, doping layer depth, and/or impurity concentration may be used in the various embodiments. In some embodiments, different doping materials may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The low recombination material <b>202</b>, the high recombination material <b>204</b>, the positive doped layer <b>206</b><i>a/b</i>, and the negative doped layer <b>208</b><i>a/b </i>are semiconductor type materials wherein the bandgap between the conduction band and the valence band is relatively small (as compared to an insulator type material). In the high recombination material <b>204</b>, electrons and holes may more easily recombine, or may be annihilated, as compared to the low recombination material <b>202</b>. Since the rate at which electrons and holes recombine is inversely proportional to the electron and hole concentrations in the conduction and valence bands, respectively, the low recombination material <b>202</b> has relatively more free electrons and holes at any given temperature as compared to the high recombination material <b>204</b>. Accordingly, there are a relatively greater number of free electrons and holes that are available to migrate from the low recombination material <b>202</b> (as compared to the high recombination material <b>204</b>). Various embodiments may be created using selected materials with relatively high and low recombination rates of interest to achieve desired current and/or voltage in a semiconductor embodiment <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When heat energy is applied or transmitted into the semiconductor materials <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b><i>a/b</i>, and/or <b>208</b><i>a/b</i>, mobile charge carriers (electrons) are able to migrate from their valence band up to their respective conduction band. Once the electron migrates to its conduction band, the electron may readily move to conduction bands of adjacent atoms or molecules. The associated hole created by the electron is also a mobile charge carrier that may readily migrate to adjacent atoms or molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The mobile charge carriers (electron) of the low recombination material <b>202</b> tend to remain in the conduction bands due to the inherent nature of the low recombination material <b>202</b> which tends to resist recombination of the electron and hole pairs. Thus, it is relatively easy for the mobile charge carriers of the low recombination material <b>202</b> to migrate to other conduction bands of adjacent atoms or molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In contrast, the electrons and/or holes that have migrated into the high recombination material <b>204</b> tend to recombine. Electron mobile charge carriers drop out of the conduction bands into available holes of the valence bands due to the inherent nature of the high recombination material <b>204</b> which tends to facilitate recombination of the electrons and/or holes. That is, it is relatively easy for the electrons in the conduction band to recombine with the holes of the valence bands.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The migration of mobile charge carriers (electrons and/or holes) may be directed, guided, limited and/or constrained in a manner that induces (generates) an aggregate electric current flow and an attendant voltage in the semiconductor embodiment <b>200</b> of the direct thermal electric converter <b>100</b>. The current and voltage available at the terminals <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> may then be provided to a load <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a portion <b>214</b> of the semiconductor embodiment <b>200</b> that conceptually illustrates migration of mobile charge carriers (electrons and holes) from the low recombination material <b>202</b> into the positive doped layer <b>206</b><i>a/b</i>, and then the attendant migration of holes from the positive doped layer <b>206</b><i>a/b </i>into the high recombination material <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a portion <b>216</b> of the semiconductor embodiment <b>200</b> conceptually illustrates migration of mobile charge carriers (electrons and holes) from the low recombination material <b>202</b> into the negative doped layer <b>208</b><i>a/b</i>, and then the attendant migration of electrons from the negative doped layer <b>208</b><i>a/b </i>into the high recombination material <b>204</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Even when two semiconductors are both direct (or indirect), they may still have different recombination rates. Of particular interest are narrow gap direct semiconductors with different effective Densities of States, indicating different recombination rates.

In particular, Lead Sulfide (PbS) and Lead Telluride (PbTe) have a significant differences (for example, a factor of 1.6) at ambient temperature.
