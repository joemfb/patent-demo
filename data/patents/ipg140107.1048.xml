<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A drink bottle with a removable lid includes an inner lid attached to the mouth of the bottle and an outer lid pivotably mounted to said inner lid. A drink spout extends from the inner lid. The outer lid may be latched into a closed position covering the drink spout. A push button can be selectively actuated to release the latched outer lid, permitting the outer lid to open to access the drink spout. The push button moves a lid slide containing a catch extension that engages a catch notch in the outer lid to latch the outer lid closed.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is directed to a drink bottle having an outer lid attached to an inner lid by a hinge, the outer lid held closed by a moveable extension engaging with a notch in the outer lid and openable by actuating a push button that moves the extension out of engagement with the notch, the push button having a push button lock to prevent actuation of either the push button or moveable extension.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Personal beverage bottles are becoming ever more popular and have moved beyond the common beverage bottle packed with a school lunch or in a lunch box. Gyms are filled with members exercising, and many members bring their own beverage bottles for hydration. Hikers, bikers, walkers, commuters, tourists and many others carry beverage bottles as they go on their way. An increasingly common feature of the beverage bottles is a drink nozzle or spout that offers the ability to drink from the bottle without complete removal of the lid from the bottle. Another feature of some drink bottles is a cover for the drink spout or nozzle to keep the spout or nozzle clean between drinking.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides a beverage bottle with a removable lid wherein the lid has an inner lid with a drink spout and an outer lid or cover that is hinged to selectively cover and seal the drink spout. The outer lid may be latched to the inner lid when in the closed positioned. A push button on the inner lid can be operated, when in an unlocked condition (as will be described in further detail below), to release the latched outer lid, permitting the outer lid to open so as to permit drinking from the drink spout. The push button is mounted on a pivot structure and connected on one side to one end of a lid slide. The other end of the lid slide extends to a portion on the inner lid opposite to the hinge and forms a catch extension that engages with a catch notch in the outer lid to hold or latch the outer lid closed. On pressing on one end of the push button towards the radial center of the bottle, the other end of the push button moves away from the radial center of the bottle and pulls the lid slide with it. The catch extension at the end of the lid slide opposite the push button moves out of engagement from the catch notch in the outer lid, thereby permitting the outer lid to open. A push button lock is mated to the lid slide and is configured to selectively lock the lid slide in place, which inhibits the operation of the push button release by removing the user's ability to depress the push button, actuate the lid slide, and/or move the catch extension out of engagement with the catch notch in the outer lid.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, a lid biasing element causes the outer lid to be moved toward the fully open position. The biasing element may be made of a flexible, resilient material that, after being deformed, moves back into its original shape.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment of the invention, the lid slide is biased toward a latching position by a deformable portion of the spout that functions as a biasing element so that the catch extension that holds the outer lid in the closed position protrudes into its engagement position except when a release force is exerted on the push button.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Various embodiments now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and which show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments. However, this invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. The following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Throughout the specification and claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The phrase &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d; does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, although it may. Furthermore, the phrase &#x201c;in another embodiment&#x201d; does not necessarily refer to a different embodiment, although it may. Thus, as described below, various embodiments of the invention may be readily combined without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, as used herein, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is an inclusive &#x201c;or&#x201d; operator, and is equivalent to the term &#x201c;and/or,&#x201d; unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; is not exclusive and allows for being based on additional factors not described, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In addition, throughout the specification, the meaning of &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural references.

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a beverage bottle <b>10</b> includes a bottle body <b>12</b> to which is attached a removable lid <b>14</b>. The bottle body <b>12</b> may be of any suitable material, including metal, plastic, glass, rubber and combinations thereof and may be insulated or un-insulated. In the illustrated embodiment, the bottle body <b>12</b> is formed from a plastic or other polymer material, which produces a flexible and/or squeezable bottle body <b>12</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the bottle body <b>12</b> may be formed of an insulated stainless steel body part on the bottom of which is fastened a plastic or rubber base (not shown). In yet another embodiment, the bottle body <b>12</b> may be of a double-walled construction, between which is an evacuated space, forming a so-called vacuum bottle. The removable lid <b>14</b> of the present invention may be used on a flexible bottle, as illustrated, or on a rigid bottle. The flexible bottle permits the user to squeeze the bottle to force the beverage from the bottle, while the rigid bottle requires the user to draw the liquid out of the bottle through suction or by pouring the liquid from the bottle. As disclosed above, the bottle body <b>12</b> may include a base that provides protection for the bottom of the bottle body <b>12</b> as well as providing a relatively wide surface on which the beverage bottle <b>10</b> is rested when standing. The base may be constructed of a plastic material, such as polypropylene, although other materials are of course possible. The bottle body <b>12</b> may have a smooth or contoured surface that may be provided with patterns, such as by printing, painting, embossing or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The removable lid <b>14</b> may be secured to a mouth (not shown) of the bottle body <b>12</b> by a threaded connection, as disclosed in the illustrated embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>9</b>. Threads are formed about the mouth (not shown) of the bottle body <b>12</b> and complimentary threads <b>15</b> are formed within the removable lid <b>14</b> so that the lid <b>14</b> may be threadably attached to and detached from the bottle body <b>12</b>. The bottle body <b>12</b> may be a narrow-mouth bottle or a wide-mouth bottle. The removable lid <b>14</b> depicted in the drawing figures is configured to be used on a wide-mouth bottle. While the above embodiment discloses threaded structures used to attach the lid <b>14</b> to the bottle body <b>12</b>, it should not be read to limit the manner in which the lid <b>14</b> may be attached to the bottle body <b>12</b>. Accordingly, in alternate embodiments, the lid <b>14</b> may be attached to the bottle body <b>12</b> by alternate attaching or fastening structures, such as a snap-on lid that fits onto a rim on the bottle, a bayonet attachment, or other lid attachment structures.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in one embodiment, the removable lid <b>14</b> includes: an outer lid <b>16</b>; an inner lid <b>18</b>; a lid slide <b>20</b> disposed within the inner lid <b>18</b>; a push button <b>22</b> connected to the lid slide <b>20</b> for selectively actuating the lid slide <b>20</b>; a push button lock <b>24</b> connected to the lid slide <b>20</b> for selectively locking the push button <b>22</b> to prevent it from being depressed and to prevent the lid slide <b>20</b> from being actuated; and a hinge <b>26</b> that connects the outer lid <b>16</b> to the inner lid <b>18</b>. The removable lid <b>14</b> further includes a flexible drink spout <b>28</b> that has a gasket <b>30</b> disposed at a lower end thereof, the drink spout <b>28</b> extending through the inner lid <b>18</b> such that the gasket <b>30</b> is located internal to the inner lid <b>18</b>. A handle <b>32</b> may be attached to the inner lid <b>18</b> and/or the outer lid <b>16</b> to provide a convenient method of carrying the bottle <b>10</b> or attaching the bottle <b>10</b> to a backpack, gym bag or the like. In one embodiment, the handle <b>32</b> is attached about the outer ends of the hinge <b>26</b>, thus permitting the handle <b>32</b> to be a hinged handle. The handle <b>32</b> and outer lid <b>16</b> share the hinge <b>26</b> so that only one hinge pin need be provided for both elements.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the inner lid <b>18</b> may be comprised of an upper cover <b>34</b> and a lower cover <b>36</b>. The upper cover <b>34</b> may take many different configurations. In one embodiment, the upper cover <b>34</b> is primarily shaped as an upside down cup, having a substantially closed top surface <b>38</b>, except for a spout opening <b>40</b> disposed therein, and a cylindrical sidewall <b>42</b> extending downward from an outer perimeter thereof. The top surface <b>38</b> of the upper cover <b>34</b> has a decreased diameter, such that a recessed outer peripheral edge <b>44</b> is formed around all, or part, of the outer circumference of the top surface <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A catch extension opening <b>48</b> is formed in an upper portion of the cylindrical side wall <b>42</b> that is perpendicular and adjacent to the recessed outer edge <b>44</b> of the upper cover <b>38</b>. Also disposed in the cylindrical sidewall <b>42</b>, located radially opposite to the catch extension opening <b>48</b>, is a push button opening <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), which is surrounded at its perimeter by a push button frame <b>52</b>. The push button frame <b>52</b> serves to aid in properly seating and containing the push button <b>22</b> when the removable lid <b>14</b> is assembled and protects the button, for example if the bottle is dropped or bumped against an object.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, the lower cover <b>36</b> of inner lid <b>18</b> is located internal to the upper cover <b>34</b>, such that a perimeter of an upper surface <b>56</b> of the lower cover <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is seated against and/or mated to the internal bottom surface <b>58</b> of the recessed edge <b>44</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>), which acts as a stand-off, so as to form a lid slide compartment between the upper cover <b>34</b> and the lower cover <b>36</b>. This lid slide compartment has the catch extension opening <b>48</b> disposed in the sidewall <b>42</b> at one side of the compartment and the push button opening <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) disposed in the sidewall <b>42</b> at the opposite side. The lower cover <b>36</b> includes a lower cover protrusion <b>60</b> that extends upward from the upper surface <b>56</b> of the lower cover <b>36</b> and resides inside the compartment between the upper cover <b>34</b> and the lower cover <b>36</b>. The lower cover <b>36</b> also includes a lower cover spout opening <b>62</b> that is aligned with the spout opening <b>40</b> in the upper cover <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The lid slide <b>20</b> is a slider mechanism that is responsible for keeping the outer lid <b>16</b> latched closed when the lid is placed in the closed position. The lid slide <b>20</b> is located within the lid slide compartment formed between the mated upper and lower covers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, and slidably engages with both the push button opening <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and the catch extension opening <b>48</b> disposed in the upper cover <b>34</b>. One end of the lid slide <b>20</b> contains a catch extension <b>64</b> that slidably engages with the catch extension opening <b>48</b>. The opposite end of the lid slide <b>20</b> contains a push button engagement extension <b>66</b> that slidably engages with the push button opening <b>50</b>. Further disposed in the lid slide <b>20</b> is a lid slide spout opening <b>68</b>, that is generally aligned with the spout openings <b>40</b> and <b>62</b> in both the upper and lower covers <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, and includes a biasing edge <b>69</b> protruding inward into the spout opening <b>68</b>. The lid slide <b>20</b> further includes a bottom recess <b>73</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) disposed in a bottom surface of the lid slide <b>20</b> that provides clearance for, and covers, the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b> that, when assembled, extends upward from the upper surface <b>56</b> of the lower cover <b>36</b> and into the lid slide compartment. The lid slide's bottom recess <b>73</b> allows the lid slide <b>20</b> to slide over the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b> within the slide compartment without making contact with the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b>. The lid slide <b>20</b> further includes a lock hinge pin <b>70</b> disposed in a cylindrical recess <b>72</b> located in an upper surface of the lid slide <b>20</b>. The lock hinge pin <b>70</b> permits the lid slide <b>20</b> to hingeably mate with the push button lock <b>24</b>. The lid slide also includes a top recess <b>74</b> disposed in a top surface of the lid slide <b>20</b>, into which the push button lock <b>24</b> will be seated when mated thereto, such that the top surface of the push button lock <b>24</b> does not protrude much higher, if at all, above the top surface of the lid slide <b>20</b>. This will help to ensure that the lid slide <b>20</b> and mated push button lock <b>24</b> will have a consistently smooth sliding action within the lid slide compartment. The lid slide further includes a lock protrusion opening <b>75</b> that creates a passage between the bottom recess <b>73</b> and the top recess <b>74</b> of the lid slide <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The push button <b>22</b> is a button that is used to actuate the lid slide <b>20</b> to open the outer lid <b>16</b>. The push button <b>22</b> includes a pivot connection <b>76</b> that holds the push button <b>22</b> within the push button frame <b>52</b> by a pivot pin <b>78</b> that is slidably engaged through complimentary holes located in both the frame and pivot connection <b>76</b>. Pivot connection <b>76</b> and mated pivot pin <b>78</b> divide the push button <b>22</b> into an upper end <b>80</b> and a lower end <b>82</b> thereby allowing a rotational rocking movement of the push button <b>22</b> around the pivot connection <b>76</b>. In this manner, the push button <b>22</b> acts as a lever. A slide engagement extension <b>84</b> extends from the upper end <b>80</b> of the push button <b>22</b> and engages with the push button engagement extension <b>66</b> located at the end of the lid slide <b>20</b>. With the slide engagement extension <b>84</b> mated with the push button engagement extension <b>66</b> of the lid slide <b>20</b>, the push button <b>22</b> can pivot about the pivot connection <b>76</b> to pull on the push button engagement extension <b>66</b> of the lid slide <b>20</b>, thereby slidably actuating the lid slide <b>20</b>, as well as the extension and retraction of the catch extension <b>64</b> from within the catch extension opening <b>48</b> located at the opposite end of the lid slide <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref>, in one embodiment, the push button lock <b>24</b> is a locking lever that serves to place the push button <b>22</b> and the lid slide <b>20</b> in either a locked or unlocked condition. The locked condition prevents the push button <b>22</b> from being depressed and the catch extension <b>64</b> at the end of the lid slide <b>20</b> from retracting back into the catch extension opening <b>48</b> in the upper cover. The unlocked condition permits a user to depress the push button <b>22</b>, thereby actuating the lid slide <b>20</b>, and retracting the catch extension <b>64</b> back into the catch extension opening <b>48</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the push button lock <b>24</b> has a knurled thumb switch <b>86</b>, a lever arm <b>88</b> connected at one end to the thumb switch, a lock hinge cylinder <b>90</b> connected to the opposite second end of the lever arm <b>88</b>, and a push button lock protrusion <b>92</b> disposed on the lever arm between the thumb switch and hinge cylinder and extending downward from the lever arm <b>88</b>. The push button lock <b>24</b> is mated to the lid slide <b>20</b> by the insertion of the lock hinge cylinder <b>90</b> over the lock hinge pin <b>70</b> disposed on the lid slide <b>20</b>, and the insertion of the lock protrusion <b>92</b> into the lock protrusion opening <b>75</b> in the lid slide <b>20</b> (see FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>10</b>, the flexible drink spout <b>28</b> is the spout through which a user accesses and removes fluids held in the assembled beverage bottle <b>10</b>. The spout <b>28</b> is formed from a pliable material, such as a food-grade silicon rubber that flexes and bends readily. The flexible drink spout <b>28</b> may be comprised of a short drinking tube that extends from an open top end, or mouth <b>94</b>, which mouth is located external to the inner lid <b>18</b>, through the spout openings <b>40</b>, <b>62</b>, and <b>68</b> in each of the upper cover <b>34</b>, lid slide <b>20</b>, and lower cover <b>36</b>, and is connected at a bottom open end <b>96</b> to the gasket <b>30</b>. The gasket <b>30</b> is thus located internal to the inner lid <b>18</b> and is seated against a bottom surface the lower cover <b>36</b>. The diameter of the gasket <b>30</b> is approximately the same as that of the lower cover <b>36</b> and is otherwise configured to be large enough to cover the mouth of the bottle body <b>12</b> to which the removable lid <b>14</b> will be attached. The drink spout <b>28</b> provides user access to the fluid or beverage held within the interior of body bottle <b>12</b>, when the bottle <b>10</b> is fully assembled</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As disclosed previously, the inner lid may further include threads <b>15</b> formed within or on the lower interior surface of the sidewall <b>42</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, for mating with complimentary threads (not shown) disposed about the mouth of the bottle body <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>, the removable lid <b>14</b> may also optionally include a drink counter that is comprised of a rotating dial <b>98</b> disposed on the exterior surface of the open bottom end of the sidewall <b>42</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b>. The dial <b>98</b> includes a plurality of sequential numbers <b>100</b>, beginning with the number &#x201c;1&#x201d;, disposed thereon. Adjacent to the rotating dial <b>98</b> and disposed on or in the outer surface of the sidewall <b>42</b> is a dial indicator <b>102</b>, such as a raised or recessed dot, hash mark, or arrow. In alternate embodiments, the dial indicator <b>102</b> can also be a marking made with ink, paint, or other applied markings, or any combination of raised protrusions, recesses, or markings. The rotating dial can be rotated such that each number will sequentially align with the dial indicator. The dial is intended to allow users of the bottle <b>10</b> to keep track of the number of bottles of fluid they have drank in a given time period, such as the number of bottles of water a user has drank during a given day. However, it is to be understood that alternate configurations of the drink dial are contemplated as being within the scope of this disclosure, such as a drink dial containing markings permitting a user to track the total number of ounces, or other fluid volume measurements, consumed. Further still, in additional alternate embodiments of the inner lid <b>18</b> a rotating dial and complimentary indicator, as disclosed above, is not present. Rather, in alternate embodiments the inner lid <b>18</b> does not include any drink counter of any type.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>10</b>, the outer lid <b>16</b>, similar to the inner lid <b>18</b>, is generally cup-shaped and has a closed top end and generally cylindrical sidewall(s) extending downward therefrom, ending in the substantially open circumferential lower edge <b>46</b> that mates with the recessed edge <b>44</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b>, when the lid is in a closed position. The outer lid <b>16</b> further includes a pair of outer lid hinge tabs <b>104</b> disposed on the outer surface of the outer lid <b>16</b> and a lid biasing element retention hook <b>106</b> extending from an inner surface of the outer lid <b>16</b>. Complimentary to the lid hinge tabs <b>104</b> is an inner lid hinge barrel <b>108</b> that is integrally connected to the top surface <b>38</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b>. The lid hinge tabs <b>104</b> are positioned on either side of hinge barrel <b>108</b> and a hinge pin <b>110</b> is disposed through a center pin hole in the hinge tabs <b>104</b> and the mated hinge barrel <b>108</b> to form the lid hinge <b>26</b>. In one embodiment, a &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped handle <b>32</b> having handle hinge barrels disposed at each end of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shape is positioned such that the handle hinge barrels are generally located on the outsides of the lid hinge tabs <b>104</b>. A hinge pin <b>110</b> is inserted through the handle hinge barrels, the lid hinge tabs <b>104</b>, and the hinge barrel <b>108</b>, so as to form the hinge <b>26</b> for the lid, as well as a hinged handle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the outer lid further includes a spout seal <b>118</b> for sealing the open mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b> when the outer lid <b>16</b> is in a closed position. The shape of the spout seal <b>118</b> is complimentary to the shape of the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>30</b>, such that when the outer lid <b>16</b> is closed, the spout seal <b>118</b> mates with the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b> is circular in shape and the spout seal <b>118</b> is in the form of a complimentary-shaped raised circular ring that extends or protrudes from the inner top surface of the outer lid <b>16</b> and has an outer side wall that is tapered from the base of the protruding ring toward the center of the ring. The taper permits the protruding end of the spout seal <b>118</b> to be guided inside of the mouth of the spout <b>28</b> when the outer lid <b>16</b> is closed, while the tapered sides of the spout seal <b>118</b> apply a force sufficient to provide a liquid tight seal against the internal edges of mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b>, when the spout seal <b>118</b> is fully seated upon closing of the outer lid <b>16</b>. The compression forces applied to the lid by the spout may cause the lid to open when the latch is released. In addition, the outer lid <b>16</b> includes a catch notch <b>120</b> that is disposed on the interior surface of the circumferential lower edge <b>46</b> near the bottom of the outer lid <b>16</b>. Lastly, the outer lid <b>16</b> may also include structures (not shown) to help guide the spout <b>28</b> such that it will be properly seated against or around the spout seal <b>118</b> when closing the outer lid <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, the removable lid <b>14</b> further includes a lid biasing element <b>112</b> that is disposed around the biasing element retention hook <b>106</b> on the interior of the outer lid <b>16</b>, passes through a pair of outer lid slots <b>114</b> disposed in the outer lid <b>16</b> between the hinge tabs <b>104</b>, passes between each end of the hinge pin <b>110</b> and the top surface <b>38</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b>, and is retained in a biasing element retention slot <b>116</b> disposed at the base of the hinge barrel <b>108</b> on the inner lid <b>18</b>. In its free state, lid biasing element <b>112</b> takes the shape of an O-ring and is made of a flexible material that is resilient, such as rubber or silicone, and biases the outer lid <b>16</b> toward the fully open position by exerting tension forces on both the retention hook <b>106</b> from the outer lid <b>16</b> and the retention slot <b>116</b> from the inner lid <b>18</b>. When the outer lid <b>16</b> is in the closed position, the lid biasing element <b>112</b> is stretched and bent almost 180-degrees back on itself as it extends from the biasing element retention slot <b>116</b> and around the ends of the hinge pin <b>110</b> to connect with biasing element retention hook <b>106</b>. Since lid biasing element <b>112</b> is stretched, it exerts tension forces that cause the outer lid <b>16</b> to move toward the open position and to be retained there when the outer lid <b>16</b> is unlatched and free to move about the hinge <b>26</b>. In alternate embodiments, the lid biasing element <b>112</b> may be made of other suitable materials and have other configurations that provide similar functionality. The biasing element <b>112</b> may provide the primary force for moving the outer lid <b>16</b> to the fully open position, or the outer lid <b>16</b> may be moved toward the fully open position by the user and retained there by the biasing element <b>112</b>. The force of the biasing element <b>112</b> on the outer lid <b>16</b> may be easily overcome by the user in order to move the outer lid <b>16</b> to the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, to assemble the removable lid <b>14</b> the push button lock <b>24</b> is mated with the lid slide <b>20</b> by inserting the lock protrusion <b>92</b> on push button lock <b>24</b> into the lock protrusion opening <b>75</b> in the lid slide <b>20</b>, and mating the lock hinge cylinder <b>90</b> of the push button lock <b>24</b> with the lock hinge pin <b>70</b> on the lid slide <b>20</b>. When these two components are mated, the lock protrusion <b>92</b> protrudes downward through the protrusion opening <b>75</b> in the lid slide <b>20</b> and into the bottom recess <b>73</b> of the lid slide <b>20</b>. Next, the push button <b>22</b> is mated with the lid slide <b>20</b> by engaging the slide engagement extension <b>84</b> on the push button <b>22</b> with the push button engagement extension <b>66</b> at the end of the lid slide <b>20</b>. The assembled lid slide <b>20</b>, push button lock <b>24</b>, and push button <b>22</b> are then assembled into the upper cover <b>34</b>, by inserting the end of the lid slide <b>20</b> with the catch extension <b>64</b> into the push button opening in the sidewall <b>42</b> of the upper cover <b>34</b> until the catch extension protrudes through the catch extension opening <b>48</b> and the push button is fully seated into the push button frame <b>52</b>. The pivot pin <b>78</b> is then inserted through the push button frame <b>52</b> in the upper cover <b>34</b> and the push button <b>22</b> to hingeably connect them together and prevent the removal of the push button <b>22</b>, lid slide <b>20</b>, and push button lock <b>24</b>. In this condition, the spout openings <b>40</b> and <b>68</b> in both the lid slide <b>20</b> and the upper cover <b>34</b> are aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring Further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>, the lower cover <b>36</b> is next inserted into the upper cover <b>34</b> from the open bottom end of the upper over 34 such that (1) the lower cover spout opening <b>62</b> is aligned with the spout openings <b>68</b> and <b>40</b> in both the lid slide <b>20</b> and the upper cover <b>34</b>, and (2) the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b> is directed upward and protrudes into the bottom recess <b>73</b> of the lid slide <b>20</b>. Accordingly, both the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b> and the push button lock protrusion <b>92</b> now reside in the space defined by the bottom recess <b>73</b> in the lid slide <b>20</b>. Depending on the positioning of the push button lock <b>24</b>, the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b> may selectively interfere with the free linear movement of the push button lock protrusion <b>92</b> when attempting to depress the push button to slidably actuate the lid slide <b>20</b>. The lower cover <b>36</b> is further seated in place such that a perimeter of the upper surface <b>56</b> of the lower cover <b>36</b> is seated against and/or mated to the internal bottom surface <b>58</b> of the recessed edge <b>44</b> of the upper cover <b>34</b>. The properly seated lower cover <b>36</b> may be permanently affixed to the upper cover <b>34</b> by, for example, sonic welding the lower cover <b>36</b> to the upper cover <b>34</b>, or other such known techniques. Various seals may also be used to prevent liquids from passing between the various components that form the inner lid <b>18</b>. In alternate embodiments, the lower cover <b>36</b>, gasket <b>30</b>, and spout <b>28</b> may be manufactured so as to form a single-piece lower cover <b>36</b>. The spout can be installed now or later as described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> and <b>7</b>, the handle <b>32</b> may be optionally mated to the outer lid <b>16</b> so that integral guide pins at the ends of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped handle are seated inside the hinge tabs <b>104</b> of the outer lid <b>16</b>. The outer lid hinge tabs <b>104</b> are next aligned with each end of the inner lid hinge barrel <b>108</b>. The lid biasing element <b>112</b> is inserted into the biasing element retention slot <b>116</b> at the base of the inner lid hinge barrel <b>108</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b>, through the outer lid slots <b>114</b>, and stretched over the biasing element retention hook <b>106</b> in the outer lid <b>16</b>. The lid hinge pin <b>110</b> is then inserted into the aligned hinge components, such that the biasing element <b>112</b> passes between the hinge pin <b>110</b> and the top surface <b>38</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b>. The rotating dial is also snapped in place at the bottom of the inner lid <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Lastly, the combined spout <b>28</b> and gasket <b>30</b> are installed in one of two ways. In a first way, the disk-shaped gasket <b>30</b> is folded or rolled and is stuffed from above through the spout openings <b>40</b>, <b>68</b>, and <b>62</b> in the upper cover, lid slide, and lower cover respectively. Once the gasket <b>30</b> is through the spout openings, it is pulled to seat the spout <b>28</b> in place and the gasket <b>30</b> is flattened within the inner lid so that it is seated against the lower cover <b>36</b> to form a seal over the mouth of the bottle. In a second way, the spout <b>28</b> is inserted from the open bottom end of the inner lid <b>18</b> upwards through the spout openings <b>62</b>, <b>68</b>, and <b>40</b> of each of the lower cover <b>36</b>, the lid slide <b>20</b>, and the upper cover <b>34</b>, until the gasket <b>30</b> is properly seated against the bottom surface of the lower cover <b>36</b> and the spout <b>28</b> fully extends through the spout opening <b>40</b> in the upper cover <b>34</b>. With the removable lid fully assembled, a user may proceed to use the bottle <b>10</b>. While the above disclosure provides for various steps to assemble the removable lid <b>14</b> and bottle <b>10</b>, it should be understood the various assembly steps may be performed in a different order than those disclosed above, or fewer or additional assembly steps may be performed, depending on the specific configuration of the removable lid and bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In operation, the bottle functions as follows. In one embodiment, with the removable lid <b>14</b> in a closed position, the user removes the removable lid <b>14</b> from the bottle body <b>12</b>, for example, by unscrewing the threads <b>15</b> on the inner surface of the sidewall <b>42</b> of the lid <b>14</b> from the threads disposed on the outer surface of the bottle neck (not shown). After the user fills the bottle with the chosen beverage, the lid <b>14</b> is re-attached to the bottle body <b>12</b>. When the removable lid <b>14</b> is attached to the bottle body <b>12</b>, the gasket <b>52</b> covers the mouth of the bottle body <b>12</b> and is sandwiched between the top surface of the mouth of the bottle and the bottom surface of the lower cover <b>36</b> of the removable lid <b>14</b> with sufficient force to provide a liquid tight seal between the mouth of the bottle and the gasket <b>30</b>. This liquid tight seal prevents fluid from leaking out of the assembled beverage bottle <b>10</b> at the mating surfaces of the bottle body <b>12</b> and removable lid <b>14</b>, and only permits fluid to exit the assembled bottle <b>10</b> through the spout <b>28</b> when the outer lid <b>16</b> is in an open position.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when the outer lid <b>16</b> is in a closed position, a circumferential lower edge <b>46</b> of the outer lid <b>16</b> mates with the recessed edge <b>44</b> on the upper cover <b>34</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b> so as to shield the top surface <b>38</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b> from dirt and contamination and to enclose the spout <b>28</b> within the interior of the outer lid <b>16</b>. Furthermore, in the closed position the outer lid <b>16</b> seals the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b> by mating the spout seal <b>118</b> into and against the open mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b>. When the spout seal <b>118</b> and mouth <b>94</b> of the spout are mated, the inner surface of the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>30</b> is stretched slightly around the tapered outer surface of the mated spout seal <b>118</b>. This ensures that when the outer lid <b>16</b> is closed, there is sufficient force between the tapered outer surface of the spout seal <b>118</b> and the inner surface of the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b> to form a liquid tight seal with the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b>, thus preventing any liquid from escaping from within the bottle <b>10</b> while the outer lid <b>16</b> is closed. The outer lid is kept in the closed position over the inner lid <b>18</b> by the engagement of the catch extension <b>64</b>, which is located at the end of the lid slide <b>20</b> and generally protrudes from the catch extension opening <b>48</b> in the inner lid <b>18</b>, with the catch notch <b>120</b> disposed in the outer lid <b>16</b>. While the illustrated embodiments show a notch in the outer lid and an extension on the end of the lid slide, in alternative embodiments, alternative structures may be utilized for maintaining the lid in a closed position, such as reversing the locations of the notch and extension, or use of other mechanical or magnetic locking mechanisms and features.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>7</b>-<b>9</b>, to open the removable lid <b>14</b> and gain access to the beverage contained in the bottle <b>10</b>, the push button lock <b>24</b> must first be placed into an unlocked position, which in one embodiment corresponds to the thumb switch <b>86</b> being rotated to the left side of the push button <b>22</b> above the icon depicting an unlocked padlock <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). This in turn rotates the lever arm <b>88</b> of the push button lock <b>24</b> clockwise (when viewed from in a top-down view) and moves the attached push button lock protrusion <b>92</b> out of alignment with the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b>, so that when the lid slide is actuated, the push button lock protrusion will slide with the lid slide <b>20</b> without making contact with the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) that remains stationary. With the push button lock <b>24</b> in the unlocked position, the user is able to push on the lower end <b>82</b> of the push button <b>22</b> towards the radial center of the removable lid <b>14</b>. Pushing on the button <b>22</b> rotates the push button <b>22</b> about the pivot connection <b>76</b> and causes the upper end <b>80</b> of the push button <b>22</b>, as well as the slide engagement extension <b>84</b> extending from the upper end <b>80</b> of the push button <b>22</b>, to move radially outward. The slide engagement extension <b>84</b> on the push button <b>22</b> thus pulls on the mated push button engagement extension <b>84</b> at the end of the lid slide <b>20</b> in the same direction. This motion in turn actuates the lid slide <b>20</b>, causing the catch extension <b>64</b> disposed at the opposite end of the lid slide <b>20</b> (1) to slidably be retracted into the inner lid <b>18</b> through the catch extension opening <b>48</b>, and (2) to disengage from the catch notch <b>120</b> in the outer lid <b>16</b>, which releases the outer lid <b>16</b> from the closed and latched position so that it may move to the open position. The removable lid is shown in cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicting the push button <b>22</b> in a depressed condition, the connected lid slide <b>20</b> in the slidably actuated and retracted position, and the outer lid <b>16</b> shown in the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 10</figref>, generally, the catch extension <b>64</b> disposed at an end of the lid slide <b>20</b> extends through and protrudes from the catch extension opening <b>48</b>, except when the push button <b>22</b> is depressed and causes the catch extension <b>64</b> to be pulled into catch opening <b>48</b>. When the push button <b>22</b> is released, the catch extension <b>64</b> is automatically biased back into its previous state/position and again protrudes from within the catch extension opening <b>48</b>. To achieve the automatic return of the catch extension to its protruding position, the flexible spout <b>28</b> that passes through the spout openings <b>62</b>, <b>68</b>, and <b>40</b> in each of the lower cover <b>36</b>, the lid slide <b>20</b>, and the upper cover <b>34</b> acts as a biasing element on the lid slide, forcing the catch extension on the lid slide to protrude from the catch extension opening in the upper cover. The biasing is achieved as a result of the reactionary force from the side wall of the drink spout <b>28</b>, after the sidewall of the spout <b>28</b> is depressed slightly inward toward a center of the spout <b>28</b> by the biasing edge <b>69</b> of the lid slide spout opening <b>68</b>. At all times, the biasing edge <b>69</b>, which is disposed in the lid slide spout opening <b>68</b> nearest the catch extension <b>64</b>, applies a slight force against the sidewall of the flexible drink spout <b>28</b> passing there through, causing the sidewall to indent inward toward the center of the drink spout at the location of the biasing edge <b>69</b>. This in turn causes the sidewall of the spout <b>28</b> to apply a force in the opposite direction, back against the biasing edge <b>69</b> of the lid slide <b>20</b> and toward the catch extension <b>64</b> on the lid slide <b>20</b> and catch extension opening <b>48</b> in the upper cover <b>34</b>. Accordingly, in this manner, the spout <b>28</b> also acts as a biasing mechanism for the outer lid latching mechanism to keep the catch extension <b>64</b> biased to protrude from the catch extension opening <b>48</b> without requiring an additional biasing element. Thus, catch extension <b>64</b> can be moved out of engagement with the catch notch <b>120</b>, but is biased back into its original position by the spout <b>28</b> applying a force on the lid slide <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>7</b>, when the outer lid is in a closed position, the lid biasing element <b>112</b> is stretched around the hinge pin <b>110</b> and is at all times under tension, which is in turned transferred to the biasing element retention slot <b>116</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b> and the biasing element retention hook <b>106</b> of the outer lid <b>16</b>. When the push button is depressed and the catch extension is disengaged from the catch notch in the outer lid, the tension in the lid biasing element <b>112</b>, as applied to both the biasing element retention slot <b>116</b> of the inner lid <b>18</b> and the biasing element retention hook <b>106</b> of the outer lid <b>16</b>, causes the outer lid <b>116</b> to automatically rotate on its own into an open position, where some of the tension in the lid biasing element <b>112</b> is relieved. The outer lid <b>16</b> may be held in this open position by the remaining tension in the lid biasing element <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the outer lid <b>16</b> is in the fully open position, a projection <b>105</b> extending from the back of the biasing element retention hook <b>106</b> on the outer lid <b>16</b> bears against the inner lid hinge barrel <b>108</b> and catches on a ridge <b>107</b> on the hinge barrel <b>108</b> to retain the outer lid <b>16</b> in the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With the outer lid in the open position, the spout seal <b>118</b> in the outer lid <b>16</b> is rotated away from the mouth <b>94</b> of the drink spout <b>28</b> and the drink spout <b>28</b> is open and accessible to the user. The user may drink from the bottle <b>10</b> by tipping the top of the bottle, and accordingly, the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b> toward him, like a drinking glass or typical soda bottle, and sipping the beverage from the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b> as it exits through the spout <b>28</b>. In the case of flexible bottle bodies <b>12</b>, the user may drink from the bottle <b>10</b> by squeezing the bottle body <b>12</b> and forcing the beverage out through the spout <b>28</b> into the user's mouth, or by a combination of both aforementioned techniques. When the user drinks through the drink spout <b>28</b>, the liquid passes from within the bottle body <b>12</b> over the fluid tight gasket <b>30</b>, into the bottom end <b>96</b> of the spout <b>28</b> that is connected to the gasket <b>30</b>, and out the mouth <b>94</b> of the spout <b>28</b>. If the present lid is to be used on a flexible squeeze bottle body <b>12</b> in which the user squeezes the bottle to force the beverage from the drink spout <b>28</b>, as disclosed above, no venting holes are needed. In addition, if the present lid is to be used with rigid bottle configurations, because of the larger diameter of the drink spout <b>28</b> and the ability to sip on one side or edge of the spout <b>28</b>, leaving an air gap between the user's upper lip and the opposite side of the spout, no separate venting hole is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">However, in still alternate embodiments (not depicted), the removal of liquid from the bottle <b>10</b> may cause a negative air pressure within the bottle <b>10</b>, especially for rigid bottle configurations in which the spout may be completely covered by the mouth of a user. In such embodiments, it is contemplated that a vent hole may be optionally provided through the inner lid, through which air may flow into the bottle to prevent the buildup of such negative pressure, thereby making drinking from the bottle easier. Such a vent hole would be sealed off upon closing of the outer lid <b>16</b> to prevent fluid from leaking there through when the outer lid <b>16</b> is in the closed position. In such an embodiment, sealing the vent hole when the outer lid <b>16</b> is closed helps prevent leaking of the liquid from the drink bottle <b>10</b>, for example when the bottle is stored on its side such as when placed into a school locker or gym bag. When the outer lid <b>16</b> is opened, the vent hole is unsealed, permitting the flow of air into the interior of the bottle <b>10</b> when a user drinks from the spout <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref> and <b>7</b>-<b>10</b>, to close the outer lid <b>16</b>, the user rotates the lid about hinge <b>26</b> until the catch notch <b>120</b> in the outer lid <b>16</b> re-engages with the catch extension <b>64</b> protruding through the catch extension opening <b>48</b> in the inner lid <b>18</b>. If the user wants to ensure that the push button <b>22</b> won't be accidentally depressed at an inopportune time, say for example when the bottle is laying on its side while inside a backpack or other bag, he can rotate the push button lock <b>24</b> to a locked position, which in one embodiment corresponds to the thumb switch <b>86</b> being slidably rotated to the right side of the push button <b>22</b> above the icon depicting a locked padlock <b>124</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). This in turn rotates the lever arm <b>88</b> of the push button lock <b>24</b> counterclockwise (when viewed from in a top-down view) and forces the attached push button lock protrusion <b>92</b> to slip behind the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b>, such that the push button lock protrusion <b>92</b> is placed in direct contact with, and in radial alignment with, the stationary lower cover protrusion <b>60</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). With the two protrusions <b>92</b> and <b>60</b> in direct contact and alignment with each other, relative to the sliding direction of the lid slide <b>20</b>, when the user attempts to depress the push button to actuate the lid slide <b>20</b>, the lower cover protrusion <b>60</b> interferes with the sliding movement of the push button lock protrusion <b>92</b> that would otherwise move with the lid slide <b>20</b>, thus preventing any movement or actuation of the lid slide <b>20</b>, and accordingly, any movement of the push button <b>22</b>. Thus, when the push button lock <b>24</b> is in the locked position, it is not possible to either depress the push button <b>22</b> or actuate the lid slide <b>20</b>, and therefore, the catch extension <b>64</b> cannot disengage from the catch notch <b>120</b> and the outer lid <b>16</b> will remain in the closed and latched position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The outer lid <b>16</b> and inner lid <b>18</b> are of polypropylene in one embodiment, but may be made of any number of plastics such as PET, HDPE, LDPE or other polyesters. The release button <b>22</b> may be of polypropylene or another material. As noted above, the drink spout <b>28</b> is made of silicone rubber. Other materials are of course possible and are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Thus, there has been shown and described a drink bottle having a removable lid that has a drinking spout and a lockable cover or outer lid over the drinking spout. Although other modifications and changes may be suggested by those skilled in the art, it is the intention of the inventor to embody within the patent warranted hereon all changes and modifications as reasonably and properly come within the scope of his contribution to the art.</p>
