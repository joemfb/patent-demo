<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device and a method for manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">NAND type flash memories are known as electrically rewritable and highly integrable nonvolatile semiconductor memory devices. Memory transistors of conventional NAND type flash memories have a stacked-gate structure in which a charge accumulation layer (floating gate) and a control gate are stacked via an insulation film. A NAND cell unit is configured by a plurality of memory transistors connected in series in a column direction with adjoining ones sharing their source and drain, and select gate transistors provided at the ends of the column of memory transistors. One end of the NAND cell unit is connected to a bit line, and the other end thereof is connected to a source line. A memory cell array is configured by NAND cell units arranged in a matrix. NAND cell units arranged in a row direction are referred to as a NAND cell block. The gates of select gate transistors arranged in the same row are connected to the same select gate line, and the control gates of memory transistors arranged in the same row constitute a word line. When N memory transistors are connected in series in a NAND cell unit, the number of word lines included in one NAND cell block is N.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Miniaturization of the NAND type flash memories has reduced the gate length and the interval between adjoining transistors, which has brought about various problems described below. For example, these problems are (a) reduction in drain current controllability based on an electric field of the control gate due to increase in parasitic capacitance between adjoining gates, etc., short channel effect (SCE), etc., (b) increase in an interference effect between adjoining gates, (c) increase in a leak current between adjoining electrodes, (d) leaning or collapsing of patterns during fabrication of the gates because of an increasing aspect ratio of the gate electrodes, (e) deterioration of data retention characteristics due to a significant reduction in the number of electrons that can be accumulated in the charge accumulation layer (the number of electrons per bit), etc. Hence, conventional NAND type flash memories have almost reached the physical limit of miniaturization, with a significantly narrowed writing/erasing window of the memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">&#x201c;Three-dimensionally stacked&#x201d; memories, in which memory cell transistors are stacked sterically to form many layers, are considered to be the main method for future integration. Specifically, a structure in which nitride film trap type (SONOS, MONOS) cells are stacked is proposed in many papers, etc. The nitride film trap type cell structure has a merit in that it can be manufactured (stacked) easily, but its major problem is that its erasing characteristic and data retention characteristic are poorer than those of the floating gate type cell because of its nature of trapping electrons in the nitride film.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, the conventional floating gate type memory cell structure for accumulating charges in the floating gate electrode is difficult to manufacture and stack, because it has an EB (Etch Back) structure in which a control gate electrode and an IPD film (Inter-Poly-Dielectric film or inter-gate insulating film) are provided not only over the upper surface of the floating gate electrode but also over the side surfaces thereof for securing a drive power (coupling ratio) of the control gate electrode. Further, according to one method for increasing the coupling ratio in order to widen the writing/erasing window of the memory cells, it is necessary to increase the thickness of the floating gate electrode. However, if the thickness of the floating gate electrode is increased in the EB structure in which the IPD film and the control gate electrode are stacked above the floating gate electrode, the word line is consequently raised upward and the aspect ratio is increased, exposing the problem (d) described above. Therefore, it is not easy to improve the coupling ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Hence, as a cell structure for securing coupling ratio without extreme difficulty of manufacture, other than the stacked gate structure, the following structure has already been proposed. That is, in this structure, each control gate electrode is embedded between floating gates via an inter-gate insulating film such that the control gate electrode extends along the word line direction. This structure secures the coupling ratio by raising the potential of a writing target cell through the control gate electrodes on both sides of the target cell.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, as for these memory cells, simply stacking them means a simple increase in the number of manufacturing steps, and it is hence difficult to reduce the bit cost while ensuring an increase in the cell capacity that is balanced with the cost increase. Simple stacking is effective only by a bit cost shrink ratio=1/the number of stacked layers, i.e., the division by the number of layers, which means that the shrink ratio is small when the number of layers is large, leading to a high bit cost. Therefore, in the cell structure seeking a shrink by stacking, an object from a practical standpoint is to restrict the number of steps and the cost.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When a higher coupling ratio is needed to widen the writing/erasing window of the memory cells MC, it is necessary to increase the thickness of the floating gate.

Therefore, thickening of the floating gate is easy, and the coupling ratio can be increased while the word lines are maintained at a low aspect. This is advantageous for the problem of pattern leaning and collapsing, etc. during fabrication of the gates. As regards the bit cost problem too, because the word lines for the upper cells and lower cells can be manufactured simultaneously as will be shown in the following manufacturing flow, it is possible to reduce the number of steps and to reduce critical lithography steps of which unit process price is high, making it possible to restrict the bit cost. Hence, the structure proposed here is advantageous for the various problems of stacking.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">[Method for Manufacturing Memory Cell Array Structure according to First Embodiment]</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, a method for manufacturing the memory cell array according to the present embodiment will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">First, there are some conceivable variations regarding the formation of a peripheral circuit region. When the formation is on a bulk silicon substrate, it is necessary to form the peripheral circuits first. At this time, it is also possible to simultaneously form the memory cell arrays according to the present embodiment on the bulk silicon substrate. In the present embodiment, the NAND cell units NU<b>1</b> and NU<b>2</b> are provided sterically. Hence, an example of forming NAND cell units NU<b>1</b> and NU<b>2</b> above a silicon substrate will be explained. The method for forming peripheral circuit transistors is the same as an ordinary method. That is, first, a channel is formed above a silicon substrate. Then, gate oxide films (both a Low Voltage oxide film and a High Voltage oxide film) are formed above the silicon substrate. Then, after a gate electrode and a mask material for AA (active area) formation are stacked, an STI trench is formed. Then, after the STI trench is filled, a mask material for GC (gate) formation is stacked, GC electrodes are formed, and a side wall insulating film is formed. After this, a source/drain diffusion layer is formed, an inter-GC insulating film is embedded, and the surface is planarized.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">After the peripheral circuits are formed, the memory cell array according to the present embodiment is formed as their overlying layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> are diagrams showing the method for manufacturing the memory cell array according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an insulating layer <b>30</b>A made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is formed above an unillustrated silicon substrate, and above them, a first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>A made of polysilicon, a first tunnel insulating film (gate insulating film) <b>12</b>A made of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and a first floating gate forming layer <b>13</b>A made of polysilicon are stacked sequentially. The first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>A to become a channel (body) is basically made of polysilicon, but may be made of monocrystal silicon. In the present embodiment, by using polysilicon for the channel (body) so as to form an SOI structure, it becomes unnecessary to form an STI in the silicon substrate, which realizes a cell structure that is more suitable for stacking. Since formation of the tunnel insulating film <b>12</b>A is carried out above the semiconductor layer <b>11</b>A made of polysilicon, it is done by using not a thermally-oxidized film, but a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) or an ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) oxide film. Note that although the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>A is provided by film formation as described above, it may instead be a silicon substrate as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">After the layers up to the first floating gate forming layer <b>13</b>A are formed, mask materials <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> for AA pattern formation made of, e.g., SiN and SiO<sub>2 </sub>are patterned onto the first floating gate forming layer <b>13</b>A. RIE (Reactive Ion Etching) using the mask materials <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> is carried out to selectively etch the stack of layers to the bottom of the insulating layer <b>30</b>A to form first trenches to thereby form the AA pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As a result, a first floating gate forming layer <b>13</b>B, a first gate insulating film <b>12</b>, a first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, and an insulating layer <b>30</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the trenches formed by the AA pattern formation are filled with a first element isolating insulating layer <b>15</b> made of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and then planarization is carried out by CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) using the polysilicon forming the first floating gate forming layer <b>13</b>B as the stopper. Then, the upper surface of the first element isolating insulating layer <b>15</b> is set back by etch back. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a first insulating layer <b>31</b> for isolating the upper layer from the lower layer is formed above the first element isolating insulating layer <b>15</b> and the first floating gate forming layer <b>13</b>B, and a second floating gate forming layer <b>23</b>A made of polysilicon is formed above the first insulating layer <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, mask materials <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> for GC pattern formation made of, e.g., SiN and SiO<sub>2 </sub>are patterned onto the second floating gate forming layer <b>23</b>A. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the stack of layers is selectively etched to the top of the tunnel insulating film <b>12</b> by RIE using the mask materials <b>43</b> and <b>44</b>, to form second trenches and thereby form the GC pattern. As a result, a first floating gate <b>13</b>, a second floating gate forming layer <b>23</b>B, a first select gate forming layer <b>16</b>A, and a second select gate forming layer <b>26</b>A are formed. It is preferable that this GC pattern formation be carried out by an etching process having a high selectivity toward the tunnel insulating film <b>12</b> of the lower layer and that the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> of the lower layer be not etched.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, after an inter-gate insulating film (IPD) <b>32</b> made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is formed, the trenches of the GC pattern are filled with a control gate forming layer <b>33</b>A.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the control gate forming layer <b>33</b>A is etched back by RIE to form control gates <b>33</b>.

After this, in order to form the select gate forming layers <b>16</b>A and <b>26</b>A and transistors of an unillustrated row decoder region, select gate trenches equivalent to EI (Etching Inter Poly) trenches are formed by RIE or the like. As a result, select gate trenches <b>17</b>A which reach down to the first select gate <b>16</b> through a second select gate forming layer <b>26</b>B and the first insulating layer <b>31</b> are formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in order to form select gate transistors S<b>11</b> to S<b>22</b> independently for lower cells and upper cells, a first select gate line <b>17</b>, a second insulating layer <b>34</b>, and a second select gate line <b>27</b> are sequentially formed in the select gate trenches <b>17</b>A by repeating embedding and etch back. The select gate lines <b>17</b> and <b>27</b> may be made of polysilicon or metal (W, etc.) like the control gate <b>33</b>. A cap insulating film <b>39</b>A is embedded in the etched-back portion of the second select gate line <b>27</b>, and the upper surface of the cap insulating film <b>39</b>A is planarized by CMP using the mask material <b>43</b> as a stopper. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</figref>, <b>16</b>B, and <b>16</b>C are an A-A&#x2032; cross section, a B-B&#x2032; cross section, and a C-C&#x2032; cross section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, planarization is carried out by CMP using the second floating gate forming layer <b>23</b>B or the control gate <b>33</b> as the stopper, and a second tunnel insulating film (gate insulating film) <b>22</b>A made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and a second semiconductor layer <b>21</b>A made of polysilicon are sequentially formed above the planarized surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A</figref>, <b>18</b>B, and <b>18</b>C are an A-A&#x2032; cross section, a B-B&#x2032; cross section, and a C-C&#x2032; cross section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, in order to form AA pattern into the second semiconductor layer <b>21</b>A, the second tunnel insulating film <b>22</b>A, the second floating gate forming layer <b>23</b>B, and the second select gate forming layer <b>26</b>B of the upper layer, a mask material <b>45</b> for AA pattern formation made of SiN is patterned onto the second semiconductor layer <b>21</b>A, and RIE is carried out to form the AA pattern to thereby form third trenches. This AA pattern formation is carried out by an etching process having a high selectivity toward the mask materials <b>27</b><i>m </i>and <b>33</b><i>m</i>, and the control gate <b>33</b> and the select gate line <b>27</b> are not etched. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A</figref>, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C are an A-A&#x2032; cross section, a B-B&#x2032; cross section, and a C-C&#x2032; cross section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> respectively. Through this step, the second floating gate <b>23</b> is formed, and the second tunnel insulating film <b>22</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>21</b> are formed self-aligned with the second floating gate <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Then, a second element isolating insulating layer <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is embedded in the trenches of the upper layer AA pattern.

The material of the contacts <b>35</b> to <b>38</b> may be polysilicon, metal (W, etc.), etc. which are used commonly.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to this embodiment, since the AA pattern is formed in the lower layer first floating gate <b>13</b> and in the upper layer second floating gate <b>23</b> at different timings, the first floating gate <b>13</b> and the second floating gate <b>23</b> might be misaligned in the GC direction. However, this will not hinder the operation because they are different memory cells MC<b>1</b> and MC<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In contrast, any misalignment between the first floating gate <b>13</b> and the channel of the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b> or between the second floating gate <b>23</b> and the channel of the second semiconductor layer <b>21</b> would greatly influence the operations of the memory cells MC<b>1</b> or MC<b>2</b>. In this regard, according to the memory cell array structure of the present embodiment, the first semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, the first tunnel insulating film <b>12</b>, and the first floating gate <b>13</b> of the lower layer are simultaneously subjected to AA pattern formation, and the second semiconductor layer <b>21</b>, the second tunnel insulating film <b>22</b>, and the second floating gate <b>23</b> of the upper layer are simultaneously subjected to AA pattern formation. Hence, it is possible to prevent misalignment between the memory cells MC<b>1</b> or MC<b>2</b> and the channel of the semiconductor layer <b>11</b> or <b>21</b> in each layer. Therefore, the memory cells MC<b>1</b> and MC<b>2</b> can operate without fault.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Furthermore, according to the present embodiment, it is possible to shorten the manufacturing process because the control gates <b>33</b> are shared between the lower and upper memory cells MC<b>1</b> and MC<b>2</b>, and the upper layer and the lower layer are simultaneously subjected to GC pattern formation.</p>

This makes the floating gates of the upper and lower layers substantially the same in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, mask materials <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> for GC pattern formation made of SiN and SiO<sub>2 </sub>are patterned onto the third floating gate forming layer <b>29</b>A. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, RIE is carried out by using the mask materials <b>43</b> and <b>44</b> to selectively etch the stack of layers to the top of the first tunnel insulating film <b>12</b> to form second trenches to thereby form the GC pattern. As a result, the first floating gate <b>13</b>, the second floating gate forming layer <b>23</b>B, the third floating gate forming layer <b>29</b>B, the first select gate forming layer <b>16</b>, and second select gate forming layers <b>26</b>B and <b>28</b>B are formed. It is preferred that this GC pattern formation be carried out by an etching process having a high selectivity toward the first tunnel insulating film <b>12</b> of the lower layer and that the semiconductor layer <b>11</b> of the lower layer be not etched.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, after an inter-gate insulating film (IPD) <b>32</b> is formed, a control gate forming layer <b>33</b>A is embedded in the trenches of the GC pattern. Polysilicon or metal (W, etc.) can be used as the control gate forming layer <b>33</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the control gate forming layer <b>33</b>A is etched back by RIE to thereby form the control gate <b>33</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, a mask material <b>33</b><i>m </i>and an insulating layer <b>39</b> made of a CVD oxide film, a coated oxide film, or the like are embedded above the control gate <b>33</b>, and the upper surface is planarized by CMP using the mask <b>43</b> made of SiN as the stopper. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, planarization is carried out by CMP using the layers made of polysilicon (the third floating gate forming layer <b>29</b>B and the second select gate forming layer <b>28</b>B) as the stopper, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, a second gate insulating film <b>22</b>A made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and a second semiconductor layer <b>21</b>A made of polysilicon are sequentially formed above the planarized surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A</figref>, <b>37</b>B, and <b>37</b>C are an A-A&#x2032; cross section, a B-B&#x2032; cross section, and a C-C&#x2032; cross section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, in order to form AA pattern into the second semiconductor layer <b>21</b>A, the second tunnel insulating film <b>22</b>A, the second floating gate forming layer <b>23</b>B, the third floating gate forming layer <b>29</b>B, and the second select gate forming layers <b>26</b>B and <b>28</b>B of the upper layer, a mask material <b>45</b> for AA pattern formation made of SiN is patterned onto the second semiconductor layer <b>21</b>A, and RIE is carried out to form the AA pattern to thereby form third trenches. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39A</figref>, <b>39</b>B, and <b>39</b>C are an A-A&#x2032; cross section, a B-B&#x2032; cross section, and a C-C&#x2032; cross section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> respectively. Through this step, the second floating gates <b>23</b> and <b>29</b> are formed, and at the same time, the second tunnel insulating film <b>22</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>21</b> are formed self-aligned with the second floating gates <b>23</b> and <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, a second element isolating insulating layer <b>25</b> is embedded in the trenches (third trenches) of the upper layer AA pattern. Finally, through-holes are formed in end portions of the semiconductor layers <b>11</b> and <b>22</b>, control gates <b>33</b>, and select gate lines <b>17</b> and <b>27</b> to form contacts <b>35</b> to <b>38</b>, to thereby complete two memory cell array layers <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. The material of the contacts <b>35</b> to <b>38</b> may be polysilicon and metal (W, etc.) that are used commonly.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">According to the second embodiment, in addition to the effect achieved by the first embodiment, it becomes easier to maintain a flat interface between the second select gate <b>28</b> and the second tunnel insulating film <b>22</b> in the upper layer, and to give a uniform characteristic to the lower and upper select gate transistors S<b>11</b> and S<b>12</b>, and S<b>21</b> and S<b>22</b> because the second select gate <b>28</b> is interposed between the second select gate line <b>27</b> and the second tunnel insulating film <b>22</b> in the upper layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> is a perspective diagram showing a memory cell array structure according to the third embodiment. Multilayer stacking is available by repeating the flow up to the contact formation, which is included in the above-described two-layer formation process. In the present embodiment, four memory cell array layers <b>10</b>A, <b>20</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>20</b>B are stacked. Such multilayer interconnection is advantageous in that it can share the platform with a floating gate type NAND flash memory, because it can do with the three layers of bit lines, a source line, and global lines as with a single-layer floating gate type NAND flash memory, and needs no significant changes in the peripheral circuits. Note that the first semiconductor layer of the upper layer and the second semiconductor layer of the lower layer may be formed commonly.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The embodiments described above have a structure in which the control gate <b>33</b> is shared between the lower and upper memory cells MC<b>1</b> and MC<b>2</b>. Therefore, the manufacturing process becomes simple, and wiring can be simplified. However, it is also possible to divide the control gate <b>33</b> to lower and upper portions so as to enable the lower and upper memory cells MC<b>1</b> and MC<b>2</b> to be controlled independently. In this case, the control gate formation process may be carried out in the same manner as the select gate formation process described above.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the first embodiment, the second select gate line <b>27</b> of the upper layer needs not be formed in one process, but instead, the select gate line <b>27</b> may be etched back rather deeply, and polysilicon may be added thereabove as in the second embodiment. In this way, it is possible to obtain the same effect as the second embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">When forming a multilayer structure, it is possible to form the AA pattern and the GC pattern alternately into two layers at a time as in an order of first layer&#x2192;(second layer+third layer)&#x2192;(fourth layer+fifth layer) . . . as for the AA pattern, and (first layer+second layer)&#x2192;(third layer+fourth layer)&#x2192;(fifth layer+sixth layer) . . . as for the GC pattern. This would further shorten the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, another method for self-alignment between the floating gate and the channel is conceivable than the method described above. For example, when forming the AA pattern, the floating gate is etched together with a sacrifice film such as a nitride film formed above the floating gate. Then, after an oxide film is embedded in the formed trenches, the sacrifice film is removed by a hot phosphoric acid treatment. Then, a second tunnel insulating film <b>22</b> and a second semiconductor layer <b>21</b> are embedded where the sacrifice film has been, and the top surface is planarized by CMP or RIE. This method can also realize self-alignment between the floating gate and the channel.</p>
