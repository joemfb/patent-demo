<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of separating biologically ingestible microparticles is used to obtain biologically ingestible microparticles in a thin film fluid formed between two processing formed by a fluid to be processed containing at least a first solvent in which an objective substance to be pulverized is dissolved and a second solvent in which the solubility of the microparticles is lower than in the first solvent. The biologically ingestible microparticles are separated by a neutralization reaction in the thin film fluid.</p>

<p id="p-0004" num="0011">The nanotechnology attracts a great deal of attention as a scientific technology raising a new industrial revolution. Because a conventional substance can exhibit new functions by converting the substance into microparticles, the conversion of the substance into nanoparticles is an important theme in the whole industrial world, and the interest in the technology of conversion into nanoparticles is extremely increasing for advance of the nanotechnology. (Non-Patent Document 1) (Non-Patent Document 1)</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0012">Particularly with respect to substances intended to be ingested by the living body (biologically ingestible substances), such as foods, food additives, cosmetics and pharmaceutical preparations for drugs and medicines, microparticulation technology draws increasing attention, and particularly the microparticulation of drugs and medicines in pharmaceutical preparations is known to bring about improvements in solubility, that is, significant improvements in the degree of biological absorption, and is increasingly expected.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0013">On the other hand, a long time for development and depletion of possible substances become problematic in creation of a new possible substance for drugs and medicines, and one of such causes is that the possible compound is poorly water-soluble so that a change in the structure of the compound may be necessary and thus the development may be increasingly delayed or deadlocked. Because possible compounds selected to be developed are low in solubility, there is also a problem that not only formulation of drugs and medicines but a toxicity test and evaluation of their dynamics cannot be advanced. However, some compounds are highly membrane-permeable even being low in solubility in water, and can be sufficiently absorbed after oral administration, so that when compounds are dropped in view of solubility only, promising compounds may be also left out. Accordingly, there is a desire to develop formulating technology for improving solubility and consequently for improving the degree of absorption into the living body.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0014">It is reported that, in many cases, even a poorly water-soluble drug, when finely atomized, increases its surface area and increases the rate of dissolution, thereby increasing absorption into the living body. For example, the biological availability (BA) of an anti-endometriosis drug danazol was 5.1% when its commercial product (average particle diameter: 10 &#x3bc;m) was administered to a dog in the form of a suspension, while the BA of danazol was significantly increased to 82.3% when the drug was administered in the form of a nano-suspension having an average particle diameter of 169 nm (Int J. Pharm. 125, 1995, 91-97). When an anti-inflammatory agent naproxen was administered to a rat, its absorption was increased four times as much by atomizing its bulk powder of 20 to 30 &#x3bc;m into powder of 270 nm (Int J. Pharm 125, 1995, 309-313). Accordingly, when a poorly water-soluble drug can be formed successfully into nanoparticles, the absorptivity of the drug can be significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0015">Under this background, manufacturing technologies of atomizing (nano atomization) a drug have been desired, and for industrial application of such technologies, the establishment of a production method capable of stable mass production is one of the most important tasks in the application of nanotechnology to pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0016">Generally, as a method for producing microparticles, there are: a break-down method (crushing method) of mechanically crushing and atomizing a bulk-state material to obtain microparticles; and a bottom-up method (developing method) of aggregating atoms and molecules thereby developing them into microparticles of suitable size.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0017">As a crushing method, included are a mechanical crushing style of using a mill such as a ball mill, an attritor mill, a vibrator mill, a sand mill, a roller mill or a Cowles-type mixer, and another style of radiating femtosecond laser to solid particles such as a laser ablation. In the case of the mechanical crushing style, however, there is a fundamental limit to the degree of atomization by crushing, and there are problems of, for example, mix of impurities and lack of purity in products, since use of a crushing force generated by contacting a medium mill inevitably causes mix of broken particles of bead itself. Further, enormous energy is required, so that at present there is also a problem in energy costs. The laser ablation method is a process of utilizing a crushing force by strong light, and thus the possibility of photodecomposition at the molecular level cannot be denied. The substantial amount of production under the present situation is about 0.1 mg/h and cannot be said to be at an industrially practicable level.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0018">Further, microparticles produced by the crushing method generate active sites easily on their fracture surfaces as a result of physical crushing, so that the crushed microparticles are aggregated again to easily form coarser aggregates than before crushing. Accordingly, the utility value of the product may be deteriorated, or anomalies such as increase of viscosity in the dispersion system as a whole may be caused, so that there are many problems in the crushing methods themselves.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0019">Patent Document 1 describes a method of obtaining drug microparticles, specifically a method of obtaining particles of less than 250 nm by means of a mill such as a ball mill, an attritor mill, a vibrator mill, a sand mill, a roller mill or a Cowles-type mixer. As for mix of foreign materials due to, for example, abrasion of media, it is merely referred to therein as not causing unacceptable contamination, and a risk of mix of foreign materials may arise a critical problem for pharmaceutical preparations in which high qualities always are required.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0020">Next, the bottom-up method used as a method of preparing microparticles is a method utilizing various reaction means such as chemical reaction, crystallization and sublimation, wherein a reaction is used in combination with a polymer dispersing method, a thermal decomposition method, a supercritical method or a sonication method, thereby aggregating atoms and molecules to form microparticles.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0021">As reaction means, a reaction method using a batch reaction container as described in Patent Document 3 or a gaseous phase method using plasma in a high vacuum as described in Patent Document 4 is used in some cases. Further, a microreactor and a micro-flow path reactor as described in Patent Documents 5 and 6 is utilized in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0022">In a batch system, controlling temperature in the batch is generally difficult, and so is conducting a uniform reaction. Further, the control of concentration in a completely uniform state is not feasible, and thus the control of reaction conditions is difficult. Moreover, the reaction time should be prolonged, and thus a uniform reaction hardly proceeds under the control of all reaction conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0023">In a gaseous phase method, the amount of nanoparticles formed per unit time is small, and a high-energy apparatus to evaporate materials is necessary, such as an electron beam, plasma, a laser and induction heating. Further, the yield is low, so a gaseous phase method cannot be said to be very suitable for mass production in view of production costs. Furthermore, it is a problem that the nanoparticles obtained by a gaseous phase method are readily aggregated and fused together while a size of the particles varies, since the particles are microparticles of a pure substance.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0024">It has been attempted to use a microreactor or a micromixer known in microchemical processing in a method for producing the biologically ingestible minute microparticles described above. However, when the microparticles are produced by these methods, the methods are not applicable to all the reactions, since the micro-flow path is closed with high possibility by clogging of the flow path with bubbles and byproducts generated by the reaction, and the reactions are allowed to proceed fundamentally by molecular diffusion only. The microchemical process uses a scale-up method of increasing the number of reactors arranged in parallel, but a problem is that because the manufacturing ability of one reactor is small, and scaling up in a large volume is not practical, and the respective reactors are difficult to be supplied with the same performance, thus failing to provide uniform products. When the reaction solution is highly viscous or the reaction causes increasing viscosity, very high pressure is necessary for passing of the solution through a minute flow path, so it concerns that a usable pump is limited, and leakage of the solution from an apparatus cannot cease due to the high pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0025">Particularly in the case of pharmaceutical preparations, high qualities are definitely required. Strongly desired are physicochemical qualities such as a crystal form or a crystal particle size, and basic qualities of having mixing of impurities and, further, insoluble microparticles, in the pharmaceutical preparations, so superb technologies of production meeting such requirements for qualities are required. However, substances produced in the chemical industry and produced as foods and pharmaceutical preparations often contain aggregates of fine crystals, and those with a mother liquid and impurities in crystals. Also, when atomization is done with a crushing device using media, mix of a media-derived foreign material is inevitable. From now on, consciousness of environmental issues and saving of resources and energy is necessary, thus including this, there are many problems to be resolved. Further in the process for producing biologically ingestible microparticles, mix of a foreign material and growth of bacteria in the process may cause a problem too, so the proposal of a production method capable of providing biologically ingestible microparticles in a safer and more inexpensive way by reducing production time is required.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0026">Some poorly water-soluble drugs are soluble not only in organic solvents but also in acidic or alkaline solutions, but many of the drugs are known to be poor in stability of compounds in aqueous solutions in which they have been dissolved. For example, pirenoxine is hydrolyzed when dissolved in an aqueous solution of pH 6 or higher. Accordingly, many of pirenoxine eye drops commercially available should, just before use, be dissolved in an attached solvent and be prepared.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0027">An aqueous suspension having a poorly water-soluble drug suspended therein is known too. However, the diameter of drug particles in aqueous suspended eye drops commercially available is several &#x3bc;m to several dozen &#x3bc;m, and thus these aqueous suspended eye drops are hardly subjected to filtering sterilization. For assuring the sterility of the preparations, it is necessary that sterilization such as final high-pressure steam sterilization or dry heat sterilization of the main raw material be done, and the whole of the production process thereafter be conducted by an aseptic operation. However, it is known that, when the final high-pressure steam sterilization is conducted, in a state from large to small particles mixed in it, small particles dissolve and disappear, while larger particles further grow (Ostwald ripening). In a sterilizing operation involving intense changes of the temperature, the particles further become coarser and coarser. During sterilization, a surface modifier/particle-solving agent is separated, which is accompanied by coarsened particles, and thus it is difficult to maintain dispersibility (JP-A H06-227967/Patent Document 7). When the dry heat sterilization of the main raw material is conducted, the thermal denaturation, adhesion and strong aggregation of the main raw material are caused, and thus mechanical crushing and dispersion treatment for a longer time are necessary, and as a result, an aseptic operation for a long time is required. In the case of the production method involving such aseptic operations, it costs for the aseptic facilities and operations, and aspects of production such as workability and of quality assurance such as maintenance of asepsis matter.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0028">As an aqueous suspension of pirenoxine, a method capable of filtering sterilization and providing eye drops is shown in which pirenoxine is ultrafinely atomized by mechanical crushing to provide inexpensive eye drops (JP-A 2007-77061/Patent Document 8). However, the conventional mechanical production method requires a long time in atomization and suffers from problems such as productivity and increasing burden of costs due to high processing energy and complexity of the process. Further, many of atomizing machines use media, which indicates mix of media as foreign material and difficulty in acquisition of uniform particles and easy aggregation. It is also noted that coarse particles act as cores to promote aggregation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0029">Meanwhile, the fact that atomization of pirenoxine can improve osmotic properties to corneas and, in the form of an aqueous suspension, improving stability to light is known, and the same effect can be expected for other eye drops.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0030">In the method for atomizing a pharmaceutical composition, particularly in the case of a poorly water-soluble drug, there is a method of improving solubility such as a pH regulating method, an organic solvent method, a micelle method, a complex method, a microemulsion method, and a microparticulation method. The methods other than the microparticulation method depend on physical properties of individual drugs and are thus not always applicable to every drug. The microparticulation method of crushing by a mechanical means can be applied widely to drugs, but there are problems such as easy aggregation, difficulty in acquisition of uniform particles, and mix of impurities in the crushing process.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0031">The method of atomizing a drug includes a dry crushing method, a wet crushing method, a crystallization method, and so on. Generally, a pharmaceutical preparation is heat-labile, so that in the dry crushing method, there are problems due to heat generation during crushing process such as conversion into an amorphous compound, and occurrence of dust. The wet crushing method also suffers from problems such as a long processing time, and difficulty in regulating the diameter of attained particles. Further, use of media inevitably causes mix of a foreign material attributable to abrasion of the media, and the mixed foreign material is difficult to be isolated, thus making the resulting particles unusable in products requiring high purity.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0032">In most cases, it takes long time for the wet crushing as described above to process, so that bacteria may grow over the time. In addition, a great burden of costs out of high processing energy and complexity of the process is concerned.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0033">The method for producing drug microparticles includes a method of dissolving a compound in a solvent and then mixing the solution with a new solvent to separate crystals, and a method of dissolving a compound in a solvent by pH regulation and then changing the pH with an acid or an alkali to separate crystals. In such reaction methods, two liquids have been mixed usually by means of a dynamic mixing apparatus having a movable part in its mixing area, for example, a stirring and mixing apparatus having an impeller. It should be careful when such a mixing apparatus is used to process a compound having an extremely high rate of crystal growth. If it takes a long time to mix a solution of such a compound with a new solvent, separation of crystals is initiated in its solution in a state of nonuniform concentration, then particles having broad particle size distribution/particle diameter distribution, and coarse particles, depending on growth of crystals, are mixed, resulting in not obtaining the objective crystals having sharp particle size distribution/particle diameter distribution. There is also a method of separating microparticles by allowing a solution to be in contact with abase having protrusions, which are hardly different from each other, at density of at least 100 protrusions per square centimeter on the surface thereof (JP-A 2006-104193/Patent Document 2), but there still are many to be solved such as an amount of production.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0034">It has been desired to provide stable and dispersible drug particles in nanomicron size, in which particle diameters are easily regulated; aggregation or precipitation after aggregation is unlikely to occur; other than main drugs, fewer additives such as surfactant and stabilizer are contained; and redispersibility is excellent. In addition, it has been strongly requested to provide a pharmaceutical composition, in which no contamination due to mechanical abrasion and the like happens; safety and stability are securely maintained; and bioavailability is excellent.</p>

<p id="p-0081" num="0088">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. The technical scope of the present invention is not limited by the following embodiments and examples, and the present invention can be carried out with various modifications without changing the gist thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0089">The method of the present invention comprises separating, in a thin film fluid, raw materials of biologically ingestible microparticles as a reactant, thereby producing biologically ingestible microparticles, wherein the fluid is formed into a thin film fluid between two processing surfaces arranged so as to be able to approach to and separate from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other, and biologically ingestible microparticles are separated in the thin film fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0090">An apparatus of the same principle as described in JP-A 2004-49957 filed by the present applicant, for example, can be used in the method of uniform stirring and mixing in a thin film fluid formed between processing surfaces arranged to be opposite to each other so as to be able to approach to and separate from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0091">Hereinafter, the fluid processing apparatus suitable for carrying out this method is described.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, this apparatus includes opposing first and second processing members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, at least one of which rotates to the other. The opposing surfaces of both the processing members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> serve as processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> to process a fluid to be processed therebetween. The first processing member <b>10</b> includes a first processing surface <b>1</b>, and the second processing member <b>20</b> includes a second processing surface <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0093">Both the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are connected to a flow path of the fluid to constitute a part of the flow path of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0094">Specifically, this apparatus constitutes flow paths of at least two fluids to be processed and joins the flow paths together.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0095">That is, this apparatus is connected to a flow path of a first fluid to form a part of the flow path of the first fluid and simultaneously forms a part of a flow path of a second fluid other than the first fluid. This apparatus joins both the flow paths together thereby mixing and reacting both the fluids between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, each of the flow paths is hermetically closed and made liquid-tight (when the processed fluid is a liquid) or air-tight (when the processed fluid is a gas).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0096">Specifically, this apparatus as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref> includes the first processing member <b>10</b>, the second processing member <b>20</b>, a first holder <b>11</b> for holding the first processing member <b>10</b>, a second holder <b>21</b> for holding the second processing member <b>20</b>, a surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b>, a rotation drive member, a first introduction part d<b>1</b>, a second introduction part d<b>2</b>, a fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b>, a second fluid supply part p<b>2</b>, and a case <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0097">Illustration of the rotation drive member is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0098">At least one of the first processing member <b>10</b> and the second processing member <b>20</b> is able to approach to and separate from each other, and the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are able to approach to and separate from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0099">In this embodiment, the second processing member <b>20</b> approaches to and separates from the first processing member <b>10</b>. On the contrary, the first processing member <b>10</b> may approach to and separate from the second processing member <b>20</b>, or both the processing members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> may approach to and separate from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0100">The second processing member <b>20</b> is disposed over the first processing member <b>10</b>, and the lower surface of the second processing member <b>20</b> serves as the second processing surface <b>2</b>, and the upper surface of the first processing member <b>10</b> serves as the first processing surface <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, the first processing member <b>10</b> and the second processing member <b>20</b> in this embodiment are circular bodies, that is, rings. Hereinafter, the first processing member <b>10</b> is referred to as a first ring <b>10</b>, and the second processing member <b>20</b> as a second ring <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0102">Both the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> in this embodiment are metallic members having, at one end, a mirror-polished surface, respectively, and their mirror-polished surfaces are referred to as the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b>, respectively. That is, the upper surface of the first ring <b>10</b> is mirror-polished as the first processing surface <b>1</b>, and the lower surface of the second ring <b>20</b> is mirror-polished as the second processing surface <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0103">At least one of the holders can rotate relative to the other holder by the rotation drive member. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, numerical <b>50</b> indicates a rotary shaft of the rotation drive member. The rotation drive member may use an electric motor. By the rotation drive member, the processing surface of one ring can rotate relative to the processing surface of the other ring.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0104">In this embodiment, the first holder <b>11</b> receives drive power on the rotary shaft <b>50</b> from the rotation drive member and rotates relative to the second holder <b>21</b>, whereby the first ring <b>10</b> integrated with the first holder <b>11</b> rotates relative to the second ring <b>20</b>. Inside the first ring <b>10</b>, the rotary shaft <b>50</b> is disposed in the first holder <b>11</b> so as to be concentric, in a plane, with the center of the circular first ring <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0105">The first ring <b>10</b> rotates centering on the shaft center of the first ring <b>10</b>. The shaft center (not shown) is a virtual line referring to the central line of the first ring <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0106">In this embodiment as described above, the first holder <b>11</b> holds the first ring <b>10</b> such that the first processing surface <b>1</b> of the first ring <b>10</b> is directed upward, and the second holder <b>21</b> holds the second ring <b>20</b> such that the second processing surface <b>2</b> of the second ring <b>20</b> is directed downward.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0107">Specifically, the first and second holders <b>11</b> and <b>21</b> include a ring-accepting concave part, respectively. In this embodiment, the first ring <b>10</b> is fitted in the ring-accepting part of the first holder <b>11</b>, and the first ring <b>10</b> is fixed in the ring-accepting part so as not to rise from, and set in, the ring-accepting part of the first holder <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0108">That is, the first processing surface <b>1</b> is exposed from the first holder <b>11</b> and faces the second holder <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0109">Examples of the material for the first ring <b>10</b> include metal, ceramics, sintered metal, abrasion-resistant steel, metal subjected to hardening treatment, and rigid materials subjected to lining, coating or plating. The first processing member <b>10</b> is preferably formed of a lightweight material for rotation. A material for the second ring <b>20</b> may be the same as that for the first ring <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0110">The ring-accepting part <b>41</b> arranged in the second holder <b>21</b> accepts the processing surface <b>2</b> of the second ring <b>20</b> such that the processing member can rise and set.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0111">The ring-accepting part <b>41</b> of the second holder <b>21</b> is a concave portion for mainly accepting that side of the second ring <b>20</b> opposite to the processing surface <b>2</b>, and this concave portion is a groove which has been formed into a circle when viewed in a plane.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0112">The ring-accepting part <b>41</b> is formed to be larger in size than the second ring <b>20</b> so as to accept the second ring <b>20</b> with sufficient clearance between itself and the second ring <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0113">By this clearance, the second ring <b>20</b> in the ring-accepting part <b>41</b> can be displaced not only in the axial direction of the circular ring-accepting part <b>41</b> but also in a direction perpendicular to the axial direction. In other words, the second ring <b>20</b> can, by this clearance, be displaced relative to the ring-accepting part <b>41</b> to make the central line of the second ring <b>20</b> unparallel to the axial direction of the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0114">Hereinafter, that portion of the second holder <b>21</b> which is surrounded by the second ring <b>20</b> is referred to as a central portion <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0115">In other words, the second ring <b>20</b> is displaceably accepted within the ring-accepting part <b>41</b> not only in the thrust direction of the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>, that is, in the direction in which the second ring <b>20</b> rises from and sets in the part <b>41</b>, but also in the decentering direction of the second ring <b>20</b> from the center of the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>. Further, the second ring <b>20</b> is accepted in the ring-accepting part <b>41</b> such that the second ring <b>20</b> can be displaced (i.e. run-out) to vary the width between itself upon rising or setting and the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>, at each position in the circumferential direction of the second ring <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0116">The second ring <b>20</b>, while maintaining the degree of its move in the above three directions, that is, the axial direction, decentering direction and run-out direction of the second ring <b>20</b> relative to the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>, is held on the second holder <b>21</b> so as not to follow the rotation of the first ring <b>10</b>. For this purpose, suitable unevenness (not shown) for regulating rotation in the circumferential direction of the ring-accepting part <b>41</b> may be arranged both in the ring-accepting part <b>41</b> and in the second ring <b>20</b>. However, the unevenness should not deteriorate displacement in the degree of its move in the three directions.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0117">The surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> supplies the processing members with force exerted in the direction of approaching the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> each other. In this embodiment, the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> is disposed in the second holder <b>21</b> and biases the second ring <b>20</b> toward the first ring <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0118">The surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> uniformly biases each position in the circumferential direction of the second ring <b>20</b>, that is, each position of the second processing surface <b>2</b>, toward the first ring <b>10</b>. A specific structure of the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, the case <b>3</b> is arranged outside the outer circumferential surfaces of both the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, and accepts a product formed between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and discharged to the outside of both the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, the case <b>3</b> is a liquid-tight container for accepting the first holder <b>11</b> and the second holder <b>21</b>. However, the second holder <b>21</b> may be that which as a part of the case <b>3</b>, is integrally formed with the case <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0120">As described above, the second holder <b>21</b> whether formed as a part of the case <b>3</b> or formed separately from the case <b>3</b> is not movable so as to influence the distance between both the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, that is, the distance between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. In other words, the second holder <b>21</b> does not influence the distance between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0121">The case <b>3</b> is provided with an outlet <b>32</b> for discharging a product to the outside of the case <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0122">The first introduction part d<b>1</b> supplies a first fluid to be processed to the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0123">The fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b> is connected directly or indirectly to the first introduction part d<b>1</b> to impart fluid pressure to the first fluid. A compressor or a pump can be used in the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0124">In this embodiment, the first introduction part d<b>1</b> is a fluid path arranged inside the central part <b>22</b> of the second holder <b>21</b>, and one end of the first introduction part d<b>1</b> is open at the central position of a circle, when viewed in a plane, of the second ring <b>20</b> on the second holder <b>21</b>. The other end of the first introduction part d<b>1</b> is connected to the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b> outside the second holder <b>21</b>, that is, outside the case <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0125">The second introduction part d<b>2</b> supplies a second fluid to be reacted with the first fluid to the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. In this embodiment, the second introduction part is a fluid passage arranged inside the second ring <b>20</b>, and one end of the second introduction part is open at the side of the second processing surface <b>2</b>, and a second fluid-feeding part p<b>2</b> is connected to the other end.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0126">A compressor or a pump can be used in the second fluid-feeding part p<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0127">The first processed fluid pressurized with the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b> is introduced from the first introduction part d<b>1</b> to the space between the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and will pass through the space between the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> to the outside of the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0128">At this time, the second ring <b>20</b> receiving the supply pressure of the first fluid stands against the bias of the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b>, thereby receding from the first ring <b>10</b> and making a minute space between the processing surfaces. The space between both the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> by approach and separation of the surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> will be described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0129">A second fluid is supplied from the second introduction part d<b>2</b> to the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, flows into the first fluid, and is subjected to a reaction promoted by rotation of the processing surface. Then, a reaction product formed by the reaction of both the fluids is discharged from the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> to the outside of both the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. The reaction product discharged to the outside of the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> is discharged finally through the outlet <b>32</b> of the case <b>3</b> to the outside of the case <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0130">The mixing and reaction of the processed fluid are effected between the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> by rotation, relative to the second processing member <b>20</b>, of the first processing member <b>10</b> with the drive member.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0131">Between the first and second processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, a region downstream from an opening m<b>2</b> of the second introduction part d<b>2</b> serves as a reaction chamber where the first and second processed fluids are reacted with each other. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(C)</figref> illustrating a bottom face of the second ring <b>20</b>, a region H shown by oblique lines, outside the second opening m<b>2</b> of the second introduction part in the radial direction r<b>1</b> of the second ring <b>20</b>, serves as the processing chamber, that is, the reaction chamber. Accordingly, this reaction chamber is located downstream from the openings m<b>1</b> and m<b>2</b> of the first introduction part d<b>1</b> and the second introduction part d<b>2</b> between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0132">The first fluid introduced from the first opening m<b>1</b> through a space inside the ring into the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, and the second fluid introduced from the second opening m<b>2</b> into the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, are mixed with each other in the region H serving as the reaction chamber, and both the processed fluids are reacted with each other. The fluid will, upon receiving supply pressure from the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b>, move through the minute space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> to the outside of the rings, but because of rotation of the first ring <b>10</b>, the fluid mixed in the reaction region H does not move linearly from the inside to the outside of the rings in the radial direction, but moves from the inside to the outside of the ring spirally around the rotary shaft of the ring when the processing surfaces are viewed in a plane. In the region H where the fluids are thus mixed and reacted, the fluids can move spirally from inside to outside to secure a zone necessary for sufficient reaction in the minute space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, thereby promoting their uniform reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0133">The product formed by the reaction becomes a uniform reaction product in the minute space between the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> and appears as microparticles particularly in the case of crystallization or separation.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0134">By the balance among at least the supply pressure applied by the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b>, the bias of the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b>, and the centrifugal force resulting from rotation of the ring, the distance between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> can be balanced to attain a preferable minute space, and further the processed fluid receiving the supply pressure applied by the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b> and the centrifugal force by rotation of the ring moves spirally in the minute space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, so that their reaction is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0135">The reaction is forcedly effected by the supply pressure applied by the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b> and the rotation of the ring. That is, the reaction occurs under forced uniform mixing between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> arranged opposite to each other so as to be able to approach to and separate from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0136">Accordingly, the crystallization and separation of the product formed by the reaction can be regulated by relatively easily controllable methods such as regulation of supply pressure applied by the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b> and regulation of the rotating speed of the ring, that is, the number of revolutions of the ring.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0137">As described above, this processing apparatus is excellent in that the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, which can exert influence on the size of a product, and the distance in which the processed fluid moves in the reaction region H, which can exert influence on production of a uniform product, can be regulated by the supply pressure and the centrifugal force.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0138">The reaction processing gives not only deposit of the product but also liquids.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0139">The rotary shaft <b>50</b> is not limited to the vertically arranged one and may be arranged in the horizontal direction or arranged at a slant. This is because during processing, the reaction occurs in such a minute space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> that the influence of gravity can be substantially eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0140">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, the first introduction part d<b>1</b> extends vertically and coincides with the shaft center of the second ring <b>20</b> in the second holder <b>21</b>. However, the first introduction part d<b>1</b> is not limited to the one having a center coinciding with the shaft center of the second ring <b>20</b> and may be arranged in other positions in the central portion <b>22</b> of the second holder <b>21</b> as long as the first fluid can be supplied into the space surrounded by the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, and the first introduction part d<b>1</b> may extend obliquely as well as vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0141">A more preferable embodiment of the apparatus is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(A)</figref>. As shown in this figure, the second processing member <b>20</b> has the second processing surface <b>2</b> and a pressure-receiving surface <b>23</b> which is positioned inside, and situated next to, the second processing surface <b>2</b>. Hereinafter, the pressure-receiving surface <b>23</b> is also referred to as a separation-regulating surface <b>23</b>. As shown in the figure, the separation-regulating surface <b>23</b> is an inclined surface.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0142">As described above, the ring-accepting part <b>41</b> is formed in the bottom (i.e. a lower part) of the second holder <b>21</b>, and the second processing member <b>20</b> is accepted in the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>. The second processing member <b>20</b> is held by the second holder <b>21</b> so as not to be rotated with a baffle (not shown). The second processing surface <b>2</b> is exposed from the second holder <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0143">In this embodiment, a material to be processed is introduced inside the first processing member <b>10</b> and the second processing member <b>20</b> between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, and the processed material is discharged to the outside of the first processing member <b>10</b> and the second processing member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0144">The surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> presses by pressure the second processing surface <b>2</b> against the first processing surface <b>1</b> to make them contacted with or close to each other, and generates a thin film fluid of predetermined thickness by the balance between the surface-approaching pressure and the force, e.g. fluid pressure, of separating the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> from each other. In other words, the distance between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is kept in a predetermined minute space by the balance between the forces.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0145">Specifically, the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> in this embodiment is comprised of the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>, a spring-accepting part <b>42</b> arranged in the depth of the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>, that is, in the deepest part of the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>, a spring <b>43</b>, and an air introduction part <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0146">However, the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> may be the one including at least one member selected from the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>, the spring-accepting part <b>42</b>, the spring <b>43</b>, and the air introduction part <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0147">The ring-accepting part <b>41</b> has the second processing member <b>20</b> fit into it with play to enable the second processing member <b>20</b> to be displaced vertically deeply or shallowly, that is, vertically in the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0148">One end of the spring <b>43</b> is abutted against the depth of the spring-accepting part <b>42</b>, and the other end of the spring <b>43</b> is abutted against the front (i.e., the upper part) of the second processing member <b>20</b> in the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, only one spring <b>43</b> is shown, but a plurality of springs <b>43</b> are preferably used to press various parts of the second processing member <b>20</b>. This is because as the number of springs <b>43</b> increases, pressing pressure can be given more uniformly to the second processing member <b>20</b>. Accordingly, several to a few dozen springs <b>43</b> comprising a multi-spring type preferably attach to the second holder <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0149">In this embodiment, air can be introduced through the air introduction part <b>44</b> into the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>. By such introduction of air, air pressure together with pressure by the spring <b>43</b> can be given as pressing pressure from the space, as a pressurizing chamber, between the ring-accepting part <b>41</b> and the second processing member <b>20</b> to the second processing member <b>20</b>. Accordingly, adjusting the pressure of air introduced through the air introduction part <b>44</b> can regulate the surface-approaching pressure of the second processing surface <b>2</b> toward the first processing surface <b>1</b> during operation. A mechanism of generating pressing pressure with another fluid pressure such as oil pressure can be utilized in place of the air introduction part <b>44</b> utilizing air pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0150">The surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> not only supplies and regulates a part of the pressing pressure, that is, the surface-approaching pressure, but also serves as a displacement regulating mechanism and a buffer mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0151">Specifically, the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> as a displacement regulating mechanism can maintain initial pressing pressure by regulating air pressure against the change in the axial direction caused by elongation or abrasion at the start of or in the operation. As described above, the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> uses a floating mechanism of maintaining the second processing member <b>20</b> so as to be displaced, thereby also functioning as a buffer mechanism for micro-vibration or rotation alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0152">Now, the state of the thus constituted processing apparatus during use is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0153">At the outset, a first fluid to be processed is pressurized with the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b> and introduced through the first introduction part d<b>1</b> into the internal space of the sealed case. On the other hand, the first processing member <b>10</b> is rotated with the rotation of the rotary shaft <b>50</b> by the rotation drive member. The first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> are thereby rotated relatively with a minute space kept therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0154">The first processed fluid is formed into a thin film fluid between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> with a minute space kept therebetween, and a second fluid to be processed which is introduced through the second introduction part d<b>2</b> flows into the thin film fluid between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> to comprise apart of the thin film fluid. By this, the first and second processed fluids are mixed with each other, and a uniform reaction of both of the fluids being reacted with each other is promoted to form a reaction product. When the reaction is accompanied by separation, relatively uniform and fine particles can be formed. Even when the reaction is not accompanied by separation, a uniform reaction can be realized. The separated reaction product may be further finely atomized by shearing between the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> with the rotation of the first processing surface <b>1</b>. The first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> are regulated to form a minute space of 1 &#x3bc;m to 1 mm, particularly 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m, thereby realizing a uniform reaction and enabling production of superfine particles of several nm in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0155">The product is discharged from the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> through an outlet <b>32</b> of the case <b>3</b> to the outside of the case. The discharged product is atomized in a vacuum or depressurized atmosphere with a well-known decompression device and converted into liquid in the atmosphere to collide with each other, then what trickled down in the liquid is able to be collected as degassed liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0156">In this embodiment, the processing apparatus is provided with a case <b>3</b>, but may be carried out without a case. For example, a decompression tank for degassing, that is, a vacuum tank, is arranged, and the processing apparatus may be arranged in this tank. In this case, the outlet mentioned above is naturally not arranged in the processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0157">As described above, the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> can be regulated to form a minute space in the order of &#x3bc;m which cannot be formed by arranging mechanical clearance. Now, this mechanism is described.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0158">The first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> are capable of approaching to and separating from each other, and simultaneously rotate relative to each other. In this example, the first processing surface <b>1</b> rotates, and the second processing surface <b>2</b> slides in the axial direction thereby approaching to and separating from the first processing surface <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0159">In this example, therefore, the position of the second processing surface <b>2</b> in the axial direction is arranged accurately in the order of &#x3bc;m by the balance between forces, that is, the balance between the surface-approaching pressure and the separating pressure, thereby establishing a minute space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0160">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(A)</figref>, the surface-approaching pressure includes the pressure by air pressure (positive pressure) from the air introduction part <b>44</b> by the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b>, the pressing pressure with the spring <b>43</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0161">The embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> are shown by omitting the second introduction part d<b>2</b> to simplify the drawings. In this respect, these drawings may be assumed to show sections at a position not provided with the second introduction part d<b>2</b>. In the figures, U and S show upward and downward directions respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0162">On the other hand, the separating force include the fluid pressure acting on the pressure-receiving surface at the separating side, that is, on the second processing surface <b>2</b> and the separation regulating surface <b>23</b>, the centrifugal force resulting from rotation of the first processing member <b>10</b>, and the negative pressure when negative pressure is applied to the air introduction part <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0163">When the apparatus is washed, the negative pressure applied to the air introduction part <b>44</b> can be increased to significantly separate the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> from each other, thereby facilitating washing.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0164">By the balance among these forces, the second processing surface <b>2</b> while being remote by a predetermined minute space from the first processing surface <b>1</b> is stabilized, thereby realizing establishment with accuracy in the order of &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0165">The separating force is described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0166">With respect to fluid pressure, the second processing member <b>20</b> in a closed flow path receives feeding pressure of a processed fluid, that is, fluid pressure, from the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b>. In this case, the surfaces opposite to the first processing surface in the flow path, that is, the second processing surface <b>2</b> and the separation regulating surface <b>23</b>, act as pressure-receiving surfaces at the separating side, and the fluid pressure is applied to the pressure-receiving surfaces to generate a separating force due to the fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0167">With respect to centrifugal force, the first processing member <b>10</b> is rotated at high speed, centrifugal force is applied to the fluid, and a part of this centrifugal force acts as separating force in the direction in which the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are separated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0168">When negative pressure is applied from the air introduction part <b>44</b> to the second processing member <b>20</b>, the negative pressure acts as separating force.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0169">In the foregoing description of the present invention, the force of separating the first and second processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> from each other has been described as a separating force, and the above-mentioned force is not excluded from the separating force.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0170">By forming a balanced state of the separating force and the surface-approaching pressure applied by the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> via the fluid between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> in the flow path of the closed fluid, a uniform reaction is realized between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, and simultaneously a thin film fluid suitable for crystallization and separation of microscopic reaction products is formed as described above. In this manner, this apparatus can maintain a minute space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> by forced thin film fluid, the minute space of which is not achievable with a conventional mechanical apparatus, and microparticles can be formed highly accurately as the reaction product.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0171">In other words, the thickness of the thin film fluid between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is regulated as desired by regulating the separating force and surface-approaching pressure, thereby realizing a necessary uniform reaction to form and process microscopic products. Accordingly, when the thickness of the thin film fluid is to be decreased, the surface-approaching pressure or separating force may be regulated such that the surface-approaching pressure is made relatively higher than the separating force. When the thickness of the thin film fluid is to be increased, the separating force or surface-approaching pressure may be regulated such that the separating force is made relatively higher than the surface-approaching pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0172">When the surface-approaching pressure is increased, air pressure, that is, positive pressure is applied from the air introduction part <b>44</b> by the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b>, or the spring <b>43</b> is changed to the one having higher pressing pressure, or the number of springs may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0173">When the separating force is to be increased, the feeding pressure of the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b> is increased, or the area of the second processing surface <b>2</b> or the separation regulating surface <b>23</b> is increased, or in addition, the rotation of the first processing member <b>10</b> is regulated to increase centrifugal force or reduce pressure from the air introduction part <b>44</b>. Alternatively, negative pressure may be applied. The spring <b>43</b> shown is a pressing spring that generates pressing pressure in an extending direction, but may be a pulling spring that generates a force in a compressing direction to constitute a part or the whole of the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0174">When the separating force is to be decreased, the feeding pressure of the fluid pressure imparting mechanism p<b>1</b> is reduced, or the area of the second processing surface <b>2</b> or the separation regulating surface <b>23</b> is reduced, or in addition, the rotation of the first processing member <b>10</b> is regulated to decrease centrifugal force or increase pressure from the air introduction part <b>44</b>. Alternatively, negative pressure may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0175">Further, properties of a processed fluid, such as viscosity, can be added as a factor for increasing or decreasing the surface-approaching pressure and separating force, and regulation of such properties of a processed fluid can be performed as regulation of the above factor.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0176">In the separating force, the fluid pressure exerted on the pressure-receiving surface at the separating side, that is, the second processing surface <b>2</b> and the separation regulating surface <b>23</b> is understood as a force constituting an opening force in mechanical seal.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0177">In the mechanical seal, the second processing member <b>20</b> corresponds to a compression ring, and when fluid pressure is applied to the second processing member <b>20</b>, the force of separating the second processing member <b>20</b> from the first processing member <b>10</b> is regarded as opening force.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0178">More specifically, when the pressure-receiving surfaces at a separating side, that is, the second processing surface <b>2</b> and the separation regulating surface <b>23</b> only are arranged in the second processing member <b>20</b> as shown in the first embodiment, all feeding pressure constitutes the opening force. When a pressure-receiving surface is also arranged at the backside of the second processing member <b>20</b>, specifically in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(B)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> described later, the difference between the feeding pressure acting as a separating force and the feeding pressure acting as surface-approaching pressure is the opening force.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0179">Now, other embodiments of the second processing member <b>20</b> are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0180">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(B)</figref>, an approach regulating surface <b>24</b> facing upward, that is, at the other side of the second processing surface <b>2</b>, is disposed at the inner periphery of the second processing member <b>20</b> exposed from the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0181">That is, the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> in this embodiment is comprised of a ring-accepting part <b>41</b>, an air introduction part <b>44</b>, and the approach regulating surface <b>24</b>. However, the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> may be one including at least one member selected from the ring-accepting part <b>41</b>, the spring-accepting part <b>42</b>, the spring <b>43</b>, the air introduction part <b>44</b>, and the approach regulating surface <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0182">The approach regulating surface <b>24</b> receives predetermined pressure applied to a processed fluid to generate a force of approaching the second processing surface <b>2</b> to the first processing surface <b>1</b>, thereby functioning in feeding surface-approaching pressure as a part of the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b>. On the other hand, the second processing surface <b>2</b> and the separation regulating surface <b>23</b> receive predetermined pressure applied to a processed fluid to generate a force of separating the second processing surface <b>2</b> from the first processing surface <b>1</b>, thereby functioning in feeding apart of the separating force.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0183">The approach regulating surface <b>24</b>, the second processing surface <b>2</b> and the separation regulating surface <b>23</b> are pressure-receiving surfaces receiving feeding pressure of the processed fluid, and depending on its direction, exhibits different actions, that is, generation of the surface-approaching pressure and generation of a separating force.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0184">The ratio (area ratio A<b>1</b>/A<b>2</b>) of a projected area A<b>1</b> of the approach regulating surface <b>24</b> projected on a virtual plane perpendicular to the direction of approaching and separating the processing surfaces, that is, in the direction of rising and setting of the second ring <b>20</b>, to a total area A<b>2</b> of the projected area of the second processing surface <b>2</b> and the separation regulating surface <b>23</b> of the second processing member <b>20</b> projected on the virtual plane is called balance ratio K which is important for regulation of the opening force.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0185">Both the top of the approach regulating surface <b>24</b> and the top of the separation regulating surface <b>23</b> are defined by the inner periphery <b>25</b> of the circular second regulating part <b>20</b>, that is, by top line L<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the balance ratio is regulated for deciding the place where base line L<b>2</b> of the approach regulating surface <b>24</b> is to be placed.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0186">That is, in this embodiment, when the feeding pressure of the processed fluid is utilized as opening force, the total projected area of the second processing surface <b>2</b> and the separation regulating surface <b>23</b> is made larger than the projected area of the approach regulating surface <b>24</b>, thereby generating an opening force in accordance with the area ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0187">The opening force can be regulated by the pressure of the processed fluid, that is, the fluid pressure, by changing the balance line, that is, by changing the area A<b>1</b> of the approach regulating surface <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0188">Sliding surface actual surface pressure P, that is, the fluid pressure out of the surface-approaching pressure, is calculated according to the following equation:

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P=P</i>1&#xd7;(<i>K&#x2212;k</i>)+<i>Ps </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0189">wherein P<b>1</b> represents the pressure of a processed fluid, that is, fluid pressure; K represents the balance ratio; k represents an opening force coefficient; and Ps represents a spring and back pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0190">By regulating this balance line to regulate the sliding surface actual surface pressure P, the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is formed as a desired minute space, thereby forming a film of the fluid to make the product minute and effecting uniform reaction processing.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0191">Usually, as the thickness of a thin film fluid between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is decreased, the product can be made finer. On the other hand, as the thickness of the thin film fluid is increased, processing becomes rough and the throughput per unit time is increased. By regulating the sliding surface actual surface pressure P on the sliding surface, the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> can be regulated to realize the desired uniform reaction and to obtain the minute product. Hereinafter, the sliding surface actual surface pressure P is referred to as surface pressure P.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0192">From this relation, it is concluded that when the product is to be made coarse, the balance ratio may be decreased, the surface pressure P may be decreased, the space may be increased and the thickness of the film may be increased. On the other hand, when the product is to be made finer, the balance ratio may be increased, the surface pressure P may be increased, the space may be decreased and the thickness of the film may be decreased.</p>

<p id="p-0187" num="0194">As described above, the space is regulated in consideration of the pressing pressure of the spring <b>43</b> and the air pressure of the air introduction part <b>44</b>. Regulation of the fluid pressure, that is, the feeding pressure of the processed fluid, and regulation of the rotation of the first processing member <b>10</b> for regulating centrifugal force, that is, the rotation of the first holder <b>11</b>, are also important factors to regulate the space.</p>

<p id="p-0237" num="0244">The structure of the receiving depression <b>124</b> is similar to that in the embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref> (the first processing member <b>101</b> corresponds to the first ring <b>10</b>, the first holder <b>111</b> to the first holder <b>11</b>, the second processing member <b>102</b> to the second ring <b>20</b>, and the second holder <b>121</b> to the second holder <b>21</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0245">Then, the second holder <b>121</b> is provided with the bias mechanism <b>103</b>. The bias mechanism <b>103</b> preferably uses an elastic body such as spring. The bias mechanism <b>103</b> corresponds to the surface-approaching pressure imparting mechanism <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref> and has the same structure. That is, the bias mechanism <b>103</b> presses that side (bottom) of the second processing member <b>102</b> which is opposite to the processing surface <b>120</b> and biases each position of the second processing member <b>102</b> uniformly downward to the first processing member <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0246">On the other hand, the inner diameter of the receiving depression <b>124</b> is made larger than the outer diameter of the second processing member <b>102</b>, so that when arranged concentrically as described above, a gap t<b>1</b> is arranged between outer periphery <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the second processing member <b>102</b> and inner periphery of the receiving depression <b>124</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0247">Similarly, a gap t<b>2</b> is arranged between inner periphery <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the second processing member <b>102</b> and outer periphery of the central part <b>22</b> of the receiving depression <b>124</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(B)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0248">The gaps t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b> are those for absorbing vibration and eccentric behavior and are set to be in a size to secure operational dimensions or more and to enable sealing. For example, when the diameter of the first processing member <b>101</b> is 100 mm to 400 mm, the gaps t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b> are preferably 0.05 mm to 0.3 mm, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0249">The first holder <b>111</b> is fixed integrally with the shaft <b>50</b> and rotated with the shaft <b>50</b>. The second processing member <b>102</b> is not rotated relative to the second holder <b>121</b> by a baffle (not shown). However, for securing 0.1 micron to 10 micron clearance necessary for processing, that is, the minute gap t between the processing surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(B)</figref>, a gap t<b>3</b> is arranged between the bottom of the receiving depression <b>124</b>, that is, the top part, and the surface facing a top part <b>124</b><i>a </i>of the second processing member <b>102</b>, that is, the upper part. The gap t<b>3</b> is established in consideration of the clearance and the vibration and elongation of the shaft <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0250">As described above, by the provision of the gaps t<b>1</b> to t<b>3</b>, the second processing member <b>102</b> can move not only in the direction z<b>1</b> of approaching to and separating from the first processing member <b>101</b>, but also relative to the center and inclination, that is, the direction z<b>2</b> of the processing surface <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0251">That is, in this embodiment, the bias mechanism <b>103</b> and the gaps t<b>1</b> to t<b>3</b> constitute a floating mechanism, and by this floating mechanism, the center and inclination of at least the second processing member <b>102</b> are made variable in the small range of several &#x3bc;m to several mm. The run-out and expansion of the rotary shaft and the surface vibration and vibration of the first processing member <b>101</b> are absorbed.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0252">The groove <b>112</b> on the processing surface <b>110</b> of the first processing member <b>101</b> is described in more detail. The rear end of the groove <b>112</b> reaches the inner periphery <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the first processing member <b>101</b>, and its top is elongated toward the outside y of the first processing member <b>101</b>, that is, toward the outer periphery. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(A)</figref>, the sectional area of the groove <b>112</b> is gradually decreased in the direction from the center x of the circular first processing member <b>101</b> to the outside y of the first processing member <b>101</b>, that is, toward the outer periphery.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0253">The distance w<b>1</b> of the left and right sides <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the groove <b>112</b> is decreased in the direction from the center x of the first processing member <b>101</b> to the outside y of the first processing member <b>101</b>, that is, toward the outer periphery. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(B)</figref>, the depth w<b>2</b> of the groove <b>112</b> is decreased in the direction from the center x of the first processing member <b>101</b> to the outside y of the first processing member <b>101</b>, that is, toward the outer periphery. That is, the bottom <b>112</b><i>c </i>of the groove <b>112</b> is decreased in depth in the direction from the center x of the first processing member <b>101</b> to the outside y of the first processing member <b>101</b>, that is, toward the outer periphery.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0254">As described above, the groove <b>112</b> is gradually decreased both in width and depth toward the outside y, that is, toward the outer periphery, and its sectional area is gradually decreased toward the outside y. Then, the top of the groove <b>112</b>, that is, the y side, is a dead end. That is, the top of the groove <b>112</b>, that is, the y side does not reach the outer periphery <b>101</b><i>b </i>of the first processing member <b>101</b>, and an outer flat surface <b>113</b> is interposed between the top of the groove <b>112</b> and the outer periphery <b>101</b><i>b</i>. The outer flat surface <b>113</b> is a part of the processing surface <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0255">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the left and right sides <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>and the bottom <b>112</b><i>c </i>of the groove <b>112</b> constitute a flow path limiting part. This flow path limiting part, the flat part around the groove <b>112</b> of the first processing member <b>101</b>, and the flat part of the second processing member <b>102</b> constitute the dynamical pressure generating mechanism <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0256">However, only one of the width and depth of the groove <b>112</b> may be constituted as described above to decrease the sectional area.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0257">While the first processing member <b>101</b> rotates, the dynamical pressure generating mechanism <b>104</b> generates a force in the direction of separating the processing members <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> from each other to secure a desired minute space between the processing members <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> by a fluid passing through the space between the processing members <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. By generation of such dynamical pressure, a 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m minute space can be generated between the processing surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. A minute space like that can be regulated and selected depending on the object of processing, but is preferably 1 &#x3bc;m to 6 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 1 &#x3bc;m to 2 &#x3bc;m. This apparatus can realize a uniform reaction and form microparticles by the minute space, which are not achieved in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0258">The grooves <b>112</b> . . . <b>112</b> may extend straight from the center x to the outside y. In this embodiment, however, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(A)</figref>, the grooves <b>112</b> are curved to extend such that with respect to a rotation direction r of the first processing member <b>101</b>, the center x of the groove <b>112</b> is positioned in front of the outside y of the groove <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0259">In this manner, the grooves <b>112</b> . . . <b>112</b> are curved to extend so that the separation force by the dynamical pressure generating mechanism <b>104</b> can be effectively generated.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0260">Then, the working of this apparatus is described.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0261">A first processed fluid R which has been introduced from a hopper <b>170</b> and has passed through the first introduction part d<b>1</b>, passes through the hollow part of the circular second processing member <b>102</b>, and the first processed fluid R that has received the centrifugal force resulting from rotation of the first processing member <b>101</b> enters the space between the processing members <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, and uniform reaction and generation of microparticles are effected and processed between the processing surface <b>110</b> of the rotating first processing member <b>101</b> and the processing surface <b>120</b> of the second processing member <b>102</b>, then exits from the processing members <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> and is then discharged from the discharge part <b>108</b> to the side of the decompression pump Q. Hereinafter, the first processed fluid R is referred to simply as a fluid R, if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0262">In the foregoing description, the fluid R that has entered the hollow part of the circular second processing member <b>102</b> first enters the groove <b>112</b> of the rotating first processing member <b>101</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(A)</figref>. On the other hand, the processing surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> that are mirror-polished flat parts are kept airtight even by passing a gas such as air or nitrogen. Accordingly, even if the centrifugal force by rotation is received, the fluid cannot enter through the groove <b>112</b> into the space between the processing surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> that are pushed against each other by the bias mechanism <b>103</b>. However, the fluid R gradually runs against both the sides <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>and the bottom <b>112</b><i>c </i>of the groove <b>112</b> formed as a flow path limiting part to generate dynamical pressure acting in the direction of separating the processing surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> from each other. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(B)</figref>, the fluid R can thereby exude from the groove <b>112</b> to the flat surface, to secure a minute gap t, that is, clearance, between the processing surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. Then, a uniform reaction and generation of microparticles are effected and processed between the mirror-polished flat surfaces. The groove <b>112</b> has been curved so that the centrifugal force is applied more accurately to the fluid to make generation of dynamical pressure more effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0263">In this manner, the processing apparatus can secure a minute and uniform gap, that is, clearance, between the mirror surfaces, that is, the processing surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, by the balance between the dynamical pressure and the bias force by the bias mechanism <b>103</b>. By the structure described above, the minute gap can be as superfine as 1 &#x3bc;m or less.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0264">By utilizing the floating mechanism, the automatic regulation of alignment between the processing surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> becomes possible, and the clearance in each position between the processing surfaces <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> can be prevented from varying against physical deformation of each part by rotation or generated heat, and the minute gap in each position can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0265">In the embodiment described above, the floating mechanism is a mechanism arranged for the second holder <b>121</b> only. Alternatively, the floating mechanism can be arranged in the first holder <b>111</b> instead of, or together with, the second holder <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0266">Other embodiments of the groove <b>112</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0263" num="0270">In the embodiments described above, at least either the width or depth of the groove <b>112</b> is gradually decreased in size in the direction from inside to outside the first processing member <b>101</b>, thereby constituting a flow path limiting part.

As shown the embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the width and depth of the groove <b>112</b> can be changed as described above thereby slanting the bottom and both sides of the groove <b>112</b>, so that the slanted surfaces serves as a pressure-receiving part toward the fluid to generate dynamical pressure. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(A)</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(B)</figref>, on the other hand, the termination surface of the groove <b>112</b> serves as a pressure-receiving part toward the fluid to generate dynamical pressure.</p>

<p id="p-0266" num="0273">For example, in the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and FIG. <b>21</b> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the groove <b>112</b> does not penetrate to the outer side of the first processing member <b>101</b>. That is, there is an outer flat surface <b>113</b> between the outer periphery of the first processing member <b>101</b> and the groove <b>112</b>. However, the structure of the groove <b>112</b> is not limited to such embodiment, and the groove <b>112</b> may reach the outer periphery of the first processing member <b>101</b> as long as the dynamical pressure can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0274">For example, in the case of the first processing member <b>101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23(B)</figref>, as shown in the dotted line, a part having a smaller sectional area than other sites of the groove <b>112</b> can be formed on the outer flat surface <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0275">The groove <b>112</b> may be formed so as to be gradually decreased in size in the direction from inside to outside as described above, and the part (terminal) of the groove <b>112</b> that had reached the outer periphery of the first processing member <b>101</b> may have the minimum sectional area (not shown).

<p id="p-0269" num="0276">Now, the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> are summarized.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0277">This processing apparatus is a processing apparatus wherein a rotating member having a flat processing surface and a fixed member having a flat processing surface are opposite to each other so as to be concentric with each other, and while the rotating member is rotated, a material to be reacted is fed through an opening of the fixed member and subjected to a reaction between the opposite flat processing surfaces of both members, wherein the rotating member is provided with a pressurizing mechanism by which pressure is generated to maintain clearance without mechanically regulating clearance and enables 1 &#x3bc;m to 6 &#x3bc;m microscopic clearance not attainable by mechanical regulation of clearance, thereby significantly improving an ability to atomize formed particles and an ability to uniformize the reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0278">That is, this processing apparatus have a rotating member and a fixed member each having a flat processing surface in the outer periphery thereof and has a sealing mechanism in a plane on the flat processing surface, thereby providing a high speed rotation processing apparatus generating hydrostatic force, hydrodynamic force, or aerostatic-aerodynamic force. The force generates a minute space between the sealed surfaces, and provides a reaction processing apparatus with a function of non-contact and mechanically safe and high-level pulvelization and uniformizing of reactions. One factor for forming this minute space is due to the rotation speed of the rotating member, and the other factor is due to a pressure difference between the introduction side and discharge side of a processed material (fluid). When a pressure imparting mechanism is not arranged in the introduction side, that is, when the processed material (fluid) is introduced at atmospheric pressure, there is no pressure difference, and thus the sealed surfaces should be separated by only the rotation speed of the rotating member. This is known as hydrodynamic or aerodynamic force.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0279"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18(A)</figref> shows the apparatus wherein a decompression pump Q is connected to the discharge part of the reaction apparatus G, but as described above, the reaction apparatus G may be arranged in a decompression tank T without arranging the housing <b>106</b> and the decomposition pump Q, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(A)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0280">In this case, the tank T is decompressed in a vacuum or in an almost vacuum, whereby the processed product formed in the reaction apparatus G is sprayed in a mist form in the tank T, and the processed material colliding with, and running down along, the inner wall of the tank T can be recovered, or a gas (vapor) separated from the processed material and filled in an upper part of the tank T, unlike the processed material running down along the wall, can be recovered to obtain the objective product after processing.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0281">When the decompression pump Q is used, an airtight tank T is connected via the decompression pump Q to the processing apparatus G, whereby the processed material after processing can be formed into mist to separate and extract the objective product.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0282">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24(C)</figref>, the decompression pump Q is connected directly to the tank T, and the decompression pump Q and a discharge part for fluid R, different from the decompression pump Q, are connected to the tank T, whereby the objective product can be separated.

This inclined surface (pressure-receiving surface <b>23</b>) is formed such that the distance in the axial direction between the upstream end in the direction of flow of the fluid and the processing surface of the processing member provided with the depression <b>13</b> is longer than the distance between the downstream end and the aforesaid processing surface. The downstream end of this inclined surface in the direction of flow of the fluid is arranged preferably on the projected area in the axial direction of the depression <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0381">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(A)</figref>, a downstream end <b>60</b> of the inclined surface (pressure-receiving surface <b>23</b>) is arranged on the projected area in the axial direction of the depression <b>13</b>. The angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> of the inclined surface to the second processing surface <b>2</b> is preferably in the range of 0.1&#xb0; to 85&#xb0;, more preferably in the range of 10&#xb0; to 55&#xb0;, still more preferably in the range of 15&#xb0; to 45&#xb0;.

<p id="p-0375" num="0382">The depressions <b>13</b> may be connected to one another or separated from one another as described above. When the depressions <b>13</b> are separated, the upstream end at the innermost peripheral side of the first processing surface <b>1</b> is <b>13</b>-<i>b</i>, and the upstream end at the outermost peripheral side of the first processing surface <b>1</b> is <b>13</b>-<i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0383">In the foregoing description, the depression <b>13</b> was formed on the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the pressure-receiving surface <b>23</b> was formed on the second processing surface <b>2</b>.

The elevation angle (&#x3b8;<b>1</b>) is arranged at more than 0&#xb0; and less than 90&#xb0;, and when the reaction speed is high, the angle (&#x3b8;<b>1</b>) is preferably arranged at 1&#xb0; to 45&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0389">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(B)</figref>, the direction of introduction of the second processing surface <b>2</b> from the opening d<b>20</b> has directionality in a plane along the second processing surface <b>2</b>. The direction of introduction of the second fluid is in the direction in which a component on the processing surface is made apart in the radial direction and in the direction in which the component is forwarded in the rotation direction of the fluid between the rotating processing surfaces.

When the reaction speed is high, the angle (&#x3b8;<b>2</b>) may be small, and when the reaction speed is low, the angle (&#x3b8;<b>2</b>) is preferably arranged larger. This angle can vary depending on various conditions such as the type of fluid, the reaction speed, viscosity, and the rotation speed of the processing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0392">The bore diameter of the opening d<b>20</b> is preferably 0.2 &#x3bc;m to 3000 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 10 &#x3bc;m to 1000 &#x3bc;m.

Depending on whether the fluid is intended to be transferred straight or dispersed, the shape of the opening d<b>20</b> is preferably changed and can be changed depending on various conditions such as the type of fluid, reaction speed, viscosity, and rotation speed of the processing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0393">The opening d<b>20</b> in the separate flow path may be arranged at a position nearer to the outer diameter than a position where the direction of flow upon introduction by the micro-pump effect from the depression arranged in the first processing surface <b>1</b> is converted into the direction of flow of a spiral laminar flow formed between the processing surfaces. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(B)</figref>, the distance n from the outermost side in the radial direction of the processing surface of the depression arranged in the first processing surface <b>1</b> to the outside in the radial direction is preferably 0.5 mm or more. When a plurality of openings are arranged for the same fluid, the openings are arranged preferably concentrically. When a plurality of openings are arranged for different fluids, the openings are arranged preferably concentrically in positions different in radius. This is effective for the reactions such as cases (1) A+B&#x2192;C and (2) C+D&#x2192;E should occur in due order, but other case, i.e., A+B+C&#x2192;F should not occur, or for circumventing a problem that an intended reaction does not occur due to insufficient contact among reactants.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0394">The processing members are dipped in a fluid, and a fluid obtained by reaction between the processing surfaces can be directly introduced into a liquid outside the processing members or into a gas other than air.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0395">Further, ultrasonic energy can be applied to the material just after being discharged from the space between the processing surfaces or from the processing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0396">Then, the case where temperature regulating mechanisms J<b>1</b> and J<b>2</b> are arranged in at least one of the first processing member <b>10</b> and the second processing member <b>20</b> for generating a temperature difference between the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0397">The temperature regulating mechanism is not particularly limited. A cooling part is arranged in the processing members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> when cooling is intended. Specifically, a piping for passing ice water and various cooling media or a cooling element such as a Peltier device capable of electric or chemical cooling is attached to the processing members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0398">When heating is intended, a heating part is arranged in the processing members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>. Specifically, steam as a temperature regulating medium, a piping for passing various hot media, and a heating element such as an electric heater capable of electric or chemical heating is attached to the processing members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0399">An accepting part for a new temperature regulating medium capable of directly contacting with the processing members may be arranged in the ring-accepting part. The temperature of the processing surfaces can be regulated by heat conduction of the processing members. Alternatively, a cooling or heating element may be embedded in the processing members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> and electrified, or a path for passing a cooling medium may be embedded, and a temperature regulating medium (cooling medium) is passed through the path, whereby the temperature of the processing surfaces can be regulated from the inside. By way of example, the temperature regulating mechanisms J<b>1</b> and J<b>2</b> which are pipes (jackets) arranged inside the processing members <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0400">By utilizing the temperature regulating mechanisms J<b>1</b> and J<b>2</b>, the temperature of one of the processing surfaces is made higher than that of the other, to generate a temperature difference between the processing surfaces. For example, the first processing member <b>10</b> is heated to 60&#xb0; C. by any of the methods, and the second processing member <b>20</b> is set at 15&#xb0; C. by any of the methods. In this case, the temperature of the fluid introduced between the processing surfaces is changed from 60&#xb0; C. to 15&#xb0; C. in the direction from the first processing surface <b>1</b> to the second processing surface <b>2</b>. That is, the fluid between the processing surfaces has a temperature gradient. The fluid between the processing surfaces initiates convection due to the temperature gradient, and a flow in a direction perpendicular to the processing surface is generated. The &#x201c;flow in a direction perpendicular to the processing surface&#x201d; refers to a flow in which components flowing in a direction perpendicular to at least the processing surface are contained in flowing components.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0401">Even when the first processing surface <b>1</b> or the second processing surface <b>2</b> rotates, the flow in a direction perpendicular to the processing surface is continued, and thus the flow in a direction perpendicular to the processing surface can be added to a spiral laminar flow between the processing surfaces caused by rotation of the processing surfaces. The temperature difference between the processing surfaces is 1&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C., preferably 5&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0402">The rotary shaft <b>50</b> in this apparatus is not limited to a vertically arranged shaft. For example, the rotary shaft may be arranged at a slant. This is because the influence of gravity can be substantially eliminated by a thin film fluid formed between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> during processing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the first introduction part d<b>1</b> coincides with the shaft center of the second ring <b>20</b> in the second holder <b>21</b> and extends vertically. However, the first introduction part d<b>1</b> is not limited to the one coinciding with the shaft center of the second ring <b>20</b>, and as far as it can supply the first fluid to the space surrounded with the rings <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, the part d<b>1</b> may be arranged at a position outside the shaft center in the central part <b>22</b> of the second holder <b>21</b> and may extend obliquely as well as vertically. Regardless of the angle at which the part d<b>1</b> is arranged, a flow perpendicular to the processing surface can be generated by the temperature gradient between the processing surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0403">When the temperature gradient of the fluid between the processing surfaces is low, heat conduction merely occurs in the fluid, but when the temperature gradient exceeds a certain border value, a phenomenon called Benard convection is generated in the fluid. This phenomenon is governed by Rayleigh number Ra, a dimensionless number, defined by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Ra=L</i><sup>3</sup><i>&#xb7;g&#xb7;&#x3b2;&#xb7;&#x394;T</i>/(&#x3b1;&#xb7;&#x3bd;)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein L is the distance between processing surfaces; g is gravitational acceleration; &#x3b2; is coefficient of volumetric thermal expansion of fluid; &#x3bd; is dynamic viscosity of fluid; &#x3b1; is heat diffusivity of fluid; and &#x394;T is temperature difference between processing surfaces. The critical Rayleigh number at which Benard convection is initiated to occur, although varying depending on the properties of a boundary phase between the processing surface and the fluid, is regarded as about 1700. At a value higher than this value, Benard convection occurs. Under the condition where the Rayleigh number Ra is a large value of about 10<sup>10 </sup>or more, the fluid becomes a turbulent flow. That is, the temperature difference &#x394;T between the processing surfaces or the distance L between the processing surfaces in this apparatus are regulated such that the Rayleigh number Ra becomes 1700 or more, whereby a flow perpendicular to the processing surface can be generated between the processing surfaces, and the reaction procedures described above can be carried out.
</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0404">However, the Benard convection hardly occurs when the distance between the processing surfaces is about 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m. Strictly, when the Rayleigh number is applied to a fluid between the processing surfaces having a distance of 10 &#x3bc;m or less therebetween to examine the conditions under which Benard convection is generated, the temperature difference should be several thousands of degrees or more in the case of water, which is practically difficult. Benard convection is one related to density difference in temperature gradient of a fluid, that is, to gravity. When the distance between the processing surfaces is 10 &#x3bc;m or less, there is high possibility of minute gravity field, and in such a place, buoyancy convection is suppressed. That is, it is the case where the distance between the processing surfaces is 10 &#x3bc;m or more that Benard convection actually occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0405">When the distance between the processing surfaces is about 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m, convection is generated not due to density difference but due to surface tension difference of a fluid resulting from temperature gradient. Such convection is Marangoni convection. This phenomenon is governed by Marangoni number Ma, a dimensionless number, defined by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>Ma=&#x3c3;&#xb7;&#x394;T&#xb7;L</i>/(&#x3c1;&#xb7;&#x3bd;&#xb7;&#x3b1;)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
wherein L is the distance between processing surfaces; &#x3bd; is dynamic viscosity of fluid; &#x3b1; is heat diffusivity of fluid; &#x394;T is temperature difference between processing surfaces; &#x3c1; is density of fluid; and &#x3c3; is temperature coefficient of surface tension (temperature gradient of surface tension). The critical Marangoni number at which Marangoni convection is initiated to occur is about 80, and under the conditions where the Marangoni number is higher than this value, Marangoni convection occurs. That is, the temperature difference &#x394;T between the processing surfaces or the distance L between the processing surfaces in this apparatus is regulated such that the Marangoni number Ma becomes 80 or more, whereby a flow perpendicular to the processing surface can be generated between the processing surfaces even if the distance therebetween is as small as 10 &#x3bc;m or less, and the reaction procedures described above can be carried out.

<p id="p-0407" num="0414">The materials for the processing surface arranged to be opposite to each other so as to be able to approach to and separate from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other, are not particularly limited, and the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> can be prepared from ceramics, sintered metals, abrasion-resistant steels, other metals subjected to hardening treatment, or rigid materials subjected to lining, coating or plating. In the present invention, the distance between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> arranged to be opposite to each other so as to be able to approach to and separate from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other, is 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m, particularly preferably 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0415">In addition, the space between the processing surfaces may be heated (warmed), or may be radiated with ultraviolet ray (UV). Particularly, when a difference in temperature is set between the first processing surface <b>1</b> and the second processing surface <b>2</b>, there is an advantage that since convection can be generated in a thin film fluid, the reaction can be promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0416">In order that separation of crystals does not occur due to a drop in liquid temperature before fluids are mixed, the temperature of the liquid sending tube extending from a pot for dissolution of the compound to a liquid spouting outlet in a mixing apparatus is preferably regulated so that the solution of the compound is always kept high at a temperature enough not to become supersaturated.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0417">The producing method is conducted in a container capable of securing a depressurized or vacuum state, so as to form a depressurized or vacuum state of a secondary side at which the fluid after processing is discharged thereby removing a gas generated during the separation, removing a gas discharged from the processing member, or removing the solvent of the fluid. By doing so, a fluid containing the biologically ingestible microparticles separated between the processing surfaces is discharged in an atomized state from the processing surfaces, even when the producing method and removal of the solvent are almost simultaneously conducted, so that the surface area of the fluid is increased, and there is extremely high advantage to the efficiency of removal of the solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0418">Hereinafter, specific aspects of the method for producing biologically ingestible microparticles, which are carried out using the apparatus described above, will be described. First, a method of separating biologically ingestible microparticles by change in solubility is described.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0419">In the thin film fluid formed between the processing surfaces in the apparatus described above, a solution containing a first solvent in which at least one kind of biologically ingestible microparticle material to be formed into microparticles has been dissolved is mixed with a solvent capable of serving as a second solvent in which the solubility of the biologically ingestible microparticle material is lower than in the first solvent, to separate biologically ingestible microparticles.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0420">The biological ingestion material includes drugs. The present invention can be carried out using various drugs. The drug is preferably an organic substance occurring in a substantially pure state. The drug should be dispersible with low solubility in at least one kind of solvent and soluble in at least one kind of solvent. The low solubility means that the drug has a solubility of less than about 10 mg/mL, preferably less than about 1 mg/mL, in a solvent (for example, water) at a processing temperature (for example, room temperature). Solubility means that the drug is soluble in an amount of not less than 10 mg/mL. If necessary, the solvent may be heated or cooled. Preferably a dispersant (surfactant), a water-soluble polymer, a stabilizer, a preservative, a pH regulating agent, and a tonicity agent are previously added to one of or both of the first and second solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0421">Suitable drugs can be selected from various known drugs including, for example, analgesic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anthelmintic agents, antiarrhythmic agents, antibiotics (including penicillin), anticoagulants, antihypotensive drugs, antidiabetic agents, antiepileptic drugs, antihistaminic agents, anti-malignant tumor agents, anti-obesity drugs, anorectic drugs, antihypertensive agents, antimuscarinic drugs, antimycobacterial agents, antineoplastic agents, immunosuppressive agents, antithyroid agents, antibacterial agents, antiviral agents, anti-anxiety drugs (hypnotics and neuroleptics), astringents, beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, blood preparations and plasma substitutes, myocardial inotropic agents, contrast media, corticosteroids, cough suppressants (expectorants and mucus-destructive agents), diagnostic agents, diagnostic image-forming agents, diuretic agents, dopaminergic agents (antiparkinson agents), hemostatic drugs, immunological agents, lipid regulatory agents, muscle relaxants, parasympathomimetic agents, parathyroid calcitonin and biphosphonates, prostaglandins, radioactive agents, sex hormones (including steroids), antiallergic agents, stimulants and anorexigenic agents, sympathomimetics, thyroid agents, vasodilators and xanthines, cataract remedies, and adrenal corticosteroids.

<p id="p-0419" num="0426">The content of the drug in the present invention is not particularly limited. A highly concentrated suspension can be prepared and diluted to an intended concentration to prepare a pharmaceutical.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0427">The stabilizer includes, for example, sodium edetate, sodium sulfite, sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium thiosulfate, dibutyl hydroxy toluene, and tocopherol.</p>

<p id="p-0423" num="0430">The tonicity agent includes, for example, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and mannitol.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0431">As the solvent used in a fluid containing at least one kind of biologically ingestible microparticle material in the present invention, water such as ultrapure water and ion-exchange water, a water-miscible organic solvent such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, acetone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and dimethylsulfoxide, and a water-immiscible organic solvent such as octane, cyclohexane, benzene, xylene, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate can be appropriately selected depending on the object.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0432">The biologically ingestible microparticles of the present invention are not particularly limited as long as they are intended to be ingested by the living body. Examples of such microparticles include: those which, like drugs in pharmaceutical preparations, are intended to be absorbed into the living body to exhibit their effect in the living body; those which, like barium sulfate as a contrast medium, pass through the living body; carrier substances of a chemical component in a drug delivery system; those which, like cosmetics, are applied to a skin of the living body; and intermediates between foods and the above substances.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0433">The separating reaction of microparticles occurs by forced uniform mixing between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> arranged to be opposite to each other so as to be able to approach to and separate from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other, in the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0434">First, a solution containing the first solvent is introduced through one flow path, that is, the first introduction part d<b>1</b> into the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> arranged to be opposite to each other so as to be able to approach to and separate from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other, thereby forming a thin film fluid out of the first fluid between the processing surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0435">Then, a solvent capable of serving as the second solvent in which the intended material has lower solubility than in the first solvent is introduced directly through another flow path, that is, the second introduction part d<b>2</b> into the thin film fluid out of the first fluid produced between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0436">As described above, the first solvent-containing solution and the second solvent are mixed in the space between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the distance of which is regulated by the pressure balance between the supply pressure of the fluid and the pressure exerted between the rotating processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, thereby effecting the separating reaction of microparticles.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0437">To effect the reaction between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the second fluid may be introduced through the first introduction part d<b>1</b> and the first fluid through the second introduction part d<b>2</b> (this applies to the Examples that follow), as opposed to the above description. That is, the expression &#x201c;first&#x201d; or &#x201c;second&#x201d; for each solvent has a meaning for merely discriminating an n<sup>th </sup>solvent among a plurality of solvents present, and a third or more solvents can also be present.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0438">As described above, the processing apparatus can be provided with a third introduction part d<b>3</b> in addition to the first introduction part d<b>1</b> and the second introduction part d<b>2</b>. In this case, the first solvent-containing solution, the second solvent, and a solution containing a stabilizer/dispersant can be introduced separately through the respective introduction parts into the processing apparatus. By doing so, the concentration and pressure of each solution can be controlled separately, and the separating reaction can be regulated more accurately. When the processing apparatus is provided with four or more introduction parts, the foregoing applies and fluids to be introduced into the processing apparatus can be subdivided in this manner.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0439">Then, the method of separating biologically ingestible microparticles by neutralization reaction or by pH change is described. The following method is characterized in that when biologically ingestible microparticles are produced by separating biologically ingestible microparticle materials in a fluid by neutralization reaction or pH change, the fluid is formed into a thin film fluid generated between the processing surfaces arranged to be opposite to each other so as to be able to approach to and separate from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other, thereby separating biologically ingestible microparticles by neutralization reaction or pH change.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0440">Hereinafter, specific examples of the present invention are described in more detail with reference to examples of biologically ingestible barium sulfate microparticles ingested as a contrast medium into the living body. However, the present invention is not limited to these examples.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0441">This reaction occurs by forced uniform mixing between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> arranged to be opposite to each other so as to be able to approach to and separate from each other, at least one of which rotates relative to the other, in the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0437" num="0444">As described above, the first fluid and the second fluid are allowed to join together in a thin film fluid formed between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the distance of which is regulated by the pressure balance between the supply pressure of the fluid and the pressure exerted between the rotating processing surfaces. The first fluid and the second fluid are mixed in the thin film fluid, and the two substances are reacted. Specifically, the reaction of forming biologically ingestible barium sulfate microparticles can be carried out by neutralization reaction or by pH change.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0445">Then, a method of obtaining biologically ingestible microparticles other than barium sulfate is described.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0446">Here, the simplest chemical reaction formula (Ion reaction formula) related to separation of barium sulfate exemplified above is as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Ionic Reaction Formula)
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Ba<sup>2+</sup>+SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;BaSO<sub>4 </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0447">The neutralization reaction in the present invention includes a neutralization reaction as the most fundamental acid-base reaction, that is, a neutralization reaction of negating the properties of both acid and base and simultaneously forming water and a salt, and a reaction wherein in the above ionic reaction formula, the cationic substance Ba<sup>2+</sup> and the anionic substance SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup> are reacted with each other to form the substance such as BaSO<sub>4</sub>. The acid and base in this case may be those defined by Arrhenius, Broensted-Lowry, or Lewis.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0448">Herein, the objective substance can be changed and obtained by changing the cationic or anionic substance to be used. The cationic or anionic substance is not particularly limited and may be a single atom ion such as Na<sup>+</sup> or Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, or a polyatomic ion such as NH<sup>4+</sup> or CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. The objective substance may also be a complex ion. Organic matters whose structure is partially ionized in solution as often observed particularly in medical drugs can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0449">Both the first and second fluids may contain the same ion.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0450">When the neutralization reaction is carried out, the reaction may be accompanied by change in solvent pH.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0451">The particle size, monodispersity or crystal form of the biologically ingestible microparticles obtained in the present invention can be regulated by changing the number of revolutions of the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the distance between the processing surfaces <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the flow rate and temperature of the thin film fluid, and the concentration of the starting materials.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0452">The biologically ingestible microparticles obtained in the present invention have desired particle size distribution/particle diameter distribution, the degree of crystallinity is 50% or more based on the total mass of the obtained particles, and a fluid containing the particles is a stable dispersion over hours, free of coagulating sedimentation or particle aggregation after preparation. The distance between the processing surfaces arranged to be opposite to each other can be freely regulated, so the particle diameter can be controlled, and at least one of the processing surfaces can rotate relative to the other, thereby controlling the crystal form freely.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0453">The dispersion obtained by the present invention is stable, and this dispersion is comprised of a liquid dispersing medium and the biologically ingestible microparticles. A pharmaceutical composition can be obtained by mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in the biologically ingestible microparticles or a dispersion containing the particles of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0454">When this dispersion is used as a suspended ophthalmic solution as shown in examples below, the solution in which the intended drug is not dissolved shall be used and has preferably pH 3 to pH 9, more preferably pH 3.0 to pH 6.5, depending on physical properties of the drug. A pH value outside this range is not preferable because of high stimulation on the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0455">It is preferable that 90% of the obtained biologically ingestible microparticles in particle size distribution/particle diameter distribution have a particle size of 500 nm or less (that is, those particles having a particle diameter larger than 500 nm account for less than 10% of the particles). When 90% of the microparticles in particle size distribution/particle diameter distribution have a particle size of 500 nm or less, coarse particles serve as cores to prevent the phenomenon of aggregation, so that the surface area is increased and the apparent solubility is increased, and therefore, the corneal permeability of the active ingredient in the suspended ophthalmic solution is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0456">From the viewpoint of filtration sterilization, 90% of the particles in a suspended ophthalmic solution in particle size distribution/particle diameter distribution have a particle size of preferably 220 nm or less, whereby the solution can be sterilized by filtration and can be sterilized more inexpensively than in the conventional art.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0457">The filtration sterilization filter that can be used may be any filter made of various materials as long as it is a commercial filter assured to be aseptic. Its materials include, for example, cellulose acetate, polycarbonate, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0458">The pore size of the filter is preferably 0.45 &#x3bc;m or less, and more preferably 0.22 &#x3bc;m or less. In the case of particle size distribution/particle diameter distribution higher than the above range, the filtration filter may be undesirably clogged and the yield may be undesirably decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0459">The dispersion stability of the suspended ophthalmic solution in the present invention can be improved by adding a surfactant and/or a water-soluble polymer to regulate the absolute value of zeta potential of the drug particles in the range of 20 mV to 150 mV. The amount of the surfactant/water-soluble polymer used in regulation of zeta potential varies depending on pH, but is preferably in the range of 0.05% to 3% in the suspended ophthalmic solution.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0460">In this manner, an aqueous dispersion (suspension) in which biologically ingestible microparticles having an average primary particle size of 0.5 nm to 10000 nm, preferably 1 nm to 500 nm, more preferably 30 nm to 200 nm have been dispersed can be prepared. When the dispersant is added to a solution containing biologically ingestible microparticle materials, an aqueous dispersion (suspension) in which biologically ingestible microparticles coordinated thereon with the dispersant have been dispersed can be prepared, and the obtained biologically ingestible microparticles are made very excellent in re-dispersibility. Because contamination in the production process is low and the degree of crystallization can be highly controlled in separating crystals, this production method is particularly convenient for obtaining biologically ingestible microparticles which, like pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, are intended to be ingested into the living body.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0461">The &#x201c;particle size&#x201d; used in this specification refers to an average particle size determined by usual particle size measuring methods known in the art such as a dynamic light scattering method/laser diffraction method.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0462">The effective dose level of the treatment drug is an effective dose for obtaining a desired therapeutic response to a specific administered composition and method. Accordingly, the selected dose level depends on a specific drug, a desired therapeutic effect, administration route, desired treatment duration, and other factors. As described above, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention exhibits a surprisingly high in vivo absorption ratio which will be described specifically in Examples below and is extremely useful.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0463">The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is considered particularly useful in oral and parenteral administration methods including intravenous injection. It is anticipated that water-sparingly-soluble drugs which could not be intravenously injected in a conventional way can be administered safely according to the present invention. Drugs which could not be orally administered due to poor bioavailability can be effectively administered according to the present invention.</p>

In Comparative Example 2, the sample was thereafter further finely divided, atomized and dispersed with an ultrathin film high-speed rotary pulverizer (SS5-100 manufactured by M Technique Co., Ltd.). In Comparative Example 4, none of the treatment was conducted, and only the pH adjustment of the bulk powder was conducted. Then, the bulk powders subjected to the above treatment were dissolved to prepare a separated suspension. The processing conditions and the particle size distribution/particle diameter distribution measurement results are shown in Table 2.</p>

<p id="p-0495" num="0502">While 0.05 mol/L nitric acid aqueous solution was sent as a first fluid from the center at a revolution number of 100 to 1000 rpm and at a sending solution temperature of 25&#xb0; C., a solution prepared by dissolving pirenoxine in 0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide was introduced as a second fluid into the space between the processing surfaces. The first and second fluids were mixed with each other in the thin film fluid, and a pirenoxine suspension was discharged from the processing surfaces. The recovered pirenoxine suspension was dialyzed with a dialysis tube against purified water to remove byproducts and then measured with a particle size distribution measuring instrument utilizing a dynamic light scattering method as measurement principle (trade name: Microtrac UPA150, manufactured by Nikkiso Co., Ltd.). The recovered pirenoxine suspension was dried, and its substance when identified with an X-ray diffraction/differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) instrument coincided with the pirenoxine bulk powder.</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0503">In Comparative Examples 5 and 6, on the other hand, pirenoxine bulk powders were preliminarily pulverized and dispersed at 18000 rpm for 30 min. with a homogenizer (CLEARMIX 2.2S manufactured by M Technique Co., Ltd.).

<p id="p-0503" num="0510">The cornea excised from Japanese domestic rabbit was fixed to a horizontal 2-chamber diffusion cell (effective area, 0.3 cm<sup>2</sup>; cell volume, 5 mL; temperature, 32&#xb0; C.) such that the corneal epithelium was faced with the donor side. A reservoir liquid was a phosphate isotonic buffer, pH 7.5. Each test solution in Examples 11 to 13 and Comparative Examples 5 to 7 was used at the donor side. The time when each test solution was added to the donor side was time 0, and the reservoir liquid was sampled with time. The pirenoxine concentration in the sampled solution was measured with HPLC, and pirenoxine that had moved in the cornea was evaluated. The results are shown in Table 7. The numerical values in the table are mean values in triplicate.</p>
