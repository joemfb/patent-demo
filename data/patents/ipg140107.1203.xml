<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a paper sheet processing apparatus (or paper sheet processing device) comprising a paper sheet housing part housing bills, cards, coupon tickets, and so on (hereafter collectively referred to as &#x201c;paper sheets&#x201d;) and detection means detecting that the paper sheet housing part has become full with the paper sheets.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, a bill processing apparatus, which is one of the embodiments of the paper sheet processing apparatus, is incorporated into a service device such as a game medium rental machine installed in a game hall, a vending machine or a ticket-vending machine installed in a public space, or the like which identifies the validity of a bill inserted from a bill insertion slot by a user and provides various types of products and services in accordance with a value of the bill having been judged as valid.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a bill processing apparatus usually comprises a bill conveyance mechanism that conveys a bill inserted into the bill insertion slot, a bill identification part that conducts validity judgment (also referred to as &#x201c;authenticity judgment&#x201d;) whether the bill to be conveyed is valid or not, and a bill housing part (bill housing stacker) housing one bill after another having been validated by the bill identification part. This bill housing part also has a function as a safe, which is configured attachable to and removable from the apparatus main body, and comprises a placing plate, on which a plurality of bills are stacked and housed, pressing means (presser spring) for biasing the placing plate, and a presser plate for pressing a bill onto the placing plate against a biasing force by the presser spring such that the bill is guided and positioned thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the bill is guided between the placing plate and the presser plate, the presser plate is driven from an initial position to a pressing position on the placing plate side and presses bills onto the placing plate in the pressing position. The, as the presser plate is driven to return to the initial position, the bills having been pressed onto the placing plate are pushed back by the biasing force of the presser spring so that the uppermost bill of the bills hits and contacts a regulatory part whereby a plurality of bills are stacked and housed one after another on the placing plate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Here, it is likely that the above-described bill housing part may fail in operation if too many bills are guided thereto such that detection means detecting that the number of bills on the placing plate reaches capacity limit is provided as disclosed in Patent Document 1. The detection means disclosed in Patent Document 1 detects a full state with the bills when a swinging lever is turned as bills are placed on a receiving plate (placing plate) inside a cassette in which the swinging lever has been rotatably installed. That is, the receiving plate is enabled to contact one end of the swinging lever when the full state with bills is reached, a slide lever engaged with the other end is raised by a lever action upon contacting the receiving plate, and the rising of the slide lever is detected by an optical sensor, having a light emitting part and alight receiving part, or a micro switch, etc., to detect that the receiving plate has become full with bills.

</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0007">In the above-described bill processing apparatus, since the full state with bills in the bill housing part is detected by detecting, via the swinging lever and the slide lever, a depressed position of the receiving plate on which the bills are placed, the number of parts may increase and cause inflation of manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0008">In the present invention, a paper sheet processing apparatus capable of inexpensively detecting that a paper sheet housing part has become full with paper sheets is provided.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means to Solve the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0009">In the present invention, a paper sheet processing apparatus comprises a paper sheet housing part, in which paper sheets are stacked and housed, a placing plate, which is installed inside the paper sheet housing part and moves as more paper sheets are stacked and housed, a magnetic body being magnetized, which is installed on the placing plate, a magnetic sensor, which detects a magnetism amount of the magnetic body, and determination means, which determines whether or not the magnetism amount detected by the magnetic sensor is equal to or greater than a threshold value. Further features of the present invention, its nature, and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and the following description of the preferred embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0050">A bill processing apparatus <b>1</b> of this embodiment is configured to be incorporable into, for example, various types of gaming machines such as slot machines, and the bill processing apparatus <b>1</b> includes an apparatus main body <b>2</b> and a bill housing part (bill stacker) <b>100</b> which is provided on the apparatus main body <b>2</b> and is capable of stacking and housing a great number of bills. The bill housing part <b>100</b> has a function as a safe and is configured to be mountable to and demountable from a frame <b>2</b>A constituting the apparatus main body <b>2</b>. In this embodiment, for example, it is possible to remove the bill housing part <b>100</b> from the frame <b>2</b>A of the apparatus main body <b>2</b> by pulling a handle <b>101</b> fixed to a front face thereof in a state that a lock mechanism (not shown) is unlocked.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0051">Here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the above-described bill processing apparatus <b>1</b> is mainly constituted of three structural bodies. That is, the bill processing apparatus <b>1</b> comprises the apparatus main body <b>2</b>, a stand (frame member) <b>2</b>D, in which the apparatus main body <b>2</b> is placed in a mountable/demountable manner, and a bill housing part <b>100</b>, installed into the stand <b>2</b>D in a mountable/demountable manner. Here, a plate <b>2</b>F that has installed thereon a sensor board <b>141</b> on which a magnetic sensor <b>140</b> to be described later and a reader/writer <b>142</b> are implemented is in turn installed onto a rear surface side of the apparatus main body <b>2</b> as a unit wherein the reader/writer <b>142</b> writes and reads information into and from a storage part (for example, an IC tag disposed in the bill housing part) in which bill information is written. The plate <b>2</b>F is interposed between the frame <b>2</b>A, constituting the apparatus main body, and a top surface of the stand <b>2</b>D and is fixed between these components.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the apparatus main body <b>2</b> has the frame <b>2</b>A and an open/close member <b>2</b>B configured to be opened and closed with its one end as a rotating center with respect to the frame <b>2</b>A. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the frame <b>2</b>A and the open/close member <b>2</b>B are configured to form a space (bill traveling route) <b>3</b> through which a bill is carried such that both frame and member face with each other across the space when the open/close member <b>2</b>B is closed for the frame <b>2</b>A, and to form a bill insertion slot <b>5</b> such that front exposed faces of both frame and member are aligned and that the bill traveling route <b>3</b> exits at the bill insertion slot <b>5</b>. In addition, the bill insertion slot <b>5</b> is a slit-like opening from which a short side of a bill can be inserted into the inside of the apparatus main body <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0053">In the apparatus main body <b>2</b>, a bill conveyance mechanism <b>6</b> that conveys a bill; an insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b> that detects the bill inserted into the bill insertion slot <b>5</b>; bill reading means <b>8</b> that is installed on a downstream side of the insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b> and reads information from the bill in a travelling state; a skew correction mechanism <b>10</b> that accurately positions and conveys the bill with respect to the bill reading means <b>8</b>; a movable piece passage detecting sensor that detects that the bill passes through movable pieces constituting the skew correction mechanism <b>10</b>; a discharge detecting sensor <b>18</b> that detects that the bill is discharged into the bill housing part <b>100</b>; a presser plate detecting sensor <b>23</b> for detecting a position of a presser plate <b>115</b> pressing the bill toward a placing plate <b>105</b> in the bill housing part <b>100</b>; a sensor (magnetic sensor <b>140</b>) for detecting whether bills stacked and housed in the bill housing part <b>100</b> are in a predetermined state or not; and control means <b>200</b> (a control circuit board <b>200</b>A; refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) for controlling the driving of the bill conveyance mechanism <b>6</b>, the bill reading means <b>8</b>, the skew correction mechanism <b>10</b>, and so on are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0054">Hereafter, the respective components described above will be described in detail. The bill traveling route <b>3</b> is extended from the bill insertion slot <b>5</b> toward the back side, and is formed to be bent so as to be inclined downward at its rear side, and to be eventually bent in the vertical direction. A discharge slot <b>3</b><i>a </i>from which the bill is discharged into the bill housing part <b>100</b> is formed in the bill traveling route <b>3</b>, and the bill discharged therefrom is fed into a feed port (receiving port) <b>103</b> of the bill housing part <b>100</b> in the vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0055">The bill conveyance mechanism <b>6</b> is a mechanism capable of conveying a bill inserted from the bill insertion slot <b>5</b> along the inserting direction, and of conveying back the bill in an insertion state toward the bill insertion slot <b>5</b>. The bill conveyance mechanism <b>6</b> comprises a motor <b>13</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) serving as a driving source installed in the apparatus main body <b>2</b>; and conveyor roller pairs (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B), (<b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B), (<b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B), and (<b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B) which are installed at predetermined intervals along the bill traveling direction in the bill traveling route <b>3</b>, and are driven to rotate by the motor <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0056">The conveyor roller pairs are installed so as to be partially exposed on the bill traveling route <b>3</b>, and all the pairs are constituted of driving rollers of the conveyor rollers <b>14</b>B, <b>15</b>B, <b>16</b>B, and <b>17</b>B installed on the underside of the bill traveling route <b>3</b> driven by the motor <b>13</b>; and pinch-rollers of the conveyor rollers <b>14</b>A, <b>15</b>A, <b>16</b>A, and <b>17</b>A installed on the upperside and driven by the these driving rollers. In addition, the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B) to first nip and hold therebetween the bill inserted from the bill insertion slot <b>5</b>, and to carry the bill toward the back side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, is installed in one portion of the center position of the bill traveling route <b>3</b>, and a couple of the conveyor roller pairs (<b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B), (<b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B), or (<b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B) being disposed in this order on the downstream side thereof are respectively installed in a couple of portions with a predetermined interval in the lateral direction of the bill traveling route <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0057">Further, the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B) disposed in the vicinity of the bill insertion slot <b>5</b> is usually in a state that the upper conveyor roller <b>14</b>A is spaced from the lower conveyor roller <b>14</b>B, and the upper conveyor roller <b>14</b>A is driven to move toward the lower conveyor roller <b>14</b>B to nip and hold the inserted bill therebetween when insertion of the bill is sensed by the insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b>. In addition, the upper conveyor roller <b>14</b>A is controllably driven to be pressed against or spaced from the conveyor roller <b>14</b>B by a driving source <b>70</b> (refer to a block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). The driving source <b>70</b> may comprise a motor, solenoid, and the like, and is installed in the open/close member <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0058">Then, the upper conveyor roller <b>14</b>A is spaced from the lower conveyor roller <b>14</b>B so as to release the load on the bill when a process (skew correction process) for positioning the bill for the bill reading means <b>8</b> by eliminating tilt of the inserted bill is executed by the skew correction mechanism <b>10</b>, and the upper conveyor roller <b>14</b>A is driven to move toward the lower conveyor roller <b>14</b>B again to nip and hold the bill therebetween when the skew correction process is completed. The skew correction mechanism <b>10</b> comprises a pair of right and left movable pieces <b>10</b>A (only one side is shown) that perform skew correction and the skew correction process is performed by driving a motor <b>40</b> for a skew driving mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0059">The conveyor rollers <b>14</b>B, <b>15</b>B, <b>16</b>B and <b>17</b>B installed on the underside of the bill traveling route <b>3</b> are, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, driven to rotate via the motor <b>13</b> and pulleys <b>14</b>C, <b>15</b>C, <b>16</b>C, and <b>17</b>C installed at the ends of the driving shafts of the respective conveyor rollers. That is, a driving pulley <b>13</b>A is installed on the output shaft of the motor <b>13</b>, and a driving belt <b>13</b>B is wrapped around between the pulleys <b>14</b>C, <b>15</b>C, <b>16</b>C, and <b>17</b>C installed at the ends of the driving shafts of the respective conveyor rollers and the driving pulley <b>13</b>A. In addition, tension pulleys are engaged in places with the driving belt <b>13</b>B, which prevents the driving belt <b>13</b>B from loosening.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0060">In accordance with the configuration described above, when the motor <b>13</b> is driven to normally rotate, the conveyor rollers <b>14</b>B, <b>15</b>B, <b>16</b>B, and <b>17</b>B are driven to normally rotate in synchronization therewith to carry the bill toward the insertion direction. When the motor <b>13</b> is driven to reversely rotate, the conveyor rollers <b>14</b>B, <b>15</b>B, <b>16</b>B, and <b>17</b>B are driven to reversely rotate in synchronization therewith to carry back the bill toward the bill insertion slot <b>5</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0061">The insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b> is to generate a detection signal when a bill inserted into the bill insertion slot <b>5</b> is detected. In this embodiment, the insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b> is installed between the pair of conveyor rollers (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B) and the skew correction mechanism <b>10</b>. The insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b> comprises, for example, an optical sensor such as a regressive reflection type photo sensor. However, the insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b> may comprise a mechanical sensor other than the optical sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0062">Further, the movable piece passage detecting sensor <b>12</b> is to generate a sensed signal when it is sensed that a front end of the bill passes through a pair of right and left movable pieces <b>10</b>A constituting the skew correction mechanism <b>10</b>, and the movable piece passage detecting sensor <b>12</b> is installed on the upstream side of the bill reading means <b>8</b>. The movable piece passage detecting sensor <b>12</b> also comprises an optical sensor or a mechanical sensor in the same way as mentioned before with respect to the insertion detecting sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0063">Further, the discharge detecting sensor <b>18</b> is to detect a trailing end of the bill passing through such that it is detected that the bill is discharged into the bill housing part <b>100</b>. The discharge detecting sensor <b>18</b> is disposed just in front of the receiving port <b>103</b> of the bill housing part <b>100</b> on the downstream side of the bill traveling route <b>3</b>. The discharge detecting sensor <b>18</b> also comprises an optical sensor or a mechanical sensor in the same way as the aforementioned insertion detecting sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0064">The bill reading means <b>8</b> reads bill information on the bill carried in a state that the skew is eliminated by the skew correction mechanism <b>10</b> (in a state that the bill is accurately positioned), and judges whether the bill is true or false. In detail, for example, the bill reading means <b>8</b> may comprise a line sensor that performs reading of the bill such that a bill to be carried is irradiated with light from upper and lower sides, and transmitted light therethrough and reflected light therefrom are detected by a light receiving element. A line sensor is shown in the drawing, and an optical signal read by the line sensor is photoelectric-converted, and the signal is compared and checked with data of a legitimate bill stored in advance, which makes it possible to identify the authenticity of the bill to be carried.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0065">The bill housing part <b>100</b> stacks and houses bills one after another after the bills are identified as being legitimate by the bill reading means <b>8</b>. Here, the configuration of the bill housing part <b>100</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 14</figref> in addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0066">Note that, among these drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view showing an interior configuration of the bill housing part, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a front view of the placing plate as viewed from a back side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a front view showing the main body frame of the bill housing part with the placing plate removed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a view showing an example of a configuration of the magnetic sensor implemented on the sensor board, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a view showing a relationship between a magnet and the magnetic sensor, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a side view showing a state that the magnetic sensor is not detecting magnetism of the magnet because of a shield body, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a side view showing a state that the magnetic sensor detects the magnetism of the magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the main body frame <b>100</b>A constituting the bill housing part <b>100</b> is formed into a substantially rectangular parallelepiped (or cuboid) shape, and one end of bias means (e.g., bias spring) <b>106</b> is attached to an interior side of a front wall <b>102</b><i>a </i>thereof, and a placing plate <b>105</b> on which bills to be fed via the above-described receiving port <b>103</b> are sequentially stacked is provided to the other end thereof. Therefore, the placing plate <b>105</b> is in a state that it is pressed toward the presser plate <b>115</b>, which will be described later, by the bias means <b>106</b>. The placing plate <b>105</b> has a plate shape and a plate area larger than those of a bill to be housed and it is possible to place and house a bill in a state that wrinkles and bent portions are stretched and bills are housed in a vertical manner in a housing space defined by the main body frame <b>100</b>A such that the placing plate <b>105</b> can slide to-and-fro in the housing space to be described later by a biasing force of the biasing means (spring) and a pressing force of the presser plate as a counter force to the biasing force. The housing space of the main body frame <b>100</b>A comprises, in the order from the back side, a compartment in which the presser plate driving mechanism <b>120</b> of the presser plate <b>115</b>; a compartment of the press standby part <b>108</b>; a compartment of regulatory members <b>110</b> and an opening <b>110</b>A; and a compartment in which bills are stacked and housed onto the placing plate <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0068">In the main body frame <b>100</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, the presser standby part in which bills having dropped from a receiving port <b>103</b> are kept and held is provided. A pair of regulatory members <b>110</b> are extending in a vertical direction and disposed on both sides of the placing plate <b>105</b> of the press standby part <b>108</b>. An opening <b>110</b>A, through which the presser plate <b>115</b> passes in a process of successively stacking bills onto the placing plate <b>105</b>, is formed between the pair of regulatory members <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0069">Further, protruding walls <b>100</b>B are formed on both side walls inside the main body frame <b>100</b>A such that the placing plate <b>105</b> may hit and contact thereon when the placing plate is pressed by the biasing means <b>106</b>. The protruding walls <b>100</b>B fulfill a role to stably hold the stacked bills by hit and contact on both sides of the uppermost bill of the stacked bills when the presser plate <b>105</b> is biased by the biasing means as bills are successively stacked on the placing plate <b>105</b>. The protruding walls <b>100</b>B are provided with contact faces for hitting and contacting the placing plate <b>105</b> thereon as they are flush with faces of the pair of regulatory members <b>110</b> on the presser plate <b>105</b> side. Therefore, the faces of the protruding walls <b>100</b>B and the regulatory members <b>110</b> are substantially parallel to the placing face of the placing plate <b>105</b>, thereby enabling the housed bills to be stably held.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0070">Further, the presser plate <b>115</b> that presses bills having fallen in the press standby part <b>108</b> from the receiving port <b>103</b> toward the placing plate <b>105</b> is arranged in the main body frame <b>100</b>A. The presser plate <b>115</b> is formed in such a size that it may be capable of reciprocating through an opening formed between the pair of regulatory members <b>110</b> and is driven to reciprocate between a position (pressing position) where the bills are pressed onto the placing plate <b>105</b> and another position (initial position) where the press standby part <b>108</b> is opened.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0071">The presser plate <b>115</b> is driven to reciprocate as described above via a presser plate driving mechanism <b>120</b> installed in the main body frame <b>100</b>A. The presser plate driving mechanism <b>120</b> comprises a pair of link members <b>115</b><i>a </i>and <b>115</b><i>b </i>having respective ends thereof supported pivotally by the presser plate <b>115</b> so as to allow the presser plate <b>115</b> to reciprocate in an arrow A direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and these link members <b>115</b><i>a </i>and <b>115</b><i>b </i>are connected in a shape of letter &#x201c;X&#x201d;, and the other ends opposite to the respective ends are supported pivotally by a movable member <b>122</b> installed movably in a vertical direction (an arrow B direction). A rack <b>122</b>A is formed in the movable member <b>122</b> along an arrow B direction and geared (engaged) with a pinion <b>124</b>A constituting the presser plate driving mechanism <b>120</b> (the pinion is arranged coaxially with the gear <b>124</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a housing part side gear train <b>124</b> constituting the presser plate driving mechanism <b>120</b> is connected to the pinion. In this case, in this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, a driving source (a motor <b>20</b>) and a main body side gear train <b>21</b> sequentially engaged with the motor <b>20</b> are installed in the above-described apparatus main body <b>2</b>, and when the bill housing part <b>100</b> is mounted to the apparatus main body (stand <b>2</b>D), the main body side gear train <b>21</b> is to be connected to the housing part side gear train <b>124</b>. The housing part side gear train <b>124</b> comprises a gear <b>124</b>B installed coaxially with the pinion and gears <b>124</b>C, <b>124</b>D to be engaged sequentially with the gear <b>124</b>B, and when the bill housing part <b>100</b> is mounted to and demounted from the apparatus main body <b>2</b>, the gear <b>124</b>D is configured to be engaged with and disengaged from a final gear <b>21</b>A of the main body side gear train <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0073">As a result therefrom, the presser plate <b>115</b> is driven to reciprocate in the arrow A direction as the motor <b>20</b> installed in the apparatus main body <b>2</b> is driven to rotate so as to drive the main body side gear train <b>21</b> and in turn the presser plate driving mechanism <b>120</b> (the housing part side gear train <b>124</b>, the rack <b>122</b>A formed in the movable member <b>122</b>, and the link members <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b><i>b</i>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0074">The magnetic sensor <b>140</b> detecting that a predetermined number of bills are placed on the placing plate <b>105</b> is installed inside the frame <b>2</b>A of the apparatus main body <b>2</b>. As described above, the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> is implemented on the sensor board <b>141</b> disposed on the plate <b>2</b>F interposed between the frame <b>2</b>A and the stand <b>2</b>D that constitutes the apparatus main body <b>2</b> and the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> may be constituted of a lead switch. The lead switch may be configured, for example, by disposing two ferromagnetic leads <b>140</b><i>b </i>and <b>140</b><i>c </i>opposing each other across a contact interval inside a glass tube <b>140</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. That is, when a magnetic field equal to or greater than a predetermined amount (set as a threshold value) is applied to the glass tube <b>140</b><i>a</i>, the leads <b>140</b><i>b </i>and <b>140</b><i>c </i>become magnetized, attract each other inside the glass tube <b>140</b><i>a</i>, and form a closed circuit to generate a detection signal (and when the magnetic field is removed, the respective leads become separate due to their resilience and the circuit becomes open). The magnet <b>140</b>A that applies the magnetic field to the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> is fixed via a holder <b>140</b>D disposed at a central portion of a rear surface (facing a front wall <b>102</b><i>a </i>side) of the placing plate <b>105</b> of the bill housing part <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0075">The magnetic sensor <b>140</b> is installed at a predetermined position in a direction in which the placing plate <b>105</b> is pressed by the presser plate <b>115</b>, the placing plate <b>105</b> is pressed by the presser plate <b>115</b> against the biasing force of the biasing means <b>106</b>, and by a loaded amount of bills on the placing plate <b>105</b> increasing and then exceeding a predetermined number of bills, the magnetic field caused by the magnet <b>140</b>A becomes detected and the detection signal is generated. The position at which the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> is installed (the position at which the threshold value is exceeded and the detection signal is generated) is determined in advance according to a size of the bill housing part to be mounted, and in this embodiment, the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> is installed so that the detection signal is generated before the bills loaded on the placing plate <b>105</b> reaches a predetermined number of bills determined in advance and specifically when the loaded bills reach a number of bills slightly less (nine bills in the present embodiment) than the predetermined number of bills in consideration of safety, handling property, etc., to be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0076">In this case, the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> (sensor board <b>141</b>) may be installed at a plurality of locations along the pressing direction of the presser plate <b>115</b>. For example, by installing a magnetic sensor <b>140</b>B of the same kind on a further inner side along the pressing direction from the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is also possible to detect another number of bills in relation to the bills housed in the bill housing part <b>100</b>. This configuration is in consideration because another kind of bill housing part <b>100</b> having a different housing capacity may be mounted to the stand <b>2</b>D, and the other kind of bill housing part <b>100</b> having another housing capacity may be mounted to the same apparatus main body <b>2</b>, which can accept different kinds of bill housing parts. For example, by letting respective sensors operate independently, the number m1 of bills which is to be detected by the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> and the number m2 of bills which is to be detected by the magnetic sensor <b>140</b>B can be recognized independently.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0077">Also, in the above-mentioned configuration, it is preferable that shield body <b>140</b>F, which shields magnetism for the magnetic sensor <b>140</b>, is to be installed along the movement direction of the placing plate <b>105</b> between the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> and the magnet <b>140</b>A. The shield body <b>140</b>F is formed as a plate extending along the movement direction of the placing plate <b>105</b> and having a width larger than that of the magnet <b>140</b>A, so as to be attached to a rear surface of the main body frame <b>100</b>A of the bill housing part <b>100</b>. The shield body <b>140</b>F is made of a material having high magnetic permeability, such as iron, iron-nickel alloy (permalloy), and so on, such that the magnetism from the magnet <b>140</b>A passes inside the shield as shown by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> so as to prevent the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> from detecting the magnetism. The magnetic sensor <b>140</b>, as described above, is implemented on the sensor board <b>141</b> installed on the plate <b>2</b>F disposed between the stand <b>2</b>D and the frame a<b>2</b> constituting the apparatus main body <b>2</b> such that the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> stays still and does not move even though the presser plate <b>105</b> moves. On the other hand, the magnet <b>140</b>A fixed to a holder <b>140</b>D disposed on a rear side of the placing plate <b>105</b> moves along with the placing plate <b>105</b> as the stacked amount of bills is increased. Therefore, a relative position movement between the immovable magnetic sensor <b>140</b> (sensor board <b>141</b>) and the movable magnet <b>140</b>A occurs. Here, as understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sensor board <b>141</b> is arranged substantially parallel to an upper plate of the main body frame <b>100</b>A and aligned substantially parallel to the movement direction of the magnet <b>140</b>A to make a positional relationship. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the shield body <b>140</b>F is formed with an equivalent size of width or wider and is also arranged substantially parallel to the sensor board <b>141</b>. And the shield body <b>140</b>F extends in a direction of movement of the placing plate <b>105</b> (i.e., magnet <b>140</b>A). Therefore, the shield body <b>140</b>F is disposed between the immovable sensor board <b>141</b> and the moveable magnet <b>141</b> such that they would not face with each other. When the placing plate <b>105</b> moves to a predetermined position where the magnetism of the magnet <b>140</b>A is detectable by the magnetic sensor <b>140</b>, a predetermined process may be performed in accordance with the detected magnetism. The above-mentioned predetermined position, for example, may mean a position of the placing plate <b>105</b> (dotted line X as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>) when the magnet <b>140</b>A reaches the end portion of the shield body <b>140</b>F on the front wall <b>102</b><i>a </i>side. If the magnet <b>140</b>A moves beyond the above-mentioned position, the sensor board <b>141</b> and the magnet <b>140</b>A directly faces with each other in magnetism. That is, the magnetism emitted by the magnet <b>140</b>A can become directly detected.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0078">Along with the movement of the placing plate <b>105</b> as the stacked amount of bills is increased, the magnet <b>140</b>A moves with respect to the shield body <b>140</b>F, and the position on which the amount of magnetism can be detected by the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> can be set accurately in association with the threshold value corresponding to the predetermined number of bills. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the magnet <b>140</b>A is located on the presser plate side from the end portion of the shield body <b>140</b>F (indicated by a dotted line X), the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> does not detect a magnetic field; and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when the magnet <b>140</b>A moves on the presser spring side beyond the end portion of the shield body <b>140</b>F (indicated by a dotted line X), the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> detects a magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0079">In particular, by installing the above-described shield body <b>140</b>F, it becomes possible to accurately manage the magnetism detected by the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> and accurately detect the position of the placing plate <b>105</b> (the predetermined number of bills) without being influenced by characteristics of the magnet <b>140</b>A and the magnetic sensor <b>140</b>. This is because it is more preferable that the magnetic field strength is drastically changed as the magnet starts to show its face from the shield body such that the change may be utilized as a switching signal while the magnetic field strength gradually increases as the distance therebetween decreases because the magnetism spread in a 3D manner.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0080">Also, it is preferable that, in the above-described structure, the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> and the magnet <b>140</b>A are installed at a central position in a width direction of the placing plate <b>105</b> on which the bills are stacked as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>. As the bills are stacked onto the placing plate <b>105</b>, a balance in the width direction may be disrupted depending on circumstances of conveying bills into the bill housing part, etc., but it is possible to detect stably a stacking condition of the bills by placing the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> and the magnet <b>140</b>A at the central position of the placing plate even if the balance in the width direction is disrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0081">In particular, in this embodiment, guide means is provided to enable the placing plate <b>105</b> to move inside the main body frame <b>100</b>A in a stable state. The guide means may be configured with a pair of members including a rail and a sliding member along the rail. For example, it may be configured with recesses <b>105</b>D respectively formed on side peripheries on both left and right sides and top peripheries on both left and right sides disposed respectively across the mounted magnet <b>140</b>A; and protrusions <b>100</b>E formed in a consecutive rib-like shape extending along the movement direction of the placing plate <b>105</b> on the respective interior walls of the main body frame <b>100</b>A to guide these recesses <b>105</b>D. It is more preferable that such kind of guide means is provided on an upper part of the placing plate <b>105</b>. In this way, it may not be necessary for the bottom end part to support all own weight of the placing plate <b>105</b> on a bottom end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0082">As described above, since the guide means is provided on the placing plate <b>105</b> and the main body frame <b>100</b>A, disruption of balance is prevented even when the placing plate <b>105</b> is pressed such that the position of the placing plate <b>105</b> (the predetermined number of bills) may be detected more accurately. Thus, the placing plate <b>105</b> slides along the guide means.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0083">Conveyor members <b>150</b> which are capable of touching the bill conveyed-in from the receiving port <b>103</b> are installed in the main body frame <b>100</b>A of the bill housing part <b>100</b>. The conveyor members <b>150</b> take their own role to contact the bill conveyed-in so as to stably guide the bill into an appropriate position in the press standby part <b>108</b> (position where the bill can be stably pressed without causing the bill to be moved to the right or left side when the bill is pressed by the presser plate <b>115</b>). In this embodiment, the conveyor members are constituted of belt-like members (hereafter called belts <b>150</b>) installed so as to face the press standby part <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0084">In this case, the belts <b>150</b> are installed so as to extend along the conveying-in direction with respect to the bill, and are wrapped around the pair of pulleys <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B supported rotatably on both ends in the conveying-in direction. Further, the belts <b>150</b> contact a conveyor roller <b>150</b>C extending in an axis direction which is supported rotatably in the region of the receiving port <b>103</b>, and the belts <b>150</b> and the conveyor roller <b>150</b>C nip and hold the bill conveyed-in the receiving port <b>103</b> therebetween to guide the bill directly to the press standby part <b>108</b>. Here, in this embodiment, the pair of belts <b>150</b> are provided on the right and left sides, respectively, across the above-described presser plate <b>115</b> in order to be capable of contacting the surface on left and right sides of the bill. In addition, the belts <b>150</b> may be prevented from loosening by not only being wrapped around the pulleys <b>150</b>A and <b>150</b>B at the both ends, but also causing tension pulleys to push the belts <b>150</b> at the intermediate positions, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0085">The pair of belts <b>150</b> are configured to be driven by the motor <b>13</b> that drives the above-described plurality of conveyor rollers installed in the apparatus main body <b>2</b>. In detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the above-described driving belt <b>13</b>B driven by the motor <b>13</b> is wrapped around a pulley <b>13</b>D for the driving force transmission, and a gear train <b>153</b> installed at the end of the spindle of the pulley <b>150</b>A supported rotatably on the receiving port <b>103</b> side is engaged with a gear train <b>13</b>E for the power transmission sequentially installed onto the pulley <b>13</b>D. That is, when the bill housing part <b>100</b> is mounted to the apparatus main body <b>2</b>, an input gear of the gear train <b>153</b> is configured to be engaged with a final gear of the gear train <b>13</b>E, and the pair of belts <b>150</b> are configured to be driven to rotate in a synchronized manner with the above-described conveyor rollers <b>14</b>B, <b>15</b>B <b>16</b>B, and <b>17</b>B for conveying the bill by driving the motor <b>13</b> to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0086">Also, the above-mentioned presser plate detecting sensor <b>23</b> is configured to be capable of detecting a position of the presser plate <b>115</b> that presses the bill toward the placing plate <b>105</b>, and further, to be capable of detecting the mounting or demounting operation when the bill housing part <b>100</b> is mounted to or demounted from the frame <b>2</b>A (stand <b>2</b>D) of the apparatus main body <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0087">Next, the control means for controlling operations of the above-mentioned paper sheet processing apparatus will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0088">The control means <b>200</b> comprises a control circuit board <b>200</b>A that controls the operations of the above-described respective drive units, and a CPU (Central Processing Unit) <b>210</b> constituting bill identification means, a ROM (Read Only Memory) <b>212</b>, a RAM (Random Access Memory) <b>214</b>, and a reference data storage part <b>216</b> are mounted on the control circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0089">In the ROM <b>212</b>, various types of programs such as operation programs for the respective drive units such as the motor <b>13</b> that drives the above-described bill conveyance mechanism, the motor <b>20</b> that drives the presser plate, the driving source <b>70</b> that drives the conveyor roller <b>14</b>A to contact/be spaced from the conveyor roller <b>14</b>B, the motor <b>40</b> to drive the skew driving mechanism <b>10</b>; an authenticity judgment program for the bill read by the bill reading means <b>8</b>; and permanent data are stored. The CPU <b>210</b> generates control signals according to the programs stored in the ROM <b>212</b>, carries out the input and output of the signals with respect to the respective drive units via an I/O port <b>220</b>, and controls the driving of the respective drive units.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0090">Further, detection signals from various types of sensors such as the insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b>, the movable piece passage detecting sensor <b>12</b>, the discharge detecting sensor <b>18</b>, the magnetic sensor <b>140</b>, the presser plate detecting sensor <b>23</b> for detecting the position of the presser plate <b>115</b>, and the like are to be input to the CPU <b>210</b> via the I/O port <b>220</b>, and the driving of the respective drive units is controlled on the basis of these detection signals. In this case, the CPU <b>210</b> has a function of so-called determination means that determines that the amount of magnetism from the magnet <b>140</b>A mounted on the placing plate <b>105</b> has become equal to or greater than the threshold value when the detection signal is input from the magnetic sensor <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0091">Further, data and programs used for the operation of the CPU <b>210</b> are stored in the RAM <b>214</b>, and reference data used for the performance of a bill authenticity judgment, for example, various types of data acquired from all the printing areas of the legitimate bill (such as data about contrasting density and data about transmitted light or reflected light when the bill is irradiated with infrared ray) are stored as reference data in the reference data storage part <b>216</b>. In addition, the reference data is stored in the dedicated reference data storage part <b>216</b>. However, the data may be stored in the ROM <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0092">Then, a bill reading detection sensor (for example, a line sensor) <b>80</b> constituting the above-described bill reading means <b>8</b> is connected to the CPU <b>210</b> via the I/O port <b>220</b>, and bill reading data read by the bill reading detection sensor <b>80</b> is compared with the reference data stored in the reference data storage part <b>216</b> such that a bill authenticity judgment process is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0093">Further, the CPU <b>210</b> is configured to send, via the I/O port <b>220</b>, a control signal (alarm signal) to notification means <b>250</b> and a management apparatus <b>270</b> that manages the bill processing apparatus <b>1</b>. Here, the notification means <b>250</b> may be configured with a speaker that notifies the state by sound, a lamp that notifies the state visually, and the like, and when the detection signal from the above-described magnetic sensor <b>140</b> is generated, the CPU <b>210</b> sends a drive signal (alarm signal) to a drive circuit of the notification means to notify the state (that the number of bills in the bill housing part <b>100</b> has reached the predetermined number).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0094">As configured in the aforementioned way, when the number of bills reaches the predetermined number, a manager or the like is notified of such a state, thereby enabling the manager or the like to find that the bill housing part has been full with the bills loaded therein.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0095">Otherwise, when the detection signal is input from the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> to the CPU <b>210</b>, the CPU <b>210</b> may be configured to send a signal (error signal) notifying that the number of bills has reached the predetermined number, for example, to the external apparatus <b>270</b> that manages a plurality of bill processing apparatuses <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0096">As configured in this way, for example, the management apparatus (higher-level apparatus) that manages the bill processing apparatuses <b>1</b> can take care of processing when the bill housing part <b>100</b> becomes full of bills such that the bill housing part <b>100</b> may be removed from the specific bill processing apparatus at an appropriate timing.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0097">As described above, when the aforementioned bill processing apparatuses <b>1</b> are installed in many gaming machines in a game hall or the like, an operating rate of the gaming machines can be improved by shortening necessary time (average recovery time) to exchange the bill housing parts <b>100</b> because respective timings for exchange of the bill housing parts <b>100</b> may be obtained appropriately. In the case of bill processing apparatuses that cannot detect respective positions of the aforementioned presser plates, a typical timing to exchange the bill housing parts <b>100</b> is in the time zone (for example, in the dawn) when the hall is scarcely crowded such that the bill housing parts of all the gaming machines are usually to be exchanged. However, the bill housing parts can be exchanged individually at appropriate timings because the error signals are independently sent to the external apparatus <b>270</b> whereby the average recovery time can be shortened such that the operating rate of the gaming machines can be improved. Also because each bill housing part <b>100</b> can be exchanged at an appropriate timing, a malfunction that occurs due to insertion of a new bill into a bill housing part that is already full can be prevented and it thus becomes possible to improve efficiency of maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0098">Alternatively, the CPU <b>210</b> may be configured to stop the driving of the motor <b>13</b> for the bill conveyance mechanism so as to bring a state that the bill cannot be conveyed, that is, to make the aforementioned bill conveyance mechanism disabled since the detection signal is generated from the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> to notify that the bill housing part <b>100</b> has become full (or nearly full) with bills.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0099">As configured in this way, the state that the bill cannot be conveyed is established although a user attempts to insert another bill when the bill housing part <b>100</b> has become full (or nearly full) with bills, and an additional bill beyond the predetermined number of bills is not conveyed such that it is possible to prevent each component of the bill housing part from breaking down.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0100">Here, the timing at which the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> generates the detection signal (the number of bills stacked onto the placing plate; the setting of the predetermined number of bills) may be decided arbitrarily, and in this embodiment, for example, the predetermined number of bills to be housed is set to 400 by taking an allowance of approximately 100 bills with the current configuration having the maximum capacity of 500 bills in the interior space of the bill housing part <b>100</b> such that the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> is configured to generate the detection signal when the number of bills having stacked reaches a value less than the predetermined number by nine (9). As described above, it is possible to change the predetermined number of bills to be determined in advance as appropriate by changing the position of the magnetic sensor such that it can be effectively prevented components from breaking down.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0101">In addition, the control means <b>200</b> that controls the operation of the bill processing apparatus is implemented on one control circuit board <b>200</b>A as mentioned above. However, the control means <b>200</b> may be implemented in a distributed manner on separate control circuit boards in accordance with respective functions.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0102">Next, the bill processing operation in the bill processing apparatus <b>1</b> executed by the control means <b>200</b> will be described with reference to the flowcharts of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 to 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0103">When an operator inserts a bill into the bill insertion slot <b>5</b>, the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B) installed in the vicinity of the bill insertion slot is in a state that the rollers are spaced from each other in an initial stage (refer to ST<b>16</b> and ST<b>56</b> to be described later). Further, with respect to the presser plate <b>115</b>, the pair of link members <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b><i>b </i>driving the presser plate <b>115</b> are positioned in a pathway of the press standby part <b>108</b>, and the presser plate <b>115</b> is so positioned (hereinafter, called &#x201c;standby position&#x201d;) that the pair of link members <b>115</b><i>a</i>, <b>115</b><i>b </i>prevent the bill from being conveyed into the press standby part <b>108</b> from the receiving port <b>103</b> (refer to ST<b>134</b> to be described later). That is, in this state, the presser plate <b>115</b> is brought into the opening <b>110</b>A formed between the pair of regulatory members <b>110</b> such that the opening through which the bill passes is in an occluded state so as to prevent the bill stored in the bill housing part from being drawn out.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0104">Moreover, the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A constituting the skew correction mechanism <b>10</b> located on the downstream side of the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B) are in a state that the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A are moved to leave the minimum open width therebetween (for example, an interval between the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A is 52 mm; refer to ST<b>15</b> and ST<b>57</b> to be described later) so as to prevent the bill from being drawn out in the initial stage.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0105">When the above-described pair of conveyor rollers (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B) are in the initial state, the operator easily insert a wrinkled bill into the bill insertion slot <b>5</b>. Then, when the insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b> detects the insertion of the bill (ST<b>01</b>), the driving motor <b>20</b> of the above-described presser plate <b>115</b> is driven to rotate reversely for a predetermined amount (ST<b>02</b>) to move the presser plate <b>115</b> to the initial position. In this initial position, the press standby part <b>108</b> is in an open state (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), and the bill can be conveyed into the inside of the bill housing part <b>100</b>. That is, by driving the motor <b>20</b> to rotate reversely for a predetermined amount, the presser plate <b>115</b> is driven from the aforementioned standby position to the initial position via the main body side gear train <b>21</b> and the presser plate driving mechanism <b>120</b> (the housing part side gear train <b>124</b>, the rack formed on the movable member <b>122</b>, and the link members <b>115</b><i>a </i>and <b>115</b><i>b </i>etc.). The press standby part <b>108</b> is opened by the movement of the presser plate <b>115</b> such that the bill can be conveyed into the inside of the bill housing part.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0106">In this state, the above-described driving source <b>70</b> is driven to move the upper conveyor roller <b>14</b>A so as to make a contact with the lower conveyor roller <b>14</b>B. In accordance therewith, the inserted bill is nipped and held therebetween by the pair of conveyor rollers (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B) (ST<b>03</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0107">Next, a traveling route opening process is conducted (ST<b>04</b>). The opening process is conducted by driving the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A to move in separating directions so as to become apart with each other as the motor <b>40</b> for the skew correction mechanism is driven to rotate reversely as shown in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (ST<b>100</b>). At this time, when it is detected that the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A have moved to the predetermined positions (the maximum open width positions) by the movable piece detecting sensor that detects positions of the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A (ST<b>101</b>), the driving operation to rotate the motor <b>40</b> reversely is stopped (ST<b>102</b>). This traveling route opening process allows the bill to enter between the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A. In addition, in the previous step of ST<b>04</b>, the bill traveling route <b>3</b> is in a closed state by a traveling route closing process (ST<b>15</b>, ST<b>57</b>) to be described later. Thus, the bill traveling route <b>3</b> is closed in this way before an insertion of the bill so as to prevent an element such as a line sensor from being broken by, for example, inserting a plate-like member from the bill insertion slot for illicit purposes or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0108">Next, the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is driven to rotate normally (ST<b>05</b>). The bill is carried into the inside of the apparatus by the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B), and when the movable piece passage detecting sensor <b>12</b> installed on the downstream side from the skew correction mechanism <b>10</b> detects the front end of the bill, the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is stopped (ST<b>06</b> and ST<b>07</b>). At this time, the bill is located between the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A constituting the skew correction mechanism <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0109">Next, the above-described driving source <b>70</b> is driven to allow the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B) holding the bill therebetween to become apart from each other (ST<b>08</b>). At this time, the bill is in a state that no load is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0110">Then, a skew correction operating process is executed as the bill remains in this state (ST<b>09</b>). The skew correction operating process is conducted by driving the motor <b>40</b> for the skew correction mechanism to rotate normally to drive the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A to get closer with each other. That is, in this skew correction operating process, as shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the motor <b>40</b> described above is driven to rotate normally to move the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A in respective directions such that the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A get closer with each other (ST<b>110</b>). The movement of the movable pieces is continued until the interval becomes the minimum width (example; width of 62 mm) of the bill registered in the reference data storage part in the control means, and the skew is corrected by the movable pieces <b>10</b>A touching both sides of the bill such that the bill may be positioned at the accurate center position.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0111">When the skew correction operating process as described above is completed, a traveling route opening process is subsequently executed (ST<b>10</b>). This process is conducted by moving the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A in separating directions as the above-described motor <b>40</b> for the skew correction mechanism is driven to rotate reversely (refer to ST<b>100</b> to ST<b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0112">Next, the above-described driving source <b>70</b> is driven to move the upper conveyor roller <b>14</b>A to contact the lower conveyor roller <b>14</b>B, and the bill is nipped and held between the pair of conveyor rollers (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B) (ST<b>11</b>). Thereafter, the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is driven to rotate normally to carry the bill into the inside of the apparatus, and when the bill passes through the bill reading means <b>8</b>, a bill reading process is executed (ST<b>12</b> and ST<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0113">Then, when the bill to be carried passes through the bill reading means <b>8</b>, and the trailing end of the bill is detected by the movable piece detecting sensor <b>12</b> (ST<b>14</b>), a process for closing the bill traveling route <b>3</b> is executed (ST<b>15</b>). In this process, first, as shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, after the trailing end of the bill is detected by the movable piece detecting sensor <b>12</b>, the above-described motor <b>40</b> is driven to rotate normally to move the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A in respective directions such that the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A get closer with each other (ST<b>120</b>). Next, when it is sensed by the movable piece detecting sensor that the movable pieces <b>10</b>A move to the predetermined positions (minimum open width positions: for example, width of 52 mm) (ST<b>121</b>), the driving operation of the normal rotation of the motor <b>40</b> is stopped (ST<b>122</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0114">With this traveling route closing process, the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A are moved to the minimum open width positions (width of 52 mm) narrower than the width of any bill allowed to be inserted, thereby effectively preventing the bill from being drawn out. That is, by executing such a bill traveling route closing process, an opening distance between the movable pieces <b>10</b>A is made shorter than the width of the inserted bill, thereby enabling the effective prevention of an action of drawing-out the bill in the direction toward the insertion slot by the operator for illicit purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0115">In addition, when the movable piece detecting sensor as described above detects the movement of the movable pieces <b>10</b>A in this state, it may be considered that the operator is committing some fraudulent activities such that a predetermined processes may be executed. For example, a fraudulent manipulated signal (an anomaly sensed signal) may be transmitted to a higher-level apparatus that manages the operations of the bill processing apparatus, or an annunciator lamp may be provided on the bill processing apparatus, and this lamp may flash, or without activating a process for input acceptance (ST<b>22</b>) input by another operator thereafter, a process in which a discharge operation or the like is forcibly carried out may be executed. Or, appropriate processes such as canceling the operation of the bill processing apparatus (for example, a process for stopping the processing, a process for discharging the bill, and the like) and the like may be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0116">Further, in succession to the traveling route closing process described above (ST<b>15</b>), a conveyor roller pair spacing process is executed such that the driving source <b>70</b> is driven to make the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B) having been in a state capable of nipping and holding the bill therebetween separate from each other (ST<b>16</b>). By executing the conveyor roller pair spacing process, even if the operator additionally inserts (double insertion) another bill by mistake, the bill is not subject to a feeding operation by the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B) and hits front ends of the pair of movable pieces <b>10</b>A in a closed state according to ST<b>15</b> such that it is possible to reliably prevent the operation of bill double-insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0117">Along with the bill traveling route closing process as mentioned above, when the bill reading means <b>8</b> reads the data up to the trailing end of the bill, the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is driven for a predetermined amount and leave the bill stopped at a predetermined position (escrow position; position where the bill is carried toward the downstream by 13 mm from the center position of the bill reading means <b>8</b>), and at this time, a bill authenticity judgment process is executed by the control means <b>200</b> (ST<b>17</b> to ST<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0118">In the bill authenticity judgment process at ST<b>20</b> as described above, when the bill is judged as a legitimate bill (ST<b>21</b>; Yes), an input from the operator is received (ST<b>22</b>). This input corresponds to an acceptance operation in which the operator presses an acceptance button in order to accept provision of services (for example, in the case of a gaming device, an acceptance process accompanied by start of a game), and a return operation in which the operator presses a return button in order to execute a process for returning the inserted bill.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0119">Then, when an operation to accept the provision of various types of services is input (ST<b>23</b>; Yes), the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is consecutively driven to rotate normally to convey the bill in this state toward the bill housing part <b>100</b> (ST<b>24</b>). While the bill is conveyed, the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is driven to rotate normally until the trailing end of the bill is detected by the discharge detecting sensor <b>18</b>, and after the trailing end of the bill is detected by the discharge detecting sensor <b>18</b> (ST<b>25</b>), the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is driven to rotate normally by the predetermined amount (ST<b>26</b> and ST<b>27</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0120">The process for driving the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> to rotate normally in ST<b>26</b> and ST<b>27</b> corresponds to a driving amount for which the bill is conveyed in the receiving port <b>103</b> of the bill housing part <b>100</b> from the discharge slot <b>3</b><i>a </i>on the downstream side of the bill traveling route <b>3</b> of the apparatus main body <b>2</b> so that the pair of belts <b>150</b> contact the surface on both sides of the conveyed-in bill to guide the bill stably to the press standby part <b>108</b>. That is, by further driving the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> to rotate normally for a predetermined amount after the trailing end of the bill is detected by the discharge detecting sensor <b>18</b>, the pair of belts <b>150</b> contact the bill conveyed-in and are driven in the bill feeding direction so as to guide the bill in a stable state to the press standby part <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0121">Then, after the above-described bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is stopped, the process for driving the presser plate <b>115</b> is executed (ST<b>28</b>) such that the bill is placed on the placing plate <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0122">The process for driving the presser plate <b>115</b> is executed in accordance with the flowchart as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. First, the driving motor <b>20</b> of the presser plate <b>115</b> is driven to rotate normally for a predetermine amount to move the presser plate <b>115</b> staying at the initial position in the above ST<b>02</b> until it gets to the pressing position (ST<b>130</b>). With respect to the amount of driving to rotate normally the motor <b>20</b>, if the motor <b>20</b> is composed of a DC motor, a predetermined amount of rotation can be set such that pulses are generated by utilizing, for example, an encoder and the number of the pulses is measured. That is, by driving the driving motor <b>20</b> to rotate normally for a predetermined amount, the presser plate <b>115</b> is moved from the initial position to the pressing position via the main body side gear train <b>21</b> and the presser plate driving mechanism <b>120</b> (the housing part side gear train <b>124</b>, the rack formed on the movable member <b>122</b>, and the link members <b>115</b><i>a </i>and <b>115</b><i>b </i>and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0123">According to the movement of the presser plate <b>115</b>, the bill in the press standby part <b>108</b> passes through the opening <b>110</b>A between the pair of regulatory members <b>110</b> so as to be deflected in a U-shape in a laterally symmetrical manner, and the bill is finally pressed onto the placing plate <b>105</b>. In this case, since the bill is conveyed to the appropriate pressing position without leaning to either side by the pair of belts <b>150</b> as described above, even if the presser plate <b>115</b> is moved, the bill is placed on the placing plate <b>105</b> stably without jamming or the like between the presser plate <b>115</b> and the pair of regulatory members <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0124">When the presser plate <b>115</b> is moved to the pressing position, the presser plate <b>115</b> is processed to wait (ST<b>131</b>) for a predetermined time (200 ms) at the pressing position so as to place the bill stably on the placing plate <b>105</b>, and thereafter, the driving motor <b>20</b> of the presser plate <b>115</b> is driven to rotate reversely (ST<b>132</b>). Then, when it is detected by the presser plate detecting sensor <b>23</b> that the presser plate <b>115</b> has moved from the pressing position to the aforementioned standby position, the driving of the motor <b>20</b> is stopped, and the presser plate <b>115</b> is stopped in the standby position (ST<b>133</b>: Yes, ST<b>134</b>). As described above, the bill cannot be drawn out in this standby position.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0125">In addition, if the presser plate detecting sensor <b>23</b> does not detect that the presser plate <b>115</b> has moved from the pressing position to the standby position within a predetermined period of time, it is considered that something is wrong with the stack operation, and the signal expressing that something is wrong with the stack operation (an error signal) is transmitted to an external apparatus, annunciation means, or the like (ST<b>133</b>; No, ST<b>133</b>A).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0126">Then, after the presser plate <b>115</b> is moved from the pressing position to the standby position, in a case where the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> detects magnetism provided to the rear surface of the placing plate <b>105</b> (ST<b>135</b>; Yes), a detection signal is sent to the CPU <b>210</b> to inform that the number of bills stacked in the bill housing part <b>100</b> approaches the predetermined number (ST<b>136</b>: No, ST<b>137</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0127">In this embodiment, in designing a detection signal generation as a threshold value from the magnetic sensor <b>140</b>, the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> is installed to generate the detection signal before the number of bills stacked on the placing plate <b>105</b> reaches the predetermined number (that is, the predetermined number less nine (9)) in consideration of safely and easy handling.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0128">Concretely, when the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> begins to detect the magnetism emitted by the magnet <b>140</b><i>a</i>, the CPU <b>210</b> increments a count repeatedly at each subsequent bill housing operation (for each operation of housing a single bill) (ST<b>138</b>) and writes the information in the RAM <b>214</b>. When the count is not exceeding nine (9), the CPU <b>210</b> causes a notification that the stacker is approaching a full state (ST<b>137</b>). This notification may specifically be comprised of a drive signal to be sent to the notification means <b>250</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) configured with a speaker that notifies such a state by sound, a lamp that notifies the state visually, and so on, as mentioned above, to make the administrator and the like notified that the stacker is approaching a full state by means of the sound, lamp, and so on. With this notification, the administrator can exchange the bill housing parts <b>100</b> before the number of bills in the bill housing part <b>100</b> reaches the predetermined number.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0129">Otherwise, the CPU <b>210</b> may be configured to send an error signal to the management apparatus or another external apparatus <b>270</b> that manages the operations of bill processing apparatuses (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) to enable the state to be grasped in the other location. By this configuration, the timing for removing the bill housing part <b>100</b> can be managed appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0130">Further, after the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> detects the magnetism, when it is detected that ten (10) or more times the bill stack operation is repeated without exchanging the bill housing part <b>100</b> (ST<b>136</b>; Yes), a process of disabling the apparatus is executed in order for bills not to be further inserted therein (ST<b>136</b>A). With respect to this disabling process, for example, a process of stopping the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> driving the bill conveyance mechanism <b>6</b> described above may be performed in order not to convey the bill inside even if a user inserts a bill into the bill insertion slot. In this way, because no more bills beyond the predetermined number of bills are thus prevented from being conveyed into the bill housing part <b>100</b>, it is possible to prevent components of the bill housing part <b>100</b> from breaking down.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0131">Also, in the process of ST<b>21</b> as described above, when the inserted bill is judged as a non-legitimate bill or the operator presses the return button (ST<b>23</b>; No), a traveling route opening process is executed (ST<b>51</b>, refer to ST<b>100</b> to ST<b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>), then, the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is driven to rotate reversely, and the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B) are brought into contact with each other such that the bill waiting at the escrow position is conveyed toward the bill insertion slot <b>5</b> (ST<b>52</b> and ST<b>53</b>). Then, when the insertion detecting sensor <b>7</b> senses the trailing end of the bill to be returned toward the bill insertion slot <b>5</b>, the driving to reversely rotate the bill conveyor motor <b>13</b> is stopped, and above-described driving source <b>70</b> is driven to make the conveyor roller pair (<b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B) having been in a state of nipping and holding the bill therebetween separate from each other (ST<b>54</b> to ST<b>56</b>). Then, the traveling route closing process is executed (AT<b>57</b>), the motor <b>20</b> for driving the presser plate <b>115</b> is driven to rotate forward for a predetermined amount to return the presser plate, which had been moved to the initial position in ST<b>02</b>, to the standby position (ST<b>58</b>), and the series of processes have been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0132">In the bill processing apparatus having the above-mentioned configuration, as bills are stacked and housed on the placing plate <b>105</b> inside the bill housing part <b>100</b>, the position of the placing plate <b>105</b> moves gradually, and the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> starts to detect the magnetic field of the magnet <b>140</b>A installed on the placing plate <b>105</b>. When the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> detects the magnetic field (if the threshold value is exceeded), the CPU <b>210</b> of the control means becomes capable of determining whether or not the number of bills inside the bill housing part <b>100</b> has reached the predetermined number (whether or not the sate of the bill housing part gets close to full). Therefore, the number of mechanically operating parts can thus be decreased such that it is possible to detect whether the bill housing part is full with stacked bills or not at a lower cost.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0133">As mentioned above, the embodiment of the present invention is described. However, the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various modifications of the present invention can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0134">For example, in ST<b>136</b> of the flowchart as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the process of ST<b>136</b>A may be executed when the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> detects the magnetism successively for N times. This is because the count number to be measured has also deviations since originally thicker thickness of the damaged bill may be reduced to that of one undamaged bill because of compression force caused by the biasing force of the above-mentioned biasing means <b>106</b> after the bill is stacked and housed on the placing plate <b>105</b> while the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> may detect the magnetism in error since the inserted bill may be damaged severely (wrinkled, twisted, etc.) and one damaged bill may show a thickness more than one piece of undamaged bill at the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0135">As described above, with respected to the detection signal transmitted from the magnetic sensor <b>140</b>, it may be made that the detection signal to be transmitted from the magnetic sensor <b>140</b> is generated only if the counter consecutively receives the detection signal N times (for example, ten (10) times) such that the above-mentioned error may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0136">Further, in the present invention, it suffices that the apparatus is configured to have the magnetic sensor capable of detecting that the number of bills housed in the bill housing part has reached the predetermined number of bills having been determined in advance or has got close to the predetermined number, and other configurations of the apparatus, such as driving sources driving the various driving members or power transmission mechanisms from the driving sources, are appropriately modified.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0137">In the above-described embodiment, the position of the placing plate inside the paper sheet housing part moves gradually as more and more paper sheets get stacked and housed on the placing plate. The magnetized magnetic body is disposed on the placing plate and the magnetism from the magnetic body is detected by the magnetic sensor according to the movement of the placing plate. In the process of detecting the magnetism amount from the magnetic body disposed on the placing plate, by setting a predetermined threshold value concerning the detected magnetism amount to be determined by the determination means, it becomes possible to determine whether or not the paper sheet housing part has become full with paper sheets. Therefore, the number of mechanically operating components can thereby be reduced and the full state of the paper sheet housing part with paper sheets can be detected at a low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0138">Further, a shield body which shields the magnetic sensor from magnetism is arranged along a direction of movement of the placing plate between the magnetic sensor and the magnetic body, and as the magnetic body moves with respect to the shield body in accordance with the movement of the placing plate, the threshold value can be set when the placing plate is moved to a position where an amount of magnetism from the magnetic body can be detected by the magnetic sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0139">In such a configuration, by installing the shield body, it is possible to set the magnetism detection position with respect to the magnetic sensor precisely and it is possible to detect the position of the placing plate and specifically to accurately detect that the number of paper sheets placed on the placing plate becomes a predetermined set value.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0140">Further, when the determination means determines that the amount of magnetism is at least the threshold value, the apparatus may comprise notification means to notify what is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0141">In such a configuration, the paper sheets are filled in and such a state is notified so that it is possible to find earlier that the paper sheet housing part is in a full state with paper sheets. In such a case, by way of example, the notification means may notify it in voice or visually such as by blinking light.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0142">Also, the paper sheet processing apparatus comprises: a conveyor mechanism which conveys a paper sheet to a paper sheet housing part; and control means which controls conveyor processing of the paper sheet by the conveyor mechanism, wherein the control means is capable of disabling the conveyor processing of the paper sheet when the determination means determines that the amount of magnetism is at least the threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0143">In such a configuration, because when full state of the paper sheet is reached, the control means disables the paper sheet conveyance process operation, the conveyor processing of paper sheets to the paper sheet housing part is prevented beyond a limit. Malfunction of components of the paper sheet housing part can thereby be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0144">Further, notification means can transmit an error signal to an external apparatus that manages operations of the paper sheet processing apparatus when the determination means determines an amount of magnetism is greater than or equal to a threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0145">In such a configuration, for example, the management device (external apparatus) that manages the paper sheet processing device can take care of processing when the apparatus is full with paper sheets such that it is possible to remove the paper sheet housing part at an appropriate timing.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0146">As described above, the paper sheet processing apparatus which is capable of inexpensively detecting that the paper sheet housing part becomes full with paper sheets can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0147">The present invention can be incorporated into various types of apparatuses to provide products and services by inserting a bill thereinto, for example. It is also possible to apply it to a processing device to process a paper sheet such as a coupon ticket, not limited to, but including the bill.</p>
