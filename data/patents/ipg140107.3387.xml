<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to the art of vibration devices and, more particularly, to a linear vibrator for generating tactile sensation.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ARTS</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Consumer products, such as mobile phones and portable multi-media players, generally include vibrators for generating tactile feedback. For example, a mobile phone has a vibrator for generating vibration while a call is called in, and a portable multi-media player has a touch screen having vibrators for getting tactile feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A vibrator has a moving unit moving along a linear direction is called linear vibration device. Generally, the linear vibration device comprises a cover, a base forming a receiving cavity together with the cover, a coil located on the base, an elastic member coupled to the base, a vibrating unit suspended in the receiving cavity by the elastic member. The vibrating unit typically includes a magnet and a weight attached to the magnet. The coil is positioned right below the magnet. The elastic member comprises an arm and a pair of splints extending from the arm, and the splints attach to the vibrating unit for suspend the vibrating unit in the cavity. However, during the vibration of the vibrating unit, the elastic plate can not fix with the vibrating unit in the receiving cavity firmly, which directly leads the vibrator to deteriorated endurance, and shortened lifespan.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">So, it is necessary to provide a new vibrator for solving the problem mentioned above.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A linear vibration device is mounted on a printed circuit board for generating tactile vibration. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a linear vibration device <b>10</b>, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, includes a cover <b>16</b>, a crust <b>11</b> forming a receiving space together with the cover <b>16</b>, a PCB (printed circuit board) <b>18</b> covered by the crust <b>11</b>, an annular coil <b>12</b>, a plurality of elastic member <b>13</b>, a supporting portion <b>15</b>, and a moving unit <b>14</b> comprising a weight <b>140</b> and a magnet assembly <b>141</b>. The PCB <b>18</b> includes a plurality of welding points <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The cover <b>16</b> and the crust <b>11</b> corporately form a housing having the receiving space. The crust <b>11</b> further defines a bottom wall <b>111</b> and a plurality of sidewalls <b>110</b> extending perpendicularly from the bottom wall <b>111</b>. The bottom wall <b>111</b> defines a though hole <b>101</b> in a middle portion thereof.

The positioning portions <b>401</b> are used for assembling with the elastic members <b>13</b>. A protrusion <b>420</b> extending from the positioning portions <b>401</b> for coupling the elastic member <b>14</b>. The main body <b>410</b> defines an aperture <b>430</b> in a middle portion thereof for receiving the magnet assembly <b>141</b> therein. The magnet assembly <b>141</b> has a first magnet part <b>1411</b> and a second magnet part <b>1412</b> separately positioned in the aperture of the weight. Thus, the magnet assembly <b>141</b>, together with the weight <b>140</b>, is suspended in the receiving space by the elastic members <b>13</b>, i.e., the moving unit <b>14</b> is suspended in the receiving space by the elastic members <b>13</b>. In fact, the magnet assembly <b>141</b> may solely be a moving unit without the weight <b>140</b>, and can be directly connected to the elastic members <b>13</b>. In addition, if the weight <b>140</b> is used as a part of the moving unit <b>14</b>, the weight <b>140</b> can be made from materials having specific gravities higher than 7.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the supporting portion <b>15</b> defines a supporting plate <b>151</b>, a pair of supporting arms <b>152</b> extending perpendicularly from two ends of the supporting plate <b>151</b> respectively for pushing the mounting portion <b>131</b> toward the positioning portion <b>401</b> of the moving unit <b>14</b>, a supporting part <b>153</b> extending perpendicularly from the supporting arm <b>152</b> and substantially parallel to the supporting plate <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each of the elastic members <b>13</b> includes a fastening portion <b>135</b> positioned on the sidewall <b>110</b> of the crust <b>11</b>, an elastic arm <b>136</b>, and a mounting portion <b>131</b>. The elastic arm <b>136</b> comprises a first arm <b>134</b> extending perpendicularly from the fastening portion <b>135</b>, a second arm <b>132</b> connected to the first arm <b>134</b> by a U-shaped connecting portion <b>133</b>. The mounting portion <b>131</b> extends perpendicularly from the second arm <b>132</b> and substantially parallel to the fastening portion <b>135</b>. Further, the mounting portion <b>131</b> may includes a main board <b>1310</b> and a fender <b>310</b> extending from the edge portion of the main board <b>1310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the elastic members <b>13</b> is capable of deforming elastically along a direction substantially parallel to the fastening portion <b>135</b>. The positioning portion <b>401</b> of the weight <b>140</b> is at least partially received in a slot between the supporting plate <b>151</b> and the supporting part <b>153</b>, and the second arm <b>132</b> is at least partially sandwiched between the supporting arm <b>152</b> and protrusion <b>420</b>. Therefore, the weight <b>140</b> is suspended in the receiving space by the elastic members <b>13</b>. Accordingly, the moving unit <b>14</b> is firmly assembled to the supporting portion <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the magnet assembly <b>141</b> has a first magnet part <b>141</b><i>a </i>and a second magnet part <b>141</b><i>b</i>, wherein, the first magnet part <b>141</b><i>a </i>has magnetic poles opposite to those of the second magnet part <b>141</b><i>b</i>. Planes of magnetic poles of the magnet assembly <b>141</b> are parallel and face to the bottom wall <b>111</b> and are also parallel to the annular coil <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the crust <b>11</b> further defines a blocking ring <b>102</b> extending upwardly form a central portion of the bottom wall <b>111</b>. The blocking ring <b>102</b> forming an accommodating space, for receiving the annular coil <b>12</b>. The coil <b>12</b> is located right below the magnet assembly <b>141</b>. The combination of the weight <b>140</b> and the magnet assembly <b>141</b> is served as a moving unit <b>14</b>. The blocking ring <b>102</b> is located within the vibrating amplitude of the moving unit <b>14</b>. The supporting arm <b>152</b> is attached to the second arm <b>132</b> with the second arm <b>132</b> received in the slot, and the second arm <b>132</b> is attached to an outer surface of the protrusion <b>420</b> of the weight <b>140</b>. When electrified, the moving unit <b>14</b> vibrates along a direction paralleled to the PCB <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">During the vibration of the moving unit <b>14</b>, the mounting portion <b>131</b> can withstand the moving unit <b>14</b> by contacting the positioning portions <b>401</b> for limiting the vibration amplitude. Accordingly, the mounting portion <b>131</b> engages with a side surface of the positioning portion <b>401</b> of the moving unit <b>14</b>. The side surface connects with and is upright to a top surface of the positioning portion <b>401</b>. The supporting plate <b>151</b> overlays a part of the top surface and is vertical to the mounting portion <b>131</b>. The fender <b>310</b> defines a top part above the top surface.
