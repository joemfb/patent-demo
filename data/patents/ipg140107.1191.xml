<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to cooling tower apparatus for providing heat exchange. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing efficient heat exchange for industrial processes while also allowing for the abatement of cooling tower plume as desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In electricity generation using steam driven turbines, water is heated by a burner to create steam which drives a turbine to create electricity. Also in other industrial processes water is needed for cooling. In order to minimize the amount of clean water necessary for this process, the steam must be converted back into water, by removing heat, so that the water can be reused in the process. In air conditioning systems for large buildings, air inside the building is forced passed coils containing a cooled refrigerant gas thereby transferring heat from inside the building into the refrigerant gas. The warmed refrigerant is then piped outside the building where the excess heat must be removed from the refrigerant so that the refrigerant gas can be re-cooled and the cooling process continued.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In both of the foregoing processes, and numerous other processes that require the step of dissipating excess heat, cooling towers have been employed. In wet type cooling towers, water is pumped passed a condenser coil containing the heated steam, refrigerant, or other heated liquid or gas, thereby transferring heat into the water. The water is then pumped to the top of the heat exchangers and sprayed over a cooling tower media comprised of thin sheets of material or splash bars. As the water flows down the cooling tower media, ambient air is forced passed the heated water and heat is transmitted from the water to the air by both sensible and evaporative heat transfer. The air is then forced out of the cooling tower and dissipated into the surrounding air.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cooling towers are highly efficient and cost effective means of dissipating this excess heat and thus are widely used for this purpose. A recognized drawback to cooling towers, however, is that under certain atmospheric conditions a plume can be created by moisture from the heated water source evaporating into the air stream being carried out of the cooling tower. Where the cooling tower is very large, as in the case of power plants, the plume can cause low lying fog in the vicinity of the cooling tower. The plume can also cause icing on roads in the vicinity of the cooling tower where colder temperatures cause the moisture in the plume to freeze. Efforts have therefore been made to limit or eliminate the plume caused by cooling towers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One common way to limit plume is the introduction of ambient air. For example, plume abated cooling towers are employed where ambient air, in addition to being brought in at the bottom of the tower and forced upwards through a fill pack as hot water is sprayed down on the fill pack, is brought into the cooling tower through isolated heat conductive passageways above the hot water spray heads. These passageways which are made from a heat conductive material such as aluminum, steel, copper, etc., allow the ambient air to absorb some of the heat without moisture being evaporated into the air. Also, above the cooling fill, the wet laden heated air and the dry heated air are mixed thereby reducing the plume.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another cooling tower orientation employs a plume abatement system in which the hot water is partially cooled before being provided into the cooling tower. The partial cooling of the hot water is performed using a separate heat exchanger operating with a separate cooling medium such as air or water. The separate heat exchanger reduces the efficiency of the cooling tower and thus should only be employed when atmospheric conditions exist in which a plume would be created by the cooling tower.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another example of a system designed to reduce plume in a wet type cooling tower entails pumping hot water through a dry air cooling section where air is forced across heat exchange fins connected to the flow. The water, which has been partially cooled, is then sprayed over a fill pack positioned below the dry air cooling section and air is forced through the fill pack to further cool the water. The wet air is then forced upwards within the tower and mixed with the heated dry air from the dry cooling process and forced out the top of the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While the foregoing systems provide heat exchange for industrial processes in combination with solutions for addressing plume abatement, these systems or solutions oftentimes require the construction of a complex, and oftentimes costly, wet and dry air heat transfer mechanisms. This cost is partly due to each respective heat transfer mechanism, wet and dry, requiring use of separate vertical fan systems to provide air flow through their respective wet and dry sections. For example, during operation of such systems, and individual fan system is required to provide an air stream through the dry section and a second, separate fan system is required to provide an air stream through the wet section. The employment of the separate wet and dry fan systems add additional construction cost during construction. Also, the fan apparatus for the dry sections are typically oriented in a vertical position, requires the tower height to be significantly larger which is often times not desired or allowed. Moreover, each the individual fan systems require maintenance during the life cycle of the cooling tower systems, adding to the cost of operation of such systems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another drawback is the foregoing systems and design is the above-discussed fan assemblies are vertical in orientation as previously mentioned. This vertical orientation while may not be a drawback per se, it requires that the fans be a limited size and therefore additional fan assemblies may be required. This vertical orientation requires the towers to be larger in height and space as previously discussed increasing the vertical size of said cooling towers, potentially limiting the locations where the tower may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The foregoing shows that there is a need for a cost efficient cooling tower that allows for plume abatement as needed, in an efficient, economical manner. Moreover there is a need for a cost effective cooling tower system that utilizes an efficient plume abatement system would therefore be desirable.</p>

The air delivery section <b>20</b> also includes a lower outlet <b>42</b> that is in fluid communication with the wet heat exchange section <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The dry heat exchange apparatus <b>21</b> employs a heat exchanger <b>44</b> through which air flows. The heat exchanger <b>44</b> is positioned in front of the upper outlet <b>34</b>, and preferably extends the length of the upper outlet <b>34</b>. As illustrated, the heat exchanger <b>44</b> is connected to a series of conduits that carry the liquid or gas to be cooled, to and from the heat exchanger <b>44</b>. The conduits comprise an inlet conduit <b>46</b> and an outlet conduit <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring back to the wet heat exchanger <b>14</b>, it includes a cooling water distribution assembly <b>48</b> and cooling fill <b>50</b>. As previously mentioned, the wet heat exchanger <b>14</b> includes the cold water basin <b>18</b>. The cold water basin <b>18</b> is positioned below the water distribution assembly and cooling fill <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and partial plan, schematic view of the cooling tower <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is depicted, illustrating the wet heat exchange sections encircling the tower shell <b>12</b>. The respective air flow fans <b>30</b> are also illustrated positioned on top of each of the respective air delivery sections <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also depicts the various air mixing ducts <b>16</b> extending radially inward from the tower shell <b>12</b>. The air mixing ducts <b>16</b> can have varying lengths in order to provide ambient air to different radial locations, ensuring all portions of the cooling tower <b>10</b> have ambient air available. Moreover, the varying lengths of the ducts <b>16</b> ensure an ample supply of ambient air is provided around the perimeter of the cooling tower <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, during operation of the cooling tower <b>10</b>, the fan <b>30</b> functions to force air downward as indicated by the arrows. As previously discussed, the fan <b>30</b> is positioned horizontally along axis B. This positioning allows for the fan <b>30</b> to have a large diameter if desired. For example, in some applications the fan <b>30</b> may have a diameter greater than 7.1 meters. Moreover, in other applications, the fan may have a diameter of approximately 8.5 meters. The orientation and range in diameter size allow for only a single fan to be employed for the operation of the cooling tower <b>10</b>, eliminating the need for multiple fan assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If the damper <b>38</b> is open, the air will flow through the heat exchanger <b>44</b> and through the shell <b>12</b>. Concurrently, as indicated by the arrows, the air stream continues to flow downward through the lower outlet <b>42</b> and into the wet heat exchange portion <b>14</b>. To the contrary, if the damper <b>38</b> is closed, the air stream will not flow through the dry heat exchanger <b>44</b> and will flow downward through the lower outlet <b>42</b> as previously described. The damper <b>38</b> may be utilized to adjust airflow through the dry heat exchanger <b>44</b> as discussed where additional cooling is desired and/or in conditions where plume abatement is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Simultaneously as the fan <b>30</b> is directing the airflow through the tower <b>10</b>, water is supplied to the supply conduit <b>49</b>. The fluid, which is referred to herein as water or inlet water, may in some exemplary industrial applications range from 40&#xb0; F. to 210&#xb0; F. Although water is described in the following examples, various embodiments can be used with other fluids, including treated water or other liquids, any or all of which are referred to as water herein. The inlet water is passed to a two-way diverter valve, or control valve <b>52</b> as detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one configuration, the control valve <b>52</b> directs all or some of the water through the conduit <b>46</b> so that it enters the dry heat exchanger <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The dry heat exchanger <b>44</b> may include a serious of coils or tubes (not pictured) or the like. The water travels through the heat exchanger <b>44</b> and is cooled by the tubes or coils operating as a closed circuit heat exchanger with the ambient air. The water exits then the heat exchanger <b>44</b> via the outlet conduit <b>47</b> at which point it flows onto the wet heat exchange section <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Turning now to the heat exchange wet section <b>14</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the water departs the dry heat exchanger <b>44</b> and enters the cooling water distribution assembly <b>48</b>. The water distribution assembly <b>48</b>, can take many forms for example, a tray having nozzles or a conduit system have nozzles attached thereto, wherein the water drips or is sprayed downward from the from the distribution assembly in a distributed fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As it is sprayed or distributed, the water will contact and pass through the heat exchange media <b>50</b>. The heat exchange media <b>50</b> can take many forms, for example an evaporative fill media such as a series of splash bars or a sheet fill pack. As the water contacts the heat exchange media <b>50</b> heat exchange occurs. As the water exits the fill media, the water is collected in the cool water basin <b>18</b>. The water in the water cool water basin <b>18</b> can be extracted by a pump or gravity flow and returned to the process location for use or exhausted into the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a wet cooling tower in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is depicted. The hybrid cooling tower, generally designated <b>200</b>, is similar to the embodiments described and discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, however instead of employing both a wet and a dry heat exchange section, the cooling tower <b>200</b> employs a wet section only.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The cooling tower <b>200</b> has a an internal framework (not illustrated) which supports the various components that will be discussed The cooling tower <b>200</b> includes a tower shell <b>202</b> wherein the shell <b>202</b> internally houses a wet heat exchanger section <b>204</b> along with a cold water basin <b>206</b>. The cooling tower <b>200</b> generally includes a support structure of frame assembly comprising a base <b>207</b> and support walls <b>208</b>. The walls <b>208</b> extend upwardly along a vertical axis C away from the base <b>207</b> to a top portion <b>210</b> to which a fan shroud <b>212</b> is attached. The fan shroud <b>212</b> houses a fan <b>214</b> and portions of its drive mechanism. As illustrated, the fan <b>214</b> lies in a plane D that is normal or perpendicular to the vertical axis C. The wet heat exchanger further includes a cooling water distribution assembly <b>216</b> and cooling fill <b>218</b> positioned above the cold water basin <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">During operation of the cooling tower <b>200</b>, the fan <b>214</b> functions for force air downward as indicated by the arrows. As previously discussed, the fan <b>214</b> is positioned horizontally along axis D. This positioning allows for the fan <b>214</b> to have a large diameter. For example, in some applications the fan <b>214</b> may have a diameter greater than 7.1 meters. Moreover, in other applications, the fan <b>214</b> may have a diameter of approximately 8.5 meters. The orientation and range in diameter size allow for only a single fan to be employed for the operation of the cooling tower <b>200</b>, eliminating the need for multiple fan assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As the fan assembly generates the downward airstream, the liquid to be cooled enters the cooling water distributions assembly <b>216</b>. The water distribution assembly <b>216</b>, for example, can take many forms as discussed in connection with the other embodiments, for example, a tray having nozzles or a conduit system having dispersement nozzles attached thereto. The water drips or is sprayed downward from the from the distribution assembly <b>216</b> in a distributed fashion. As it is sprayed, the water will contact and pass through the heat exchange media <b>218</b>. The heat exchange media can take many forms, for example an evaporative fill media such as a series of splash bars or a sheet fill pack. As the water contacts the heat exchange media <b>218</b> heat exchange occurs. As the water exits the fill media, the water is collected in the cool water basin <b>206</b>. The water in the cool water basin <b>207</b> can be extracted by a pump or gravity flow and returned to the process location for use or exhausted into the environment.</p>
