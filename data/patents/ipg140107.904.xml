<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application hereby claims priority under 35 U.S.C. Section 119 to Italian Patent application number MI2011A000830, filed May 12, 2011, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to high temperature-resistant steam valves, and more particularly to steam valves for steam turbines. For the purposes of this specification the term &#x201c;high-temperature&#x201d; shall be taken to mean at least 650 degrees Celsius.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An effective means to increase power generation efficiency of a steam turbine is to raise the turbine steam temperature to 650 deg. C. or more.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Special considerations may be made for these high temperatures. For example, the valve may require cooling features or additionally may be made of high hot strength materials. While cooling means typically have only limited effectiveness, the use of different materials in a valve can introduce problems as different materials have different coefficients of expansion and thus upon heating, unacceptable internal stresses may be created which may adversely affect service life.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure relates to a steam valve including a chest, a lock, a spindle, and a strainer. Each of these components is made of specific Ni alloys combinations that enable the valve to operate at temperatures above 650&#xb0; C. with a good service life.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Introduction to the Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A high temperature steam valve is disclosed that addresses the problem of service life, particularly the problem of cracking and oxidation due to high temperature operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure attempts to address this problem by means of the subject matters of the independent claim. Advantageous embodiments are given in the dependent claim.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosure is based on the general idea using specific materials combinations for component pieces of a steam turbine valve.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure is now described with reference to the drawing, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosure. However, the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details, and as such is not limited to the exemplary embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a series of two high temperature steam turbine valves <b>5</b>. Exemplary embodiments maybe applied to any one or both of the valves <b>5</b>. The valves <b>5</b> each comprise a chest <b>10</b>, which is a casing that forms a chamber. In the chamber is a lock <b>17</b> with a cavity through which a spindle <b>15</b> extends. The spindle <b>15</b> has two distal ends. One end protrudes out from the chest <b>10</b> while the other end is located in the chamber. The purpose of the lock <b>17</b> is to guide the movement of the spindle <b>15</b> whose purpose is to movably position a valve closing member <b>20</b>, for example a disk, plug or equivalent, relative to a seat <b>24</b>, so as to bring the valve <b>5</b> either into an open or closed state. A strainer <b>25</b> is located in the chamber upstream of the closing means and preferably at least partially in the inlet port <b>12</b>. These locations enable the strainer <b>25</b> to perform its function of retaining solid particles typically present in the steam, thus reducing potential damage to the valves closing means.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">At a downstream end of the valve <b>5</b>, a plurality of bolts <b>30</b> are optionally provided. The purpose of the bolts <b>30</b> is to provide a means to fix the valve <b>5</b> relative to further steam turbine equipment items. These items may include, but are not limited to further piping, turbine casings, and further valves.</p>
