<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to firearm accessories.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More particularly, the present invention relates to sights for firearms.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the field of firearms, sights are numerous and varied but are used for a single purpose. A sight system is intended to put a bullet on a target. Sight systems include, in a basic form, a rear sight and a front sight. Lining up the front sight with the rear sight is intended to determine the striking position of the bullet. However, there are added factors complicating this simple process. The distance the bullet must travel will cause a deviation from the designated target. In other words, a front and rear sight can be adjusted to deliver bullet on target at a specific distance. A greater distance will result in a low bullet strike. This deviation can be accounted for by adjusting the front or rear sight relative the other. However, adjustable sights require that the sight be tested as adjusted to determine the appropriate amount of adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be highly advantageous, therefore, to remedy the foregoing and other deficiencies inherent in the prior art by having pre-set sight distances.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Briefly, to achieve the desired objects and advantages of the instant invention, provided is a sight for a firearm. The sight for use on a firearm includes a frame member mountable to a firearm and having a pair of spaced apart posts extending therefrom, a support member extending transversely between the pair of posts and selectively rotatable with respect thereto, and a sight element. The sight element is carried by the support member between the posts. The sight element includes a central portion rotatably coupled to the support member, a first sight aperture portion extending from the central portion and defining a first aperture formed in a diamond shape with an upper v-notch and a lower v-notch, and a second sight aperture portion extending from the central portion and defining a second aperture formed in a diamond shape.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a specific aspect, the sight element is constrained from lateral movement along the support member. Furthermore, the support member extends through one of the pair of posts and terminating in a knob to facilitate rotation of the support member with respect to the pair of posts such that the support member can be moved longitudinally between the pair of posts, coincidentally moving the sight element and allowing minute of angle adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a rear sight for a firearm is provided. The rear sight includes a mounting base, a frame member having an end pivotally coupled to the base and an opposing end, a pair of spaced apart posts extend from the opposing end of the frame member, a support member extending transversely between the pair of posts and selectively rotatable with respect thereto, and a sight element carried by the support member between the posts. The sight element includes a central portion, a first sight aperture portion extending from the central portion and defining a first aperture formed in a diamond shape with an upper v-notch and a lower v-notch, and a second sight aperture portion extending from the central portion and defining a second aperture formed in a diamond shape being smaller than the first aperture.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect, a sight for use with a firearm is provided, including a sight element. The sight element includes a central portion, a first sight aperture portion extending from the central portion and defining a first aperture formed in a diamond shape with an upper v-notch and a lower v-notch, and a second sight aperture portion extending from the central portion and defining a second aperture formed in a diamond shape.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Specific objects and advantages of the instant invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which:</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a rear sight in a first configuration, according to the resent invention;</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Turning now to the drawings in which like reference characters indicate corresponding elements throughout the several views, attention is first directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> which illustrates a rear sight for use on a firearm, generally designated <b>10</b>. Rear sight <b>10</b> is couplable to, or proximate, the receiver of a firearm and is used in combination with a front sight. Sight <b>10</b>, in the present embodiment includes an attachment base <b>12</b> configured to be received by and secured to a rail of a firearm. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the rail can be attached to or be a part of the receiver of a firearm, or can be a part of or attached to a handguard carried by the firearm. It will also be understood that a fixed or integral base can also be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A pivoting frame member <b>14</b> includes an end <b>15</b> pivotally coupled to base <b>12</b> and an opposing end <b>16</b>. Frame member <b>14</b> is moveable between an upright position (illustrated) in which sight <b>10</b> is configured for use, and a lowered position for storage. Opposing end <b>16</b> includes spaced apart posts <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> extending therefrom. When support member <b>14</b> is in the upright position, posts <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> extend upwardly. Frame member <b>14</b> includes a support member <b>20</b> extending transversely between posts <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> and is selectively rotatable with respect thereto. An end of support member <b>20</b> extends through post <b>19</b> and terminates in a knob <b>22</b>. Knob <b>22</b> facilitates rotation of support member <b>20</b> with respect to posts <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a sight element <b>30</b> is carried by support member <b>20</b> and positioned so as to be substantially centrally located between posts <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. Sight element <b>30</b> includes a central portion <b>32</b> with a transverse opening <b>34</b>, a sight aperture portion <b>36</b> extending from central portion <b>32</b> and a sight aperture portion <b>38</b> extending from central portion <b>32</b> opposite sight aperture portion <b>36</b>. Sight aperture portion <b>36</b> includes an aperture <b>40</b> formed therethrough, and sight aperture <b>38</b> has an aperture or notch <b>42</b> formed therethrough. Sight aperture portion <b>36</b> and sight aperture portion <b>38</b> are at a 135 degree angle with respect to each other in the preferred embodiment. Sight element <b>30</b> is constrained from lateral movement along support member <b>20</b>, generally fixed in the center thereof, but rotatable thereon between two positions. Lateral movement of sight element <b>30</b> is constrained with respect to support member <b>20</b> so that longitudinal movement of support member <b>20</b> between posts <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> controllably and reproducibly adjusts the position of sight element <b>30</b> relative posts <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>. Rotational movement of sight element <b>30</b> with respect to support member <b>20</b> is between a position wherein sight aperture portion <b>36</b> is upright (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and a position wherein sight aperture portion <b>38</b> is upright (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Aperture <b>40</b> is preferably formed in a diamond shape with an upper v-notch and a lower v-notch. The upper and lower notches can be used as sighting locations each having specific ranges. The center of aperture <b>40</b> can be another sighting distance that has been pre-calibrated. Thus, with sight aperture portion <b>36</b> in the upright position, multiple sighting indexes can be provided. By using knob <b>22</b>, support member <b>20</b> can be moved longitudinally between posts <b>18</b> and <b>19</b>, coincidentally moving sight element <b>30</b> and allowing minute of angle adjustment. Knob <b>22</b> preferably includes incremental movements referred to as &#x201c;clicks&#x201d;. Preferably, each incremental &#x201c;click&#x201d; is in increments of 0.50 minutes of angle. Additionally, sight element <b>30</b> can be rotated on support member <b>20</b> to place sight aperture portion <b>38</b> in the upright position. Aperture <b>42</b> then functions as the sight aperture. In this embodiment, aperture <b>42</b> is also diamond shaped, but has smaller dimensions to facilitate sighting on targets at a greater distance away. The top v-notch in this instance can be open to facilitate target acquisition at the greater ranges. Thus aperture <b>42</b> has sighting distances that have been pre-calibrated. By employing rear sight <b>10</b>, multiple sight options are available for distances over a large range without requiring incremental adjustment of the sight.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Various changes and modifications to the embodiments herein chosen for purposes of illustration will readily occur to those skilled in the art. To the extent that such modifications and variations do not depart from the spirit of the invention, they are intended to be included within the scope thereof, which is assessed only by a fair interpretation of the following claims.</p>
