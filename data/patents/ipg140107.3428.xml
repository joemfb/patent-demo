<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A plasma display panel includes a phosphor layer inside discharge cells partitioned by barrier ribs and a plurality of electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When driving signals are applied to the electrodes of the plasma display panel, a discharge occurs inside the discharge cells. More specifically, when the discharge occurs in the discharge cells by applying the driving signals to the electrodes, a discharge gas filled in the discharge cells generates vacuum ultraviolet rays, which thereby cause phosphors between the barrier ribs to emit visible light. An image is displayed on the screen of the plasma display panel using the visible light.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, there is a plasma display panel comprising a front substrate, a back substrate positioned opposite the front substrate, a barrier rib positioned between the front substrate and the back substrate to partition a discharge cell, and a seal portion positioned outside the barrier rib in an area between the front substrate and the back substrate, wherein a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion on one side of the plasma display panel is different from a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion on the other side of the plasma display panel opposite the one side.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect there is a plasma display panel comprising a front substrate, a back substrate positioned opposite the front substrate, a barrier rib positioned between the front substrate and the back substrate to partition a discharge cell, and a seal portion positioned outside the barrier rib in an area between the front substrate and the back substrate, wherein a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion in a first region of each of the front substrate and the back substrate is different from a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion in a second region of each of the front substrate and the back substrate opposite the first region, wherein a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion in a third region of each of the front substrate and the back substrate adjacent to the first and second regions is different from a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion in a fourth region of each of the front substrate and the back substrate opposite the third region.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect, there is a multi plasma display panel comprising a first plasma display panel and a second plasma display panel disposed adjacent to the first plasma display panel, wherein each of the first and second plasma display panels includes a front substrate, a back substrate positioned opposite the front substrate, a barrier rib positioned between the front substrate and the back substrate to partition a discharge cell, and a seal portion positioned outside the barrier rib in an area between the front substrate and the back substrate, wherein a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion on one side of each of the first and second plasma display panels is greater than a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion on the other side of each of the first and second plasma display panels opposite the one side.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still another aspect, there is a multi plasma display panel comprising a first plasma display panel, a second plasma display panel disposed adjacent to the first plasma display panel in a first direction, a third plasma display panel disposed adjacent to the first plasma display panel in a second direction crossing the first direction, and a fourth plasma display panel that is disposed adjacent to the third plasma display panel in the first direction and is disposed adjacent to the second plasma display panel in the second direction, wherein each of the first, second, third, and fourth plasma display panels includes a front substrate, a back substrate positioned opposite the front substrate, a barrier rib positioned between the front substrate and the back substrate to partition a discharge cell, and a seal portion positioned outside the barrier rib in an area between the front substrate and the back substrate, wherein a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion in a first region of each of the front substrate and the back substrate of each of the first to fourth plasma display panels is different from a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion in a second region of each of the front substrate and the back substrate of each of the first to fourth plasma display panels opposite the first region, wherein a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion in a third region of each of the front substrate and the back substrate of each of the first to fourth plasma display panels adjacent to the first and second regions is different from a distance between the barrier rib and the seal portion in a fourth region of each of the front substrate and the back substrate of each of the first to fourth plasma display panels opposite the third region.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the plasma display panel may include a front substrate <b>201</b>, on which a plurality of first electrodes <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> are formed, and a back substrate <b>211</b> on which a plurality of second electrodes <b>213</b> are formed to cross the first electrodes <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the first electrodes <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> may include scan electrodes <b>202</b> and sustain electrodes <b>203</b> substantially parallel to each other, and the second electrodes <b>213</b> may be called address electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An upper dielectric layer <b>204</b> may be formed on the scan electrode <b>202</b> and the sustain electrode <b>203</b> to limit a discharge current of the scan electrode <b>202</b> and the sustain electrode <b>203</b> and to provide insulation between the scan electrode <b>202</b> and the sustain electrode <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A protective layer <b>205</b> may be formed on the upper dielectric layer <b>204</b> to facilitate discharge conditions. The protective layer <b>205</b> may be formed of a material having a high secondary electron emission coefficient, for example, magnesium oxide (MgO).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A lower dielectric layer <b>215</b> may be formed on the address electrode <b>213</b> to provide insulation between the address electrodes <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Barrier ribs <b>212</b> of a stripe type, a well type, a delta type, a honeycomb type, etc. may be formed on the lower dielectric layer <b>215</b> to provide discharge spaces (i.e., discharge cells). Hence, a first discharge cell emitting red light, a second discharge cell emitting blue light, and a third discharge cell emitting green light, etc. may be formed between the front substrate <b>201</b> and the back substrate <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The address electrode <b>213</b> may cross the scan electrode <b>202</b> and the sustain electrode <b>203</b> in one discharge cell. Namely, each discharge cell is formed at a crossing of the scan electrode <b>202</b>, the sustain electrode <b>203</b>, and the address electrode <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each of the discharge cells provided by the barrier ribs <b>212</b> may be filled with a predetermined discharge gas.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A phosphor layer <b>214</b> may be formed inside the discharge cells to emit visible light for an image display during an address discharge. For example, first, second, and third phosphor layers that respectively generate red, blue, and green light may be &#x26;tined inside the discharge cells.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While the address electrode <b>213</b> may have a substantially constant width or thickness, a width or thickness of the address electrode <b>213</b> inside the discharge cell may be different from a width or thickness of the address electrode <b>213</b> outside the discharge cell. For example, a width or thickness of the address electrode <b>213</b> inside the discharge cell may be greater than a width or thickness of the address electrode <b>213</b> outside the discharge cell.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When a predetermined signal is supplied to at least one of the scan electrode <b>202</b>, the sustain electrode <b>203</b>, and the address electrode <b>213</b>, a discharge may occur inside the discharge cell. The discharge may allow the discharge gas filled in the discharge cell to generate ultraviolet rays. The ultraviolet rays may be incident on phosphor particles of the phosphor layer <b>214</b>, and then the phosphor particles may emit visible light. Hence, an image may be displayed on the screen of the plasma display panel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A frame for achieving a gray scale of an image displayed on the plasma display panel is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a frame for achieving a gray scale of an image may include a plurality of subfields. Each of the plurality of subfields may be divided into an address period and a sustain period. During the address period, the discharge cells not to generate a discharge may be selected or the discharge cells to generate a discharge may be selected. During the sustain period, a gray scale may be achieved depending on the number of discharges.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, if an image with 256-gray level is to be displayed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a frame may be divided into 8 subfields SF<b>1</b> to SF<b>8</b>. Each of the 8 subfields SF<b>1</b> to SF<b>8</b> may include an address period and a sustain period.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, at least one of a plurality of subfields of a frame may further include a reset period for initialization. At least one of a plurality of subfields of a frame may not include a sustain period.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The number of sustain signals supplied during the sustain period may determine a gray level of each of the subfields. For example, in such a method of setting a gray level of a first subfield at 2<sup>0 </sup>and a gray level of a second subfield at 2<sup>1</sup>, the sustain period increases in a ratio of 2<sup>n </sup>(where, n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) in each of the subfields. Hence, various gray levels of an image may be achieved by controlling the number of sustain signals supplied during the sustain period of each subfield depending on a gray level of each subfield.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that one frame includes 8 subfields, the number of subfields constituting a frame may vary. For example, a frame may include 10 or 12 subfields. Further, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that the subfields of the frame are arranged in increasing order of gray level weight, the subfields may be arranged in decreasing order of gray level weight or may be arranged regardless of gray level weight.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A driving waveform for driving the plasma display panel is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a reset signal RS may be supplied to the scan electrode Y during a reset period RP for initialization of at least one of a plurality of subfields of a frame. The reset signal RS may include a ramp-up signal RU with a gradually rising voltage and a ramp-down signal RD with a gradually falling voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">More specifically, the ramp-up signal RU may be supplied to the scan electrode Y during a setup period of the reset period RP, and the ramp-down signal RD may be supplied to the scan electrode Y during a set-down period following the setup period SU. The ramp-up signal RU may generate a weak dark discharge (i.e., a setup discharge) inside the discharge cells. Hence, the wall charges may be uniformly distributed inside the discharge cells. The ramp-down signal RD subsequent to the ramp-up signal RU may generate a weak erase discharge (i.e., a set-down discharge) inside the discharge cells. Hence, the remaining wall charges may be uniformly distributed inside the discharge cells to the extent that an address discharge occurs stably.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">During an address period AP following the reset period RP, a scan reference signal Ybias having a voltage greater than a minimum voltage of the ramp-down signal RD may be supplied to the scan electrode Y. In addition, a scan signal Sc falling from a voltage of the scan reference signal Ybias may be supplied to the scan electrode Y.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A pulse width of a scan signal supplied to the scan electrode during an address period of at least one subfield of a frame may be different from pulse widths of scan signals supplied during address periods of the other subfields of the frame. A pulse width of a scan signal in a subfield may be greater than a pulse width of a scan signal in a next subfield. For example, a pulse width of the scan signal may be gradually reduced in the order of 2.6 &#x3bc;s, 2.3 &#x3bc;s, 2.1 &#x3bc;s, 1.9 &#x3bc;s, etc. or may be reduced in the order of 2.6 &#x3bc;s, 2.3 &#x3bc;s, 2.3 &#x3bc;s, 2.1 &#x3bc;s, . . . , 1.9 &#x3bc;s, 1.9 &#x3bc;s, etc. in the successively arranged subfields.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As above, when the scan signal Sc is supplied to the scan electrode Y, a data signal Dt corresponding to the scan signal Sc may be supplied to the address electrode X. As a voltage difference between the scan signal Sc and the data signal Dt is added to a wall voltage obtained by the wall charges produced during the reset period RP, an address discharge may occur inside the discharge cell to which the data signal Dt is supplied. In addition, during the address period AP, a sustain reference signal Zbias may be supplied to the sustain electrode Z, so that the address discharge efficiently occurs between the scan electrode Y and the address electrode X.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">During a sustain period SP following the address period AP, a sustain signal SUS may be supplied to at least one of the scan electrode Y or the sustain electrode Z. For example, the sustain signal SUS may be alternately supplied to the scan electrode Y and the sustain electrode Z. Further, the address electrode X may be electrically floated during the sustain period SP. As the wall voltage inside the discharge cell selected by performing the address discharge is added to a sustain voltage Vs of the sustain signal SUS, every time the sustain signal SUS is supplied, a sustain discharge, i.e., a display discharge may occur between the scan electrode Y and the sustain electrode Z.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>), a seal portion <b>400</b> may be formed outside the barrier rib <b>212</b> in an area between the front substrate <b>201</b> and the back substrate <b>211</b>. In other words, the seal portion <b>400</b> may be formed at an edge of at least one of the front substrate <b>201</b> and the back substrate <b>211</b> on which an exhaust hole <b>200</b> is formed. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>), the front substrate <b>201</b> and the back substrate <b>211</b> may be attached to each other through the seal portion <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>c</i>), an exhaust tip <b>220</b> may be connected to the exhaust hole <b>200</b>, and an exhaust pump <b>230</b> may be connected to the exhaust tip <b>220</b>. The exhaust pump <b>230</b> may exhaust an impurity gas remaining in a discharge space between the front substrate <b>201</b> and the back substrate <b>211</b> to the outside and may inject a discharge gas such as argon (Ar), neon (Ne), and xenon (Xe) into the discharge space. The discharge space between the front substrate <b>201</b> and the back substrate <b>211</b> may be sealed through the above-described method.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a distance between the seal portion <b>400</b> and the barrier rib <b>212</b> may vary depending on a component location of the plasma display panel.</p>

For example, a distance between the seal portion <b>400</b> and the barrier rib <b>212</b> at one side of the back substrate <b>211</b> may be different from a distance between the seal portion <b>400</b> and the barrier rib <b>212</b> at the opposite side of the back substrate <b>211</b>. Alternatively, it may seem that a distance between the seal portion <b>400</b> and the barrier rib <b>212</b> at one side of the front substrate <b>201</b> is different from a distance between the seal portion <b>400</b> and the barrier rib <b>212</b> at the opposite side of the front substrate <b>201</b>.
