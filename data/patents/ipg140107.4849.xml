<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An efficient grating coupler for a semiconductor optical mode includes a tapered edge to couple light between waveguide modes constrained by differing waveguide thicknesses. An optical circuit or laser has a waveguide in a rib or strip waveguide section that is of different height (e.g., having different vertical constraints) than a waveguide section that has a grating coupler through which light passes off-circuit. The tapered edge can couple light between the two waveguide sections with very low loss and back-reflection. The low loss and minimal back-reflection enables testing of the photonics circuit on a wafer level, and improved performance through the grating coupler.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is a significant increase in the use of optics in computing systems. Semiconductor photonics are increasingly used to meet the increased use of optics. Semiconductor photonics can be integrated on an integrated circuit (I/C) with known processing techniques. The resulting photonic I/Cs (PIC) have a small form factor, and can be integrated into circuits for use in telecommunication and data communication, biomedical devices, bio-sensing systems, gaming systems, and other uses.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There has been an interest in the use of silicon-based photonics (Si photonics) because of the fact that Si photonics materials processing is compatible with standard CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) fabrication techniques and equipments. The pervasive use and knowledge of silicon processes allows for the design and manufacture of very compact Si photonics devices with current techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, coupling light into and out of sub-micron semiconductor devices such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI) PICs with high efficiency is difficult because of a small waveguide mode size and attendant large optical beam divergence. Current techniques involve the use of a surface grating coupler (GC) formed by periodically etching a SOI waveguide, so light can then be coupled out of the plane of the planar PICs. Unlike edge coupling where polished optical facets of singulated devices (e.g., dies) are required, the use of GCs allows access to the devices from the wafer surface and therefore enables wafer-level testing and characterization, which is essential for high-volume manufacture demand.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A major drawback with GCs is that their coupling efficiency is typically lower than that of an edge coupling method. GCs may be more efficient at certain processing thicknesses than at others. For example, traditional GC designs have relatively high efficiency when coupling to a 220 nm SOI platform, but the efficiency decreases rapidly with increasing SOI thickness. Given that a preferred integration platform for SOI PICS is based on a 400 nm thickness, the coupling efficiency of the GC is significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, conventional GC designs usually feature high back-reflection as a result of the enhancement of coupling efficiency by a deep etch into the SOI. The back-reflection can easily cause instability when operating a integrated laser, as well as causing uncertainties in measuring device spectral responses. Traditionally, when light propagates in the waveguide and reaches the GC region, it gets scattered by the periodic structures of GC. Some scattered power is directed out of the waveguide plane as desired, and some is scattered downwards into the substrate and lost.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, traditional coupling efficiency as determined by the power scattered into the substrate is usually limited to a maximum of &#x2212;3 dB. However, factoring in other loss mechanisms such as fabrication imperfections and mode mismatch between GC and coupling fiber usually results in a typically achievable coupling efficiency of less than &#x2212;6 dB.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Descriptions of certain details and implementations follow, including a description of the figures, which may depict some or all of the embodiments described below, as well as discussing other potential embodiments or implementations of the inventive concepts presented herein. An overview of embodiments of the invention is provided below, followed by a more detailed description with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As provided herein, an efficient grating coupler includes a tapered edge to couple light between waveguide modes constrained by differing waveguide thicknesses. The optical circuit or laser includes a rib or strip waveguide section that has a waveguide mode in an active region that has different vertical constraints than a waveguide mode in the grating coupler. The tapered edge is included at the end of the rib waveguide section interfacing between the rib waveguide and the grating coupler (e.g., through a slab waveguide section), and couples light between the rib waveguide and the grating coupler with very low loss and low back-reflection.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The improved coupling performance in operation of the circuit makes for a more efficient optical chip in use. Additionally, the improved coupling performance provides performance that allows the optical circuit to be tested in-wafer, which improves the meeting of demands of high-volume manufacturing. In one embodiment, the final optical circuit includes a fully-integrated transmitter (FIT) based on a hybrid laser, a high-speed silicon modulator, and a nitride inverted taper coupler.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective diagram of an embodiment of a grating coupler to optically interface with a tapered waveguide edge. Circuit <b>100</b> illustrates a portion of an integrated circuit (I/C). The I/C may be part of any of a number of devices using optical signals, such as optical transmitters and/or receivers, optical processing elements, electrical-optical or optical-electrical conversion circuits, or other devices. Similar to what is mentioned above, such optical signal devices may include devices for use in telecommunication and/or data communication, biomedical devices, bio-sensing systems, environmental sensors, gaming systems, or other areas.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As illustrated, circuit <b>100</b> includes rib waveguide <b>110</b>, which may be connected to grating coupler <b>120</b> through slab waveguide <b>140</b>. Rib waveguide <b>110</b> includes taper <b>130</b>, which may also be referred to as an &#x201c;inverted taper&#x201d;. For purposes of simplicity, reference wilt generally be made to a taper or a tapered edge, but will be understood that &#x201c;inverted taper&#x201d; could also be used to describe the tapered end between the body of rib waveguide <b>110</b> and grating coupler <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Rib waveguide <b>110</b> may also be referred to as a &#x201c;strip&#x201d; waveguide, and is generally defined as having a portion of material that has vertical edges, and a top surface above the surface of the semiconductor substrate or slab. Rib waveguide <b>110</b> has a waveguide mode, where appropriate bias and signaling is provided to cause circuit <b>100</b> to transmit and/or receive an optical signal. It will be understood that the waveguide mode is a region that is activated in an active region of circuit <b>100</b>, when circuit <b>100</b> is appropriately biased. For purposes of simplicity in description, circuit <b>100</b> will be described simply as having a waveguide, without necessarily explicitly referring to the active region of the circuit. The waveguide mode in rib waveguide <b>110</b> will exist and convey an optical signal in a direction parallel to the semiconductor substrate, constrained by rib waveguide <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The vertical edges will generally constrain the waveguide mode and cause the photons to move along the waveguide mode in a lengthwise axis of rib waveguide <b>110</b>. The top surface of rib waveguide <b>110</b> will generally constrain the waveguide mode in a vertical direction. The top surface of rib waveguide <b>110</b> will have a thickness, or a height relative to a beginning of the semiconductor substrate on which it is integrated. As mentioned above, silicon laser circuits are commonly designed with a thickness of approximately 400 nanometers. In one embodiment, semiconductor material other than silicon-on-insulator (SOI) may be used, and a different semiconductor material (such as II-V material) could be used to process the waveguides. In certain embodiments, depending on semiconductor material type and desired use of the optical circuit, other thicknesses could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Grating coupler <b>120</b> is a grating region of circuit <b>100</b>. The vertical structures of grating coupler <b>120</b> are perpendicular to the direction light would travel along rib waveguide <b>110</b> (going either direction). It will be observed that the structures protrude up off the semiconductor substrate in the grating region, in contrast to traditional designs that simply etch trenches into a grating region. Thus, for purposes of distinction, traditional grating designs may be referred to as &#x201c;trench&#x201d; grating couplers, and the structure or design presented herein may be referred to as a &#x201c;fin&#x201d; grating coupler. The fins extend up to the same or approximately the same height as rib waveguide <b>110</b> at the top surfaces of the fins. Thus, they may be said in one embodiment to be in the same plane as the rib waveguide. The fins may be in substantially the same plane in that the heights and/or the substrates do not necessarily have to identically align.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The fins are spaced periodically apart from each other by a spacing. In one embodiment, the spacing is approximately equal to the height of the fins. A waveguide mode will exist within the grating coupler region of circuit <b>100</b>. Again, the waveguide mode exists in the active region, which will not be specifically referred to. The vertical constraints on the waveguide mode in the grating coupler region are tighter than those of rib waveguide <b>110</b>. Thus, the waveguide mode in grating coupler <b>120</b> is constrained by a vertical thickness different than that of the waveguide mode of rib waveguide <b>110</b>. The use of the grating coupler and the taper may be effective for vertical differences of at least ten percent or more. In one embodiment, grating coupler <b>120</b> has its highest efficiency around 200 nanometers, which is nearly 50% less than the example 400 nm of rib waveguide <b>110</b> mentioned above. In one embodiment, the thickness of slab waveguide <b>140</b> is approximately 200 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The principal point in indicating the heights (or thicknesses or vertical constraints is in pointing out that different waveguide mode thicknesses exist between rib waveguide <b>110</b> and grating coupler <b>120</b>. While examples may be described herein with reference to specific thicknesses, these should be understood as examples only, and are not limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Taper <b>130</b> is included in (integrated onto or with) rib waveguide <b>110</b>. While it may be described as a separate component, it will be understood that it can be produced with the same processing steps that generate rib waveguide <b>110</b>. Thus, in one embodiment, taper <b>130</b> could be considered to be part of rib waveguide <b>110</b>. Taper <b>130</b> tapers the outer, vertical edges of rib waveguide <b>110</b> to a narrower structure. In one embodiment, the narrower portion is the convergence of the vertical edges in a point (or rather, in a vertical line). The tapering &#x201c;points&#x201d; from the rib waveguide to grating coupler <b>120</b> along the horizontal axis of the direction of propagation of light in the waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Taper <b>130</b> focuses or expands light between rib waveguide <b>110</b> and grating coupler <b>120</b>. The focusing of the optical mode could be considered to &#x201c;squeeze&#x201d; the larger waveguide mode down to the smaller one, or expand from the smaller to the larger in the reverse direction. Taper <b>130</b> may be considered to function similarly to a lens component that couples optical fibers together. In contrast to a lens, taper <b>130</b> is integrated directly onto the same semiconductor substrate as the waveguides, and exchanges optical signals on-die.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, circuit <b>100</b> includes slab waveguide <b>140</b>, which may or may not be situated between rib waveguide <b>110</b> and grating coupler <b>120</b>, or more precisely, between taper <b>130</b> and grating coupler <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the thickness of slab waveguide <b>140</b> is what provides the vertical constraint of the waveguide mode in grating coupler <b>120</b>. Slab waveguide <b>140</b> is defined by the areas of the substrate that are removed to define the optical pathway between rib waveguide <b>110</b> and grating coupler <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The use of grating coupler <b>120</b> in combination with taper <b>130</b> allows for better matching, and thus more efficient performance, of circuit <b>100</b>. The transfer from the larger to the smaller waveguide modes or from the smaller to the larger waveguide modes can reduce optical mode mismatch. Additionally, the higher efficiency removes the need to generate a singulated device with polished edges to test the functionality and characterization of circuit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a grating coupler design. Circuit <b>200</b> illustrates an example of a photonics circuit according to any embodiment described herein, such as circuit <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Circuit <b>200</b> includes semiconductor bulk <b>210</b>, which represents any bulk or base material on which integrated circuits are integrated. Semiconductor bulk <b>210</b> includes the wafer material on which the I/Cs are processed. It will be understood that various features illustrated in circuit <b>200</b> are not to scale, but are merely representative of features and functionality present in a photonics circuit as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Semiconductor substrate <b>220</b> represents semiconductor material that is processed onto semiconductor bulk <b>210</b>. A substrate may be processed onto semiconductor bulk <b>210</b> via any known processing techniques, including depositing, growing, etching, or other techniques. In one embodiment, semiconductor substrate <b>220</b> includes silicon-on-insulator (SOI). Semiconductor substrate <b>220</b> includes a series or sequence of fins in a periodic grating connected. In one embodiment, the grating portion is connected to a slab waveguide with a taper interfacing the slab waveguide to a rib waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an active region of circuit <b>200</b>, a waveguide mode is induced within semiconductor substrate <b>220</b>, which conveys light <b>222</b> from other areas of circuit <b>200</b> into the grating region for emission out the top of cladding <b>230</b> (as shown for the transmission of an optical signal). Light <b>222</b> is transferred through semiconductor substrate <b>220</b> from another area (not shown), and light <b>224</b> is emitted out through the grating coupler in a transmission mode. In accordance with what is described above, semiconductor substrate <b>220</b> has a thickness <b>242</b> (e.g., &#x2dc;200 nm). Light <b>222</b> is originated in an area having a thickness <b>244</b>, larger than thickness <b>242</b> (e.g., &#x2dc;400 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it will be understood that in accordance with what is described herein, light <b>222</b> is generated in a region of greater thickness <b>244</b>, and focused through a tapered edge to thickness <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, buried layer <b>212</b> or a deep layer is used in addition to the taper and grating coupler described herein. The deep layer is represented generically in circuit <b>200</b> as buried layer <b>212</b>, and can represent anything from a double SOI substrate to a buried metal reflector processed under the grating coupler region. Alternatively, the deep layer may simply be an undercut edge that is used to remove a buried insulator layer to improve diffraction efficiency. Thus, the substrate on which the grating coupler is processed may be or include buried layer <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will be understood that one advantage of the use of the taper and the grating coupler is that they can be processed with a standard etching technique. Alternatively, a silicon overlay layer may be placed over the substrate <b>220</b> (e.g., using a-Si deposition or c-Si epitaxy) and then the grating coupler is defined on it. With such implementations, the geometric similarity between the superstrate and the substrate is lifted, which may enhance the power scattered into the superstrate. The use of a metallic film such as gold (Au) or aluminum (Al) beneath the grating coupler allows the device to reflect optical signals back up to the superstrate. Under a suitable constructive interference condition, the power scattered into the superstrate is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The use of the taper and grating coupler described herein does not introduce the increased processing complexity, but may enhance the performance in the circumstance that one of the techniques is used.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref> illustrate an embodiment of a comparison of grating coupler diffraction efficiency. Both figures provide illustrations of diffraction (toward the superstrate) efficiency as a function of etch depth, etch width, and grating period. The efficiency is plotted from simulations of a traditional circuit having a &#x201c;trench&#x201d; grating coupler on <b>501</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, and a circuit having a &#x201c;fin&#x201d; grating coupler and a tapered edge on SOI as described herein in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. In both figures, the top oxide cladding is assumed to be 1 &#x3bc;m thick, the etch width is normalized by the grating period, and the etch depth is normalized by 400 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, at optimum operation points showing diffraction efficiency intensity <b>310</b>, the device features are approximately &#x2212;2.5 dB insertion loss (where darker shading shows increased efficiency). Simulations show that the maximum diffraction efficiency is 56% and the corresponding back-reflection is 11%.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, at optimum operation points showing diffraction efficiency intensity <b>320</b>, the device features are approximately &#x2212;1.9 dB insertion loss, which is better than the best grating couplers reported with metal reflector embedded in the substrate. Simulations show a maximum diffraction efficiency of 76%, and a corresponding very low back-reflection is 0.4%.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Observation of the issues of low diffraction efficiency and strong back-reflection indicate that there is large mode mismatch between the waveguide region and the grating region that causes undesired scattering. Thus, with use of the tapered edge as described herein to reduce the input waveguide height to approximately 200 nm, the mode mismatch is largely eliminated between the two regions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> illustrate an embodiment of fabricated periodic grating coupler and inverted taper designs, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an example of a fabricated periodic grating. Grating <b>402</b> includes fins <b>410</b>. Unlike putting a silicon overlay layer and then defining the grating region, grating <b>402</b> with fins <b>410</b> only requires several lithographic steps to fabricate, and is compatible with commonly used fabrication processes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an example of a fabricated inverted taper structure on a rib waveguide. Circuit <b>404</b> is illustrated with taper <b>420</b> connecting a rib waveguide to slab waveguide <b>430</b>. Taper <b>420</b> adiabatically transfers the vertical mode size between the size of the rib waveguide and the size of the grating region waveguide (e.g., 400 nm and 200 nm, respectively). In one embodiment, the structures can be designed with only two lithographic masks. Thus, in one embodiment the rib waveguide, inverted-taper, and periodic grating are created in one step of 200 nm etch, and the slab waveguide is defined with an additional step of 200 nm etch to reach buried oxide in an SOI system.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The fabricated structures were measured for grating coupler performance by using single-mode fiber (SMF). Total coupling loss (calculated as diffraction efficiency times the SMF coupling efficiency) was 3 dB, and the 3 dB bandwidth was 60 nm, which was very comparable to predictions from simulations. The spectral fringe contrast was 0.04 dB and corresponded to 27 dB of back-reflection.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a grating coupler with a sloped cladding. Circuit <b>500</b> is part of an optical integrated circuit, and includes semiconductor bulk <b>510</b> on which grating coupler <b>520</b>, taper <b>532</b>, and slab waveguide <b>534</b> are integrated. The use of the grating coupler with an inverted taper are discussed above and a detailed discussion of those elements is not repeated here.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Circuit <b>500</b> also includes cladding <b>542</b> above the circuit to provide optical interchange for the optical I/C. In one embodiment, cladding <b>542</b> is sloped to provide a vertical emission of light from circuit <b>500</b>. Typically, the emission of light from circuit <b>500</b> would not be vertical if cladding <b>542</b> were planar as is typically done. Thus, cladding <b>542</b> is illustrated with facet <b>550</b>, which slopes vertically up and horizontally away from the direction of the optical mode in transmission in circuit <b>500</b>. Thus, light is emitted from taper <b>532</b> into grating coupler <b>520</b>. Facet <b>550</b> is at its lowest level above taper <b>532</b>, and slopes up to the end of the grating region furthest from taper <b>532</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, facet <b>550</b> is sloped vertically down instead of vertically up, as illustrated in circuit <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Whether facet <b>550</b> is sloped up or down depends on the designed emission directions of grating coupler <b>520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Cladding <b>544</b> illustrates other cladding that covers circuit <b>500</b>. Facet <b>550</b> is provided directly over grating coupler <b>520</b> to direct emitted light in a vertical direction (i.e., substantially perpendicular to semiconductor bulk <b>510</b>). It will be observed that the height requirement for a single facet <b>550</b> is more than 7 microns of cladding.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a grating coupler with successive facets of sloped cladding. Given the difficulty in achieving a uniform-quality cladding at 7 microns thickness, it may be desirable to use multiple facets as illustrated with circuit <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Circuit <b>600</b> includes semiconductor bulk <b>610</b>, on which grating coupler <b>620</b>, taper <b>632</b>, and slab waveguide <b>634</b> may be integrated. The cladding of circuit <b>600</b> is separated as shown into segments <b>642</b>, <b>644</b>, and <b>646</b> to expose multiple facets <b>650</b>. The facets in the cladding allow for vertical emission of light, but the height requirement is much lower, at approximately 3 microns. Facets <b>650</b> slope vertically up and horizontally away from taper <b>632</b> in the direction of light <b>660</b> for transmission of light from circuit <b>600</b>. Similar to what is described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, facets <b>650</b> may alternatively slope vertically down and horizontally away from taper <b>632</b>, as illustrated in circuit <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of a test system for a wafer with optical circuits having integrated tapered edge and grating coupler components.

It will be understood that PIC <b>712</b> is not drawn to scale for wafer <b>710</b>. PIC <b>712</b> includes grating coupler <b>714</b> that receives focused tight from an inverted taper for transmission of light out of the PIC.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Test system <b>720</b> represents test equipment that could be used to verify the functionality of PIC <b>712</b>. Test system <b>720</b> specifically can test PIC <b>712</b> in-wafer, rather than having to separate individual chips from wafer <b>710</b> prior to testing the circuit, which can save substantial processing/testing costs. Test system <b>720</b> includes an optical test circuit that tests PIC <b>712</b> via grating coupler <b>714</b> from wafer <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, PIC <b>712</b> may generate and transmit a test signal out of grating coupler <b>714</b>, which could be tested for direction and intensity, as well as signal integrity.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow diagram of an embodiment of a process for generating and testing an optical circuit having integrated tapered edge and grating coupler components. Flow diagrams as illustrated herein provide examples of sequences of various process actions. Although shown in a particular sequence or order, unless otherwise specified, the order of the actions can be modified. Thus, the illustrated implementations should be understood only as an example, and the process can be performed in a different order, and some actions may be performed in parallel. Additionally, one or more actions can be omitted in various embodiments of the invention; thus, not all actions are required in every implementation. Other process flows are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, a buried layer, or a double SOI layer (DSOI) is used for grating coupler efficiency. If such a layer is used, the semiconductor substrate may need to be prepared prior to processing the grating coupler onto the substrate. An additional layer may not be made in all cases. If an additional layer is used, the semiconductor substrate may be processed to generate a buried layer in a location of the grating coupler area, <b>802</b>. The buried layer may be a buried SOI layer. The buried layer may be a buried metal reflector layer.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, a buried oxide layer is removed from the semiconductor substrate, which can also improve performance of the grating coupler. Thus, in one embodiment, a buried insulator layer is removed via an undercut etch, typically via wet etch.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The processing of a photonics die as described herein includes fabricating an optical semiconductor substrate, <b>804</b>. Some wafers may be pre-prepared for optical die processing. The processing of the die continues on a prepared wafer by processing a rib or strip waveguide on the semiconductor substrate, <b>806</b>. In one embodiment, part of processing the rib waveguide onto the semiconductor substrate includes processing a tapered edge on the rib waveguide that &#x201c;points&#x201d; to the grating coupler area, <b>806</b>. In one embodiment, processing the tapered edge is accomplished via a separate processing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The processing of the photonics die continues by processing a finned grating coupler on the semiconductor substrate in the grating coupler area, <b>808</b>. The processing of the photonics die continues by processing the slab waveguide, <b>810</b>. The slab waveguide is formed by etching out its shape, which focuses the light from the rib waveguide into the grating region. As one example, consider the perspective view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that shows an active region in the substrate defined by a structure formed by removing substrate material from around the rib waveguide and between the rib waveguide toward the grating region. The generating of the photonics die may be finished by processing cladding onto the photonics die, <b>812</b>. In one embodiment, testing is performed by the organization that performs the processing of the photonics die on the wafer, the testing is done on-wafer, <b>814</b>. In one embodiment, the processing of the cladding onto the photonics die may include processing one or more sloped facets into the cladding over the grating region.</p>
