<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a process for the production of panels with integrated insulation in particular for the production of buildings.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention also covers the panel that is thus obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Means for producing walls of buildings are known.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One process consists in raising the walls with bricks or bond stones connected with mortar with the pouring of posts and other lintels to ensure the uptake of mechanical forces and then connecting insulation through the exterior but most often through the interior.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This interior insulation is based on synthetic materials such as polystyrene with a lining of plaster plates or glass-wool-based plates and a partition of plaster tiles or combinations of these solutions. Insulation by means of synthetic materials that are derived from petroleum derivatives or energy hogs in production is not ideal.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Natural materials such as hemp exist and exhibit numerous advantages, such as a high insulating capacity, renewable production, recycling or problem-free elimination, and a reasonable cost even with small-scale production runs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The drawback of these materials is their weak strength and their propensity to absorb moisture and therefore to be not suitable for use in the presence of water, in particular in insulation through the exterior.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, construction has changed greatly, and buildings are to be produced as quickly as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is therefore necessary to produce panels at the factory with high-production means with a very high reproducibility, great precision, and very good quality so as to enable assembly adjusted at the installation site.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">These panels are also to be able to be installed easily with low-power lifting means that are commonly available on site.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">During prefabrication, it is increasingly required to integrate the equipment such as the casings of the woodwork of openings, the sheathings of electrical cables and heating pipes, etc., and connection housings.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Such panels should also have adequate mechanical strength characteristics to allow an elevation to at least R+1.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Finally, the panels are to be connected to one another mechanically in a satisfactory manner, primarily without having a detrimental effect on the insulation therefore by eliminating the thermal bridges.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For this purpose, this invention proposes a process for the production of a panel for the production of a building, integrating natural fibers and ready to install.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention also covers the panel that is thus obtained by the process.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a panel <b>10</b> according to this invention, comprising at least one interior surface <b>12</b> and one exterior surface <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The interior surface <b>12</b> consists of a concrete <b>16</b> made of natural fibers, in this case hemp fibers. The natural fibers could have been selected in the same way from among flax, straw and/or wood chips or a combination of natural fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is possible to cite as an example the composition of hemp concrete having the following formulations:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The percentages are expressed in terms of mass.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The reed is the central and soft part of the hemp rod.
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0032">Fibrous reed: 11.0%</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0033">Standard reed: 5.5%</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0034">Lime binder: 34.0%</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0035">Sufficient quantity of water</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0036">This makes it possible to produce panels with a thickness of 18 cm that have a thermal conductivity of 0.08 W/m.K and a dry-state density of 350 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0037">This concrete is produced by mixing in a unit of known type that comprises a blade mixer so as to obtain a good distribution of fibers in the mass.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0038">The process consists in depositing this natural hemp-fiber-based concrete in a monolithic layer in a mold M.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">Advantageously, this mold comprises, pre-positioned, the casings of the woodwork of openings with their margins as well as the service sheathings provided for accommodating fluid intake tubes and electrical cables and communication cables that are thus subsequently embedded in this concrete layer of natural fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">The exterior surface <b>14</b> consists of a light hydrophobic concrete <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">Such a concrete has significant mechanical strength, and primarily this layer includes reinforcements <b>20</b>, as will be explained further.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">As a structural concrete, it is possible to mention the following composition whose percentages are expressed in terms of mass:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0043">Cement: 23.0%</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0044">Sand: 40.0%</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0045">0/5 Expanded clay: 12.0%</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0046">5/15 Expanded clay: 12.0%</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0047">Sufficient quantity of water</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0048">Significant compression resistance is obtained at 28 days since it is greater than 15 MPa. The density is 1,550 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>and allows the production of walls with a thickness of 18 cm and with a thermal conductivity of 0.70 W/m.k.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0049">There is a problem for the production of these panels at the interface between the two layers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0050">Actually, to ensure the engagement of the two surfaces, it is provided to insert mechanical connectors <b>22</b>, for example metal connectors, into the first concrete of natural fibers that are projecting so as to have these projecting ends embedded in the light concrete layer.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0051">To ensure a quality interface between the two layers and to make possible the superposition of the two layers before hardening, surprisingly enough the patent holders noted that an additional layer <b>24</b> of silica material, for example a slip of silica material, makes it possible to ensure a satisfactory interface without having a detrimental effect on the mechanical strength of the unit and without altering the insulating and mechanical properties from one or the other of the surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0052">After the concrete sets and drying has been done sufficiently, the panels can be manipulated in a known way by industrial manufacturing of concrete panels, generally by means of eye anchors previously embedded in the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0053">The process also provides a system <b>26</b> for connecting panels to one another according to the various arrangements that are necessary in a building, facade panels or angled panels. In this case, only an exit angle is shown, but the same would hold true for a return angle. The angles are 90&#xb0; angles, but in the same way they could be less than or greater than 90&#xb0; without thereby modifying the scope of this patent application.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0054">The connecting system <b>26</b> for the facade panels is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0055">Each facade panel <b>10</b>F comprises pins <b>28</b> that project over the vertical lateral edges.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0056">These pins <b>28</b> are arranged in staggered rows on the two edges of the same plate so as to allow an interlocking when the two panels <b>10</b>E-<b>1</b> and <b>10</b>F-<b>2</b> are brought together.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">When these two panels are juxtaposed and adjusted, it is possible to cotter these two panels by means of a vertical rod <b>30</b>, able to be introduced into the pins <b>28</b>-<b>1</b>D and <b>28</b>-<b>2</b>G of the two panels.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">Likewise, in an upper part, trailing chain reinforcements <b>32</b> are left in reserve and projecting.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">The exterior surface <b>14</b> is equipped with necessary margins R while the interior surface is juxtaposed, contiguous edge to edge. The interior surface forms the interior framework and is perfectly continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060">It is then advisable to install a flat framework to pour a light concrete into this margin R, preferably of the same nature as the one that composes the exterior surface that thus makes it possible to embed the reinforcements, to connect the panels as well as the trailing chain reinforcements. It is again noted that the thermal bridges are avoided since the interior surface <b>12</b> is continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">In the case of an angle, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the margin R is in the shape of a T for providing an embodiment, made on a surface of one <b>10</b>A-<b>1</b> of the panels <b>10</b>A-<b>1</b> and <b>10</b>A-<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0062">The chain reinforcements <b>32</b> are bent to ensure continuity and enough superposition of lengths to ensure satisfactory mechanical setting.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0063">The rod <b>30</b> is introduced in the same way as above in the pins <b>28</b> that are arranged in staggered rows. It is noted that in the preferred embodiment, one of the panels has pins that are arranged in a perpendicular manner to the general plane of the panel so as to put the pins in staggered rows in the plane of a panel and not at an angle.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">The interior surfaces <b>12</b>, made of natural-fiber concrete, ensure the continuity of the insulation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0065">In the same way as above, light concrete of the same nature as that that constitutes the exterior surface <b>14</b> is poured into a framework, in situ, once the panels are positioned in a suitable way to fill in the margin R and to embed the reinforcements.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0066">The volume of concrete to be added is clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> where the light concrete is transparent.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows one of the possibilities that the process according to this invention offers.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068">Above, it was indicated that the casings of door frames and cable networks or other connecting means could be integrated in the interior surface, made of insulating concrete that is based on natural fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">This interior surface can also make it possible to achieve aesthetic effects that are structured as waves or undulations, to only cite the latter.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0070">This depends on the mold M that is used and that can have any aesthetic shape.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0071">This does not at all modify the technical nature of the panel but this makes possible aesthetic configurations that it was not possible to obtain with plaster plate panels, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0072">The exterior surface is smoothed during the manufacturing to subsequently enable the application of any finish, any wall facing, or any coating.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0073">These panels being connected to one another, it is necessary to make them integral with the remainder of the structure. Depending on the embodiment of the slab, reinforcements in reserve, connecting rods that are attached and bonded so as to provide grounding, will be provided. These reinforcements are in reserve, prepositioned to the right of the posts to be made and also come into the pins <b>28</b> such as the rod <b>30</b>, simultaneously reinforcing the cottering.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0074">In a known way, the floor is made to float.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0075">In the upper part, the walls accommodate the framework in a known way, and the pinions are made with the framework and not with the walls as in traditional construction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0076">The process for production according to this invention is very effective from the insulation standpoint.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0077">If the wall that is mentioned in the example is finished after assembly by an exterior coating or a 1.5 cm cladding and on the interior a lime coating of 1.5 cm at the most, the following results are obtained:</p>
