<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to towers that house antennas for cellular, PCS, GPS or other wireless communications or signals.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are several types of towers used to hold land-based antennas for cellular/PCS communication. Where zoning requirements, restrictive covenants or other provisions or desires require aesthetically acceptable configurations, concealed (monopole) antenna towers are often used. These antennas are integrated within common pole-like objects such as, for example, flag poles, mono palms and other type tree poles, street-lights, stop-lights and other utility poles (e.g., any type of monopole structure). The concealed antenna towers are configured so that the antennas are not externally visually apparent. The concealed antenna towers have a tubular structure with an internal, longitudinally-extending cavity that holds cables/transmission lines. The concealed antenna towers can hold one or several vertically stacked antenna canisters within a shroud or exterior that surrounds and encloses the antenna canisters. The concealed antenna towers are thus known as &#x201c;poles&#x201d; and &#x201c;slick sticks.&#x201d; See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,222,503 and 5,963,178, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past, while some concealed antenna towers are designed to allow additional antenna canisters at the top of the tower after original placement, to add additional antenna canister space for additional antenna capacity beyond it's original design to an erect concealed tower at other sub-top locations, the tower was taken down and usually replaced.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the invention are directed to methods for modifying erect concealed antenna towers (e.g., poles) to add an antenna canister and/or allow for increased antenna capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some poles in the field have a single antenna cylinder and/or only provide for new antenna cylinders to be stacked on the top of existing structure. Embodiments of the present invention allow for antenna cylinders to be added to an erect pole at a position that is typically under an existing antenna cylinder in a region that is only a pole (e.g., a hollow pipe).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the invention are directed to methods of modifying an erect concealed antenna pole by installing an antenna canister in a portion of a concealed antenna pole at a location other than where a canister is currently located while the antenna pole is erect.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some particular embodiments, the installing step can be carried out at a location that is at least two feet below the top of the pole and at least two feet above the bottom of the pole. In some embodiments, the installing step can be carried out by attaching the antenna canister to the pole below an existing antenna canister having at least one antenna (held therein and/or thereon).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the antenna pole comprises a tubular body with a wall that encloses a hollow core, and the method further includes, before the installing step, forming at least one elongate window into the wall of the pole at a location that is intermediate a bottom and top of the pole.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The forming step can be carried out by removing a plurality of spaced apart elongate wall segments from the pole at a single zone while leaving intermediate wall segments at that zone intact.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, after the forming and installing steps, the method can further include removing the intact wall segments of the pole at the zone, thereby leaving the canister to be a load-bearing structure connecting adjacent longitudinally spaced apart sections of the pole.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The at least one window can have a vertical height that is substantially the same as or larger than a height of the antenna canister.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other embodiments are directed to concealed antenna towers that include a pole having at least a portion configured as a tubular body with a hollow core, the tubular body having a wall with an inner and outer surface. The tower also includes a first bracket assembly attached to the pole at a first location, the first bracket assembly having a first member with an inwardly extending horizontal arm and a second cooperating member, the first member attached to an inner surface of the wall and the second member attached to an outer surface of the wall and the first member. The tower also includes a second bracket assembly attached to the pole at a second spaced apart location above the first location, the second bracket assembly having a first member with an inwardly extending horizontal arm and a second cooperating member, the first member attached to an inner surface of the wall and the second member attached to an outer surface of the wall and the first member. The tower also includes a vertical member attached to the first and second bracket assemblies and being longitudinally aligned with the hollow core of the pole.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The tower can also include a plurality of bolts extending through apertures in the wall of the pole and the first and second members to hold the first and second bracket assemblies to the wall of the pole. The first and second bracket assemblies may optionally each comprise a plurality of spaced apart first members and a plurality of spaced apart second members. The first members extend about an inner perimeter of the wall of the pole at the first and second locations and the second members extend about an outer perimeter of the wall of the pole at the first and second locations. The first and second bracket assemblies may also include a plurality of third members that cooperate with the first and second members. The third members reside adjacent an inner surface of the first member such that the second and third members sandwich ends of adjacent first members.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first members can be configured to reside end-to-end adjacent each other about an inner perimeter of the wall and occupy substantially all of the inner perimeter of the wall at an upper location proximate an upper end of the vertical member.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still other embodiments are directed to kits for modifying and/or retrofitting an erect concealed antenna tower with an additional antenna canister. The kits include: (a) a first bracket assembly configured to attach to a concealed antenna pole at a first location, the first bracket assembly having a first member with an inwardly extending horizontal arm and a second cooperating member, the first member configured to attach to an inner surface of the wall and the second member configured to attach to an outer surface of the wall and the first member; (b) a second bracket assembly configured to attach to the concealed antenna pole at a second spaced apart location above the first location, the second bracket assembly having a first member with an inwardly extending horizontal arm and a second cooperating member, the first member configured to attach to an inner surface of the wall and the second member configured to attach to an outer surface of the wall of the pole and the first member; and (c) a vertical member having outwardly extending arms configured to attach to the first and second bracket assemblies so that, in position, the vertical member is longitudinally aligned with an axially extending centerline of the hollow core of the pole.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The kit can also include a template for forming bolt hole patterns on a wall of a concealed antenna pole and a plurality of high strength bolts. The first and second bracket assemblies may optionally each include a plurality of spaced apart first members and a plurality of spaced apart second members and a plurality of third members that cooperate with the first and second members. In position, the third members can reside adjacent an inner surface of the first member and the second and third members sandwich opposing ends of adjacent first members.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Yet other embodiments are directed to multi-piece vertical rods for an antenna canister. The rods include a plurality of longitudinally extending members with edge portions thereof configured to reside closely spaced together to define a center space for holding coaxial cabling therein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The longitudinally members can be three semi-circular longitudinally extending members that attach together to form a cylindrical center space.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The longitudinally extending members may each comprise a plurality of tabs on opposing edge portions of each longitudinally extending member, the tabs extending radially outward from an outer surface thereof, the tabs of adjacent members being attached together to define the center space. The longitudinally extending members can have a length that is between about 5-15 feet.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The longitudinally extending members can be three circumferentially spaced apart semi-circular members configured so that opposing edge portions of a respective member abuts an outer edge portion of adjacent members.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, each of the members has a wall with an inner surface and outer surface, and each of the three members has at least one arm that extends radially outward from the outer surface of the wall from a medial portion of the respective member and first and second tabs that extend radially outward on opposing sides of the arm proximate the outer edge portions. Adjacent tabs of neighboring members are configured to attach together and the arms are configured to attach to a mounting bracket that attaches to a concealed antenna pole.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying figures, in which embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. In the figures, certain layers, components or features may be exaggerated for clarity, and broken lines illustrate optional features or operations unless specified otherwise. In addition, the sequence of operations (or steps) is not limited to the order presented in the figures and/or claims unless specifically indicated otherwise. In the drawings, the thickness of lines, layers, features, components and/or regions may be exaggerated for clarity and broken lines illustrate optional features or operations, unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;including&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;under&#x201d;, &#x201c;below&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;over&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if a device in the figures is inverted, elements described as &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;over&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;under&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of over and under. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly. Similarly, the terms &#x201c;upwardly&#x201d;, &#x201c;downwardly&#x201d;, &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; and the like are used herein for the purpose of explanation only unless specifically indicated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the specification and relevant art and should not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein. Well-known functions or constructions may not be described in detail for brevity and/or clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It will be understood that although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; are used herein to describe various regions, layers and/or sections, these regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second region, layer or section, and similarly, a second without departing from the teachings of the present invention. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The concealed antenna tower will be described as a pole herein. The term &#x201c;pole&#x201d; refers to a tubular structure that has at least a portion with a hollow core. The hollow core allows cabling to extend inside the pole from the antenna(s) to electronic circuitry that resides in a base of the pole and/or in a control station that is typically in a housing structure adjacent the pole. The pole may have a substantially circular, square or other geometric cross-sectional shape. For example, the outer wall of the housing or tower may be circular or may be a multi-faceted polygon, e.g., hexagonal, octagonal and the like. The pole can have a substantially constant diameter or width over its length or it may increase in size such that the bottom portion is larger than a top and/or intermediate portion.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The pole can comprise galvanized steel for structural rigidity and support, particularly at the base portion of the pole. The pole can have at least a portion that is a steel pipe that is between about &#xbc; inch to about &#xbe; inch thick, typically about &#xbd; inch. However, other suitable strength materials and thicknesses that can withstand environmental (weather and wind) conditions may be used, including, for example, composites, rigid polymers, wood, ceramics and concrete or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The diameter or width of the pole can vary along its length as well as for different uses or types of poles. The pole can have a height that is between about 6 feet to about 220 feet, more typically between about 20-160 feet. The pole can include one or more hand holes along its length and may include one or more above ground exit ports for transmission lines proximate a lower portion of the pole and/or a below ground path for transmission lines. As is well known, the pole can be mounted to a base plate that is supported by a concrete pad and supported by the ground. Some poles have a top flange that will accommodate upward vertical growth. Some poles have multiple entry ports, particularly, if the &#x201c;rad&#x201d; centers (defined below) of co-location tenants (different cellular service providers on the same pole) are known.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The pole can have one or a plurality of stacked sections of antennas corresponding to or one or a plurality of &#x201c;rads&#x201d;, respectively. The term &#x201c;rad&#x201d; refers to a centerline of an antenna with respect to ground. Some poles have multiple rads, each at different heights from the ground. Each antenna canister has an exterior wall or cover that is (also known as a &#x201c;shroud&#x201d;) that encases the antenna. The shroud can comprise fiberglass, polymers or other suitable material that can blend into the shape and size of the remaining pole, e.g., the steel tubular base. The shroud can be formed, painted or deposited with a coating that matches the color/material of the base (steel) section of the pole. The pole can have a flag attachment at a top portion thereof wherein it acts as a flag pole.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The terms &#x201c;antenna canister&#x201d; and &#x201c;antenna spool&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to structures that mount concealed antennas to poles for cellular, PCS, GPS or other wireless (radio) communications. The concealed antennas are typically monopole antennas as is known to those of skill in the art, but it is contemplated that embodiments of the invention may be used for other antenna types. Conventional antenna canisters can have opposing upper and lower flanges and/or members and a vertically extending (center) rod or spool extending therebetween as is known to those of skill in the art. The antennas themselves are typically mounted in the field inside the canisters in the erect towers (after the tower is in position) by a service provider. However, antennas may also be pre-loaded and mounted to (typically inside) the antenna canister prior to erection of the tower as well. The antenna canister can have various lengths and diameters or widths, such as, for example, between about 2-15 feet, typically between about 3-10 feet in length and about 3-50 inches wide (with radome/shroud), typically between about 5-27 inches (OD) wide. Examples of suppliers of commercially available antenna canisters include PN 219745 and PN 131531 from Valmont Structures, Salem, Oreg., PN 133742 and PN 135602 from PiRod Inc., Plymouth, Ind., Project No. 33201-187 (38 foot flag pole with single upper concealment cylinder on 28&#x2032; long pipe) from Chameleon Engineering, Santa Maria. Calif., Job No. 33201-187 (25&#x2033; antenna concealment cylinder) from Innovative Site Solutions, Santa Maria, Calif., and Cell-30-100-30 from Stealth Concealment Solutions, Charleston, S.C. Exemplary discussions of radomes, shoruds and/or concealed antenna poles can also be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,503, (see, inter alia, FIGS. 8A/8B, col. 15) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,963,178 (see, inter alia, FIG. 4, col. 4, 6), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate exemplary concealed antenna poles <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows that a &#x201c;new&#x201d; antenna canister <b>20</b> can be installed on an erect pole <b>10</b> at a location that is a distance below the top of the pole <b>10</b>, typically below either an existing antenna canister <b>15</b><sub>1 </sub>and above the base of the pole <b>10</b><i>b</i>, or a distance that is about 1 foot or more, typically, about 2 feet or more below the top of the pole and about 2 feet or more above the bottom of the pole. The base <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the pole <b>10</b> can include a cable exit port <b>40</b> as shown, and is typically a hollow core tube (e.g., a tubular pipe-like steel base). The size of the base <b>10</b><i>b </i>can be greater than a major portion of the remaining portion of the pole <b>10</b>. The pole <b>10</b> can also include a hand hole <b>30</b> surrounded by a rim or perimeter (the hole can also be referred to as an exit port). Optionally, a hand hole <b>30</b> or tool entry port can exist or be formed or introduced in the pole <b>10</b> in a location that is proximate the new canister region of the pole. J-hooks or other tools can be attached to the pole <b>10</b> or inserted through the hand hole/port <b>30</b> to grasp cables (e.g. coax transmission lines) extending in the target region of the pole <b>10</b> so as to be able to move them and/or hold them away from a wall removal segment or zone.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates that the &#x201c;new&#x201d; antenna canister <b>20</b> can be introduced under a plurality of (rad) zones <b>15</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>15</b><sub>5</sub>, each having a length/height that is between about 10-15 feet. As shown, the new antenna canister <b>20</b> can be placed at rad 6. However, in other embodiments, one or more antenna canisters <b>20</b> can be added to other target zones. The word &#x201c;zone&#x201d; refers to a section of the pole <b>10</b> associated with a respective antenna and/or antenna canister <b>20</b>.</p>
