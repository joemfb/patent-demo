<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to a lamp with a radiator and a method for manufacturing the lamp, and more particularly to a light emitting diode (LED) lamp with a radiator and a method for manufacturing the LED lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An LED lamp utilizing LEDs as a source of illumination is widely used in many fields because the LEDs have features of long-term reliability, environment friendliness and low power consumption. It is well-known that a conventional lamp utilizes fluorescent lights as a source of illumination. With the development of the LED lamp, the LED lamp is intended to be a cost-effective yet high quality replacement for the conventional fluorescent lamp.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, the LED lamp comprises a bracket integrally formed in a manner of metal die casting or metal extrusion by a die/mould, and a plurality of LED modules received in the bracket. The LED lamp can achieve a constant illumination intensity because a dimension of the bracket is constant. For achieving different illumination intensities according to different requirements, the dimension of the bracket has to be changed. However, a change of the die/mould for forming the bracket raises a considerable design cost burden. Furthermore, obtaining different dies/moulds with different sizes requires additional manufacture and material cost.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed, therefore, is an LED lamp whose light intensity can be easily adjusted by increasing or decreasing the number of LEDs thereof for meeting different illumination demands.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an LED lamp <b>100</b> in accordance with an exemplary embodiment is provided as a projection lamp. The LED lamp <b>100</b> includes a radiator <b>10</b>, two caps <b>20</b> attached to two opposite ends of the radiator <b>10</b> respectively, a light emitting module <b>30</b> disposed at a bottom face of the radiator <b>10</b>, and a power device <b>41</b> and two stents <b>42</b> disposed at a top face of the radiator <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the radiator <b>10</b> is integrally preformed of a metal with good heat conductivity such as aluminum, copper or an alloy thereof. In this embodiment, an elongated extruded semi-finished product is cut into pieces with different lengths, and the radiator <b>10</b> is selected from one of the pieces. The radiator <b>10</b> includes a rectangular base <b>11</b> and a plurality of fins <b>12</b> disposed on a top face of the base <b>11</b>. The fins <b>12</b> are parallel to and spaced from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For facilitating description, a longitudinal extending direction of the base <b>11</b> is defined as a longitudinal direction, and a direction parallel to the base <b>11</b> and vertical to the longitudinal direction is defined as a transverse direction. The base <b>11</b> includes a main plate <b>111</b> and two flanges <b>112</b> extending aslant downward from two opposite sides of the main plate <b>111</b> along the transverse direction, respectively. The two flanges <b>112</b> extend away from each other along the transverse direction. The flanges <b>112</b> also extend along the longitudinal direction and have a length identical to that of the main plate <b>111</b>. The flanges <b>112</b> are integrally formed with the main plate <b>111</b> to form a recess <b>113</b>. A plurality of through holes <b>114</b> is disposed uniformly on bottom sides of the flanges <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Each of the fins <b>12</b> extends along the longitudinal direction. The fins <b>12</b> located at a middle of the radiator <b>10</b> are lower than other fins <b>12</b> to form a receiving portion <b>121</b>. The fins <b>12</b> include a first group <b>122</b>, a second group <b>123</b> located at two lateral sides of the first group <b>122</b> symmetrically, and a third group <b>124</b> located at two lateral sides of the main plate <b>111</b> symmetrically and covering the flanges <b>112</b>. The receiving portion <b>121</b> is defined on the first group <b>122</b> and between two parts of the second group <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, two fins <b>12</b> of the first group <b>122</b> have &#x201c;T&#x201d; shaped top ends and define a plurality of positioning holes <b>125</b> on the top ends. The two fins <b>12</b> of the first group <b>122</b> are spaced by other fins <b>12</b> of the first group <b>122</b>.

The branches extend face to face on each pair of the fins <b>12</b> of the second group <b>123</b>. A sliding channel <b>127</b> is defined in each pair of the fins <b>12</b> of the second group <b>123</b>. The number of the third group <b>124</b> is two, and each extends upward and then outward and downward and connects a free end of a corresponding flange <b>112</b> to form a tube with the corresponding flange <b>112</b> for preventing an operator from being injured when assembling the LED lamp. Two inserting holes <b>126</b> are defined in bottom ends of the two fins of the first group <b>122</b>, respectively. Two additional inserting holes <b>126</b> are defined below the sliding channels <b>127</b>. Another two inserting holes <b>126</b> are defined in ends of the fins <b>12</b> of the third group <b>124</b> and located at top sides of the flanges <b>112</b>. The inserting holes <b>126</b> extend through the corresponding fin <b>12</b> along the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The two caps <b>20</b> are aligned with two opposite ends of the radiator <b>10</b> along the longitudinal direction, respectively. The caps <b>20</b> are respectively engaged with two opposite ends of the radiator <b>10</b>. Each cap <b>20</b> includes a positioning plate <b>21</b> and a seal housing <b>22</b> extending upward from one end of the positioning plate <b>21</b> nearby the radiator <b>10</b>. The positioning plate <b>21</b> extends from the free end of the flange <b>112</b> and is parallel to the main plate <b>111</b>. A plurality of through holes <b>211</b> are disposed uniformly on a bottom side of the positioning plate <b>21</b>. A periphery of the seal housing <b>22</b> matches with the flanges <b>112</b> and the main plate <b>111</b> to enclose the recess <b>113</b> of the radiator <b>10</b>. Six lugs <b>221</b> are formed on a top side of the seal housing <b>22</b> corresponding to the inserting holes <b>126</b>. The lugs <b>221</b> are annular for screws inserting and extending through the inserting holes <b>126</b>, whereby the caps <b>20</b> are secured on the radiator <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the light emitting module <b>30</b> includes a plurality of circuit boards <b>31</b>, a plurality of LEDs <b>32</b>, a plurality of lenses <b>33</b> each embracing an LED <b>32</b>, a fixed board <b>34</b> and a diffuser <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Specifically, each circuit board <b>31</b> is attached to a bottom face of the main plate <b>111</b> and received in the recess <b>113</b>.
