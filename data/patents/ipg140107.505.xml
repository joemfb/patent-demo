<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A transfer assist apparatus includes an anxiety measurement unit that detects a physical change linked to a sense of anxiety in the care-receiver and measures a degree of anxiety in the care-receiver, and a control unit that control the drive unit correspondingly to a trajectory inputted by the operation unit and performs feedback control so as to reduce the degree of anxiety measured by the anxiety measurement unit. The anxiety measurement unit detects at least one of a heart rate, an amount of perspiration, a breathing rate, an eyeball movement, an electric resistance of skin, and a skin temperature as the physical change linked to a sense of anxiety in the care-receiver. The control unit sets a speed limit of the drive unit correspondingly to the degree of anxiety measured by the anxiety measurement unit and restricts the drive speed of the drive unit not to exceed the speed limit.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a transfer assist apparatus, for example, a transfer assist apparatus that assists in a transfer operation for a person who cannot walk by oneself to transfer from a bed to a wheelchair or from the wheelchair to the toilet seat.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For a care-receiver who cannot walk by oneself, it is not easy to perform by oneself the transfer movement of moving from a bed to a wheelchair. Usually, a nursing assistant has to help, but the aid in transfer movement places a large physical load on the nursing assistant and a large mental load on the care-receiver. Apparatuses that assist the transfer movement of a care-receiver who cannot walk by oneself have recently been developed. For example, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2006-305092 (JP-A-2006-305092) discloses a transfer assist apparatus in which a tiltable strut is provided in a raised condition on a rotatable platform and a receiving plate (holding device) is provided at the distal end of the strut. When the care-receiver has a transfer movement by using such a transfer assist apparatus, the strut is tilted and the receiving plate is brought close to the care-receiver's body. Then, the care-receiver sets hands on the holding device, clutches the holding device, moves the body onto the receiving plate, and places the body weight thereon. Where the strut is then lifted, the care-receiver's body is also lifted. After the transfer destination is reached, the strut is tilted to complete the transfer movement.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is obviously an important problem to ensure safety of the care-receiver during the transfer assist. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 8-191865 (JP-A-8-191865) and Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 7-016269 (JP-A-7-016269) disclose safety mechanisms in electric nursing lifts. Thus, JP-A-8-191865 discloses an electric nursing lift that hoists the care-receiver from a bed or lowers the care-receiver onto the bed, the lift having a structure such that the hoisting arm can be stretched and contracted. Therefore, even when the electric nursing lift is erroneously controlled and the care-receiver is inserted between the hoisting means and the floor, the hoisting arm is contracted to absorb the force acting upon the care-receiver. As a result, the care-receiver's safety is reliably guaranteed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">JP-A-7-016269 discloses providing a bed with an aid arm that prevents tumbling and using a structure such that restricts the movement of the hoisting arm so as to allow the hoisting arm to rotate only when the aid arm protrudes to the outside of the bed. As a result, the bed is prevented from accidents such as overturning, and care-receiver's safety is protected.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A care-receiver that requires a transfer assist has disabled zones on the body, for example, a paralyzed half of the body or paralyzed legs and cognitive impairment. Therefore, significant sense of anxiety and fear are obviously associated with a transfer movement. Furthermore, during the transfer movement, the care-receiver with a disabled body has to entrust the entire own body to a nursing assistant or a nursing robot. The nursing assistant performs the aid and transfer assist, while listening to the care-receiver's wishes, and the care-receiver's sense of anxiety and fear can be mitigated based on the trust relationship between the nursing assistant and the care-receiver. However, when the transfer assist apparatus is used, the care-receiver can hardly trust the apparatus to the same extent as the nursing assistant and the sense of anxiety and fear grow additionally. One more problem associated with the transfer assist apparatus is the presence of various factors causing sense of anxiety and fear in the care-receiver, such as operation noise caused by a motor and gears, unpredictable abrupt acceleration, transfer trajectory undesirable for the care-receiver, and operation failures. Therefore, a transfer assist apparatus that can ensure not only the care-receiver's safety, but also guarantee a sense of relief is highly desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The intention provides a transfer assist apparatus that performs transfer assist, while reducing a sense of anxiety in the care-receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A transfer assist apparatus according to a first aspect of the invention assists a care-receiver transfer. The apparatus includes: a movable carriage unit; an arm unit that includes a base end attached to the carriage unit and that rotates in a horizontal plane and tilted; a body holding device that is attached to the arm unit; a drive unit that drives the carriage unit and the arm unit; an operation unit into which a trajectory of the body holding device is inputted by a manual operation; and an anxiety measurement unit that detects a physical change linked to a sense of anxiety in the care-receiver and measures a degree of anxiety in the care-receiver; and a control unit that controls the drive unit correspondingly to the trajectory inputted by the operation unit and performs feedback control so as to reduce the degree of anxiety measured by the anxiety measurement unit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the above-described configuration, the anxiety measurement unit may detect at least one of a heart rate, an amount of perspiration, a breathing rate, an eyeball movement, an electric resistance of skin, and a skin temperature as the physical change linked to the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The control unit may also set a speed limit that is an upper limit of a drive speed of the drive unit correspondingly to the degree of anxiety in the care-receiver that is measured by the anxiety measurement unit, and restrict the drive speed of the drive unit not to exceed the speed limit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the control unit may set a gain that determines a response speed of the drive unit correspondingly to the degree of anxiety in the care-receiver that is measured by the anxiety measurement unit, and send a drive command to the drive unit by using the gain that is set.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the above-described configuration, the control unit may include a user database that stores, for each user, the degree of anxiety and a setting value to reduce the degree of anxiety.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The control unit may also include a data accumulation unit that accumulates, for each user, data when the transfer assist apparatus is used.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, the control unit may set a feedback gain that minimizes an evaluation function that is based on a degree of anxiety in the care-receiver and a position and speed of the holding device, and use the set feedback gain in a position, speed, or acceleration feedback loop.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The transfer assist apparatus may further include an external output unit that outputs an anxiety representation signal that increases as the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver increases. The control unit generates the anxiety representation signal and outputs the signal to the external output unit to represent the sense of anxiety to an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The external output unit may include a speaker or a vibrator attached to the operation unit and transmits the anxiety representation signal to an operator by sound or vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A transfer assist apparatus according to a second aspect of the invention assists a care-receiver transfer. The apparatus includes: a movable carriage unit; an arm unit that is attached to the carriage unit and that rotates in a horizontal plane and tilted; a body holding device that is attached to the arm unit; a drive unit that drives the carriage unit and the arm unit; an operation unit into which a trajectory of the body holding device is inputted by a manual operation; and a control unit that controls the drive unit correspondingly to the trajectory inputted by the operation unit, and performs a feedback control to reduce a degree of anxiety in the care-receiver by storing in advance a relief trajectory range, which is a trajectory range of the body holding device in which the care-receiver has a feeling of relief, sampling with a predetermined sampling pitch a trajectory of the body holding device that is inputted by an operator via the operation unit, comparing sampled coordinate data on the trajectory with the relief trajectory range, and when the sampled coordinate data is outside the relief trajectory range or when a point predicted based on sampled coordinate data within the relief trajectory range is predicted to be outside the relief trajectory range, correcting the trajectory of the body holding device to enter the relief trajectory range.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the above-described configuration, the control unit may correct, when the sampled coordinate data is outside the relief trajectory range or when the predicted point is predicted to be outside the relief trajectory range, a position of a point sampled immediately before the sampled coordinate data is sampled or the predicted point is predicted, or at least one point sampled before the sampled coordinate data is sampled or the predicted point is predicted, and generate a trajectory that is corrected such that a point predicted based on the corrected sampled position is within the relief trajectory range.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A transfer assist apparatus according to a third aspect of the invention assists a care-receiver transfer operation. The apparatus includes: a movable carriage unit; an arm unit that includes a base end attached to the carriage unit and that rotates in a horizontal plane and tilted; a body holding device that is attached to the arm unit; a drive unit that drives the carriage unit and the arm unit; an operation unit into which a trajectory of the body holding device is inputted by a manual operation; and a control unit that controls the drive unit correspondingly to the trajectory inputted by the operation unit, and performs a feedback control to reduce a degree of anxiety in the care-receiver by storing in advance a relief trajectory range, which is a trajectory range of the body holding device in which the care-receiver has a feeling of relief, sampling with a predetermined sampling pitch a trajectory of the body holding device that an operator inputs by the operation unit, comparing sampled coordinate data on the trajectory with the relief trajectory range, and when the sampled coordinate data is outside the relief trajectory range or when a point predicted based on sampled coordinate data within the relief trajectory range is predicted to be outside the relief trajectory range, instructing the operation unit to generate a reaction force in a direction that causes resistance to an input operation that inputs the trajectory that deviates from the relief trajectory range.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the above-described configuration, the control unit may sample a trajectory of the body holding device by calculating from time to time a position of the body holding device on the basis of a drive amount of the dive unit.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a detailed functional block diagram of a control system realized by the control unit <b>17</b>.

The operation of each functional unit will be explained below together with the operation of the entire transfer assist apparatus <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the transfer assist of the care-receiver is conducted, the nursing assistant performs an operation of moving the holding device <b>3</b> by using the operation unit <b>25</b>. More specifically, the holding device <b>3</b> is moved close to the care-receiver's body. An operation signal from the operation unit <b>25</b> is provided to the trajectory generation unit <b>171</b>. As a result, the trajectory generation unit <b>171</b> generates a trajectory of the holding device <b>3</b> corresponding to the operation signal. The generated trajectory is provided to the target joint angle calculation unit <b>172</b>. The target joint angle calculation unit <b>172</b> finds the angles for the joint sections <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> to realize the generated trajectory by calculating the angles for each joint section <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The calculated target joint angles are outputted to the synthesis means <b>173</b>. Detection values from the rotation sensors <b>71</b> to <b>75</b> are also feedback sent to the synthesis means <b>173</b>. The synthesis means <b>173</b> finds the difference between the target joint angle and the present motor revolution angle for each motor <b>61</b> to <b>65</b> and <b>16</b> and provides the found differences to the motor speed command calculation unit <b>174</b>. The motor speed command calculation unit <b>174</b> multiplies the rotation angle difference by a predetermined gain and calculates a speed command that will be sent to each motor. The calculated motor speed command is provided to the motors <b>61</b> to <b>65</b> and <b>16</b> via the drive circuit <b>18</b>. As a result, the arm unit <b>2</b> is driven by the motor drive, and the holding device <b>3</b> moves in front of the care-receiver's body along the trajectory and at the speed intended by the nursing assistant.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The care-receiver then grasps the holding device <b>3</b> that is in front of the care-receiver's body and moves to the holding device <b>3</b>. After the care-receiver has moved to the holding device <b>3</b>, the nursing assistant wounds the heartbeat sensor <b>40</b> serving as an anxiety detection sensor around the chest portion of the care-receiver to set the sensor. The heartbeat of the care-receiver is detected by the heartbeat sensor <b>40</b>, and the sensor signal is outputted to the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b>. The degree of anxiety (heart rate) measured by the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> is provided to the anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> of the embodiment that conducts the feedback control to reduce the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver will be explained below. The anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> is provided with a heart rate threshold storage unit (anxiety threshold storage unit) <b>101</b> that stores heart rate thresholds (anxiety thresholds) of several stages and a speed limit setting unit <b>102</b> that sets a speed limit of the motors corresponding to the heart rate threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a relationship between the heart rate threshold and the speed limit. A low anxiety threshold, a medium anxiety threshold, and a high anxiety threshold are set in the order from the lower heart rate as the heart rate thresholds. The speed limit of the motor revolution speed is set at several stages correspondingly to each threshold. Here, a first speed limit, a second speed limit, and a third speed limit are set correspondingly to the anxiety thresholds, and the settings are such that the higher is the heart rate (sense of anxiety), the lower is the speed limit.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The speed limit setting unit <b>102</b> sets an upper limit of a motor speed correspondingly to the care-receiver's heart rate provided from time to time from the anxiety degree measurement unit <b>50</b> and the thresholds stored in the heart rate threshold storage unit <b>101</b>. For example, when the heart rate is between the low anxiety threshold and medium anxiety threshold, the first speed limit is the upper limit for the motor revolution speed.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The transfer assist device <b>10</b> has a plurality of motors <b>61</b> to <b>65</b> and <b>16</b>, and thus settings of the speed limit may be conducted for each motor.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The speed limit unit <b>175</b> is provided between the motor speed command calculation unit <b>174</b> and the drive circuit <b>18</b>, and the speed limit that has been set by the anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> is provided to the speed limit unit <b>175</b>. The speed limit unit <b>175</b> sends a speed command to the drive circuit <b>18</b>, such that the motor speed command does not exceed the speed limit, according to the set speed limit.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In a state in which such a control system functions, the nursing assistant raises the holding device <b>3</b> and lifts the care-receiver's body. In this case, the speed limit of the motor is set correspondingly to the care-receiver's heart rate, and the movement speed of the holding device <b>3</b> is automatically restricted. Where the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver intensifies, the movement speed of the holding device <b>3</b> is automatically decreased. As a result, even with a care-receiver who feels anxiety at a high movement speed, the movement speed is automatically restricted before the sense of anxiety becomes too strong. Therefore, the sense of anxiety is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">After the nursing assistant has moved the holding device <b>3</b> together with the care-receiver to a transfer destination, the nursing assistance lowers the holding device <b>3</b> and gets the care-receiver off. The transfer assist operation is thereby completed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">With such a first embodiment, where the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver is increased to a predetermined value, the speed is automatically restricted. Therefore, the transfer assist can be performed that prevents the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver from raising to a fixed level or thereabove to reduce the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">(Variation Example 1) In the above-described first embodiment, a configuration is described by way of example in which the heartbeat sensor <b>40</b> serving as an anxiety detection sensor is set in the chest area of the care-receiver, but it goes without saying that the blood flow or electrocardiogram can be measured from the outside. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the heartbeat sensor <b>40</b> may be set at a wrist or an ankle. Because the care-receiver can be assumed to have various diseases, the position for detecting the heartbeat can be appropriately selected for each care-receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">(Variation Example 2) The heartbeat sensor is not limited to a configuration that senses the blood flow or electrocardiogram of the care-receiver and can also detect a heart sound. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a microphone <b>41</b> that detects a heart sound of the care-receiver may be provided at a chest support section <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the holding device <b>3</b>. Further, the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> converts the signals from the microphone <b>41</b> into a heart rate and provides it to the anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">(Variation Example 3) A variation example 3 will be explained below. A specific feature of the variation example 3 is in that a perspiration sensor <b>42</b> is used as the anxiety detection sensor that detects a sense of anxiety in the care-receiver. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a side view illustrating a state in which the care-receiver is held in the holding device <b>3</b>. A table section <b>31</b><i>d </i>protrudes at the rear surface side of the torso support section <b>31</b> of the holding device <b>3</b> (on the side of the torso support section <b>31</b> opposite from the care-receiver). A perspiration sensor <b>42</b> is provided on the upper surface of the table section <b>31</b><i>d</i>. Examples of devices suitable as the perspiration sensor <b>42</b> include a ventilation capsule sudorometer, a skin potential meter, and a moisture sensor. The care-receiver seating in the holding device <b>3</b> places a hand on the table section <b>31</b><i>d</i>. As a result, the perspiration sensor <b>42</b> detects the amount of perspiration at the palm of the care-receiver's hand.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Because the perspiration sensor <b>42</b> is used as the anxiety detection sensor, the configuration of the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> of the first embodiment is changed to measure the amount of perspiration from the sensor signal. The threshold in the anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> has been set to a heart rate, but now a threshold based on the amount of perspiration is used.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In such a configuration, as the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver grows, the amount of perspiration increases. The increase in the amount of perspiration is detected by the perspiration sensor <b>42</b> and the speed is automatically restricted correspondingly to the amount of perspiration. As a result, the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It goes without saying that perspiration can be detected not only on the palm of the hand, but also in any location of the care-receiver's body.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">(Variation Example 4) A variation example 4 will be explained below. A specific feature of the variation example 4 is in that a piezoelectric sensor <b>43</b> that detects microvibrations of the care-receiver is used as the anxiety detection sensor that detects a sense of anxiety in the care-receiver. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a side view illustrating a state in which the care-receiver is held in the holding device <b>3</b>. The piezoelectric sensors <b>43</b> are provided on the upper surface of the lower limb support section <b>32</b> of the holding device <b>3</b> and on the side of the chest support section <b>31</b><i>a </i>that faces the care-receiver. Where the care-receiver sits in the holding device <b>3</b>, the care-receiver naturally comes into contact with the piezoelectric sensors <b>43</b>. The piezoelectric sensors <b>43</b> detect microvibrations of the human body caused by breathing.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Because the piezoelectric sensor <b>43</b> is used as the anxiety detection sensor, the configuration of the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> of the first embodiment is changed to measure a breathing rate from the sensor signal. The threshold in the anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> has been set to a heart rate, but now a threshold based on the breathing rate is used.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In such a configuration, as the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver grows, the breathing rate increases. The increase in the breathing rate is detected by the piezoelectric sensor <b>43</b> and the speed is automatically restricted correspondingly to the breathing rate. As a result, the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">(Variation Example 5) A variation example 5 will be explained below. A specific feature of the variation example 5 is in that a camera <b>44</b> that picks up the eyeball movement in the care-receiver is used as the anxiety detection sensor that detects a sense of anxiety in the care-receiver. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a side view illustrating a state in which the care-receiver is held in the holding device <b>3</b>. The camera <b>44</b> that picks up the image of the care-receiver's face is provided on the upper surface of the holding device <b>3</b>. Where the care-receiver sits in the holding device <b>3</b>, the camera <b>44</b> picks up the image of the care-receiver's face.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Because the image pickup camera <b>44</b> is used as the anxiety detection sensor, the configuration of the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> of the first embodiment is changed to measure the degree of anxiety from the eyeball movement pattern. People have been reported (for example, see Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-65609 (JP-A-2002-65609)) to demonstrate a specific eyeball movement reflecting the anxiety when they feel fear. Accordingly, the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> stores in advance an eyeball movement pattern specific to anxiety and the eyeball movement of the care-receiver that has been picked up by the camera <b>44</b> is compared with the pattern. The degree of anxiety is calculated correspondingly to a degree to which the eyeball movement of the care-receiver and the pattern match. Alternatively, the variation rate of the eyeball movement may be also calculated as the degree of anxiety. The threshold in the anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> is based on the eyeball movement.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In such a configuration, as the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver grows, the eyeballs of the care-receiver perform a specific movement. The eyeball movement is picked up by the pickup camera <b>44</b> and the speed is automatically restricted correspondingly to the sense of anxiety. As a result, the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">(Variation Example 6) A variation example 6 will be explained below. A specific feature of the variation example 6 is in that a current sensor <b>45</b> that detects an electric resistance of the care-receiver's skin is used as an anxiety detection sensor that detects a degree of anxiety in the care-receiver. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a side view illustrating a state in which the care-receiver is held in the holding device <b>3</b>. A table section <b>31</b><i>d </i>protrudes at the rear surface side of the torso support section <b>31</b> of the holding device <b>3</b> (on the side of the torso support section <b>31</b> opposite from the care-receiver). An electrode <b>45</b>A serving as the current sensor <b>45</b> is provided on the upper surface of the table section <b>31</b><i>d</i>. The care-receiver seating in the holding device <b>3</b> places a hand on the table section <b>31</b><i>d</i>. By passing a weak electric current to the care-receiver's hand via the electrode <b>45</b>A, the current sensor <b>45</b> detects the variation in electric resistance of the care-receiver's skin.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Because the current sensor <b>45</b> is used as the anxiety detection sensor, the configuration of the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> of the first embodiment is changed to measure an electric resistance of skin from the sensor signal. The threshold in the anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> is based on the electric resistance of skin. An electric resistance of human skin is dependent on a level of strain (this is disclosed, for example, in http://www.ryohdohraku.com/index.htlm). In a strained state, when the sympathetic nerves are active, a current easily flows though the human body. In other words, the electric resistance decreases. Accordingly, when the speed limit is set in the speed limit setting unit <b>102</b>, the speed limit is set correspondingly to the electric resistance of skin so that the upper limit speed of the motor decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In such a configuration, as the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver grows, the electric resistance of skin decreases. This decrease in the electric resistance is detected by the current sensor <b>45</b> and the speed is automatically restricted correspondingly to the electric resistance of skin. As a result, the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">(Variation Example 7) A variation example 7 will be explained below. A specific feature of the variation example 7 is in that a temperature sensor <b>46</b> that detects a skin temperature of the care-receiver is used as an anxiety detection sensor that detects a degree of anxiety in the care-receiver. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a side view illustrating a state in which the care-receiver is held in the holding device <b>3</b>. A table section <b>31</b><i>d </i>protrudes at the rear surface side of the torso support section <b>31</b> of the holding device <b>3</b> (on the side of the torso support section <b>31</b> opposite from the care-receiver). The temperature sensor <b>46</b> is provided on the upper surface of the table section <b>31</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">An electrode <b>46</b>A may be used as the temperature sensor <b>46</b>. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> or <b>14</b>, the electrode <b>46</b>A is brought into contact with the care-receiver's hand. A thermistor <b>46</b><i>b </i>may be also used as the temperature sensor <b>46</b>. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a temperature detection spot of the thermistor <b>46</b>B may be pasted on a finger.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Because the temperature sensor <b>46</b> is used as the anxiety detection sensor, the configuration of the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> of the first embodiment is changed to measure the skin temperature from the sensor signal. The threshold in the anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> is based on the skin temperature. The skin temperature of a human body depends on a level of strain, the skin temperature decreasing when a person is strained and increasing when the person is calm (relaxed). Accordingly, when the speed limit is set in the speed limit setting unit <b>102</b>, the speed limit is set correspondingly to the decrease in skin temperature so that the upper limit speed of the motor decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In such a configuration, as the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver grows, the skin temperature decreases. The decrease in skin temperature is detected by the temperature sensor <b>46</b> and the speed is automatically restricted correspondingly to the skin temperature.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The second embodiment of the invention will be described below. The basic configuration of the second embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment, but a specific feature of the second embodiment is that the motor speed is adjusted by adjusting a gain with the anxiety reduction control unit <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a functional block diagram of the second embodiment. In the second embodiment, the speed limit unit <b>175</b> is not provided. Instead, the anxiety reduction control unit <b>110</b> is provided with a heart rate threshold recording unit <b>111</b> and a gain setting unit <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Here, several stages are set for a heart rate threshold, and a gain that determines a response speed of the motor is set correspondingly to these thresholds at several stages. For example, the gain is set to decrease with the increase in a sense of anxiety (heart rate) correspondingly to the anxiety threshold (heart rate threshold).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The gain setting unit <b>112</b> compares the heart rate of the care-receiver that is provided from time to time from the anxiety degree measurement unit <b>50</b> with each threshold stored in the heart rate threshold recording unit <b>111</b> and determines an upper limit value of gain. The gain set in the gain setting unit <b>112</b> is provided to the motor speed command calculation unit <b>174</b>. The motor speed command calculation unit <b>174</b> uses the gain that has been set and calculates a speed command that will be provided to the motors <b>61</b> to <b>65</b> and <b>16</b>. The speed command that has thus been found is provided to each motor via the drive circuit <b>18</b>, and the holding device <b>3</b> moves along the trajectory indicated by the operation unit <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Similarly to the first embodiment, in the second embodiment, the response of motors is delayed as the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver grows. Therefore, the movement speed of the holding device <b>3</b> is automatically delayed.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The above-described variation examples 1 to 7 can be applied to the second embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The third embodiment of the invention will be described below. The basic configuration of the third embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment, but a specific feature of the third embodiment is that optimum control is executed for each user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a functional block diagram of the third embodiment. In a case where one transfer assist apparatus <b>10</b> is shared by a plurality of care-receivers, reasons causing anxiety and degrees thereof differ among the care-receivers. In such a case, one control pattern should not be applied to all the care-receivers. Accordingly, in the third embodiment, the anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> is provided with a user database <b>200</b>. Further, a data accumulation unit <b>300</b> is provided, and the sensor signals from the rotation sensors <b>71</b> to <b>75</b> and measurement values obtained with the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> are inputted in the data accumulation unit <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Anxiety thresholds (heart rate thresholds) and speed limit settings are recorded in association with a user ID in the user database <b>200</b>.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The data accumulation unit <b>300</b> accumulates data obtained when the transfer assist apparatus is used for each user.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">With such a configuration, when the transfer assist apparatus <b>10</b> is used, first, the user ID of the care-receiver is inputted.

The anxiety reduction control unit <b>100</b> executes the control of anxiety reduction on the basis of the heart rate threshold and speed limit setting that have been read out. At the same time, the data accumulation unit <b>300</b> collects and accumulates data relating to the sense of anxiety inherent to the care-receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">With such a configuration, optimum anxiety reduction control can be executed for each user. Furthermore, because data relating to anxiety are collected for each user, the movement transfer comfortable for each user can be indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">It goes without saying that the above-described variation examples 1 to 7 can be applied to the third embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The fourth embodiment of the invention will be described below. A specific feature of the fourth embodiment is in executing an automatic correction control producing a trajectory that creates a sense of relief in the care-receiver. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a functional block diagram of the fourth embodiment. In the fourth embodiment, an anxiety reduction control unit <b>120</b> is provided with a trajectory sampling unit <b>124</b>, a relief determination unit <b>125</b>, and a trajectory correction unit <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Further, data relating to a relief trajectory range are recorded in a user database <b>210</b> in association with the user ID. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a relationship between a height of the holding device <b>3</b> and a degree of anxiety is collected in the data accumulation unit <b>300</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, an anxiety trajectory range S<sub>A </sub>in which the care-receiver feels anxiety and a relief trajectory range S<sub>R </sub>in which the care-receiver feels relaxed can be separated and found by setting an appropriate threshold for a degree of anxiety. The relief trajectory range S<sub>R </sub>found in the above-described manner is recorded as the relief trajectory range in the user database.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The control operation performed by the anxiety reduction control unit <b>120</b> will be explained below together with the operation of the entire transfer assist apparatus <b>10</b>. In transfer assisting the care-receiver, the nursing assistance conducts an operation of moving the holding device <b>3</b> by using the operation unit <b>25</b>. An operation signal from the operation unit <b>25</b> is provided to the trajectory generation unit <b>171</b>. Accordingly, the trajectory generation unit <b>171</b> generates a trajectory of the holding device <b>3</b> that corresponds to the operation signal. The drive control of the motors <b>61</b> to <b>65</b> and <b>16</b> is executed according to the generated trajectory.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The trajectory sampling unit <b>124</b> conducts sampling with a predetermined sampling pitch of the trajectory generated in the trajectory generation unit <b>171</b>. The sampled coordinate data is provided to the relief determination unit <b>125</b>. The relief determination unit <b>125</b> compares the sampled coordinate data with the relief trajectory range. In a case where the sampled coordinate data is within the relief trajectory range, the processing relating to the sampled coordinate data within the relief trajectory range is completed and a transition is made to the processing of the next sampled point.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A plurality of routes connecting a start point and a target point can be considered as a trajectory indicated by the nursing assistant (operator). For example, a trajectory A, a trajectory B, and a trajectory C can be selected, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. In this case, the trajectory B is within the relief trajectory range S<sub>R</sub>, whereas the trajectory A and trajectory C are within the anxiety trajectory range S<sub>A </sub>and therefore undesirable. Accordingly, in a case where the inputted and instructed trajectory is within the anxiety trajectory range S<sub>A</sub>, the trajectory correction unit <b>126</b> corrects the trajectory automatically so as to fit the trajectory into the relief trajectory range.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">When the relief determination unit <b>125</b> determines that the coordinate data sampled in the trajectory sampling unit <b>124</b> is within the anxiety trajectory range S<sub>A</sub>, the relief determination unit sends a trajectory correction instruction to the trajectory correction unit <b>126</b>. Let us assume that the present location is P(n) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Then, for example, where the sampling point P(n+1) enters the anxiety trajectory range S<sub>A</sub>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the trajectory has to be corrected. The trajectory correction unit <b>126</b> refers to the sampling point P(n) that immediately precedes the sampling point P(n+1) and is within the relief trajectory range S<sub>R </sub>and the next preceding sampling point P(n&#x2212;1). When a point obtained by correcting the point P(n) is represented as a corrected point P(n)&#x2032; and a predicted point that is predicted on an extending lime connecting the point P(n&#x2212;1) and the corrected point P(n)&#x2032; is represented as P(n+1)&#x2032;, the position of the corrected point P(n)&#x2032; is established such that the predicted point P(n+1)&#x2032; enters the relief trajectory range. The corrected point P(n)&#x2032; thus found is provided to the trajectory generation unit <b>171</b>. The trajectory generation unit <b>171</b> corrects the trajectory by replacing the position of the point P(n) with the corrected point P(n)&#x2032; obtained by correction in the trajectory correction unit <b>126</b>. As a result, the trajectory of the holding device <b>3</b> in the transfer assist operation is fit in the relief trajectory range S<sub>R</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The motor drive control is continued based on the trajectory that has thus been corrected.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The trajectory of the holding device <b>3</b> in the transfer assist operation is determined by the operation command of the nursing assistant, but it does not mean that the nursing assistant knows fully and at all times the range in which the care-receiver feels anxiety. Furthermore, however attentive is the nursing assistance, operation errors are still possible. Accordingly, in the embodiment, a sense of anxiety in the care-receiver is reduced by automatically correcting the trajectory in a range in which the care-receiver can have a feeling of relief.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">(Variation Example 8) In the fourth embodiment a case is explained by way of example in which the trajectory of one preceding point enters the anxiety trajectory range S<sub>A</sub>, but because of the relationship between a sampling pitch of the CPU <b>17</b><i>a </i>and a motor speed, the correction of one sampling point can cause too abrupt changes. In such a case, the positions of a plurality of sampling points may be corrected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the positions of corrected points P(n)&#x2032; to P(n+3)&#x2032; are established such that the estimated point (for example, P(n+4)&#x2032;) that is several points in front of the point P(n) is within the relief trajectory range. The predicted point that takes into account a plurality of points in front may be calculated by linking vectors connected to an immediately preceding point and also, for example, by using an approximation curve such as a Bezier curve.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The fifth embodiment of the invention will be described below. A specific feature of the fifth embodiment is in that a reaction force is applied to the lever <b>25</b>A of the operation unit <b>25</b> when an inputted and instructed trajectory is within the anxiety trajectory range. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating the fifth embodiment. In the fifth embodiment, the anxiety reduction control unit <b>130</b> is provided with a trajectory sampling unit <b>134</b>, a relief determination unit <b>135</b>, and a reaction force command unit <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The trajectory sampling unit <b>134</b> samples the trajectory generated in the trajectory generation unit <b>171</b>. The relief determination unit <b>135</b> determines whether the sampling point is within the relief trajectory range S<sub>R</sub>. When the relief determination unit <b>135</b> determines that the coordinate data sampled in the trajectory sampling unit <b>134</b> has entered the anxiety trajectory range S<sub>A</sub>, the relief determination unit issues an instruction to generate a reaction force to the reaction force command unit <b>137</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The reaction force command unit <b>137</b> sends a command to generate a reaction force in a direction that causes a sensation of resistance to an input operation in which the trajectory is within the anxiety trajectory range S<sub>A </sub>and sends the command to the operation unit <b>25</b>. For example, in a case where a transition to the anxiety trajectory range S<sub>A </sub>is made in the sampling point P(n+1), similarly to the fourth embodiment, the operator feels a resistance to the operation of shifting the operation lever <b>25</b>A up. Thus, upon receiving the reaction force generation command from the reaction force command unit <b>137</b>, the operation unit <b>25</b> produces a reaction force directed from the top down, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">With such a configuration, the nursing assistant (operator) feels a resistance when a trajectory is to be inputted that makes the care-receiver anxious. As a result, a feedback designed to return the trajectory into the relief trajectory range S<sub>R </sub>is provided to the nursing assistance (operator). Therefore a sense of anxiety in the care-receiver is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">(Variation Example 9) In the above-described fourth embodiment, the variation example 8, and the fifth embodiment, a case is explained by way of example in which the trajectory sampling units <b>124</b> and <b>134</b> sample the trajectories generated in the trajectory generation unit <b>171</b>. By contrast, in variation example 9, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the output of rotation sensors <b>71</b> to <b>75</b> may be inputted to a trajectory sampling unit <b>144</b>. The trajectory sampling unit <b>144</b> calculates from time to time the present position of the holding device <b>3</b> on the basis of the output of rotation sensors <b>71</b> to <b>75</b>. Further, the next point is predicted based on the several past points. For example, the next point P(n+1) may be predicted by extending a vector connecting the point P(n&#x2212;1) and the point P(n), or a point in front may be predicted by applying a curve approximation such as a Bezier curve to a plurality of past points. The predicted points that have thus been found are provided to the relief determination unit <b>145</b>. Such a configuration also makes it possible to correct the trajectory automatically to a range in which the care-receiver can have a sense of relief. Therefore, the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver is reduced.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The sixth embodiment of the invention will be described below. A specific feature of the sixth embodiment is that a feedback gain is adjusted so as to minimize an evaluation function based on a sense of anxiety. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a functional block diagram of the sixth embodiment. In the sixth embodiment an anxiety reduction control unit <b>150</b> has a feedback gain setting unit <b>158</b>. A gain multiplication unit <b>400</b> is provided in a loop from the rotation sensors <b>71</b> to <b>75</b> to a synthesis means <b>173</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Sensor values for the rotation sensors <b>71</b> to <b>75</b> and measured values of a degree of anxiety that have been measured in the anxiety measurement unit <b>50</b> are inputted to the anxiety reduction control unit <b>150</b>.

For example, an optimum regulator can be used as a means for adjusting the gain. A model for setting a feedback gain as an optimum regulator will be explained below.</p>

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">A speaker or a vibrator can be used as the external output unit <b>500</b>. It is preferred that the anxiety representation signal that is linked to the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver be not transmitted to the care-receiver himself. Otherwise, the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver can be augmented. For example, a small speaker may be provided at the distal end of the operation lever <b>25</b>A so that the anxiety representation signal may be heard only by the operator (nursing assistant). Alternatively, a vibrator may be incorporated in the operation lever <b>25</b>A and vibrations may be transmitted to the hand of the operator (nursing assistant).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In such a configuration, the operator is notified about the sense of anxiety felt by the care-receiver. In a case where the anxiety representation signal gradually increases and then rapidly increases, measures can be taken to alleviate the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver. For example, the care-receiver can be spoken to, the movement can be slowed down, and the trajectory can be changed so as to avoid excess increase in height. As a result, the sense of anxiety in the care-receiver can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">It goes without saying that the above-described variation examples 1 to 7 can be similarly applied to the seventh embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The invention is not limited to above-described embodiments and can be variously changed without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, in the embodiments a case is explained in which a threshold is set for a degree of anxiety and the speed limit or gain is decreased in a stepwise manner. However, it goes without saying that the upper limit of the speed limit or gain may be changed continuously in response to the degree of anxiety. The system configuration of the above-described embodiments involves only the position feedback, but a speed or acceleration feedback may be also used.</p>
