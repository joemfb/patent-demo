<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to betulinic-acid containing extracts of the plant family Marcgraviaceae, compositions containing betulinic acid or betulinic acid derivatives, and methods for preventing or treating anxiety using same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is ever-increasing interest in herbal or natural-source remedies or medications. Many individuals would rather use such products than conventional pharmaceutical preparations. Additionally, medicinal substances derived from natural products can provide commercial or industrial opportunities for local populations in areas where medicinal plants grow or are cultivated. Moreover, compounds identified as the active ingredients in natural products form an important basis for pharmaceutical research.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Anxiety is a serious disorder that affects many people. Anxiety disorders can be classified into the following sub-categories: generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorders, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorders and anxiety disorders due to medical conditions, substance abuse and not otherwise specified anxiety (American Psychiatric Association. (1994). <i>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, </i>4<i>th Edn</i>. (<i>DSM</i>-<i>IV</i>). Washington, D.C.). Anxiety disorders are characterized by three basic components; subjective psychological reports, behavioural responses and physiological responses. A person usually reports subjective feelings of tension, apprehension, dread and expectations of an inability to cope (Alloy, L. B., Jacobson, N. S, &#x26; Acocella, J., (1999). <i>Abnormal Psychology: Current Perspectives </i>(pp. 150-172.). McGraw-Hill, Boston Mass.). These feelings can lead the person to behavioural responses as coping mechanisms, such as avoidance of the feared situation, impaired speech and motor functioning, and impaired performance on complex cognitive tasks. Physiological changes are often manifested as well; these include muscle tension, increased heart rate and blood pressure, dry mouth, nausea and dizziness (Weiss, S. R. B, &#x26; Uhde, T. W. (1990). Animal models of anxiety. In <i>Neurobiology of Panic Disorder </i>(pp. 3-27). Maryland: Alan R. Liss, Inc.). A natural product, or a pharmaceutical preparation derived from a natural product, would be of great interest in the alleviation of anxiety.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Marcgraviaceae is a plant family common in Costa Rica. Although the use of herbal or plant-based remedies is common throughout South America, to our knowledge, anxiolytic activity of plants of the family Marcgraviaceae, or of extracts or compounds obtained therefrom, has not been reported.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A variety of natural or herbal remedies containing betulinic acid have been described as being useful for treating depression or stress, disorders that differ from anxiety.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,182 to Pater and Tashiro describes a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form for treating various diseases including depression. The composition comprises a mixture of aqueous extracts of a number of plants, including extracts of dried seeds of <i>Zizyphus jujuba </i>containing betulinic acid. The compositions can be in the form of a health drink, in which the dried powder or concentrated aqueous solution is mixed with a syrup formula, and carbonated water is added.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The WPI abstract for Japanese Patent No. 57031620 indicates that the patent is directed to the preparation of a sweet to reduce stress when stopping smoking. The sweet is prepared by boiling seeds of gardenia in water, boiling persimmon leaves in water, and then mixing the two solutions with corn syrup. The abstract indicates that the solution of boiled persimmon leaves contains, among other things, betulinic acid, The abstract provides that a dose of about 10 grains per day of the sweet can alleviate stress associated with smoking cessation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The WPI abstract for Japanese Patent No. 69031593 appears to be directed to a method for preparation of &#x201c;betulin acid&#x201d; involving extracting the seeds of <i>Zizyphus vulgaris </i>var. <i>spinosus</i>. The abstract provides that betulin acid is a narcotic with no side effects, and is usually obtained from <i>Betula alba. </i></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Betulinic acid and various derivatives thereof are known to have pharmacological activity, and the patent literature describes the use of such compounds for the treatment of a range of conditions. However, these generally relate to disorders other than anxiety.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For instance, the use of betulinic acid and derivatives thereof for cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,048,847 to Jaggi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,046,231 to Kosmeder et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,869,535 and 5,658,947 to Dasgupta et al., among others.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Betulinic acid and various derivatives have also been identified as being useful as anti-viral agents. German patent application 19713768 to Draeger et al. discloses a preparation of betulinic acid for use as an anti-cancer and anti-HIV agent. U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,828 also discloses betulinic acid derivatives having anti-retroviral activity, particularly anti-HIV activity.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">U.S. Pat. No. 6,124,362 to Bailey et al. identifies betulinic acid as a preferred agent in a composition for regulating hair growth, when applied topically to the scalp.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">U.S. Pat. No. 5,529,769 to Cho et al. describes compositions containing betulinic acid said to be useful for the treatment of skin conditions such as wrinkling and photodamage.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Japanese Patent No. 2000-247993 appears to describe a class of triterpenoid compounds including oleanonic acid, oleanic acid, 3-epi-oleanolic acid, betulonic acid and 3-epi-betulinic acid, and indicates that some of these compounds are sigma receptor agonists. The patent appears to conclude that these compounds are therefore useful for the treatment of a broad range of disorders said to be related to the sigma receptor, such as schizophrenia, depression, worry, cerebrovascular disorder, senile activity, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, drug addiction, stress, anxiety, depression, etc. But no data is presented that the mentioned triterpenoid compounds have any of the recited utilities, let alone anxiolytic activity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It has now been discovered that preparations obtained from plants of the family Marcgraviaceae, particularly of the genus <i>Souroubea </i>or <i>Schwartzia </i>have potent anxiolytic activity. Betulinic acid has been determined to be the active ingredient in these preparations having anxiolytic activity.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Betulinic acid is a colorless crystalline solid forming plate-like or needle-like crystals. It has a molecular weight of 456.71, a melting point of 316-318&#xb0; C., and an empirical formula of C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>50</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Betulinic acid is soluble in water, ethanol, ether, acetone, benzene, and chloroform. Betulic acid is a synonym for betulinic acid. The structural formula of betulinic acid is:</p>

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Phytochemical principles are conserved in closely related species, and all members of the family Marcgraviaceae are useful in the context of the invention. Preferred members of the family Marcgraviaceae include plants of genera <i>Souroubea, Schwartzia, Marcgraviastrum, Norantea, Ruyschia</i>, and <i>Sarcopera</i>. Particularly preferred are plants of the genera <i>Souroubea </i>and <i>Schwartzia</i>. Especially preferred are plants of the genus <i>Souroubea</i>. A preferred <i>Souroubea </i>species is <i>Souroubea sympelata </i>Gigli (synonyms <i>Souroubea guianensis </i>Aubl.; <i>Ruyschia guianensis </i>(Aubl.) Sw.). <i>S. sympetala </i>is a Neotropical vine that is indigenous to Guatemala, Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and Peru. Another exemplary <i>Souroubea </i>species is <i>S. gilgii </i>V. A. Richt (synonym <i>Souroubea belizensis </i>Lundell), a Mesoamerican vine indigenous to Guatemala, Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. Other preferred <i>Souroubea </i>species include, without limitation, <i>S. loczyi </i>de Roon, <i>S. venosa </i>Shery, and <i>S. vallicola </i>Woodson.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thus, in one aspect, the invention provides a betulinic acid-containing preparation obtained from a plant of the family Marcgraviaceae. As used herein and in the claims, a &#x201c;preparation&#x201d; obtained from Marcgraviaceae means a non-naturally occurring composition of matter that contains less than the entire complement of biological materials found in the entire plant or plant part. In this respect, an intact or ground-up fruit of Marcgraviaceae would not constitute a &#x201c;preparation&#x201d; as defined herein, but a composition from which some or all of the moisture, fibre or carbohydrates are separated, would constitute a &#x201c;preparation.&#x201d; A wide range of preparations is contemplated. For instance, a betulinic-acid containing tea-like beverage, made by steeping <i>Souroubea </i>leaves in hot water, and then removing the leaves, would constitute a preparation as defined herein. Similarly, a dried, finely ground powder of Marcgraviaceae leaves would constitute a &#x201c;preparation,&#x201d; as the powder would have a moisture content far below that found in nature.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the Marcgraviaceae preparation is an extract obtained by contacting Marcgraviaceae plant material, such as fruit, leaves, other plant parts, or a mixture thereof, with a solvent in which betulinic acid is soluble, to form a betulinic acid-containing extract, and then recovering the betulinic acid-containing extract, as exemplified in the Examples herein. Preferably, the solvent used is other than water.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein and in the claims, the term &#x201c;plant&#x201d; encompasses whole plants as well as plant parts, including, without limitation, plant cells, tissues, seeds, embryos, roots, leaves, stems, et cetera.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The preparation may take the form of a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating anxiety, comprising a preparation as described above together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients, as are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In another aspect, the invention provides a commercial package comprising a betulinic acid-containing preparation obtained from a plant of the family Marcgraviaceae, and instructions for use of said preparation for preventing or treating anxiety in a subject.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention also provides a method for making an anxiolytic extract of Marcgraviaceae, comprising the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">(a) contacting a Marcgraviaceae plant or a part thereof, with a solvent in which betulinic acid is soluble, to form a betulinic acid-containing extract; and,</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">(b) recovering said extract.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As discussed above, the solvent used is preferably other than water.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The invention further provides a method for preventing or treating anxiety in a subject comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a betulinic acid-containing preparation obtained from Marcgraviaceae.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another aspect, the invention extends to the use of a plant of the family Marcgraviaceae for the prevention or treatment of anxiety in a subject.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The invention further extends to the use of a plant of the family Marcgraviaceae for the manufacture of an anxiolytic preparation.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Marcgraviaceae Preparations</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0068">Betulinic acid-containing preparations of Marcgraviaceae may be prepared by, for instance, blending or macerating Marcgraviaceae leaves, fruit, or other plant parts in a solvent in which betulinic acid is soluble, filtering the blended material, and then evaporating the solvent. Suitable solvents include, without limitation, water, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, or low molecular weight alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, or butanol. A solvent other than water is generally preferred. The resulting preparation may take the form of a solid (such as a powder), a liquid, or other forms. Alternatively, a preparation of Marcgraviaceae can be prepared by drying Marcgraviaceae plants or plant parts, and then reducing the dried materials to a powder. In an exemplified case, the extract is a dark, viscous oil, which contains betulinic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0069">The preparation can be concentrated to varying degrees, limited principally by the amount of plant material a patient can conveniently ingest. Generally, at least the fibrous plant material and naturally-occurring plant carbohydrates are separated. Typically, the preparation will contain betulinic acid in an amount of at least 0.1% to 90% by weight, based on the Marcgraviaceae-derived portion of the preparation, and preferably contains at least 0.5%, more preferably at least 1%, even more preferably at least 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% or 80% by weight betulinic acid, based on the Marcgraviaceae derived portion of the preparation.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0087">Preferred compounds of the Formula II are those in which R is unsubstituted or substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkoxy or NR<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>. Preferred for R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>are H, unsubstituted or substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted C1-C3 alkyl(aryl), unsubstituted or substituted aryl, an unsubstituted or substituted C<sub>3 </sub>to C<sub>7 </sub>ring when taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, or an amino acid residue such as glycine. Preferred values for R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>are H or, when taken together, is &#x2550;CH<sub>2</sub>. Preferred for R<sub>5 </sub>is H; for R<sub>6 </sub>is OH or O&#x2014;C(O)&#x2014;(C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>alkyl); or R<sub>5 </sub>and R<sub>6 </sub>taken together are &#x2550;O. Preferred values for R<sub>9</sub>, R<sub>10</sub>, and R<sub>12 </sub>are H. Betulonic acid may be excluded from the list of preferred derivatives. The compound of the Formula II wherein R is OH, R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>when taken together are &#x2550;CH<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>5 </sub>is H, R<sub>6 </sub>is OH and R<sub>9</sub>, R<sub>10 </sub>and R<sub>12 </sub>are H represents betulinic acid itself, and is also excluded from the list of preferred derivatives.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0088">Derivatives of betulinic acid that are also encompassed by the Formula II may be synthesized using procedures generally known in the art. Thus, for example, compounds of the Formula II wherein R is H may be prepared by the reduction of the corresponding acid to the aldehyde. Compounds of the Formula II in which R is alkoxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, aryloxy or heteroaryloxy may be prepared, for example, by esterification of the acid moiety of an appropriate betulinic acid derivative. For example esters are produced by reacting an alkali metal salt of the acid with alkyl chloride or bromide in THF in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium iodide. Alkyl tosylates may also be employed.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0090">The methyl ester of betulinic acid derivatives can be obtained from the corresponding acid by reaction with diazomethane in diethyl ether. Surprisingly, the well-known conversion of carboxylic acids into esters by reaction of the acid with an alcohol in the presence of a mineral acid does not work well for the conversion of betulinic acid into its alkyl, alkyl(aryl) or alkyl(heteroaryl) esters.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0091">Compounds of the Formula II in which R is NR<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2 </sub>may be prepared, for example, by the amidation of the acid moiety of an appropriate betulonic acid derivative. An example is the conversion of betulonic acid to N-benzyl betulinic acid amide. Betulonic acid is converted to its acid chloride upon reaction with SOCl<sub>2 </sub>or POCl<sub>3</sub>, reacted with benzylamine to generate the amide function. Finally, the 3-keto function is reduced to the 3-&#x3b2;-ol with NaBH<sub>4 </sub>in methanol. This approach can also be used to prepare ester simply by replacing the amine with an alcohol and an equivalent of triethylamine.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0093">Derivatives in which R&#x2550;OH and R<sub>6 </sub>is alkoxy or acyloxy can also be converted into the corresponding esters, R&#x2550;OR, and amides, R&#x2550;NR<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, by reaction conversion to the acid chloride (R&#x2550;Cl) followed by treatment with alcohols and triethylamine and prepared by reacting the compound having R&#x2550;OR and R&#x2550;NR<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2 </sub>with the appropriate acyl derivatives in the presence of pyridine and DMAP.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0094">Compounds of the Formula II in which R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>are hydrogen may be prepared, for example, from the hydrogenation of the alkene moiety of an appropriate betulinic acid derivative. Compounds of the Formula II in which R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>when taken together are &#x2550;O may be prepared, for example, from the ozonolysis of the corresponding alkene. Reduction of this ozonolysis product would yield compounds of the Formula II in which R<sub>3 </sub>is hydrogen and R<sub>4 </sub>is OH. Reaction of the ozonolysis product with an appropriate Grignard or organolithium reagent could provide compounds of the Formula II in which R<sub>3 </sub>is OH and R<sub>4 </sub>is unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl (such as phenyl) or heteroaryl (such as thiophenyl or furanyl). Acid catalyzed dehydration of compounds wherein R<sub>3 </sub>is OH and R<sub>4 </sub>is a group other than H, OH or CH<sub>2</sub>OH would result in compounds in which R<sub>4 </sub>is &#x2550;CHR<sub>8</sub>. The reaction of LiCH<sub>2</sub>EWG (wherein EWG is an electron withdrawing group such as a ketone, sulfoxide, sulfone, ester or nitrile) with a betulinic acid derivative in which R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>when taken together are &#x2550;O may be used to yield compounds of the Formula II in which R<sub>3 </sub>is hydrogen and R<sub>4 </sub>is CH<sub>2</sub>EWG. The reaction of a betulinic acid derivative in which R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>when taken together are &#x2550;O with ammonia, or with an appropriate primary or secondary amine or with an appropriate amino acid under slightly acidic conditions and reduction of the resulting immonium ion or imine with a suitable reducing agent such as NaBH<sub>3</sub>CN leads to compound in which R<sub>3 </sub>is H and R<sub>4 </sub>is NH<sub>2</sub>, or the substituents on the amine employed in the reaction minus a H bonded to N.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0095">Appropriate betulonic acid derivatives can be converted into the 3-&#x3b2;-amino derivatives, R<sub>5</sub>&#x2550;H, R<sub>6</sub>&#x2550;NR<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>, via the reductive amination technique in which the 3-keto function is reacted with a primary or secondary amine under mildly acidic conditions in the presence of NaBH<sub>3</sub>CN.</p>

The 3-OH moiety may also be etherified by known methods. Derivatives in which the C2 substituents have been modified to give the designated R<sub>9</sub>, and/or R<sub>10</sub>, can be accessed by reacting the appropriate betulonic acid derivative with lithium di-isopropylamide in RHF at low temperature and quenching the intermediate enolate with a variety of electrophiles. Potential electrophiles include alkyl or substituted alkyl bromides, iodides or sulfonates esters, dialkyl disulfides, diaryl disulfides, halogens or pseudohalogens, electrophilic oxygen species such as oxaziridines.

Pharmaceutical Compositions
</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0104">Pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared that comprise as active ingredients: a preparation of Marcgraviaceae; betulinic acid in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt; or a compound of formula II in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0105">Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts are known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, zinc and iron salts. Exemplary, but non-limiting, salts include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts; ammonium or alkylammonium salts, wherein the alkylammonium cation has one to three alkyl groups and each alkyl group independently has one to four carbon atoms; or transition metal salts.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0106">These pharmaceutical compositions are compositions for enteral (e.g. oral) administration, and also rectal or parenteral administration, also for topical administration to warm-blooded animals (particularly humans), the pharmacological active ingredient being present alone or together with customary pharmaceutical excipients.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0107">The pharmaceutical compositions comprise, for example, approximately from 0.1% to 100%, preferably from approximately 1% to approximately 60%, of the active ingredient. Pharmaceutical compositions for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, in unit dose forms, such as dragees, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and also ampoules. They are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, confectioning, dissolving or lyophilising processes. For example, pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained by combining the active ingredient with solid carriers, optionally granulating a resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, if desired or necessary after the addition of suitable excipients, into tablets or dragee cores.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0108">Suitable carriers include, especially, fillers, such as. sugars, for example lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, also binders, such as starch pastes, using, for example, corn, wheat, rice or potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl-cellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and, if desired, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxymethyl starch, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0109">Excipients include, especially, flow conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings that may be resistant to gastric juices, there being used, inter alia, concentrated sugar solutions which may contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Colourings or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0110">Further orally administrable pharmaceutical compositions include dry-filled capsules consisting of gelatin, and also soft sealed capsules consisting of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The dry-filled capsules may contain the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and optionally stabilisers. In soft capsules, the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols, to which stabilisers may also be added.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0111">Rectally administrable pharmaceutical compositions, for example, suppositories that comprise a combination of the active ingredient and a suppository base are also provided. Suitable as suppository bases are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, paraffin hydrocarbons, polyethylene glycols and higher alkanols. It is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules that comprise a combination of the active ingredient and a base material. Suitable base materials are, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols and paraffin hydrocarbons.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0112">Aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, for example a water-soluble salt, are particularly suitable for parenteral administration. Also suitable for parenteral administration are suspensions of the active ingredient, such as corresponding oily injection suspensions, these being used suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles, such as fatty oils, for example sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or aqueous injection suspensions that contain viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran and optionally also stabilisers.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0113">The dose of the active ingredient may depend on various factors, such as the method of administration, species of warm-blooded animal, age and/or individual condition. The preferred route of administration is oral administration. The active ingredient may be administered in a range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per dose, more preferably about 0.1 to about 2.5 mg/kg body weight per dose, even more preferably about 0.1 to about 0.25 mg/kg body weight per dose.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0114">The anxiolytic compounds of the present invention are fast acting (effective within 45-60 minutes after oral administration). Further, development of tolerance or desensitization to the anxiolytic compounds is low, and cessation of chronic treatment fails to elicit overt withdrawal effects. Hence, the anxiolytic compounds may be used to treat either or both of acute or chronic anxiety. For instance, treatment of a subject may involve daily or near-daily administration of the anxiolytic compounds for at least 21 days, 30 days, two months, three months, six months, one year or more.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0115">In a normal case, the approximate estimated daily dose for a human patient weighing approximately 75 kg is, in the case of oral administration, from about 7.5 to about 750 mg.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0116">Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain betulinic acid or a betulinic acid derivative as the sole active (i.e. anxiolytic) ingredient, or may contain an additional active ingredient, e.g. an additional anxiolytic drug such as a benzodiazepine or buspirone.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0117">The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0116" num="0118">This example illustrates the preparation of a <i>Souroubea </i>extract from leaves.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0119"><i>Souroubea sympetala </i>leaves were collected at Bioforesta, Costa Rica. The leaves were immediately preserved in 95% ethanol and stored either at room temperature or in a refrigerator.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0120">The leaves and. the 95% ethanol were blended. Additional 95% ethanol was added to facilitate the blending process. The blended material was kept for 2 days at room temperature, then filtered. The dried filter cake, which is leaf fiber, weighed 178 g.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0121">The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to afford 40.1 g of a dark powder. This powder was extracted 3 times by stirring rapidly with 150 ml of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate extracts were combined and the solvent was evaporated to afford 8.0 g of a dark viscous oil. This oil was used in rat anti-anxiety bio-assays.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0120" num="0122">This example illustrates the preparation of a <i>Souroubea </i>extract from fruit.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0123"><i>Souroubea sympetala </i>fruit was collected at Bioforesta, Costa Rica, and preserved in 95% ethanol, and was processed similarly to the <i>S. sympetala </i>leaves. The results were as follows: Dried, insoluble in 95% ethanol, 68.5 g fiber; ethanol soluble material 8.5 g; dried ethyl acetate soluble extracts 0.37 g.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE 3</heading>

<p id="p-0128" num="0130">This example illustrates that a 95% ethanol extract of leaves from <i>Souroubea </i>alleviates anxiety in the elevated plus-maze test.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0131">The majority of tests described in the following examples were conducted on adult; male Sprague-Dawley rats (typically weighing &#x2dc;300-450 gm) were obtained from Charles River Canada, St. Constant, Quebec. They were individually housed in standard clear Plexiglas cages (24&#xd7;30&#xd7;18 cm) and maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (7:00 A.M.-7:00 P.M. light phase) in a temperature and humidity controlled room. Unless indicated otherwise, animals had free access to water and maintained on a restricted diet of 5 pellets a day of Purina Lab Chow. All experimental procedures complied with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0132">In the elevated plus-maze (EPM) paradigm, conflict is generated by the innate drive to explore the new environment (to locate food) and the fear or aversion to open spaces and heights (vulnerable or dangerous zones). Typically rodents spend more time exploring the closed portions of the maze than the open zones of the maze. Increase in the number of entries into the open arms (anxiety generating) as compared to the closed arms (safe zones), as well as any increase the time spent in the open arms in comparison to closed arms is believed to reflect reduced anxiety (Pellow, S., et al., (1985). Validation of open:closed arm entries in an elevated plus-maze as a measure of anxiety of the rat., In <i>Current Protocols in Neuroscience </i>pp. 8.3.6-8.3.7), John-Wiley &#x26; Sons). Animals treated with classical anxiolytic drugs, such as benzodiazepines (e.g. Valium), venture out more onto the open arms of the maze.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0133">The EPM constitutes of a plus-shaped maze with two enclosed arms (or alleys; 50&#xd7;10&#xd7;40 cm) and two open arms (or planks; 50&#xd7;10 cm), with a 10&#xd7;10 cm central zone. The EPM was positioned at a height of 50 cm off the floor. All parts of the apparatus were made from wood, with the closed arms walled in by opaque Plexiglas. The floor was lined with coarse, black rubberized material. To avoid distractions, the EPM was surrounded by black curtain and the subjects were monitored remotely, using a closed circuit camera mounted above the set-up.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0134">The rats were randomly assigned to each of the drug conditions. The drugs were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) or orally (by gavage) 60 min prior to testing. Prior to placement onto the EPM, the rats were placed in an open-field box for a 5-min habituation. They were then placed in the centre of the EPM, facing one of the enclosed arms and observed remotely (via video-link relay) for 5 min. Behaviours scored included time spent in the open arms of the maze, time spent in the closed arms of the maze, number of entries into the open-arms and number of entries into the closed arm of the maze. In addition, the &#x2018;risk assessment&#x2019; behaviours that included the number of unprotected head-dips (protruding the head over the edge of an open-arm while the body was on the open arm of the maze), and protected head-dips (protruding the head over the edge of the maze while the hind legs are still within the closed arms) were also scored.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0135">In this example, rats received one of: (a) sweetened milk (control); (b) 50 mg/kg of a 95% ethanol extract of leaves from <i>Souroubea</i>; (c) 50 mg/kg of an ethanol acetate fraction of leaves from <i>Souroubea</i>; or (d) 50 mg/kg of an aqueous fraction of leaves from <i>Souroubea</i>; orally (by gavage) and were tested in the elevated plus-maze test 45-60 minutes after treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0136">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, rats treated with the 95% ethanol extract (marc.) or ethanol acetate fraction (f1) of <i>Souroubea </i>spent significantly more time on the open arms of the maze (as compared to controls), indicating that this plant extract imparts anxiolytic-like effects.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0137">Bioassay guided fractionation revealed that the &#x2018;anxiolytic&#x2019; activity was contained within the ethyl acetate fraction (f1).</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">EXAMPLE 6</heading>
<p id="p-0136" num="0138">This example illustrates that a crude extract of leaves from <i>Souroubea </i>alleviates anxiety in the fear-potentiated startle paradigm.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0139">In this anxiety/fear paradigm, rats are first trained to associate a neutral stimulus (a light) with an aversive stimulus (an electric shock to the foot). In response to a burst of an auditory stimulus (110 dB white noise burst of 500 m sec duration), rats demonstrate a reflexive startle response. However, when the acoustic stimulus is preceded by a fear cue (the light in this case), there is potentiation of their natural startle response. This potentiation of startle responses is thought to result from a classically conditioned increase in fear. Anxiolysis is inferred when there is a reduction in the magnitude of the fear-potentiated startle response.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0140">The fear potentiated startle equipment (Med-Associates, St-Albans, Vt.) constituted (1) a pressure-sensitive platform upon which the animal is placed (in an enclosure with shock-grid floor), (2) Speakers and amplifier, to deliver acoustic stimulus, (3) Computer controlled light cue, and (4) a computerized interface to deliver the auditory and/or visual stimuli, and to record the magnitude of startle detected by the platform. The whole set up is housed in a sound attenuated and darkened chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0141">The experiment involved three phases; a training phase, a screening phase and the testing phase. In the 2-day screening phase, the rats were conditioned to associate a light cue to an electric foot-shock. Specifically, a 5 sec light cue was followed by 0.5 sec foot shock (0.67 mA) at a random inter-trial intervals ranging from 30-60 sec. Each animal received 10 trials per day, for two days. The second or screening phase involved identifying the rats that learnt to associate the light cue with the shock, which was assessed by measuring their startle response in the absence and the presence of the fear cue. Only animals that showed the fear-potentiated startle response (at least a 40% increase in the startle amplitude) were used in the next phase. In the final or test phase, rats were treated 60 min prior to testing. Animals were placed in the test chambers and presented with 10 trials of 110 dB sound bursts (inter-trial interval of 30 sec) in the absence of the light cue, and the startle response recorded. This was followed by additional 5 trials where a 5 sec light-cue preceded the 110 dB sound burst. The startle amplitudes were averaged over each of the 5 trial sessions. For statistical analyses, the second 5 trial session average (without the cue) was subtracted from the last 5-trial session (with the light cue), and this difference score analyzed using ANOVA procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0142">Rats received one of: (a) 50 mg/kg of a 95% ethanol extract of leaves from <i>Souroubea</i>; (b) 50 mg/kg of an ethanol acetate fraction of leaves from <i>Souroubea</i>; or (c) peanut oil (control); orally (by gavage) and were tested in the fear-potentiated startle paradigm 45-60 minutes after treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0143">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, control rats show the expected potentiation of the startle response when the light comes on, however, this response is markedly attenuated in rats pretreated with 95% ethanol extract of <i>Souroubea </i>(marc.) or the ethanol acetate fraction (F1).</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0144">Thus, the anxiolytic potential of this plant product is confirmed in two distinct and validated tests of anxiety.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">EXAMPLE 7</heading>
<p id="p-0143" num="0145">This example illustrates that betulinic acid is the active anxiolytic ingredient of <i>Souroubea </i>as evidenced by the elevated plus-maze test.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0146">As indicated earlier, the active ingredient(s) responsible for the anti-anxiety effects of the <i>Souroubea </i>plant, appeared to be in fraction 1 (the ethanol acetate extract).</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0147">Within this fraction, betulinic acid was identified as being present.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0148">Rats received 1 mg/kg of betulinic acid suspended in peanut oil orally (by gavage) and were tested in the elevated plus-maze test 45-60 minutes after treatment. Control rats received only peanut oil.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0149">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, rats treated with betulinic acid spent significantly more time on the open arms of the plus-maze, confirming that betulinic acid was indeed able to alleviate anxiety.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">EXAMPLE 8</heading>
<p id="p-0148" num="0150">This example illustrates that betulinic acid has anxiolytic effects in the fear-potentiated test of anxiety.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0151">As indicated earlier, drugs that alleviate anxiety (e.g. benzodiazepines) reduce the startle amplitude when the sound (110 dB) is presented in the presence of a cue previously paired with an aversive event (foot shock).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0152">Rats received either: (a) 1 mg/kg betulinic acid suspended in peanut oil; or (b) peanut oil only (control); orally (by gavage) and were tested in the fear-potentiated paradigm 45-60 minutes after treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0153">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, betulinic acid significantly attenuated the startle response in the presence of the fear-cue (but not in its absence). The scores depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represent the difference in startle amplitude (calculated as startle response in the presence of the fear cue&#x2212;startle response in the absence of the fear cue). This score was much lower in the rats pretreated with betulinic acid, suggesting that it has anti-anxiety effects.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0154">Since the startle scores were not altered in the absence of the fear cue, one can surmise that attenuation of the fear-potentiated response is not due to non-specific motor effects.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">EXAMPLE 9</heading>
<p id="p-0153" num="0155">This example illustrates that betulinic acid has anxiolytic effects in mice (CD-1 strain) as well.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0156">Previous experiments were all conducted in experimental rats. Here we tested the effect of betulinic acid on CD-1 strain of mice.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0157">Mice received 0.25 or 2.5 mg/kg of betulinic acid, or peanut oil only (control), intra peritoneally (&#x201c;i.p.&#x201d;), and were tested 45-60 minutes later in the elevated plus maze test.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0158">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, mice treated with betulinic acid at either the 0.25 or 2.5 mg/kg i.p. dosage entered the open (anxiogenic) arm of the elevated plus maze more often than controls. The proportion of time spent on the open arm of the maze was also increased significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0159">It appears that for mice the 0.25 mg/kg dose may be the maximally effective dose (as a higher dose did not increase the anxiolytic effects further).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0160">These data demonstrate that the anxiolytic effect of betulinic acid is not restricted to rats, as it can be observed in mice as well.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">EXAMPLE 10</heading>
<p id="p-0159" num="0161">This example illustrates that betulinic acid reduces anxiety-like behaviours in BALB/c mice.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0162">BALB/c mice represent a strain of mice that is very stress-reactive. It has been suggested that this strain may represent an animal model of trait anxiety.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0163">Mice received dosages of betulinic acid in accordance with the previous example.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0164">Betulinic acid had a pronounced effect on this strain of mice. As reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, both doses of betulinic acid (0.25 or 2.5 mg/kg; i.p.) significantly increased the proportion of time spent as well as the number of entries on the open arm of the elevated plus maze relative to the peanut oil only control.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0165">Thus the anxiolytic effect of betulinic acid is evident in rats as well as mice. Furthermore, it seems effective in alleviating anxiety in a genetically anxious strain of mice.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0166">These data also suggest that betulinic acid may potentially be effective in alleviating state as well as trait anxiety.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">EXAMPLE 11</heading>
<p id="p-0165" num="0167">This example compares the anxiolytic activity of betulinic acid and some other structurally related compounds. Results are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0168">As expected, betulinic acid (0.5 mg/kg) increased the proportion of time spent in the open arm of the elevated plus maze.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0169">However neither beta-amyrin (5 mg/kg) nor oleanolic acid (0.5 mg/kg), two compounds structurally related to betulinic acid, displayed any anxiolytic activity on the elevated plus maze paradigm.

<p id="p-0168" num="0170">This example compares the effect of betulinic acid and betulinic acid methyl ester on social interaction in rats.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0171">The rat social interaction paradigm takes advantage of rats' natural behaviour in novel situations. The more &#x2018;anxious&#x2019; the animals are, the less likely they are engage in social interaction with the cohort. Anxiolytic drugs typically increase the amount of time rodents spend socially interacting with one another. (Pile, S. E., (1980). The use of social interaction as a method for detecting anxiolytic activity of chlor-diazepoxide-like drugs. In <i>Current Protocols in Neuroscience </i>(pp. 8.3.3-8.3.4), John-Wiley &#x26; Sons).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0172">The social-interaction (SI) test arena constituted of a 60&#xd7;60 cm white Plexiglas floor, enclosed by 35-cm high walls of the same material. The arena was surrounded by black curtain, and a closed circuit camera was positioned above the setup, to feed live video signals to the experimenter seated in a separate room, for behavioral assessment and recording.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0173">Each rat was placed alone in the SI box for 7.5 min daily for 2 days, in order to familiarize the animals with the test environment. Animals were paired according to their body weights (less than 10 g difference) and each pair was randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups. Rats received either betulinic acid 0.5 mg/kg i.p., betulinic acid methyl ester (methyl betulinate) 0.5 mg/kg i.p., or peanut oil only (control). Drugs were injected (i.p.) 60 min prior to testing. Tests were carried out at three intervals, 1 h, 2.5 h and 4 h after injection. Each pair was tested at the 1-h interval, then new pairs from within the same drug group were formed for the 2.5-h interval and then again at the 4-h interval (new pairs were formed for each test interval, to control for the potential confounding effect partner familiarity). At each of the three test intervals, animals were observed for 7.5 min. The behaviors scored included the amount of time the pairs spent interacting together (sniffing, grooming and chasing) as well as the number of times the animals initiated contact.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0174">Data analysis of interaction time using ANOVA, indicated a significant main Treatment effect (F (2, 79)=16.577, p&#x3c;0.0001) but no Time effect (F (2, 79)=0.882, p&#x3e;0.4). Thus the data were collapsed across time and, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the analyses revealed that both betulinic acid (p&#x3c;0.001) and its methyl ester derivative (p&#x3c;0.0001) significantly increased the amount of social interaction when compared to the control group. Furthermore, betulinic acid methyl ester was also significantly more effective at increasing social interaction than betulinic acid (p&#x3c;0.05). The frequency of initiated contact was found to be not significant.</p>

<p id="p-0173" num="0175">This example compares the anxiolytic activity of betulonic acid and some synthesized derivatives of betulinic acid to the activity of diazepam, as tested in the Vogel (punished drinking) paradigm.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0176">In the Vogel test, rats are water deprived overnight, prior to testing, and then given the opportunity to drink for 10 min in the test chamber. Every 5th lick is &#x2018;punished&#x2019; with the delivery of a mild shock delivered through the drinking spout. This generates &#x2018;anxiety&#x2019; due to the conflict between the desire to drink (due to the thirst) and the discomfort of the occasional shocks delivered through the waterspout. Thus the rats drink less when they are periodically shocked, than when they are not shocked. The number of licks made (or the shocks accepted) by the thirsty rat is known to be increased by drugs with anti-anxiety properties, and this test is one of the &#x2018;gold standards&#x2019; accepted by drug companies. An anxiolytic effect is inferred if an animal persists in the drinking more than the matched controls, in the presence of waterspout shocks. (Vogel, J. R., Beer, B., &#x26; Cloudy, D. E., (1971). A simple and reliable conflict procedure for testing anti-anxiety agents., In <i>Current Protocols in Neuroscience </i>(pp 8.3.10-8.3.12), John-Wiley &#x26; Sons).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0177">The Vogel setup (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, Pa.) comprised a clear Plexiglas cage (30&#xd7;25&#xd7;30 cm), which housed the animal during the test session. An external shock source was attached to the metal spout of the water bottle. An optical beam located at the base of the waterspout tracked the number of licks performed by monitoring the number of beam interruptions caused by the animal's tongue.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0178">Animals maintained on a water deprivation schedule were allowed access to water only during a 1-h period once a day, and maintained on a restricted diet of 5 pellets a day of Purina Lab Chow. Drug dosages and route of administration were as in Example 12. Prior to the testing, the animals were familiarized with the test cages and waterspouts by allowing them to explore the cage and have shock-free access to the water for 10 min/day for 3 days. After each test session, the rats were given ad libitum access to water for 60 min. The rats were then placed into the apparatus for a 10 min test session. They were initially allowed shock-free access to water (for the first 5 s), after which the shock circuit was activated such that every 5th lick was accompanied by a shock (0.4 mA).</p>
