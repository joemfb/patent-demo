<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to water coolers. More particularly, the invention relates to the replacement of exterior panels of a water cooler. For example, when the exterior panel of a water cooler becomes damaged or outdated, it may be desirably replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Known methods for replacing the exterior panels of water coolers are time consuming. As one example, when a water cooler is sent to a service center for panel replacement, conventional, previously known water cooler models may have an exterior panel secured to the water cooler wrapper (or cabinet housing) by multiple (e.g., twenty-three (23)) screws. Multiple steps must be taken to replace the panel: removing the liquid dispensing module, bottle ring, and POU float kit; unscrewing the faucets on the front of the cooler; unscrewing four (4) screws from the back of the unit and four (4) screws from the bottom of the unit; taking off the wrapper; unscrewing and removing the twenty-three (23) screws and the rubber seats in order to remove the panels; placing the new panel on the wrapper; screwing back on the twenty-three (23) screws and rubber seats; reassembling the wrapper; screwing back on the four (4) screws from the back and four (4) screws from the bottom of the unit; screwing back in the faucets; and replacing the liquid dispensing module, bottle ring, or POU float kit.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Replacement of the panel of such a conventional water cooler under this method took approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete. Thus a service person replacing panels on multiple water coolers can expend many hours of valuable labor time on this task. In addition, the above steps of the panel replacement process require many parts of the cooler to be disassembled, which can lead to the potential loss of parts, or error in reassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It would be advantageous to devise a method for renewing a water cooler's exterior panels that is time efficient and less complicated and that uses fewer parts than known methods. It would be also advantageous to provide the water cooler customer with a system that allowed the customer to easily change the exterior of the cooler based on the desired aesthetic. Accordingly, there is a need to renew water cooler exteriors with fewer steps and by removing fewer parts of the water cooler.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The objects mentioned above, as well as other objects are solved by the present invention, which overcomes disadvantages of prior methods of replacing a water cooler's exterior panel, while providing new advantages not believed associated with such replacement methods.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present invention provides a water cooler with a wrapper and at least one rapidly detachable exterior panel. The water cooler may have multiple apertures to receive multiple fasteners that may have a hollow shaft. Corresponding rear surface projections located on the rear surface of the panel may be adapted to insert into the wrapper and pass through a portion of the hollow shaft of the fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the fastener may have a body, a first end with an anchor adapter, a tapered second end, and a gap on the body of the fastener. When inserted into the wrapper, the anchor may be located on the outer surface of the wrapper to receive the panel's rear surface projection. The gap on the fastener may enable contraction and expansion of the body of the fastener. The fastener may have at least one hook on the body to grip the wrapper upon expansion of the fastener. The fastener may have at least one hook, which is generally triangular-shaped in cross-section. The fastener may be secured by a screw with a head and a body. The body of the screw may be insertable into the fastener, and may be attachable to the rear surface projection.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect of the invention, the fastener may be a grommet.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the fastener may be made of hard plastic, metal, or elastomeric material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the invention, a method for attaching the exterior panel of a water cooler to the wrapper of a water cooler may include providing a wrapper with front and rear surfaces and multiple apertures to receive corresponding fasteners. The method may also include providing at least one exterior panel having front and rear surfaces and rear surface projections to receive fasteners.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Set forth below is a description of what are believed to be the preferred embodiments and/or best examples of the invention claimed. Future and present alternatives and modifications to this preferred embodiment are contemplated. Any alternatives or modifications which make insubstantial changes in function, in purpose, in structure, or in result are intended to be covered by the claims of this patent.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, a preferred embodiment of water cooler <b>10</b> with a removable exterior panel <b>50</b> is shown. Panel <b>50</b> removably attaches to wrapper <b>11</b> of a water cooler (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Panel <b>50</b> may comprise multiple pieces, such as a top, middle and bottom panel portion (not shown). Panel portions may be separate pieces or integrally connected to each other. The front surface of wrapper <b>11</b> includes multiple apertures <b>12</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), each adapted to receive a fastener <b>1</b>, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> or <b>10</b>. Projecting rearwardly from the rear surface <b>50</b><i>a </i>of exterior panel <b>50</b> are fastener attachment projections <b>51</b>, which may be cylindrical projections formed integrally with panel <b>50</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, to attach panel <b>50</b> to the front surface of wrapper <b>11</b>, the panel is located in front of and over the wrapper, and aligned such that projections <b>51</b> may be press-fit into the corresponding openings <b>7</b> of fasteners <b>1</b>. Replacing a rapidly detachable panel using this preferred embodiment has been found to take a user approximately five (5) minutes&#x2014;a significant drop in the amount of time it took to replace a panel using previously known methods.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a detailed perspective of a preferred embodiment of fastener <b>1</b> receiving the panel projections <b>51</b> is shown. To attach panel <b>50</b> to the wrapper <b>11</b> a user pushes the panel <b>50</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) over the front surface of the wrapper <b>11</b> so that projections <b>51</b> align with the multiple openings <b>7</b> of the fastener <b>1</b> on the wrapper <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In yet another preferred embodiment, an alternative method may be employed to attach panel <b>50</b> to the wrapper <b>11</b>. Projecting rearwardly from the rear surface <b>50</b><i>a </i>of exterior panel <b>50</b> are fastener attachment projections <b>51</b>, which may be cylindrical projections formed integrally with panel <b>50</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Openings <b>7</b> of fasteners <b>1</b> may be press-fit onto projections <b>51</b>. Then, a user may push panel <b>50</b> over the front surface of wrapper <b>11</b> so that projections <b>51</b> with fasteners <b>1</b> affixed thereon, align with multiple apertures <b>12</b>, each adapted to receive a fastener <b>1</b> on wrapper <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Fasteners <b>1</b> may be of various shapes, sizes and functions. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, fastener <b>1</b> shown in this preferred embodiment is an anchor shape, with the first end <b>4</b> termed an anchor adapter. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the preferred embodiment of anchor-shaped fastener <b>1</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) has been inserted into apertures <b>12</b> on wrapper <b>11</b>. First end (anchor adapter) <b>4</b> is shown sitting on the wrapper's <b>11</b> surface, and has an opening <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The second end <b>5</b> of the fastener <b>1</b> is shown protruding from the rear surface of the wrapper <b>11</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, anchor-shaped fastener <b>1</b> may also have hooks <b>2</b> located on its body <b>3</b>. The hooks function to retain the panel in firm engagement with the wrapper.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, second end <b>5</b> is preferably tapered to easily fit into apertures <b>12</b> on wrapper. When using fastener <b>1</b> shown in this preferred embodiment, a user squeezes body <b>3</b> of anchor-shaped fastener <b>1</b>, closing gap <b>6</b> and contracting body <b>3</b>, allowing the user to easily push the second end <b>5</b> of anchor-shaped fastener <b>1</b> into aperture <b>12</b> on wrapper <b>11</b>. Once anchor-shaped fastener <b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) has been inserted in aperture <b>12</b> and released by the user, it expands and hooks <b>2</b> grip the walls of the wrapper's apertures <b>12</b> (as shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, another preferred embodiment is shown. Here, an anchor-shaped fastener <b>1</b> is used with a screw <b>22</b> for additional security. The screw has a head <b>23</b> and body <b>20</b> with threads <b>21</b>. In this preferred embodiment, screw <b>22</b> may be inserted after panel <b>50</b> has been attached to wrapper <b>11</b>. The distal end <b>24</b> of the screw is received into opening <b>7</b> of the fastener. Use of the screw is not preferred, however as a user will not be able to take advantage of all of the time-saving methods for replacing panel <b>51</b> available to those using the previously disclosed embodiments. In order to save assembly/disassembly time, only a few screws in key locations may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to the fastener example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, fastener <b>1</b> is a grommet. The body <b>3</b> of this fastener <b>1</b> has a hollow shaft <b>7</b> and an exterior surface <b>3</b> and an interior surface (not shown). In this preferred embodiment, hooks or threads <b>30</b> are shown, but are not necessary. The hooks or threads <b>30</b> can have a triangular shape, such that the base of the thread is wider and the thread narrows to a point from the base (as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 13</figref>). Threads <b>30</b> of grommet fastener <b>1</b> provide additional friction when the fastener is pushed into wrapper aperture <b>12</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, with the preferred embodiment of fastener <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, panel <b>50</b> removably attaches to wrapper <b>11</b> of a water cooler. Panel <b>50</b> may comprise multiple pieces, such as a top, middle and bottom panel portion (not shown). The front surface of wrapper <b>11</b> includes multiple apertures <b>12</b>, each adapted to receive a fastener <b>1</b>. Projecting rearwardly from the rear surface <b>50</b><i>a </i>of exterior panel <b>50</b> are fastener attachment projections <b>51</b>, which may be cylindrical projections formed integrally with panel <b>50</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). Fasteners <b>1</b> are pushed onto projections <b>51</b> (not shown). To attach panel <b>50</b> to the front surface of wrapper <b>11</b>, the panel is located in front of and over the wrapper, and aligned such that projections <b>51</b> with fasteners <b>1</b> attached thereon may be press-fit into the corresponding apertures <b>12</b> on the wrapper <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Fastener <b>1</b> may be made of many materials, including but not limited to a hard plastic, a metal, or an elastomeric material. Panel <b>51</b> preferably is made of a material with glossy, smooth finish, such as Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polycarbonate (PC), or Polystyrene (PS). The wrapper <b>11</b> may be made of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE), ABS, PC or PS.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-21</figref>, yet another preferred embodiment of a water cooler <b>10</b> with a removable exterior panel is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, exterior panel may comprise multiple pieces, such as a top (not shown), middle (not shown) and bottom panel portion <b>110</b>. Bottom panel <b>110</b> may have an alcove <b>111</b> attached thereto. Alcove <b>111</b> may fit into aperture <b>301</b> in wrapper <b>11</b>. Alcove <b>111</b> may be used as a storage space for water cooler supplies such as cups, instant coffee, creamer or sugar.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-21</figref>, preferred embodiments of a water cooler <b>10</b> that utilizes one or more tensioning devices (i.e. <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) to attach wrapper <b>11</b> to bottom panel <b>110</b> are shown. The embodiments allow panel <b>110</b> to be even more easily attached and detached from wrapper <b>11</b>. For example, it will only take approximately one to two minutes to change a top and bottom panel (without changing the center panel). (The center panel may be locked with faucet and usually has less chance of getting scratched due to its concave shape. If the center panel is changed, faucets may have to be unscrewed and then screwed back on, adding an additional 30 seconds to 1 minute).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the exterior panel <b>110</b> shown in this embodiment has six (6) L-shaped rear surface projections <b>100</b> that may be integrally attached to the rear surface <b>110</b><i>a </i>of panel <b>110</b> to hold leaf spring <b>102</b>. However L-shaped projection <b>100</b> is not necessary, any device that could prevent the leaf spring <b>102</b> from being bent, damaged or dislocated during part storage, transportation or assembly/disassembly process will suffice. Projections <b>100</b> may be slidably inserted into corresponding apertures <b>101</b> on wrapper <b>11</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). In the preferred embodiment shown here, in order to be moved to the engaged position, the bottom panel <b>110</b> slides up (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>); however, water cooler <b>10</b> may be designed so panel <b>110</b> may slide up, down, left or right.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, to attach panel <b>110</b> to wrapper <b>11</b>, a preferred embodiment of a tensioning device, leaf spring <b>102</b>, may be inserted between L-shaped rear surface projection <b>100</b> and wrapper <b>11</b> in pocket <b>103</b> created by guard <b>104</b> and rear interior portion of L-shaped rear surface projection (not shown). The leaf spring shown in the preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> may be secured into pocket <b>103</b> when a portion of the first end <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the leaf spring, flange <b>106</b>, is inserted into retaining aperture <b>105</b> on rear portion of L-shaped rear surface projection <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, when the panel <b>110</b> is attached to wrapper <b>11</b>, second end of the leaf spring <b>102</b><i>b </i>pushes against the interior surface <b>11</b> a of wrapper <b>11</b> (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, in the preferred embodiment shown, with the panel <b>110</b> attached to wrapper <b>11</b>, second end <b>102</b><i>b </i>of leaf spring <b>102</b> may include a shoe <b>107</b> which allows for smooth movement on the interior along the surface of wrapper <b>11</b> while sliding projections <b>100</b> into apertures <b>101</b> on wrapper <b>11</b>. With leaf spring <b>102</b> in place within pocket <b>103</b>, and affixed by flange <b>106</b> at its first end <b>102</b> a within aperture <b>105</b>, panel <b>110</b> will be pushed towards wrapper <b>11</b>, thereby securing the pieces together</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>, another preferred embodiment of a water cooler with a removable exterior panel is shown. The provided friction of the aforementioned embodiments may be sufficient to secure exterior panel <b>110</b> to wrapper <b>11</b>. However, additional securing means to lock panel <b>110</b> and prevent it from sliding out may be added as well, including but not limited to screws (not shown) or stops (cantilevers) <b>200</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>) to prevent panel <b>110</b> from disengaging from wrapper <b>11</b>. Stops <b>200</b> may be integrated to panel <b>110</b> and will prevent panel <b>110</b> from sliding around on wrapper <b>11</b> by stopping at a cut out portion <b>11</b><i>b </i>of wrapper <b>11</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the location of stops <b>200</b> may vary in different embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-21</figref>, locking of panel <b>110</b> to wrapper <b>11</b> is shown. Tab <b>201</b> pulls away from wrapper <b>11</b>.
