<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, which forms an image on a recording medium in a state in which a cartridge including at least a developer containing part adapted to contain a developer to be applied to an electrophotographic photosensitive drum, is removably mounted to a main body of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Herein, the electrophotographic image forming apparatus (hereinafter, referred to as image forming apparatus) is a type in which an image is formed on a recording medium by using an electrophotographic image forming process. As the image forming apparatus, for example, there are given an electrophotographic copying machine, an electrophotographic printer (for example, color LED printer), a facsimile apparatus, and a word processor. Further, as the image forming apparatus, both of a black and white type and a color type are encompassed therein. Further, the recording medium is a type on which an image is formed by the electrophotographic image forming apparatus, and includes, for example, paper and an OHP sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a cartridge is, for example, a process cartridge or a developing cartridge, which is removably mounted to a main body of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus to contribute to an image forming process for forming an image on the recording medium. The process cartridge is constituted as a cartridge in which at least one of charging means, developing means, and cleaning means, which serve as process means acting on an electrophotographic photosensitive drum, is formed integrally with the electrophotographic photosensitive drum, and in which the thus formed cartridge is removably mounted to the main body of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus. Therefore, the process cartridge includes one which is constructed as a cartridge in which the developing means serving as the process means is formed integrally with the electrophotographic photosensitive drum, and in which the thus formed cartridge is removably mounted to the main body of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus. Further, the process cartridge includes one which is constructed as a cartridge in which the charging means, the developing means, or the cleaning means, which serve as the process means, are formed integrally with the electrophotographic photosensitive drum, and in which the thus formed cartridge is removably mounted to the main body. The process cartridge, which includes the electrophotographic photosensitive drum and the developing means formed integrally with each other, is referred to as a so-called integral type. Besides, the process cartridge, which includes the electrophotographic photosensitive drum and the process means other than the developing means formed integrally with each other, is referred to as a so-called separate type. In the process cartridge, the user him/herself may perform mounting and removing with respect to the main body. Therefore, the user may easily perform maintenance for the main body. Further, the developing cartridge includes a developing roller, contains developer (toner) which is used for developing an electrostatic latent image formed on the electrophotographic photosensitive drum by the developing roller, and is removably mounted to the main body. In a case of the developing cartridge, the electrophotographic photosensitive drum is attached to the main body or a cartridge-support member. Alternatively, the electrophotographic photosensitive drum is provided to the so-called separate type process cartridge (in this case, the process cartridge does not include the developing means). Also in the developing cartridge, the user him/herself may perform mounting and removing with respect to the main body of the image forming apparatus. Therefore, the user may easily perform maintenance for the main body. Thus, as the cartridge, the so-called integral type or the so-called separate type process cartridge is incorporated therein. Further, there is included as the cartridge a case in which the so-called separate type process cartridge and the developing cartridge are used in a pair. Further, as the cartridge, the electrophotographic photosensitive drum is securely attached to the main body or the cartridge-support member. Then, there is included a case in which the developing cartridge is capable of acting on the electrophotographic photosensitive drum, and is removably mounted to the cartridge-support member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the present invention, the cartridge includes at least a developer containing part adapted to contain a developer to be applied to an electrophotographic photosensitive drum, (hereinafter, referred to as drum), and is used by being removably mounted to a main body.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to attain downsizing of the image forming apparatus, there are cases of using, as the exposure apparatus of the drum, light emitting devices, which are provided in line in a longitudinal direction (rotation axis direction) of the drum, and which include multiple light emitting portions that illuminate in association with image information, for exposing the photosensitive drum. As a typical example of such light emitting devices, there is given an LED head array. For example, in an LED printer, which uses the LED head array as the exposure apparatus, it is constructed such that the luminance devices expose in accordance with image information signal sent from a controller, and the exposed light beams are converged by a lens to be formed on the drum as an image. Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2009-23281 discloses such a construction that the distance between the lens surface and the drum surface is adjusted by the eccentric cam. In this construction, the distance between the lens surface and the drum surface may be adjusted with precision. In addition, the distance between the lens surface and the drum surface may be adjusted through only the rotation of the eccentric cam, thereby being capable of simplifying the operation for adjustment. Further, the fixation of the eccentric cam after the adjustment is carried out by an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the related art image forming apparatus described above, it is required to make the distance between the surface of the lens and the surface of the drum be close very much. Besides, when the cartridge was shipped while being packed together into the main body of the image forming apparatus, similarly, the distance between the surface of the lens and the surface of the drum becomes extremely closer. For that reason, if a mechanical shock is applied to the image forming apparatus during the transportation, there is such a fear that the lens and the drum may be brought into contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, in the related art image forming apparatus, through the abutment of the abutment surface provided on the drum and the outer peripheral surface of the eccentric cam, the positioning of the distance between the surface of the lens and the surface of the drum is carried out. When the image forming apparatus was shipped while the cartridge is packed together into the main body, the abutment surface of the drum and the outer peripheral surface of the eccentric cam are brought into a contact state. For that reason, when a mechanical shock is applied to the image forming apparatus during the transportation, the abutment portion for positioning is also added with the strong mechanical shock. As described above, the fixation of the eccentric cam after the adjustment is carried out by an adhesive. However, there is such a fear that the positioning by the abutment as described above may vary when the strong shock is applied to the image forming apparatus during the transportation. As a result, displacement of a focal position may cause, and there is a fear of generating an image failure thereby. Accordingly, it is conceivable to take such a countermeasure of enlarging a wrapping material so that a mechanical shock applied to the image forming apparatus during the transportation may be mitigated.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a vertical sectional right side view of an electrophotographic image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of this embodiment. The apparatus <b>100</b> is an inline type color electrophotographic image forming apparatus, which forms an image on a recording medium <b>14</b> in a state in which four process cartridges <b>8</b> (<b>8</b>Y, <b>8</b>M, <b>8</b>C, and <b>8</b>Bk) are removably mounted to a main body <b>1</b>. As exposure apparatuses exposing electrophotographic photosensitive drums (hereinafter, referred to as drum) <b>12</b>, light emitting devices <b>9</b>, which expose in association with image information, are provided. For the light emitting devices <b>9</b>, LED head arrays (LED type exposure apparatus) are used. More specifically, the apparatus <b>100</b> is a four full-color LED printer employing an electrophotographic process. Based on an electrical image information (image signal) to be input from the host apparatus <b>200</b> such as a personal computer and an image reader to a controller <b>96</b>, color image formation is carried out on a recording medium (hereinafter, referred to as sheet) <b>14</b>. Note that, in the embodiment described below, descriptions are made of a full-color LED printer by way of example, but are not limited thereto. The present invention is the one, which is applied to the above-mentioned image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The apparatus <b>100</b> includes a tray (cartridge supporting member) <b>5</b>, which moves, in a state in which the cartridges <b>8</b> are supported, between an inside position IP and an outside position OP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the main body <b>1</b>. In association with the movement of the tray <b>5</b> toward the outside position OP, a light emitting device support member <b>7</b> supporting the light emitting devices <b>9</b> are moved by interlocking members <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>), from an exposure position LP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) to a retracted position RP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Further, in association with the movement of the tray <b>5</b> toward the inside position IP, the support member <b>7</b> is moved, by the interlocking member <b>130</b>, from the retracted position RP to the exposure position IP. In association with the movement of the tray <b>5</b> when the user pulled out the tray <b>5</b> toward the outside position OP, the interlocking member <b>130</b> automatically moves the support member <b>7</b> from the exposure position LP to the retracted position RP. In addition, in association with the movement of the tray <b>5</b> when the user pushes in the tray <b>5</b> toward the inside position IP, the interlocking member <b>130</b> automatically moves the support member <b>7</b> from the retracted position RP to the exposure position IP. The retracted position RP is a position at which the support member <b>7</b> (light emitting devices <b>9</b>) does not interfere with the movement of the tray <b>5</b>, which is supporting the cartridges <b>8</b>. Besides, the retracted position RP is a position at which the support member <b>7</b> (light emitting devices <b>9</b>) does not collide with the moving tray <b>5</b> and the moving cartridges <b>8</b>, which are moving while being supported by the tray <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">(Main Body of Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The main body <b>1</b> is defined as the structure excluding the tray <b>5</b> and the cartridges <b>8</b> from the apparatus <b>100</b>. In the main body <b>1</b>, there are provided a sheet feeding tray <b>13</b>, a feed roller <b>15</b>, a transfer belt <b>18</b>, a fixing device <b>20</b>, sheet discharging roller pairs <b>22</b>, and a delivery tray <b>3</b>. The tray <b>13</b> serves to load and receive a sheet <b>14</b>. The fixing device <b>20</b> includes a fixing film <b>20</b><i>a </i>and a pressure roller <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The roller pairs <b>22</b> include a sheet discharging roller <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the delivery roller <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The sheet <b>14</b>, on which an image is formed, is delivered through the roller pairs <b>22</b> to be loaded on the tray <b>3</b>. Further, in the main body <b>1</b>, main body guide <b>11</b> are provided (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref>). The guide <b>11</b> supports the cartridge tray (cartridge support member) <b>5</b> so as to be movable. The tray <b>5</b> supports the cartridges <b>8</b> (<b>8</b>Y, <b>8</b>M, <b>8</b>C, and <b>8</b>Bk) so as to be removable. In a state in which the tray <b>5</b> locates at the inside position IP inside the main body <b>1</b>, the cartridges <b>8</b> are mounted to drum holders (hereinafter, refereed to as mounting portion) <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). In the cartridges <b>8</b>, drum bearing portions (positioning portion on drum side) <b>51</b> on a coaxial line with the drum <b>12</b> are positioned by the mounting portions <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The cartridge <b>8</b>Y contains the yellow (Y-color) developer (hereinafter, referred to as toner), and forms a yellow developer image (toner image) on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. The cartridge <b>8</b>M contains a magenta (M-color) toner, and forms a magenta toner image on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. The cartridge <b>8</b>C contains a cyan (C-color) toner, and forms a cyan toner image on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. The cartridge <b>8</b>Bk contains a black (Bk-color) toner, and forms a black toner image on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. The cartridges <b>8</b> each integrally include the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>, and as the process means, a charging roller (charging member) <b>80</b>, a developing device, and a cleaning blade (cleaning member) <b>82</b>. The process means acts on the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>. The charging roller <b>80</b> charges the drum <b>12</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the developing device includes a toner containing chamber (developer containing part) <b>32</b>A accommodating a toner T to be applied to the drum <b>12</b>, and a developing chamber (developing part) <b>32</b>B having a developing roller <b>86</b> arranged therein, which serves as a developing member for developing an electrostatic latent image formed on the drum <b>12</b> by applying the toner to the drum <b>12</b>. Besides, the cleaning blade <b>87</b> removes the residual developer on the drum <b>12</b> after transfer of the image. Note that, the main body (the main body of the apparatus) <b>1</b> refers to the structure omitting the cartridge tray <b>5</b> and the cartridges <b>8</b> from the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">(Cartridge Tray)</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The tray <b>5</b> is supported by the guide <b>11</b> with respect to the main body <b>1</b>, and is provided so as to allow a slide movement in a lateral direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> (front-back direction of main body <b>1</b>). The tray <b>5</b> supports the cartridges <b>8</b> so as to be removable. Further, the tray <b>5</b> includes intermediate electrical contacts <b>45</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) to be electrically connected to cartridge side electrical contacts (not shown) included in the cartridges <b>8</b>. The intermediate electrical contacts <b>45</b> electrically connect to main body side electrical contacts (not shown) provided to the main body <b>1</b> in a state in which the tray <b>5</b> locates at the inside position IP. The intermediate electrical contact <b>45</b> is arranged on a side plate <b>5</b><i>b </i>on a non-drive side (one end portion side in longitudinal direction of cartridges <b>8</b>) of the tray <b>5</b>. However, the arrangement of the electrical contacts <b>45</b> is not limited thereto. The electrical contacts <b>45</b> may be arranged on the side plate <b>5</b><i>a </i>on a drive side. The tray <b>5</b> moves, in a state of removably supporting the cartridges <b>8</b>, between the inside position IP inside the main body <b>1</b> and the outside position OP outside the main body <b>1</b> while passing through the opening portion <b>10</b> of the front surface of the main body <b>1</b>. The guide <b>11</b> supports the tray <b>5</b> so that the tray <b>5</b> is movable between the outside position OP and the inside position IP, and also guide the tray <b>5</b>. When the user pulls out the tray <b>5</b> from the main body <b>1</b>, the tray <b>5</b> moves from the inside position IP to the outside position OP. Further, when the user pushes in the tray <b>5</b> into the main body <b>1</b>, the tray <b>5</b> moves from the outside position OP to the inside position IP. In this case, the inside position IP refers to the positions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Besides, the outside position OP refers to the positions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The inside position IP refers to a state in which the tray <b>5</b> locates inside the opening portion <b>10</b> of the main body <b>1</b>. Besides, the outside position OP refers to a state in which the tray <b>5</b> locates outside the opening portion <b>10</b>. Even in a case where the tray <b>5</b> locates at the outside position OP, all the cartridges <b>8</b> supported by the tray <b>5</b> may not locate outside the opening portion <b>10</b>. For example, in a pullout direction X (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) of the tray <b>5</b>, the cartridge <b>8</b>Bk, which locates at the most upstream side, may locate inside the opening portion <b>10</b>. Even in such cases, the cartridge <b>8</b>Bk, which locates at the most upstream side, locates at a front forward of the main body <b>1</b>, and hence it is easy for the user to replace the cartridge <b>8</b>Bk from the opening portion <b>10</b>. Further, the respective cartridges <b>8</b> are supported by the tray <b>5</b> in a crossing direction (orthogonal direction) of the longitudinal directions of the respective cartridges <b>8</b> with respect to the movement direction of the tray <b>5</b> (pullout direction X and push-in direction Y). The longitudinal direction is the same direction with the longitudinal direction (rotation axis direction) of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> and the longitudinal direction of the developing roller <b>86</b>. However, the present invention is applicable to a case where the respective cartridges <b>8</b> are supported by the tray <b>5</b> in a direction along which the longitudinal direction is running (parallel direction) with respect to the movement direction of the tray <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">(Cartridge Mounting Portion)</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a sectional view for illustrating a method of positioning the cartridges <b>8</b> at the mounting portions <b>50</b> in the main body <b>1</b>. The mounting portions <b>50</b> are formed in the main body <b>1</b>. The mounting portions <b>50</b> are arranged one end side and another end side in the longitudinal direction of the cartridges <b>8</b>, which locate at the inside position (in this case, image formation positions at which cartridges <b>8</b> contribute image formation) IP in the main body <b>1</b>. In each of the cartridges <b>8</b>, the drum bearing portions <b>51</b> are provided. The bearing portions <b>51</b> support a drum axis (not shown) provided at the one end side and another end side in the longitudinal direction of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> so as to be rotatable. The bearing portions <b>51</b> are provided at the one end and another end in the longitudinal direction of each of the cartridges <b>8</b> so as to project. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, only one of the bearing portions <b>51</b> is illustrated. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, when the tray <b>5</b> locates at the inside position IP of the main body <b>1</b>, the bearing portion <b>51</b> is supported by a recess portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the mounting portion <b>50</b>. Specifically, the one end side bearing portion <b>51</b> is supported by the recess portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the one end side mounting portion <b>50</b>, whereas another end side bearing portion <b>51</b> is supported by the recess portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>of another end side mounting portion <b>50</b>. Owing to contacts of two slant portions <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the recess portion <b>50</b><i>a </i>and a circumferential surface <b>51</b><i>a </i>of the bearing portion <b>51</b>, the positioning of a center position (axis position) of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b> with respect to the main body <b>1</b> is carried out. Further, the respective cartridges <b>8</b> are provided with a cartridge boss (first rotation-regulated member) <b>52</b> at one end of the longitudinal direction, and a cartridge rib (second rotation-regulated member) <b>53</b> at another end thereof. The tray <b>5</b> is provided with first tray groove portions (first rotation regulating members) <b>54</b> on the side plate <b>5</b><i>a </i>of one side, and second tray groove portions (second rotation regulating member) <b>55</b> on the side plate <b>5</b><i>b </i>of another side. Then, when the respective cartridges <b>8</b> are mounted into the main body <b>1</b>, the bosses <b>52</b> are supported by the groove portions <b>54</b>, and the ribs <b>53</b> are supported by the groove portions <b>55</b>. With this structure, when the cartridge <b>8</b> receives a rotation force from the main body <b>1</b>, for rotating the drum <b>12</b>, the cartridge <b>8</b> is regulated so as not to rotate about the bearing portion <b>51</b> as a center. Specifically, the rotation of the cartridge <b>8</b> about the drum <b>12</b> as the center is regulated. Consequently, the positioning of the cartridge <b>8</b> with respect to the main body <b>1</b> is carried out as the drum <b>12</b> being a center.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(Light Emitting Device)</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To the main body <b>1</b>, the light emitting device support member <b>7</b> supporting the light emitting devices <b>9</b> is provided. In this embodiment, the light emitting device support member <b>7</b> is provided in the delivery tray <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a perspective view of the support member <b>7</b>. In corresponding to four cartridges <b>8</b>, four light emitting devices <b>9</b> are provided to the support member <b>7</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> is a perspective view of the light emitting device <b>9</b>. The light emitting device <b>9</b> includes multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b>, which are provided in line in the longitudinal direction (axis direction) of the drum <b>12</b> of the cartridge <b>8</b> mounted onto the main body <b>1</b>. The longitudinal direction of the drum <b>12</b> is a direction orthogonal to the pullout direction X of the tray <b>5</b>. The light emitting portions <b>6</b> emit light in accordance with an image information signal from a controller <b>96</b>, to thereby expose the drum <b>12</b>. As the light emitting portions <b>6</b>, for example, electric field light emitting portions are used such as liquid crystal devices (elements), semiconductor light emitting diodes (LEDs), or organic electroluminescence devices (organic EL devices). The semiconductor light emitting diode is a semiconductor element that emits light by being applied with a voltage. The organic EL element is an electronic material made of an organic compound that illuminates by being applied with a voltage, and is a self light emitting portion. The organic EL element has, for example, a structure in which an organic light-emitting molecular layer is sandwiched by two electrodes, and a voltage is applied thereto. With this structure, an electron injected from the electrode and a hole are recombined to excite the organic molecules, and when the excited organic molecules return to a ground state, the EL element emits light. The light emitting devices <b>9</b> includes a substrate <b>90</b>. The substrate <b>90</b> is supported by a holder (not shown). On the front side of the substrate <b>90</b>, the light emitting portions <b>6</b> are provided, and a driver IC <b>92</b> is provided on the back side. The light emitting portions <b>6</b> are electrically connected to the driver IC <b>92</b>. The driver IC <b>92</b> controls lighting operation of the light emitting portions <b>6</b>. The substrate <b>90</b> is connected to the controller <b>96</b> of the main body <b>1</b> through a flexible flat cable (FFC) <b>94</b>. In accordance with an image information signal from the controller <b>96</b>, the driver IC <b>92</b> conducts the lighting operation of the light emitting portions <b>6</b>. To each of the light emitting portions <b>6</b>, a SELFOC (Registered Trademark) lens <b>98</b> is bonded. A front surface <b>98</b><i>a </i>on the drum <b>12</b> side of the lens <b>98</b> is a flat surface. The lens <b>98</b> collects the light emitted from the light emitting portions <b>6</b>, to thereby conduct image formation on the drum <b>12</b>. When the support member <b>7</b> locates at the exposure position LP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), the support member <b>7</b> supports the light emitting devices <b>9</b> so that the light emitting portions <b>6</b> face an image formation region in the longitudinal direction of the drum <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). The exposure position LP is a position at which the drum <b>12</b> is exposed through the light emission of the light emitting portions <b>6</b>, which being a position at which the multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> are provided in line along the longitudinal direction of the drum <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, in a state in which the support member <b>7</b> locates at the exposure position LP, each of the multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> and the drum <b>12</b> are positioned at equal intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment, each of the multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> and the drum <b>12</b> are positioned at the equal intervals at the exposure position LP, but the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, in a case where the sizes of the lenses <b>98</b> corresponding to the respective multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> differ from each other, the distances between the multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> and the drum <b>12</b> differ. The distance between each of the multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> and the drum <b>12</b> is set to so that the light emitted from the light emitting portions <b>6</b> is collected by the lens <b>98</b> to form an image on the drum <b>12</b>. Accordingly, depending on specifications of the lens <b>98</b>, the multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> may be arranged in curve so that the distance between the light emitting portions <b>6</b> and the drum <b>12</b> becomes shorter at the both end portions in the axis direction of the drum <b>12</b>, and becomes longer at the center portion in the axis direction. Alternatively, the multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> may be arranged in curve so that the distance between the light emitting portions <b>6</b> and the drum <b>12</b> becomes longer at the both end portions in the axis direction of the drum <b>12</b>, and becomes shorter at the center portion in the axis direction. Besides, the support member <b>7</b> is provided inside the tray <b>3</b>, and hence the support member <b>7</b> is moved integrally with the tray <b>3</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At the time of image formation, the drums <b>12</b> rotate clockwise as illustrated by arrows (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The surfaces of the drums <b>12</b> are uniformly charged by the charging rollers (charging members) <b>80</b>. The light emitting portions <b>6</b> emit light in accordance with an image information signal from the controller <b>96</b>, and expose the charged surfaces of the drums <b>12</b>, to thereby form an electrostatic latent image. The electrostatic latent image formed by the drums <b>12</b> is developed by the developers with the developing rollers (developing members) <b>81</b>, and becomes the developer image.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4C</figref> are sectional views of the image forming apparatus for illustrating a cartridge replacement method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is a perspective view of the main body <b>1</b> in which the door (openable and closable member) <b>2</b> is closed. The door <b>2</b> is rotatably provided with respect to the main body <b>1</b> for opening and closing the opening portion <b>10</b> of the main body <b>1</b>. The door <b>2</b> takes a closing position for closing the opening portion <b>10</b> and an opening position for opening the opening portion <b>10</b> through the rotation about a hinge <b>2</b><i>a </i>as a center. The user opens the door <b>2</b> to open the opening portion <b>10</b>, and performs operations such as the replacement of the cartridges <b>8</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a sectional view of the image forming apparatus in which the door <b>2</b> is opened. The tray <b>5</b> is supported with respect to the main body <b>1</b> by the guide <b>11</b>, and is slidingly movable in a lateral direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> (front-back direction). The tray <b>5</b> supports the cartridges <b>8</b> so as to be removable. The tray <b>5</b> is movable between the outside position OP and the inside position for positioning the cartridges <b>8</b> to the mounting portions <b>50</b> in the main body <b>1</b> while passing through the opening portion <b>10</b> of the main body <b>1</b>. In this case, the outside position OP refers to a position outside the main body <b>1</b>, and at which the user mounts and removes the cartridges <b>8</b> to the tray <b>5</b>. Further, the inside positions IP refers to the positions for positioning the cartridges <b>8</b> to the mounting portions <b>50</b> in the main body <b>1</b>. In this embodiment, the cartridges <b>8</b> locating at the inside position IP locate at the image formation positions (IP). The image formation positions (IP) refer to the positions at which the cartridges <b>8</b> contribute to form an image on the sheet <b>14</b>. The tray <b>5</b> moves by the user between the inside position IP and the outside position OP while passing through the opening portion <b>10</b>. The door <b>2</b> engages to the guide <b>11</b> via a door link <b>29</b>. If the user opens the door <b>2</b>, in association with the opening operation of the door <b>2</b>, the link <b>29</b> pulls out the guide <b>11</b> from a position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to a position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Simultaneously, the link <b>29</b> moves the guide <b>11</b> obliquely upward on the right side. Owing to the upward movement of the guide <b>11</b>, the tray <b>5</b> supported by the guide <b>11</b> moves upward. Owing to the upward movement of the tray <b>5</b>, the drum <b>12</b> is spaced apart from the transfer belt <b>18</b>. Further, the bearing portions <b>51</b> are spaced apart from the mounting portions <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which the door <b>2</b> is opened, and the tray <b>5</b> in the main body <b>1</b> is pulled out, whereby the support member <b>7</b> is moved upward to the retracted position RP. The support member <b>7</b> is automatically moved, in association with the movement of the tray <b>5</b> at the time when the user pulls out the tray <b>5</b>, from the exposure position LP to the retracted position RP by the interlocking member (described later). The retracted position RP is a position retracted from the exposure position LP. The retracted position RP is a position at which the support member <b>7</b> (light emitting devices <b>9</b>) does not interfere with the movement of the tray <b>5</b>, which is supporting the cartridges <b>8</b>. Besides, the retracted position RP is a position at which the support member <b>7</b> (light emitting devices <b>9</b>) does not collide with the moving tray <b>5</b> and the moving cartridges <b>8</b>, which are moving while being supported by the tray <b>5</b>. The support member <b>7</b> is retracted from a moving path MP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>) in which the tray <b>5</b> moves between the outside position OP and the inside position IP. As the support member <b>7</b> moves to the retracted position RP, the multiple light emitting devices <b>9</b> may be simultaneously retracted. When the support member <b>7</b> locates at the retracted positions RP, the light emitting devices <b>9</b> exist within the main body <b>1</b>. At the retracted position RP, the support member <b>7</b> allows the movement of the tray <b>5</b> between the outside position OP and the inside position IP. Specifically, the support member <b>7</b> does not interfere with the movement of the tray <b>5</b>. With this, while leaving the support member <b>7</b> in the main body <b>1</b>, the tray <b>5</b> may be pulled out from the main body <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a view illustrating the tray <b>5</b>, which is pulled out from the inside position IP to the outside position OP. When the tray <b>5</b> locates at the outside position OP, the upward of all the cartridges <b>8</b> supported by the tray <b>5</b> is opened. Then, the respective cartridges <b>8</b> may be removed upward (arrows of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Further, all the cartridges <b>8</b> may be supported from the upward by the tray <b>5</b>. Specifically, the mounting and removing of the cartridges <b>8</b> with respect to the tray <b>5</b> may be performed from a vertical direction. Note that, according to this embodiment, when the cartridge <b>8</b>Bk, which locates most downstream in the pullout direction X (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), is mounted and removed with respect to the tray <b>5</b>, the entire length of the tray <b>5</b> may not locate at the outside position OP. Even in such cases, the tray <b>5</b> is pulled out toward the outside direction than a case where the cartridge <b>8</b>Bk locates at the image formation position (IP). Consequently, the cartridge <b>8</b>Bk is pulled out more, than in a case of locating at the image formation position, at a front forward of the main body <b>1</b>, it is easy for the user to replace the cartridge <b>8</b>Bk. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a perspective view of the main body <b>1</b> in a state in which the door <b>2</b> is opened and the tray <b>5</b> is pulled out. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates the same state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this state, the cartridges <b>8</b> are removable to the tray <b>5</b>. The tray <b>5</b> moves in a horizontal direction with respect to an installation surface of the main body <b>1</b> (not shown). However, in this embodiment, it is not limited to this, and the tray <b>5</b> may move, for example, obliquely upward with respect to the installation surface (not shown), or linearly and obliquely downward. The tray <b>5</b> moves linearly in a direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the cartridges <b>8</b> supported by the tray <b>5</b> (accommodated, mounted). The longitudinal direction of the cartridges <b>8</b> refers to the longitudinal direction of the photosensitive drum <b>12</b>, or the longitudinal direction of the developing roller <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Operation of mounting the cartridges <b>8</b> to the main body <b>1</b> is performed by the reverse procedure with the operation of removing the cartridges <b>8</b>. Specifically, the user pulls out the tray <b>5</b> to the outside position OP, and the cartridges <b>8</b> is mounted on the tray <b>5</b> (supported). The tray <b>5</b> having mounted the cartridges <b>8</b> thereon is pushed in the main body <b>1</b>. In this case, the support member <b>7</b> automatically moves, in association with the movement of the tray <b>5</b> when the user pushes in the tray <b>5</b>, from the retracted position RP to the exposure position LP by the interlocking member <b>130</b> described later. The exposure position LP locates at an adjacent position to the drum so that the light emitting devices <b>9</b> face the drums <b>12</b>, and are enabled to expose the drum <b>12</b> in accordance with an image information. Then, in association with the closing operation of the door <b>2</b> performed by the user, the guide <b>11</b> is pushed down to left downward from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> via the link <b>29</b>. The tray <b>5</b> moves downward together with the guide <b>11</b>. With this operation, the cartridges <b>8</b> supported by the tray <b>5</b> are mounted to the mounting portions <b>50</b> in the main body <b>1</b>. Then, the drum <b>12</b> is brought into contact with the transfer belt <b>18</b>. This state is a state in which the cartridges <b>8</b> locate at the image formation positions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The image formation positions are positions at which the cartridges <b>8</b> contribute to form an image on the sheet (recording medium) <b>14</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">1) Structure of Interlocking Member</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The image forming apparatus according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention includes an interlocking member <b>130</b>, which moves, in association with the pull-out or push-in operation of the tray <b>5</b> performed by the user, the support member <b>7</b> between the exposure position LP and the retracted position RP. In this case, in order to expose the drums <b>12</b> by the luminescence of the multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> of the light emitting devices <b>9</b> at the exposure position LP, the light emitting devices <b>9</b> are arranged adjacently to the drums <b>12</b> so as face thereto. The multiple light emitting portions <b>6</b> are arranged in line in the longitudinal direction of the light emitting devices <b>9</b>. At the retracted position RP, the support member <b>7</b> is retracted from the moving path MP in which the tray <b>5</b> moves between the outside position OP and the inside position IP. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate positional relations, under the door <b>2</b> closing state, among the support member <b>7</b>, the guide <b>11</b>, and the tray <b>5</b>.

The projection portion <b>34</b> is provided to the tray <b>5</b>. The engagement groove portion <b>35</b> is formed in the support member <b>7</b>. The projection portion (third engage portion) <b>31</b> is provided to the support member <b>7</b>. The groove portion <b>32</b> is formed in the main body <b>1</b>. The projection portion <b>34</b> is a substantially rectangular member extending from the side plate <b>5</b><i>b </i>(<b>5</b><i>a</i>) upwardly. The groove portion <b>35</b> is a generally substantially rectangular groove hole formed in a side plate <b>7</b><i>b </i>(<b>7</b><i>a</i>) and extending vertical direction of the support member <b>7</b>. The projection portion <b>34</b> engages with the groove portion <b>35</b> so as to be slidable in the groove portion <b>35</b>. The groove portion <b>35</b> engages with the projection portion <b>34</b>, and supports the support member <b>7</b> with respect to the tray <b>5</b> so as to be movable along a straight line direction connecting the light emitting device <b>9</b> and the center of the drum <b>12</b>. In this case, the straight line direction connecting the light emitting portions <b>6</b> and the center of the drum <b>12</b> is a direction represented by arrows VL (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Specifically, the light emitting devices <b>9</b> move in parallel and linearly to the axis line of the drum <b>12</b>. With this structure, compared to a case in which the light emitting device <b>9</b> is rotated about a fulcrum as a center, according to this embodiment, even if the space is smaller, the light emitting devices <b>9</b> (light emitting portions <b>6</b>) may be moved between the exposure position LP and the retracted position RP. The projection portions <b>31</b> are inserted into the groove portions <b>32</b>, and are slidingly movable within the groove portions <b>32</b>. The projection portions <b>31</b> slide within the groove portions <b>32</b>. With this operation, the support member <b>7</b> is movable with respect to the main body <b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in an oblique direction Q with respect to the pullout direction X. Specifically, through the engagement of the projection portions <b>31</b> and the groove portions <b>32</b>, the support member <b>7</b> is caused to move linearly with respect to the movement direction of the tray (pullout direction X and push-in direction Y) with respect to the main body <b>1</b> along the oblique direction Q. In a state in which the door <b>2</b> is closed (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>), the extension springs (elastic member, urging member) <b>30</b> are coupled between the rail bosses <b>33</b> provided to the projection portions <b>31</b> and the guide <b>11</b>. In the support member <b>7</b>, the light emitting devices <b>9</b> are urged (pulled) to the exposure position LP by the elastic force of the spring <b>30</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates a state in which the door <b>2</b> (openable and closable member) is opened, and is the same state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, if the door <b>2</b> is opened, in association with the movement of the guide <b>11</b> to upward, the tray <b>5</b> moves upward. With this operation, the support member <b>7</b> also moves upward. In this state, if the user pulls out the tray <b>5</b>, the support member <b>7</b> is pulled out in the pullout direction X through the engagement of the projection portions <b>34</b> of the tray <b>5</b> and the groove portions <b>35</b> of the support member <b>7</b>. In this case, the support member <b>7</b> is regulated so as to movable in a direction only indicated by arrows Q (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) with respect to the main body <b>1</b>, through the engagement of the projection portions <b>31</b> and the groove portions <b>32</b>. Therefore, the support member <b>7</b> is moved linearly in the direction indicated by the arrows Q with respect to the main body <b>1</b> (obliquely upward with respect to pullout direction X of tray <b>5</b>). Further, the support member <b>7</b> is regulated so as to be movable linearly and upward of a vertical direction only with respect to the tray <b>5</b> by the projection portions <b>34</b> and the groove portions <b>35</b> (direction indicated by arrows VL of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). With this structure, the light emitting devices <b>9</b> are retracted linearly upward in the vertical direction (direction indicated by arrows VL) with respect to the drums <b>12</b> of the cartridges <b>8</b>. The support member <b>7</b> moves linearly from the exposure position LP to the retracted position RP. Besides, each of the groove portions <b>35</b> are provided with rotatable roller members (friction reducing members) <b>36</b>. When the tray <b>5</b> moves, a part of the tray <b>5</b> is brought into contact with the roller members <b>36</b> so that the roller members <b>36</b> rotate. With this rotation, friction between the projection portions <b>34</b> and the groove portions <b>35</b> is reduced. Owing to this, the support member <b>7</b> smoothly moves in the up-down direction with respect to the tray <b>5</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates a state in which the support member <b>7</b> is moved up to the retracted position RP, and is the same state as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The retracted position RP locates at the downstream and upward of the exposure position LP in the pullout direction X in which the tray <b>5</b> moves from the inside position IP to the outside position OP. In this state, tops <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the projection portions <b>34</b> support the bottom portion <b>7</b><i>c </i>of the support member <b>7</b>. With this structure, the support member <b>7</b> is regulated by the springs <b>30</b> so as not to return from the retracted position RP to the exposure position LP.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Supporting bosses <b>37</b> are provided to the main body <b>1</b> for retaining (supporting) the support member <b>7</b> at the retracted position RP.

When the support member <b>7</b> locates at the exposure position LP, the bosses <b>37</b> are urged by the elastic force of the boss springs <b>38</b> so as to abut against the side plate <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the support member <b>7</b>. Heights of upper surfaces <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the bosses <b>37</b> are set so as to be lower than the heights of the tops <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the projection portions <b>34</b>. Thus, if the bottom portion <b>7</b><i>c </i>of the support member <b>7</b> is supported by the tops <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the projection portions <b>34</b>, the support member <b>7</b> is delivered to the bosses <b>37</b> from the projection portions <b>34</b>. Specifically, when the tray <b>5</b> is pulled out from a state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> toward the pullout direction X, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the support member <b>7</b> is supported (retained) by the bosses <b>37</b> at the retracted position RP. Further, in a state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the bosses <b>37</b> are regulated by the projection portions <b>34</b> their movements toward the inside of the main body. This is to prevent the movement of the support member <b>7</b> from being obstructed by the bosses <b>37</b> being caught by the groove portions <b>35</b>. Further, when the tray <b>5</b> is pulled out further from a state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> toward the pullout direction X, the engagement between the bosses <b>37</b> and the projection portions <b>34</b> is released. The bosses <b>37</b> protrude by the elastic forces of the springs <b>38</b> toward the inside of the main body, to thereby support (retain) the support member <b>7</b> at the retracted position RP. With this structure, the support member <b>7</b> retracts from the movement path MP in which the tray <b>5</b> moves between the outside position OP and the inside position IP. Consequently, the tray <b>5</b> becomes possible to move to the outside position OP.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When mounting the cartridges <b>8</b> onto the main body <b>1</b>, the user pushes in the tray <b>5</b> toward a push-in direction Y, which is an opposite direction to the pullout direction X. In association with the push-in operation, first, the support member <b>7</b>, which locates at the retracted position RP, is delivered from the upper surfaces <b>37</b><i>a </i>of the bosses <b>37</b> to the tops <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the projection portions <b>34</b>. In this case, the bottom portion <b>7</b><i>c </i>of the support member <b>7</b> before the delivery is lower than the tops <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the projection portions <b>34</b>. Therefore, the bottom portion <b>7</b><i>c </i>of the support member <b>7</b> is required to be elevated to the height of the tops <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the projection portions <b>34</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, first slant surfaces <b>60</b> are provided on the projection portions <b>34</b>. Further, provided to the support member <b>7</b> is a support slant surface <b>61</b>. When the tray <b>5</b> pushes in toward the push-in direction (mounting direction) Y, the first slant surfaces <b>60</b> and the support slant surface <b>61</b> are engaged with each other. With this engagement, the support member <b>7</b> is raised. The support member <b>7</b> is raised by a height difference between the top surfaces <b>37</b> of the bosses <b>37</b> and the tops <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the projection portions <b>34</b>. Thus, the support member <b>7</b> is delivered from the bosses <b>37</b> to the projection portions <b>34</b>. Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the projection portions <b>34</b> are provided with second slant surfaces <b>62</b>, and the support bosses <b>37</b> are provided with boss slant surfaces <b>63</b>. When the tray <b>5</b> is pushes in further from a state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> toward the push-in direction Y, the second slant surfaces <b>62</b> and the boss slant surfaces <b>63</b> are engaged with each other. With this engagement, the bosses <b>37</b> are retracted by the projection portions <b>34</b> toward the outside of the main body <b>1</b>. In addition, when the tray <b>5</b> pushes in from the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> to the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the projection portions <b>34</b> enter into the groove portions <b>35</b>.

In this case, the support member <b>7</b> is regulated, through the engagement of the projection portions <b>31</b> and the groove portions <b>32</b>, so as to be movable only in a direction opposite to the direction indicated by arrows Q (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>) with respect to the main body <b>1</b>. For that reason, the support member <b>7</b> is moved linearly, with respect to the main body <b>1</b>, in the direction opposite to the direction indicated by arrows Q (direction toward obliquely downward with respect to push-in direction Y of the tray <b>5</b>). Further, the support member <b>7</b> is regulated, by the projection portions <b>34</b> and the groove portions <b>35</b>, so as to move linearly, with respect to the tray <b>5</b>, toward the vertical direction and downward only (direction indicated by allows VL of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). With this structure, the light emitting devices <b>9</b> are moved linearly toward the drums <b>12</b> of the cartridges <b>8</b> (direction indicated by arrows VL). The support member <b>7</b> moves upstream and downward of the pullout direction X. Therefore, the support member <b>7</b> linearly moves from the retracted position RP to the exposure position LP. The exposure position LP locates at an adjacent position to the drum so that the light emitting devices <b>9</b> face the drums <b>12</b>, and are enabled to expose the drum <b>12</b> in accordance with an image information. Then, in association with the closing operation of the door <b>2</b> performed by the user, the guide <b>11</b> is pushed down to left downward from the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> via the link <b>29</b>. The tray <b>5</b> moves downward together with the guide <b>11</b>. With this operation, the cartridges <b>8</b> supported by the tray <b>5</b> are mounted to the mounting portions <b>50</b> in the main body <b>1</b>. Then, the drum <b>12</b> is brought into contact with the transfer belt <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).
