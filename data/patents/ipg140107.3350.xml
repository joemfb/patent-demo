<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a power generating apparatus of renewable energy type which transmits rotation energy of a rotor to a generator via a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor and a method of locking the rotor thereof. The power generating apparatus of renewable energy type generates power from renewable energy such as wind, tidal current, ocean current and river current. The power generating apparatus of renewable energy type, for instance, includes a wind turbine generator, a tidal generator, an ocean current generator, a river current generator or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, from a perspective of preserving the environment, it is becoming popular to use a power generating apparatus of renewable energy type such as a wind turbine generator utilizing wind power and a power generating apparatus utilizing tidal current, ocean current or river current. In the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type, the kinetic energy of the wind, tidal current, river current or the like is converted to the rotation energy of the rotor and the rotation energy of the rotor is then converted into electric power by the generator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a general power generating apparatus of renewable energy type, the rotation of the rotor is small compared to the rated rotation speed of the generator and thus, it is common to provide a mechanical step-up gear between the rotor and the generator. By this, the rotation of the rotor is increased to the rated rotation speed of the generator and then the increased rotation is inputted to the generator.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When performing maintenance or fixing the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type, the rotor is fixed (locked) sometimes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For instance, Patent Literature 1 proposes to stop the rotor in a desired rotational position by applying a braking force to the rotor by a brake mechanism and then to lock the rotor with a locking pin in the desired rotational position. Specifically, the rotor is decelerated by the brake mechanism constituted of a brake disk and a brake shoe and the rotational position of the rotor is detected by a position sensor, and once the rotor comes to a standstill at the desired rotational position, the locking pin is automatically inserted into a locking disk.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In recent years, a development of a power generating apparatus of renewable energy type equipped with a hydraulic transmission formed by a hydraulic pump and a hydraulic motor is promoted, instead of a conventional apparatus equipped with the step-up gear, which makes it difficult to reduce the weight and the cost of the apparatus. Such power generating apparatus of renewable energy type is also disclosed in Patent Literatures 2 and 3.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">The locking method disclosed in Patent Literature 1, however, uses the disk brake to stop the rotor at the desired rotational position that allows the locking pin to be inserted. The use of the brake disk in the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type with the hydraulic transmission, causes the following issues.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">In the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type equipped with the step-up gear, the rotation of the rotor, few to several tens of revolutions per minute, is increased by the step-up gear, for instance, about hundred times and then is inputted to the generator. Therefore, by providing the brake mechanism at the rotation shaft between the step-up gear and the generator, the braking force required is about 1/100 of the case where the brake disk is arranged on the main shaft between the hub and the step-up gear.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">In contrast, the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type equipped with the hydraulic transmission, the rotation shaft between the hydraulic motor rotating at high speed (low torque) and the generator is not coupled to the main shaft between the hub and the hydraulic pump. Thus, the braking mechanism is inevitably mounted to the main shaft disposed between the hub and the hydraulic pump, requiring the braking mechanism to increase in size to apply sufficient braking force to the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">Therefore, as described in Patent Literature 1, it requires an enormous braking mechanism to decelerate and stop the rotor at a desired angular position by means of the braking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">In view of the above issues, it is an object of the present invention is to provide a power generating apparatus and a rotor locking method for the apparatus, which is capable of locking the rotor without using a huge braking mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">As one aspect of the present invention, a rotor locking method for a power generating apparatus of renewable energy type comprising: a rotor including a blade, a hub on which the blade is mounted and a main shaft coupled to the hub; a hydraulic pump of variable displacement type driven by rotation of the rotor; a hydraulic motor driven by operating oil whose pressure is increased by the hydraulic pump; and a generator coupled to the hydraulic motor, may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">decelerating the rotor by adjusting a pitch angle of the blade:</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">after the decelerating step, stopping the rotor by applying a braking force by the hydraulic pump to the rotor; and</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">locking the rotor so that the rotor is immovable in a rotation direction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">For locking the rotor, the locking pin may be inserted in the first hole on the rotor side and the second hole on the nacelle side, or other locking members may be inserted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">According to the above rotor locking method, the rotor is decelerated by adjusting the pitch angle of the blade and the rotor is stopped by applying the braking force by the hydraulic pump to the rotor, and then the rotor is finally locked. Therefore, the rotor can be locked without depending on the enormous brake mechanism (the brake disk) which tends to increase in size when being applied to the power generating apparatus of renewable energy equipped with the hydraulic transmission (the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">In the case of locking the rotor by inserting the locking pin in the first hole on the rotor side and the second hole on the nacelle side,</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type may further include: an encoder which detects an angular position of the rotor; and a high pressure oil line which supplies the operating oil from the hydraulic pump to the hydraulic motor, and</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">in the locking step, a locking pin may be inserted in a first hole formed on a rotor side and a second hole formed on side of a nacelle housing the main shaft, and</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">in the stopping step, at least one of a displacement of the hydraulic pump and a pressure of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line may be adjusted based on a detection result of the encoder and the rotor is stopped in such an angular position that the first hole formed on the rotor side matches with the second hole formed on the nacelle side.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">By this, it is possible to stop the rotor at the desired position (where the first hole matches with the second hole) automatically by adjusting at least one of the displacement of the hydraulic pump and the pressure of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line. Therefore, the locking of the rotor can be performed efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">In the case of locking the rotor by inserting the locking pin in the first hole on the rotor side and the second hole on the nacelle side, the rotor locking method may further include the step of:</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">after the stopping step and before the locking step, matching the first hole formed on the rotor side with the second hole formed on the nacelle side by driving the hydraulic pump by pressurized oil supplied to the hydraulic pump and rotating the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">By driving the hydraulic pump by pressurized oil supplied to the hydraulic pump, the rotor can be rotate by any angle and be stopped at such an angular position that the first hole matches with the second hole.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">In the case of driving the hydraulic pump by the pressurized oil and rotating the rotor to match the first hole with the second hole,</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">the power generating apparatus of renewable energy may further include an encoder which detects an angular position of the rotor, and</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">in the matching step, opening and closing of a valve provided in a supply path of supplying the pressurized oil to the hydraulic pump, may be controlled based on a detection result of the encoder so as to match the first hole with the second hole.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">By this, it is possible to automate the operation of rotating the rotor using the hydraulic pump and matching the first hole with the second hole. Thus, the locking of the rotor can be performed efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0034">In the above rotor locking method,</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0035">the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type may further include: a high pressure oil line which supplies the operating oil from the hydraulic pump to the hydraulic motor; and a low pressure oil line which returns the operating oil from the hydraulic motor to the hydraulic pump,</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0036">the hydraulic pump may include: a cylinder; a piston sliding in the cylinder in response to the rotation of the rotor; a working chamber formed by the cylinder and the piston; a high pressure valve opening and closing a conduit between the working chamber and the high pressure oil line; and a low pressure valve opening and closing a conduit between the working chamber and the low pressure oil line, and</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0037">the rotor method may also include the step of:</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">after the stopping step and before the locking step, temporarily locking the rotor in such a state that the high pressure valve and the low pressure valve are maintained closed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">By maintaining the high pressure valve and the low pressure valve in a closed state, the operating oil is kept in the hydraulic chamber and the piston is immobilized (in a hydraulic locked state), thereby temporarily locking the rotor. Further, when the piston is in the hydraulic locked state, the operating oil leaks to some extend and thus, it is difficult to completely immobilize the rotor. However, this step is extremely useful in temporarily locking the rotor as a temporary measure till the rotor is perfectly locked.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">In the above rotor locking method,</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type may further include a high pressure oil line which supplies the operating oil from the hydraulic pump to the hydraulic motor,</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">to the high pressure oil line, an accumulator may be connected via an accumulator valve, and</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">in the stopping step, at least a displacement of the hydraulic motor may be increased and excess of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line is accumulated in the accumulator by opening the accumulator valve.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">In such a case that the displacement of the hydraulic pump is increased to increase the braking force (the torque) by the hydraulic pump, the discharge amount of the operating oil from the hydraulic pump increases. This can be solved by accumulating the excess of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line into the accumulator so as to absorb the excess of the operation oil (the high pressure oil) by the accumulator. The operating oil having been accumulated in the accumulator may be released later when needed, and the rotation energy of the rotor is not wasted. For instance, the operating oil may be released from the accumulator to assist the rotation of the hydraulic motor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">In the above rotor locking method for the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type,</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type may further include a high pressure oil line which supplies the operating oil from the hydraulic pump to the hydraulic motor,</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">the hydraulic motor may be a variable displacement type, and</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">in the stopping step, at least a displacement of the hydraulic pump may be increased and excess of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line may be absorbed in the hydraulic motor by temporarily increasing a displacement of the hydraulic motor.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">By temporarily increasing a displacement of the hydraulic motor, not only the excess of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line generated by the increased displacement of the hydraulic pump is absorbed by the hydraulic motor but also more electric power is generated in the generator. Therefore, the rotation energy of the rotor is not wasted.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">In the above rotor locking method for the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type,</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type may further include: a high pressure oil line which supplies the operating oil from the hydraulic pump to the hydraulic motor; a low pressure oil line which returns the operating oil from the hydraulic motor to the hydraulic pump; a bypass flow path which connects the high pressure oil line to the low pressure oil line and bypasses the hydraulic motor; and a relief valve which is provided in the bypass flow path, and</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">in the stopping step, at least a displacement of the hydraulic pump may be increased and excess of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line may be released to the low pressure oil line via the bypass flow path and the relief valve.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">By using the bypass flow path and the relief valve, the excess of the operating oil generated by the increase displacement of the hydraulic pump can be released from the high pressure oil line to the low pressure oil line.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">The above power generating apparatus of renewable energy type may be a wind turbine generator which rotates the rotor by wind in a form of renewable energy, input a torque of the rotor to the generator via the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor, and generates electric power in the generator.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">As another aspect of the present invention, a power generating apparatus of renewable energy type, may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">a rotor including a blade, a hub on which the blade is mounted and a main shaft coupled to the hub;</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0059">a generator which is coupled to the hydraulic motor;</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">a pitch drive mechanism which adjusts a pitch angle of the blade to decelerate the rotor;</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">a pump control unit which controls the hydraulic pump to stop the rotor by applying a braking force by the hydraulic pump to the rotor having been decelerated by the pitch drive mechanism; and</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">a locking unit which locks the rotor so that the rotor is immovable in a rotation direction.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">In the above power generating apparatus of renewable energy type, the rotor is decelerated by adjusting the pitch angle of the blade and the rotor is stopped by applying the braking force by the hydraulic pump to the rotor using the pump controller, and then the rotor is finally locked by means of the locking unit, e.g. a locking pin.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">Therefore, the rotor can be locked without depending on the enormous brake mechanism (the brake disk) which tends to increase in size when being applied to the power generating apparatus of renewable energy equipped with the hydraulic transmission (the hydraulic pump and the hydraulic motor).</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0078">By driving the hydraulic pump by the pressurized oil supplied from the pressurized oil source, the rotor can be rotated by an arbitrary degree.

<p id="p-0085" num="0086">For the hydraulic pump having the piston, the hydraulic chamber, the high pressure valve, the low pressure valve and the casing housing those parts, the high pressure valve or the low pressure valve of a compact type may be used, which is designed to open/close or to assist the opening and closing thereof using the pressure difference between the hydraulic chamber and the high pressure oil line or the low pressure oil line. This type of high pressure valve or the low pressure valve housed in the casing, can be opened and closed only by the pressure difference generated by the reciprocating motion of the piston in response to the rotation of the rotor. Therefore, in the case where the hydraulic pump is driven by the pressurized oil source, the pressure difference cannot be used and thus, the opening and closing of the high pressure valve or the low pressure valve cannot be controlled. To solve this, another valve separately from the high pressure valve or the low pressure valve housed in the casing is provided to switch the supply state of the pressurized oil to the hydraulic pump. This allows the hydraulic pump to be driven positively by the pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source. Further, by attaching the valve at the end surface of the casing on the side farther from the hub, it is possible to utilize the space around the end surface of the casing.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0090">the valve may be shared by the at least two of the pistons belonging to each of the groups.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0091">This type of hydraulic pump is typically designed, for the purpose of preventing the pulsation and precisely controlling the displacement, such that a plurality of the pistons reciprocate in different cycles. Further, by providing a plurality of groups of at least two of the pistons having the same phase in the cycle of the reciprocating motion, even when one of the pistons fails, other pistons belonging to the same group as the failed piston can continue operating to achieve the prevention of the pulsation and the precise control of the displacement. In such a case that n pistons have the same phase in the cycle of the reciprocating motion (n is an integer not less than two), a redundancy is n.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0092">Thus, by providing the valve which is shared by the n pistons <b>52</b><sub>l </sub>belonging to the same group having the same phase in the cycle of the reciprocating motion, the valve can open and close in the synchronized timing with the movement of the ring cam and thus, the hydraulic pump can be driven by the pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source. As a result, it is possible to achieve the drive control of the hydraulic pump by the pressurized oil using fewer valves.</p>

Thus, by determining the wave-shaped profile of the ring cam so that the first hole matches with the second hole when at least one of the pistons is positioned at a valley of the concave-convex shape of the ring cam, the rotor can be easily maintained at the above angular position where the first hole matches with the second hole, after the rotor is stopped at the angular position and until the locking pin is inserted.

It is intended, however, that unless particularly specified, dimensions, materials, shape, its relative positions and the like shall be interpreted as illustrative only and not limitative of the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0125">While the present invention is described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0126">In the following embodiments, a wind turbine generator is described in one form of the power generating apparatus of renewable energy type. However, the present invention is not limited to this and is applicable to other types of power generating apparatus of renewable energy type such as a tidal generator, an ocean current generator and a river current generator.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a wind turbine generator <b>1</b> mainly provided with a rotor <b>2</b> rotating upon receiving the wind, a hydraulic transmission <b>4</b> for accelerating the rotation of the rotor <b>2</b>, a generator <b>6</b> for generating electric power and a control unit <b>30</b> for controlling each part of the wind turbine generator <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0129">The control unit <b>30</b> includes a pitch controller <b>32</b> for controlling a pitch drive mechanism <b>40</b> described later, a pump controller <b>34</b> for controlling a hydraulic pump <b>20</b> described later, a motor controller <b>36</b> for controlling a hydraulic motor <b>22</b> described later and an ACC valve controller <b>38</b> for controlling opening/closing of an accumulator valve <b>62</b> (<b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B) described later.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0130">The rotor <b>2</b> is constituted by a blade <b>2</b>A, a hub <b>2</b>B on which the blade <b>2</b>A is mounted, and a main shaft <b>2</b>C coupled to the hub <b>2</b>B. By this, wind power acting on the blade <b>2</b>A rotates the entire rotor <b>2</b> and the rotation of the main shaft <b>2</b>C is inputted to the hydraulic transmission <b>4</b>. The angular position (rotation displacement) of the rotor <b>2</b> is measured by a rotary encoded mounted at the main shaft <b>2</b>C and then used for controlling the control unit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0131">Herein, the main shaft <b>2</b>C of the rotor <b>2</b> is housed in a nacelle <b>8</b> supported rotatably by a tower <b>7</b>. The nacelle <b>8</b> supports the main shaft <b>2</b>C via a main shaft bearing <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0132">The hub <b>2</b>B houses the pitch drive mechanism <b>40</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The pitch drive mechanism <b>40</b> is formed by a hydraulic cylinder <b>42</b>, a servo valve <b>44</b>, a hydraulic power source <b>46</b> and an accumulator <b>48</b>. The servo valve <b>44</b> regulates, under control of the pitch controller <b>32</b>, a supply of a high pressure oil generated in the hydraulic power source <b>46</b> and a supply of a high pressure oil stored in the accumulator <b>48</b> to the hydraulic cylinder <b>42</b> so as to set the pitch angle of the blade <b>4</b> to a desired value.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the pitch drive mechanism <b>40</b> equipped with the hydraulic cylinder <b>42</b>. However, this is not limitative and an actuator having an arbitrary configuration may be used instead of the hydraulic cylinder <b>42</b> to rotate the blade <b>2</b>A may around its axial line and to adjust the pitch angle. For instance, an electric motor (a servo motor) may be used as the actuator for adjusting the pitch angle. In such case, a control signal from the pitch controller <b>32</b> may be inputted to the electric motor and under the control of the pitch controller <b>32</b>, the pitch angle of the blade <b>2</b>A may be adjusted using the electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0134">The rotor <b>2</b> is fixable by means of the locking pin <b>9</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The locking pin <b>9</b> is inserted in holes formed on the rotor side <b>2</b> and the nacelle side <b>8</b>, respectively, so as to fix the rotor <b>2</b>. The configurations of the locking pin <b>9</b> and the holes where the locking pin <b>9</b> is inserted, are not limited as long as the rotor <b>2</b> can be fixed. For instance, the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0135">In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the hub <b>2</b>B and the main shaft <b>2</b>C are integrally fastened together by a plurality of fastening members <b>5</b> and then fixed to an inner ring of the main shaft bearing <b>3</b>. The hub <b>2</b>B is formed with the first hole <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0136">In contrast, the nacelle <b>8</b> is fixed to an outer ring of the main shaft bearing <b>3</b> at its end. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the end of the nacelle <b>8</b> partially protrudes inward (toward the axial center of the main shaft) to form a convex portion <b>8</b>A. The convex portion <b>8</b>A is formed with the second hole <b>11</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0137">The locking pin is insertable in the first hole <b>10</b> formed in the hub <b>2</b>B and the second hole <b>11</b> formed in the convex portion <b>8</b>A of the nacelle <b>8</b>.

The cylindrical member <b>12</b> is fixed to the convex portion <b>8</b>A. Into an internal thread formed in the cylindrical member <b>12</b>, a bolt penetrating through the cylindrical member <b>12</b> is screwed as the screw member <b>13</b>. A tip of the screw member <b>13</b> is screwed into a rear end of the locking pin <b>9</b>. In this manner, by rotating the screw member <b>13</b>, the locking pin <b>9</b> is free of moving forward and backward.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0138">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, a corner portion <b>14</b> of a tip surface of the locking pin is chamfered as well as a corner portion <b>15</b> of an opening end surface of the first hole <b>10</b> of the hub <b>2</b>B so as to allow the locking pin <b>9</b> to be inserted smoothly. The corner portions <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> may be chamfered by cutting off corners thereof at approximately 45 degrees to form inclined surfaces, or by round-chamfering the corners to round the corners.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates the case where the corner portion <b>15</b> of the opening end surface of the first hole <b>10</b> is chamfered. However, this is not limitative and a corner portion of an opening end surface (the opening end surface on the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) of the convex portion <b>8</b>A of the nacelle which is on a side opposing an insertion direction of the locking pin <b>9</b> may be chamfered as well.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0140">The hydraulic transmission <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, includes the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> of variable displacement type which is driven by rotation of the main shaft <b>2</b>C, the hydraulic motor <b>22</b> of variable displacement type which is connected to the generator <b>6</b>, and a high pressure oil line <b>24</b> and a low pressure oil line <b>26</b> that are arranged between the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> and the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0141">The high pressure line <b>24</b> is arranged between a discharge side of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> and an intake side of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>. The low pressure oil line <b>26</b> is arranged between an intake side of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> and a discharge side of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>. The operating oil (high pressure oil) having been discharged from the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> enters the hydraulic motor <b>22</b> via the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> and drives the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>. The operating oil (low pressure oil) having worked in the hydraulic motor <b>22</b> enters the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> via the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> and then is pressurized in the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>. Then the pressurized operating oil flows into the hydraulic motor <b>22</b> again via the high pressure oil line <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0142">To the high pressure oil line <b>24</b>, an accumulator <b>60</b> (<b>60</b>A, <b>60</b>B) is connected via an accumulator valve <b>62</b> (<b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B). The accumulator is, for instance, of a bladder type in which gas and the operating oil are separated by a deformable bag (a bladder), or of a piston type. In the accumulator <b>60</b>, the high pressure operating oil flows into the accumulator <b>60</b> during storing the pressure and the bladder deforms or the piston pushes to compress the gas. Meanwhile, during releasing the pressure, the compressed gas expands or high pressure gas is introduced from outside to push the bladder or the piston so that the operating oil is pushed out of the accumulator <b>60</b>. The opening and closing of the accumulator valve <b>62</b> is controlled by the ACC valve controller <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0143">In the high pressure oil line <b>24</b>, a pressure sensor <b>28</b> for measuring the pressure of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> and an accumulator <b>63</b> for preventing pulsation (pressure fluctuation of the operating oil) are provided.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0144">To the low pressure oil line <b>26</b>, an oil filter <b>66</b> for removing impurities in the operating oil, and an oil cooler <b>68</b> for cooling the operating oil <b>68</b>. Further, an oil tank <b>80</b> is connected to the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> via a replenishment line <b>82</b> and a return line <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0145">In the oil tank <b>80</b>, operating oil for replenishment is stored. The operating oil stored in the oil tank <b>80</b> is pumped by a boost pump <b>84</b> arranged in the replenishment line <b>82</b> and then supplied to the low pressure oil line <b>26</b>. In this process, the operating oil is filtered by the oil filter <b>86</b> arranged in the replenishment line <b>82</b> to remove impurities before being supplied to the low pressure oil line <b>26</b>. In this manner, by replenishing the operating oil in the low pressure oil line <b>26</b>, even when there is leaking of the operating oil, the amount of the operating oil circulating in the hydraulic transmission <b>4</b> can be maintained. In the return line <b>88</b> between the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> and the oil tank <b>80</b>, a relief valve <b>89</b> is provided to maintain the pressure in the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> near a set pressure of the relief valve <b>89</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0146">Between the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> and the low pressure oil line <b>26</b>, a bypass flow path <b>70</b> is provided to bypass the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>. In the bypass flow path <b>70</b>, a relief valve <b>72</b> is provided to maintain the pressure of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> not greater than the set pressure. Once the pressure of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> increase to the set pressure of the relief valve <b>72</b>, the relief valve <b>72</b> automatically opens to release the high pressure oil to the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> through the bypass flow path <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0147">The hydraulic pump <b>20</b> and the hydraulic motor <b>22</b> are variable displacement types which are capable adjusting their displacements. The displacements are controlled by the pump controller <b>34</b> and the motor controller <b>36</b>, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0148" num="0149">From the perspective of operating the piston smoothly along the cam curve of the cam <b>54</b>, the piston <b>52</b> may be formed by a piston body <b>52</b>A slidable in the cylinder <b>50</b> and one of a piston roller and a piston shoe which is attached to the piston body <b>52</b>A and which engages with the cam curve of the cam <b>54</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the case where the piston <b>52</b> is formed by the piston body <b>52</b>A and the piston roller <b>52</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0150">The cam <b>54</b> is mounted to the outer periphery of the main shaft <b>2</b>C via a cam mount <b>77</b>. From the perspective of achieving high torque by causing each piston <b>52</b> of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to move up and down for each rotation of the main shaft <b>2</b>C, the cam <b>54</b> may be a ring cam having a wave-shaped profile of a concave-convex shape. The wave-shaped profile of the ring cam includes a plurality of convex portions <b>54</b>A and concave portions <b>54</b>B alternately arranged around the main shaft <b>2</b>C. The wave-shaped profile of the ring cam <b>54</b> is determined so that the first hole <b>10</b> on the rotor side matches with the second hole <b>11</b> on the nacelle side when at least one of the pistons <b>52</b> is positioned at a valley of the concave-convex shape of the ring cam <b>54</b> (the deepest point of the convex portion <b>54</b>A). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a state in which a middle one of three pistons <b>52</b> is at the valley of the concave-convex shape of the ring cam <b>54</b>.

<p id="p-0150" num="0151">The high pressure valve <b>56</b> is provided in a high pressure conduit <b>57</b> between each hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> and the high pressure oil line <b>24</b>.

By this, the high pressure oil is discharged, during the pump stroke, from the active chamber to the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> via the high pressure valve <b>56</b> and the low pressure oil is supplied, during the intake stroke, from the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> to the active chamber via the low pressure valve <b>58</b>. In contrast, for the hydraulic chambers (non-active chambers) other than the active chamber, the pump controller <b>34</b>, the pump controller <b>34</b> maintains the high pressure valve <b>56</b> closed and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> open during a cycle of the piston <b>52</b> moving from the bottom dead center to the top dead center and returning to the bottom dead center. Thus, the high pressure oil is not discharged from the non-active chambers to the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> without contributing to pressurizing the operating oil.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0154">Herein, both the high pressure valve <b>56</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> are controlled by the pump controller <b>34</b> to adjust opening and closing thereof. However, this is not limitative and the operating oil flowing toward the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> alone may be allowed by a check valve which functions as the high pressure valve <b>56</b>. In such case, while the piston <b>52</b> of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> moves from the bottom dead center to the top dead center, the operating oil in the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> is pressurized and the pressure in the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> exceeds the pressure in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b>, thereby causing the high pressure valve <b>56</b> to open automatically. Therefore, there is no need to actively control the high pressure valve <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0155">Next, a rotor locking method for the wind turbine generator <b>1</b> regarding the embodiment is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0156">In the embodiment, ultimately the rotor <b>2</b> is locked by inserting the locking pin <b>9</b> in the first hole <b>10</b> on the rotor side and the second hole <b>11</b> on the nacelle side. This requires, however, the first hole <b>10</b> and the second hole <b>11</b> to be matched beforehand. Thus, the pitch controller <b>32</b> controls the pitch drive mechanism <b>40</b> to adjust the pitch angle of the blade <b>2</b>A, hence decelerating the rotor <b>2</b>. Then, the pump controller <b>34</b> controls the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to apply the braking force by the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to the rotor <b>2</b>, hence stopping the rotor at the desired angular position. The &#x201c;desired angular position&#x201d; herein indicates such an angular position of the rotor <b>2</b> that the first hole <b>10</b> matches with the second hole <b>11</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0161">Further, the pump controller <b>34</b> obtains a pressure P<sub>H </sub>of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> using the pressure sensor <b>28</b> (step S<b>6</b>).

In the process, the displacement D<sub>P </sub>of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> may be calculated using a formula (2) below.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0162">Next, the pump controller <b>34</b> adjusts the number of active chambers of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> in accordance to a formula (3) below so as to achieve the displacement D<sub>P </sub>of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> (step S<b>10</b>).</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0163">In the formula (3), m is the number of concave-convex of the cam <b>54</b>, Vp is a total displacement of all the cylinders <b>50</b>, and Fdp is a ratio of the active chamber to all the hydraulic chambers <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0164">Next, the process advances to a step S<b>12</b> to determine whether or not the rotor <b>2</b> is stopped. In the process, the state of the rotor <b>2</b> may be determined based on a detected angular position of the rotor <b>2</b> detected by the rotary encoder <b>29</b>. If the rotor <b>2</b> is not stopped (NO in the step S<b>12</b>), the process returns to the step S<b>2</b> to repeat controlling of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>. On the other hand, if the rotor <b>2</b> is stopped (YES in the step S<b>12</b>), the process transfers to a locking operation of the rotor <b>2</b> by the locking pin <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0165">Until the rotor <b>2</b> is completely by the locking pin <b>9</b>, in such a state the high pressure valve <b>56</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> are maintained closed, the operating oil is kept in the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b>, the piston <b>52</b> being immobilized (in a hydraulic locked state), the rotor being temporarily locked. By this, it is possible to efficiently perform insertion of the locking pin <b>9</b> in the first hole <b>10</b> and the second hole <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0166">By changing the displacement D<sub>P </sub>of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to stop the rotor <b>2</b> at the desired angular position, an amount of the operating oil discharged from the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>, Q<sub>P </sub>(=the displacement D<sub>P</sub>&#xd7; the rotation speed n<sub>P </sub>of the hydraulic motor <b>20</b>) changes as well. This causes the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> to be over-supplied or under-supplied. Thus, the opening and closing of the accumulator valve <b>62</b> (<b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B) may be controlled by the ACC valve controller <b>38</b> or the displacement D<sub>M </sub>of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b> may be controlled by the motor controller <b>36</b> so as to absorb excess or supply deficiency of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0167">For instance, in such a case that the displacement D<sub>P </sub>is increased in the step S<b>8</b> to increase the braking force (the torque) by the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>, the discharge amount Q<sub>P </sub>of the operating oil from the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> increases, thereby generating the excess of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b>. To solve that, the accumulator valve <b>62</b> (<b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B) is opened by the ACC valve controller <b>38</b> to feed the operating oil from the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> to the accumulator <b>60</b> (<b>60</b>A, <b>60</b>B) and then, the accumulator valve <b>62</b> (<b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B) is closed to accumulate the excess of the operating oil in the accumulator <b>60</b> (<b>60</b>A, <b>60</b>B). The operating oil having been accumulated in the accumulator <b>60</b> may be released later when needed, by opening the accumulator valve <b>62</b> (<b>62</b>A, <b>62</b>B) by means of the ACC valve controller <b>38</b>. For instance, the operating oil may be released from the accumulator <b>60</b> (<b>60</b>A, <b>60</b>B) to assist the rotation of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0168">Alternatively, the excess of the operating oil generated by the increased displacement D<sub>P </sub>of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>, may be absorbed by increasing the displacement D<sub>M </sub>of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>. In such case, an amount of increase in the displacement of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>, &#x394;D<sub>M </sub>may be determined in accordance to a formula (4) below.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0169">In the formula (4), Q<sub>EXCESS </sub>is the excess amount of the operating oil and n<sub>G </sub>is the rotation speed of the generator <b>6</b> (i.e. the rotation speed of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>).

<p id="p-0169" num="0170">Alternatively, the excess of the operating oil generated by the increased displacement D<sub>P </sub>of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> may be released to the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> via the bypass flow path <b>70</b> by opening the relief valve <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0171">When dealing with the excess of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b>, it is a priority to accumulate the excess of the operating oil in the accumulator <b>60</b>. And once the accumulator <b>60</b> is filled with the operating oil, the displacement D<sub>M </sub>of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b> is increased. Only when the excess of the operating oil cannot be solved by increasing the displacement D<sub>M</sub>, the relief valve <b>72</b> may be opened. The accumulation of the operating oil is most effective as the operating oil accumulated in the accumulator <b>60</b> can be used later when needed and increasing of the displacement D<sub>M </sub>is also effective as it leads to more power generation. On the other hand, opening of the relief valve <b>72</b> does not help the energy to be effectively used. Further, opening of the relief valve raises the temperature of the operating oil when the operating oil passes through the relief valve. As a result, the temperature of the operating oil needs to be adjusted. In view of these, it is preferable to accumulate the operating oil in the accumulator <b>60</b> and to increase the displacement D<sub>M </sub>of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b> with priority.</p>

<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0174" num="0175">A wind turbine generator regarding a second embodiment is now explained. The wind turbine generator of the second embodiment is substantially the same as the wind turbine generator <b>1</b> of the first embodiment except that there is an additional valve is provided to cause the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to carry out the motoring operation. Therefore, mainly the different configurations are explained and the components already described in the first embodiment are indicated with corresponding numbers and are not further explained.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a configuration example of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> having an additional valve for motoring operation. In the second embodiment, the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> is configured such that the cylinder <b>50</b>, the piston <b>52</b>, the hydraulic chamber <b>52</b>, the high pressure valve <b>56</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> are housed in a casing <b>90</b>. The high pressure valve <b>56</b> is, however, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The casing <b>90</b> is constituted by an end plate <b>90</b>A forming an end surface on a side closer to the hub <b>2</b>B of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>, an end plate <b>90</b>B forming an end surface on a side farther from the hub <b>2</b>B and a cylindrical wall <b>90</b>C arranged between the end plates (<b>90</b>A, <b>90</b>B).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0177">The hydraulic pump <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is provided with multiple arrays of the ring cams <b>54</b> in a longitudinal direction of the main shaft <b>2</b>C, and corresponding pistons <b>52</b> and hydraulic chambers <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0178">The end plate <b>90</b> on the side farther from the hub <b>2</b>B is formed with a through-hole <b>91</b>. The through-hole constitutes a part of a supply path <b>92</b> for supplying the pressurized oil from an external pressurized oil source to the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> (i.e. the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b>). The pressurized oil is supplied from the supply path <b>92</b> to the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> corresponding to the ring cam (a rear-most ring cam) disposed at the side farthest from the hub <b>2</b>B among the multiple arrays of the ring cams <b>54</b>. In this manner, the pressurized oil is supplied to the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> (the first working chamber from the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) corresponding to the rear-most ring cam <b>53</b> from the supply path including the through-hole <b>91</b> formed in the end plate <b>90</b> on the side farther from the hub <b>2</b>B. This is because, the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> is disposed at the farther end of the main shaft <b>2</b>C from the hub <b>2</b>B and it is easy to form the supply path <b>92</b> by utilizing the space around the end plate <b>90</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0179">In the supply path <b>92</b>, a solenoid valve <b>93</b> of a normally-closed type, and a check valve <b>94</b> which allows only the flow of the pressurized oil flowing toward the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> from the pressurized oil source. By exciting and opening the solenoid valve <b>93</b>, the pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source flows through the check valve <b>94</b> and the through-hole <b>91</b> to the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> in this order. Next, the pressurized oil pushes down the piston <b>52</b> to rotate the ring cam <b>54</b> and then is discharged to the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> via the low pressure valve <b>58</b> and the low pressure conduit <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0180">From the perspective of utilizing the space around the end plate <b>90</b>B, the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the check valve <b>94</b> may be attached to an outer surface of the end plate <b>90</b>B on the side farther from the hub <b>2</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0181">Further, the opening and closing of the solenoid valve <b>93</b> is controlled by a valve controller <b>39</b> and the opening and closing of the low pressure valve <b>58</b> is controlled by the pump controller <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The timings of opening and closing the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> are controlled in a synchronized timing with a cycle of a reciprocating motion of the piston <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0182"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a chart showing the opening/closing timings of the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0183">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the solenoid valve <b>93</b> is open and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> is closed while the piston <b>52</b> moves from the top dead center (TDC) to the bottom dead center (BDC). By this, the pressurized oil is supplied to the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> from the pressurized oil source and the piston <b>52</b> is pushed down by the pressurized oil, causing the ring cam <b>54</b> to rotate (the motor stroke).</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0184">On the other, while the piston moves from BDC to TDC, the solenoid valve <b>93</b> is closed and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> is opened. By this, the pressurized oil having pushed down the piston <b>52</b> in the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> is supplied to the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> via the low pressure valve <b>58</b> and the low pressure conduit <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0185">The pressurized oil used for causing the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to carry out the motoring operation, may be the operating oil circulating in the hydraulic transmission <b>4</b>. In such a case that the pressurized oil supplied to the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> during the motoring operation, is the operating oil circulating in the hydraulic transmission <b>4</b>, the hydraulic transmission <b>4</b> is not adversely affected by this.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a hydraulic circuit for causing the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to carry out the motoring operation using the operating oil circulating in the hydraulic transmission <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0187">In the hydraulic circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the supply path <b>92</b> is arranged between the oil tank <b>80</b> storing the low pressure oil and the hydraulic chambers <b>53</b><sub>l </sub>and <b>53</b><sub>k</sub>. In the supply path <b>92</b> on an upstream side of the solenoid valve <b>93</b>, a pump <b>95</b> as the pressurized oil source is provided. The operating oil pumped by the pump <b>85</b> from the oil tank <b>80</b> is supplied as the pressurized oil to the hydraulic chambers <b>53</b><sub>l </sub>and <b>53</b><sub>k </sub>via the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the check valve <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0188">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in addition to the boost pump <b>84</b> for pumping up the operating oil from the oil tank <b>80</b> and supplying the operating oil to the low pressure oil line <b>26</b> via the replenishment line <b>82</b>, the pump <b>95</b> is also provided as the pressurized oil source. However, this is not limitative and the boost pump <b>84</b> may also function as the pressurized oil source.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0189">For the purpose of preventing the pulsation and precisely controlling the displacement D<sub>P</sub>, the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> is typically designed such that a plurality of the pistons <b>52</b> reciprocate in different cycles. Further, the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> is usually designed by providing a plurality of groups of at least two pistons <b>52</b> that have the same phase in the cycle of the reciprocating motion in order to prevent the pulsation and to maintain the precise control of the displacement. In this manner, even when one of the pistons <b>52</b> fails, other pistons <b>52</b> belonging to the same group as the failed piston <b>52</b> can continue operating. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the shape of the ring cam <b>54</b> is determined so that the piston <b>52</b><sub>l </sub>reciprocates with the same phase as the piston <b>52</b><sub>k </sub>disposed on the other side of the piston <b>52</b><sub>l</sub>. In such case, with two pistons <b>52</b><sub>l </sub>and <b>52</b><sub>k </sub>having the same phase in the cycle of the reciprocating motion, a redundancy is two.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0190">Further, the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the check valve <b>94</b> are shared by the two pistons <b>52</b><sub>l </sub>and <b>52</b><sub>k </sub>belonging to the same group. In the synchronized timing with the movement of the ring cam <b>54</b>, the opening/closing of the solenoid valve <b>93</b> is controlled so as to achieve the motoring operation of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>. By sharing the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the check valve <b>94</b> between the two pistons <b>52</b><sub>l </sub>and <b>52</b><sub>k</sub>, the number of the valves (<b>93</b>, <b>94</b>) can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows only the supply path <b>92</b> arranged between the hydraulic chambers <b>53</b><sub>l </sub>and <b>53</b><sub>k</sub>, but the supply path <b>92</b> is also connected to other hydraulic chambers <b>53</b> in reality. For instance, the supply path <b>92</b> may be connected to j hydraulic chambers <b>53</b> among all the hydraulic chambers <b>53</b><sub>i </sub>(i=1 to m) corresponding to the rear-most ring cam <b>54</b>. If the redundancy is n, there are j/n kinds of cycles in the pistons of j hydraulic chambers <b>53</b>. More specifically, there are j/n sets of pistons <b>52</b> that reciprocate in different cycles and thus, the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the check valve <b>94</b> are provided for each set of the j/n sets of the pistons <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0192">Next, the rotor locking method for the wind turbine generator in relation to the second embodiment is explained.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0193">In the second embodiment, the pitch controller <b>32</b> controls the pitch drive mechanism <b>40</b> to adjust the pitch angle of the blade <b>2</b>A, hence decelerating the rotor <b>2</b>. Then, the pump controller <b>34</b> controls the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to apply the braking force by the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to the rotor <b>2</b>, hence stopping the rotor at the desired angular position. The &#x201c;desired angular position&#x201d; herein indicates such an angular position of the rotor <b>2</b> that the first hole <b>10</b> matches with the second hole <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0194">However, there may be a case where it is difficult to stop the rotor <b>2</b> with high precision at the desired angular position by adjusting the braking force by the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>, or a case where, after stopping the rotor <b>2</b> at the desired angular position, the rotor <b>2</b> still moves, causing misalignment afterward between the first hole <b>10</b> and the second hole <b>11</b>. Therefore, in the second embodiment, after stopping the rotor <b>2</b> by applying the braking force by the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>, the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> is driven by the pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source (the pump <b>95</b>) to rotate the rotor <b>2</b> to the desired angular position.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart showing a process of stopping the rotor <b>2</b> at the desired angular position. The steps S<b>2</b> through S<b>12</b> are the same as those explained in the first embodiment in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and thus, are not further explained.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0196">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, after the rotor <b>2</b> is stopped in accordance to the steps S<b>2</b> through S<b>12</b>, a detection result of measuring the angular position (rotation displacement) of the rotor <b>2</b> using the rotary encoder <b>29</b> is obtained (step S<b>14</b>). Then, based on the detection result of the rotary encoder <b>29</b>, it is determined whether or not the first hole <b>10</b> on the rotor side matches with the second hole <b>11</b> on the nacelle side, i.e. whether or not the rotor <b>2</b> is stopped at the desired angular position (step S<b>16</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0197">If it is determined that the rotor <b>2</b> is stopped at the desired angular position (determined as YES in the step S<b>16</b>), the process advances to the insertion of the locking pin <b>9</b> without performing the driving of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> by the pressurized oil. In the process, after the rotor <b>2</b> is temporarily locked at the desired angular position while maintaining the high pressure valve <b>56</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> in a closed state, the locking pin <b>9</b> may be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0198">On the other hand, if it is determined that the rotor <b>2</b> is not stopped at the desired angular position (determined as NO in the step S<b>16</b>), the process advances to a step S<b>18</b> to drive the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> by the pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source (the pump <b>95</b>) so as to rotate the rotor <b>2</b>. In the process, the rotor <b>2</b> may be rotated to the desired angular position by controlling the opening and closing of the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> based on the measured angular position of the rotor <b>2</b> measured by the rotary encoder <b>29</b>. For instance, duration of opening/closing of the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> in the timing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be determined based on the difference between the current angular position and the desired angular position of the rotor <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0199">After rotating the rotor <b>2</b> by driving the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> in the step S<b>18</b>, the process returns to the step S<b>14</b> and then to the step S<b>16</b> to determine whether or not the rotor <b>2</b> is stopped at the desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0200">In the embodiment, after stopping the rotor <b>2</b> by the braking force by the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>, the pressurized oil is supplied to the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to actuate the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> and the rotor <b>2</b> is rotated to the desired angular position. Thus, the locking of the rotor <b>2</b> can be performed efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0201">Further, based on the detection result of the rotary encoder <b>29</b>, the opening and closing of the solenoid valve <b>93</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> are controlled and thus, the rotating of the rotor <b>2</b> to the desired angular position can be automated by driving the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>. Thus, the locking of the rotor <b>2</b> can be performed efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0202">In the embodiment, the solenoid valve for causing the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> to carry out the motoring operation is provided in addition to the high pressure valve <b>56</b> housed in the casing <b>90</b>. This is for the following reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0203">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the high pressure valve <b>56</b> and the low pressure valve <b>58</b> that are housed in the casing <b>90</b>, are a check valve and an electromagnetic valve of a normally-open type, respectively. The check valve is used as the high pressure valve <b>56</b> to reduce the size of the high pressure valve <b>56</b>. When driving the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> by the pressurized oil supplied from the pressurized oil source (the pump <b>95</b>), the high pressure valve (the check valve) <b>56</b> housed in the casing <b>90</b> cannot be used. Thus, in the present embodiment, an electromagnetic valve of a normally-closed type is provided as the solenoid valve <b>93</b> in addition to the high pressure valve <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0204">Further, even in the case of using the electromagnetic valve as the high pressure valve <b>56</b>, from the perspective of reducing the size of the high pressure valve, the high pressure valve <b>56</b> is designed to open and close by a pressure difference between the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> and the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> or to assist the opening and closing thereof. In this manner, by using the pressure difference between the hydraulic chamber <b>53</b> and the high pressure oil line <b>24</b>, the opening and closing of the small high pressure valve <b>56</b> can be controlled with a small amount of electromagnetic force. Thus, it is possible to reduce the size of the high pressure valve <b>56</b>. In this case, by using the pressure difference generated by the reciprocation of the pistons <b>52</b>, the high pressure valve <b>56</b> becomes openable. In such case, when the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> is driven by the pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source (the pump <b>95</b>), the high pressure valve <b>56</b> cannot be solely controlled sometimes. Therefore, it is preferable to provide the solenoid valve <b>93</b> in addition to the high pressure valve <b>58</b> even in the case where the high pressure valve <b>56</b> housed in the casing is the electromagnetic valve.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0205">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0206">For instance, in the first and second embodiments, the rotor <b>2</b> is locked by inserting the locking pin <b>9</b> in the first hole <b>10</b> on the rotor side and the second hole <b>11</b> on the nacelle side. However, this is not limitative, and the rotor <b>2</b> may be locked by means of any locking members other than the locking pin <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0207">In the first and second embodiments, in order to stop the rotor <b>2</b> by the braking force by the hydraulic pump <b>20</b>, the displacement D<sub>P </sub>of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> is changed (see the step S<b>8</b>). However, this is not limitative and the pressure P<sub>H </sub>of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> may be changed instead of or in addition to the displacement D<sub>P</sub>. More specifically, at least one of the displacement D<sub>P </sub>and the pressure P<sub>H </sub>is changed to achieve the torque demand T<sub>P </sub>of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> determined in the step S<b>4</b> (T<sub>P</sub>=D<sub>P</sub>&#xd7;P<sub>H</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0208">The pressure P<sub>H </sub>of the operating oil in the high pressure oil line <b>24</b> can be adjusted, for instance, by increasing or reducing the ratio of the discharge amount ZP of the hydraulic pump <b>20</b> relative to the intake amount QM of the hydraulic motor <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0209">In the first and second embodiments, the locking pin <b>9</b> is manually inserted in the first hole <b>10</b> and the second hole <b>11</b>. However, this is not limitative and the insertion of the locking pin <b>9</b> may be automated.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an automated insertion of the locking pin <b>9</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an actuator <b>96</b> is provided on the rear end of the locking pin <b>9</b>. The actuator <b>96</b> is controlled by an actuator controller <b>98</b>. A determination unit <b>99</b> determines whether or not the first hole on the rotor side (the hole formed in the hub <b>2</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) matches with the second hole <b>11</b> on the nacelle side (the hole formed in the convex portion <b>8</b>A of the nacelle <b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) based on the detection result of measuring the angular position of the rotor <b>2</b> by the rotary encoder <b>29</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). If it is determined that the first hole <b>10</b> matches with the second hole <b>11</b>, the actuator controller <b>98</b> actuates the actuator to insert the locking pin <b>9</b> in the first hole <b>10</b> and the second hole <b>11</b>. As the actuator <b>96</b>, a hydraulic cylinder may be used for instance.</p>
