<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A hybrid data disc, method and system of forming the disc are disclosed. The hybrid disc includes a first substrate structure bonded to a second substrate structure, and at least two data layers of different formats for access from different sides of the disc. One example provides the second substrate structure with a second substrate that has at least one curable material layer on each side of the second substrate, and the curable material has a property that results in shrinkage associated with curing of the material. Other examples provide a data disc with different stacking ring configurations, a thinner substrate and substrate structures of opposite curvature.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a data disc having data in at least two different formats, and method and system for forming the disc.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development and availability of different data formats for multimedia content, it is often desirable to have contents in different data formats on a single data disc. To manufacture these hybrid discs, it is necessary to modify conventional fabrication processes and/or systems typically used for single format discs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To facilitate understanding of the embodiments of the present invention, some background relating to a conventional optical disc and its manufacturing process is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic illustration of a conventional dual layer optical disc. The optical disc <b>100</b> has a substrate <b>102</b>, a first reflective layer <b>104</b>, a spacer or bonding layer <b>106</b>, a second reflective layer <b>108</b>, and a layer <b>110</b>. For a Blu-ray disc (BD), layer <b>110</b> is a cover layer, and for a digital versatile disc (DVD), layer <b>110</b> is a second substrate. For a BD, the substrate <b>102</b> is typically a 1.1 mm polycarbonate disc, and the first reflective layer <b>104</b>, which is highly or substantially totally reflective at the read-out wavelength, can be made of a silver alloy or aluminum with a thickness of less than about 50 nm. The second reflective layer <b>108</b>, which is partially reflective, can be made of a silver alloy with a thickness of less than about 20 nm. The Blu-ray spacer layer <b>106</b> is made of a transparent resin material and has a thickness of about 25 &#x3bc;m, and the cover layer is made of a transparent material with a thickness of about 75 &#x3bc;m, and may also include a protective hard coating.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Presently, there are two widely used methods for manufacturing dual-layer Blu-ray optical discs. One is a plastic stamper method, and the other is a &#x201c;wet embossing&#x201d; method. The plastic stamper method is also referred to as a &#x201c;2P&#x201d; process, which stands for photo polymerization (referring to one of the steps in the method). The method involves molding a first data layer in a first substrate, and a second data layer in a second substrate. After a reflective layer is formed over the first data layer, the two substrates are bonded to each other using an adhesive. The second substrate is then separated and discarded, leaving an impression of the second data layer molded into the adhesive layer remaining on the first substrate. Additional processing steps are performed to complete the fabrication of the disc. In the case of Blu-ray discs, the first substrate is a 1.1 mm disc, and the second substrate may be a 0.6 mm disc.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The 2P method is further illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, which depict cross-sectional views showing various stages during the fabrication of an optical disc, e.g., a Blu-ray disc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>shows a first substrate <b>202</b>, e.g., a 1.1 mm thick polycarbonate disc, with a surface <b>202</b>D having structures such as pits and lands representing data in a first data layer. A first reflective layer <b>204</b> is formed over the molded surface <b>202</b>D of the substrate <b>202</b>. A different substrate <b>250</b>, e.g., a polycarbonate disc, typically with a thickness of 0.6 mm, has a surface <b>250</b>D with pits and lands representing data in a second data layer. Surfaces <b>202</b>D and <b>250</b>D are molded using respective stampers (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The substrate <b>250</b> is bonded to the reflective layer <b>204</b> with an adhesive layer <b>206</b> (which may be made of two separate layers of different adhesive materials), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>. After curing the adhesive by exposure to ultra-violet (UV) light (through photo polymerization of the adhesive), the substrate <b>250</b> is mechanically stripped from the reflective layer <b>204</b>, leaving the data layer impression on a surface <b>206</b>D of the adhesive layer <b>206</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>. Since the substrate <b>250</b> is discarded after this fabrication, and effectively serves as a stamper for transferring the data layer onto the adhesive <b>206</b>, it is also referred to as a sacrificial plastic stamper.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The substrate structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>has two data layers&#x2014;one molded on the substrate <b>202</b> and the other on adhesive layer <b>206</b>. A reflective layer <b>208</b> is then formed over the data surface <b>206</b>D of the adhesive layer <b>206</b>, e.g., by sputtering, and a cover layer <b>210</b> is applied over the reflective layer <b>208</b>, resulting in an optical disc <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another conventional method for making discs is the &#x201c;wet embossing&#x201d; method, which starts by molding the first data layer in the 1.1 mm Blu-ray disc polycarbonate substrate <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>. After applying the first reflective layer <b>204</b>, one or two layers of lacquer (not shown), including a wet embossing lacquer, are applied over the reflective layer <b>204</b>. The second data layer is embossed in the wet lacquer using a re-usable nickel stamper and the lacquer is UV-cured on the stamper. The disc structure is subsequently removed from the stamper, and fabrication is completed by performing additional steps such as those described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>-<i>d. </i></p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures. The drawings are not to scale, and one or more features may be expanded or reduced for clarity.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments of the present principles provide an optical disc having data in at least two different formats (also referred to as a &#x201c;hybrid&#x201d; disc), a method of fabricating the disc, a system configured for use in forming the disc, and a computer readable medium with stored program instructions for performing the method.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As will be shown below, a hybrid disc of the present invention includes a first substrate structure bonded to a second substrate structure, with the first and second substrate structures having data in different formats, and respective first and second substrates with different material layer configurations and/or different stacking ring configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, the second substrate structure has a substrate with a first curable material layer on one side of the substrate, and a second curable material layer on the other side of the substrate. Each of the curable materials has a property that results in shrinkage of the respective layer associated with curing of the material. The use of these curable layers on different sides of the substrate allows the curvature of the substrate structure to be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the hybrid disc is a double-sided double layer (DS-DL) disc, with two data layers in DVD format being accessible or read from one side of the disc, and two data layers in Blu-ray disc (BD) format being accessible or read from the other side of the disc. As discussed below, one embodiment of the present invention allows conventional equipment (i.e., designed for making standard DVDs) to be adapted for making a DVD substrate structure without a stacking ring (which is a configuration different from that of a standard DVD), which can then be bonded to a BD substrate structure to form a hybrid disc with a reduced total height that conforms to the specifications of the DVD and BD standards.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One or more features of the present principles may be applied to other combinations of disc formats and/or number of data layers. Thus, the disc formats may include at least two formats, e.g., BD25/DVD9, BD25/DVD5, BD50/DVD5, BD50/BD50, BD25/BD25, among others, as well as those available in the future or being developed, e.g., BD200. In addition, one or more sides of the final disc may itself have mixed or hybrid formats on the same side of the disc, including BD, DVD or other applicable formats. In general, each side of the disc may have multiple data layers, and the number of data layers for one side of the disc may be the same as, or different from, the number of data layers for the other side of the disc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Furthermore, any of the data layers may be a recordable layer (as opposed to all pre-recorded layers in the examples discussed below), and each side may have any combination of pre-recorded and recordable layers, and in one or more data formats.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic cross-section showing various material layers of one example of the hybrid optical disc <b>300</b>. The disc can be formed by bonding together two substrate structures <b>300</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>300</b>-<b>2</b>, each having been separately formed to include respective material and data layers. Table 1 lists the information, e.g., materials, nominal thickness and range, and method of forming the layers, relating to the various layers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. It is understood that, depending on the specific applications or disc formats, other alternatives, e.g., different materials, apply methods and/or layer thicknesses, may also be used. Details regarding the individual layers will be further discussed below.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The BD substrate structure <b>300</b>-<b>1</b> includes a substrate <b>330</b>, with the following layers formed on one side <b>300</b><i>a </i>of the substrate, from top to bottom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>: a reflective layer <b>332</b>, a spacer layer <b>334</b>, a pit layer <b>336</b> (or data layer), a semi-reflective layer <b>338</b>, a cover layer <b>340</b> and a hardcoat layer <b>342</b>. In addition, one or more resin layers <b>322</b>, <b>324</b> and intermediate layer <b>326</b> may also be formed on the other side <b>300</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>330</b>. Except for the reflective layer <b>332</b>, the semi-reflective layer <b>338</b>, and layer <b>326</b>, the other layers in the BD structure are all transparent layers made from non-metallic materials, e.g., polycarbonate, curable polymers such as UV-curing acrylic resin, among others. Depending on the material used, the intermediate layer <b>326</b> may have different reflectivity or transmission characteristics. As used herein, a substrate (e.g., substrate <b>330</b>) and one or more material or data layers associated with that substrate may collectively be referred to as a substrate structure. For example, layers associated with substrate <b>330</b> or substrate structure <b>300</b>-<b>1</b> include those formed on or contacting the substrate <b>330</b> (e.g., layers <b>324</b> and <b>332</b>), as well as others that do not contact the substrate <b>330</b> (e.g., layers <b>334</b>, <b>322</b>, and so on), but are nonetheless formed &#x201c;over&#x201d; the substrate as part of the substrate structure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Unlike conventional BDs (with a substrate thickness of 1.1 mm), the substrate <b>330</b> for this hybrid disc has a thickness of about 500 &#x3bc;m (0.5 mm), or close to the thickness of a DVD. Other embodiments may have a BD substrate thickness of less than about 0.55 mm; or in a range between 0.25 mm to 0.55 mm. In another embodiment, the BD substrate has a thickness between about 0.45 mm to about 0.55 mm. Molded pits, representing a first data layer L<b>0</b>, are formed in the substrate <b>330</b> using injection molding and stamping.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Injection molding process B<b>1</b> can be performed in a molding machine that has been modified (e.g., from a machine used for producing conventional BDs) to produce a substrate that is thinner than 1.1 mm, i.e., thinner than a conventional BD substrate. In one example, the modification may be done by mechanically adjusting the mold components to provide an effective dimension for forming a thinner substrate. This allows a conventional machine designed for standard BD substrates to be configured or retrofitted for this operation in a much shorter timeframe, e.g., resulting in over a 6-fold reduction in the time required, when compared to replacing the entire mold itself.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One or more of the molding process conditions, e.g., temperatures, process time, cooling rate, spin speed, mold pressure, and so on, may be adjusted accordingly to form the thinner BD substrate within desired specifications.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The remaining layers <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>338</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>342</b> can be formed in sequence over the substrate <b>330</b>, e.g., formed over the surface <b>330</b><i>a </i>(although these layers are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to be &#x201c;below&#x201d; the surface <b>330</b><i>a</i>) using known or conventional processes and materials such as those used for forming standard BD-50. Examples of some known processes or production steps for forming standard BDs include those used in the Singulus BLULINE II production system, for example, described in the Singulus brochure, &#x201c;BLULINE II BD50 Enabling the Blu-ray Future,&#x201d; of 2008, and others discussed in &#x201c;Smart Solutions to Drive the Future&#x201d; by Eggo Sichmann, Singulus, May 2005. Both documents are available from the interne, or from Singulus Technologies AG, of Germany. Materials in these documents are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. In one embodiment, various layers of the BD substrate structure can be formed in different machines and units integrated in a BD production system, e.g., a molding machine, spin-coater, sputtering machine, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and Table 1, after a reflective layer <b>332</b>, two transparent layers <b>334</b> and <b>336</b> are formed. In this example, these layers are made of different thickness of different types of curable materials, including, for example, radiation or thermal curable polymers or resins, e.g., UV-curable acrylic resins or acrylates. The materials and layer thicknesses are selected to provide suitable or optimal properties (e.g., optical, mechanical, chemical, among others) for respective functions. Layer <b>334</b>, which is in direct contact with reflective layer <b>332</b>, should have properties that are compatible with the material (e.g., silver) in reflective layer <b>332</b>. The pit layer <b>336</b> has pits formed thereon, e.g., using a stamper (not shown), representing a second data layer L<b>1</b>. The L<b>1</b> data pits may be formed by either the 2P process (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or the wet embossing process previously discussed. For example, layer <b>334</b> may be a standard type of resin, while the relatively thin layer <b>336</b> is selected for forming the pits in an optimal manner while minimizing shrinkage upon and/or after curing. Other thickness ranges or combinations for these two layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b> may also be used, e.g., with their total layer thickness being about 25 &#x3bc;m, while keeping layer <b>336</b> to be sufficiently thin to avoid excessive shrinkage associated with curing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">This is followed by a semi-reflective layer <b>338</b>, e.g., silver alloy, a cover layer <b>340</b> and a hardcoat layer <b>342</b>. The L<b>0</b> and L<b>1</b> data on the BD structure are read from the bottom side. In one example, the cover layer <b>340</b> and the hardcoat layer <b>342</b> are two separate layers of different types of resins, with respective thicknesses selected to provide desired or optimal properties, or to conform to certain established standards (e.g., total thickness of 75 &#x3bc;m). Furthermore, the hardcoat layer <b>342</b> has a higher modulus, i.e., less elastic, than the cover layer <b>340</b>. In one example, a material having a modulus of greater than about 1200 MPa (mega pascal) at 25&#xb0; C. is used for the hardcoat layer <b>342</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In other embodiments, one or both of the two-layer combinations, i.e., [<b>334</b>, <b>336</b>] and [<b>340</b>, <b>342</b>], may be a single layer of one material (instead of two layers of different materials), as long as the material properties and thickness are suitable for the specifications and/or performance requirements. Although UV-curable resins are preferred, other materials with appropriate properties (e.g., different shrinkage factor, modulus, curable by other means such as thermal or other forms of radiation) may also be used. It is preferable that the hardcoat layer <b>342</b> be made of a material with a high modulus to provide sufficient rigidity for effective protection.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Due to the reduced rigidity of the 0.5 mm polycarbonate disc substrate (compared to a standard 1.1 mm BD substrate), a problem may be encountered after one or more of the UV resin layers (e.g., layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>342</b>, formed using one or more UV-curable acrylic resins known to one skilled in the art) in the 0.1 mm layer stack are formed in the BD substrate structure. Specifically, since the UV resin materials typically have a shrinkage factor of about 4-8% by volume during and/or after UV curing, the resulting BD structure may exhibit heavy &#x201c;dishing&#x201d; or curvature (also referred to as a &#x201c;tilt&#x201d; or warping) due to a force arising from the shrinkage associated with the curing of the resin material. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, which shows the BD substrate <b>330</b> and the layers formed thereon having a concave shape when viewed from the bottom/readout side of the hybrid disc, or an umbrella shape when viewed in a side view.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">From a manufacturing viewpoint, such significant dishing or curved contour may lead to one or more problems such as inability to perform one or more in-line or in-process tests, including, for example, disc inspection using an inline defect scanner, signal testing, or accurate thickness measurements on one or more of the resin layer(s) during disc fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In general, the material and thickness of respective curable layers formed over the data side (side <b>330</b><i>a</i>) of the BD substrate <b>330</b> (i.e., layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>342</b>), are selected based on various factors such as optical, mechanical and/or chemical properties as determined by the functions and/or processing needs of the layers. For example, a protective or cover layer preferably has a relatively high modulus for effective protective function, while a layer in direct contact with a reflective layer that includes silver should be chemically compatible so as to avoid undesirable reaction. Any curvature resulting from shrinkage associated with the cured material may then be compensated for by using one or more curable layers formed on the other side <b>330</b><i>b </i>of the BD substrate <b>330</b> to offset the curvature or tilt (thus, the name &#x201c;tilt-offset&#x201d; layers) that may arise from material shrinkage. These tilt-offset material layers and corresponding processing steps used to alleviate or counteract the dishing effect are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, a layer <b>324</b> is applied as a topcoat layer to the other side or surface <b>330</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>330</b> (i.e., opposite to the side <b>330</b><i>a </i>where layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>342</b> are located). In this case, layer <b>324</b> is used to produce a dish-up effect (by virtue of the bending force arising from its shrinkage upon curing) that at least partially compensates for the dish-down effect from the layers on the side <b>330</b><i>a </i>of the substrate. Since the amount of curvature change depends on the material properties (e.g., the shrinkage factor and the modulus) and the layer thickness, layer <b>324</b> can be selected to have a material and thickness combination that results in an amount of curing shrinkage that would at least partially offset the curvature arising from the shrinkage of one or more layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>342</b>, such that the overall curvature of the substrate structure can be reduced. However, depending on the specific applications, this layer may not be needed in all situations. For example, it may be omitted if the dishing effect or curvature in the substrate structure resulting from resin layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>342</b> are within acceptable limits.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The material for this layer <b>324</b> (in process B<b>8</b>) may be a material such as a hardcoat layer material as used in process B<b>7</b>, e.g., with a modulus of at least 1200 MPa. In general, one or more of layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>340</b>, <b>342</b> and <b>324</b> may be made of standard materials used in known processes, or they may be proprietary materials with properties suitable for the specific functions of the respective layers. In one example, about 50 &#x3bc;m of a UV-curable resin is applied to the surface <b>330</b><i>b </i>of substrate <b>330</b> using spin-coating on a BD line equipment. The material type, layer thickness and/or process conditions are selected to provide the final, cured layer <b>324</b> with a desired magnitude of shrinkage or dishing effect. One or more process conditions, e.g., temperature, spin-coating speed, and so on, are adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>illustrates the shrinkage of the layer <b>324</b> providing a counter-balance, e.g., a force due to shrinkage that results in a dish-up effect, which at least partially offsets the dish-down effect from one or more of the resin layers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>340</b> and <b>342</b>, resulting in a substrate structure with reduced dishing or curvature compared to the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>. Appropriate choice of a combination of material, thickness and/or process condition can result in a BD substrate structure having improved flatness specification, e.g., sufficient to allow substrate inspection to be performed using standard equipment during fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In other embodiments, additional layers such as layers <b>322</b> and <b>326</b> may also be provided as a part of the BD substrate structure <b>300</b>-<b>1</b>, e.g., layer <b>322</b> may be another tilt-offset layer for fine-tuning the tilt or curvature of the BD substrate structure. These layers will be discussed in a later section.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DVD Substrate Structure</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the DVD substrate structure <b>300</b>-<b>2</b> includes the following layers, starting from the top: a substrate <b>310</b>, semi-reflective layer <b>312</b>, spacer layer <b>314</b>, reflective layer <b>316</b> and a protective layer <b>318</b>. The substrate <b>310</b> has molded pits formed thereon, representing a first data layer L<b>0</b>, and the spacer layer <b>312</b> has molded pits formed thereon, representing a second data layer L<b>1</b>. Except for the semi-reflective layer <b>312</b> and the reflective layer <b>316</b>, other layers of the DVD structure are transparent layers made from non-metallic materials, e.g., polycarbonate, acrylic resins, among others. In one example, layers <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> and <b>316</b> are formed in different machines (e.g., molding machine, sputtering machine and spin-coater) that are integrated in a DVD production system, and the protective layer <b>318</b> can be formed by spin-coating in a stripper-bonder that is separate from the DVD production system.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although most of the materials and processes for forming this DVD structure are similar to those used for forming a standard DVD disc, e.g., DVD-9, various modifications to the process and/or materials can also be implemented to provide a final hybrid disc that conforms to other physical specifications, in addition to established or currently known standards. Again, examples of various layer thicknesses and ranges, as well as description of materials and application methods, are provided in Table 1.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In general, the transparent substrate <b>310</b> has a thickness less than about 0.65 mm. In one embodiment, the thickness is at least 0.55 mm, and in another embodiment, between about 0.56 mm and 0.64 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In conventional fabrication process, the substrate <b>310</b> is provided or maintained within certain flatness specifications during manufacturing. However, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the molding process of DVD substrate <b>310</b> may be designed to provide a dishing effect or curvature that at least partially compensates for that of the BD substrate structure previously discussed, such that, when the DVD and BD structures are bonded, a hybrid disc with improved or optimum flatness (e.g., within desired specifications) can be produced. The DVD substrate molding may be achieved by adjusting one or more molding conditions (e.g., temperature, cooling time or rate, injection pressure, and so on) to produce a DVD substrate tilt to substantially compensate for the tilt of the BD substrate structure (i.e., including the topcoat layer <b>324</b>). The resulting DVD substrate <b>310</b> will have an oppositely dished shape compared to that of the BD substrate structure (or a curvature that is opposite to the curvature of the BD structure, when both are viewed from the same side or direction). Such a substrate <b>310</b> with its associated layers <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> are illustrated in the top part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>. In some situations, it may also be desirable to maintain the molded DVD substrate below a tilt limit in order to provide sufficient process control for other subsequent processing steps, e.g., in forming a spacer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one example, the DVD substrate can be molded to provide a shape with equal curvature or contours as the concave shape of the BD substrate structure, except that the DVD substrate will be convex when viewed from the bottom side (or the BD readout side) of the final hybrid disc. Depending on the specific processing needs or disc applications, however, other embodiments can provide a molded DVD substrate having a curvature or contour that is not equal (but still having an oppositely dished shape) to that of the BD substrate structure. A subsequent bonding process, which can be performed in a stripper-bonder (to be described below), will bring the DVD substrate structure <b>300</b>-<b>2</b> and the BD substrate structure <b>300</b>-<b>1</b> together, with their centers contacting each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>. In this example, the BD structure <b>300</b>-<b>1</b> is shown without the tilt-offset layers <b>322</b>, <b>324</b> and the intermediate layer <b>326</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Bonding of DVD Substrate Structure to BD Substrate Structure</heading>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and Table 1, the DVD substrate structure <b>300</b>-<b>2</b> and the BD substrate structure <b>300</b>-<b>1</b> are bonded to each other by an adhesive layer <b>320</b> to form the hybrid disc. In one embodiment, the adhesive layer <b>320</b> is an adhesive such as that used in fabricating standard DVD-18, e.g., a UV-curable cationic adhesive, or a UV-curable pressure sensitive adhesive. The adhesive may be applied by screen printing, or another suitable technique, on a hybrid stripper-bonder, or similar units.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As previously mentioned, one or more additional layers, e.g., layers <b>322</b> and <b>326</b>, can also be formed as part of the BD substrate structure <b>300</b>-<b>1</b> prior to bonding to the DVD structure <b>300</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, layer <b>322</b> may be another tilt-offset layer to provide fine-tuning to compensate for any residual tilt (i.e., any tilt that may remain from the varying layers on the BD substrate structure and/or the molding of the DVD substrate) so that the resulting hybrid disc (i.e., after bonding the DVD and BD substrate structures together), will have a predetermined flatness within certain specifications, e.g., to conform with established standards or other application needs. Fine tuning of the tilt-offset can be achieved by selecting a combination of the material properties (e.g., shrinkage factor, modulus) and thickness of the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and Table 1, a layer <b>322</b> made of an UV-curable resin material, is applied to the BD substrate structure in process H<b>3</b> (e.g., either directly to the top side <b>330</b><i>b </i>of the BD substrate <b>330</b>, or to the resin layer <b>324</b>), prior to bonding to the DVD substrate structure in the stripper bonder. The resin layer <b>322</b>, which may be applied by spin-coating in the stripper bonder, can be used to provide additional dishing offset that may be needed in order to obtain a hybrid disc with a final flatness that is within certain desired specifications or standards. The material used in layer <b>322</b> may be the same or different from that of layer <b>324</b>. For example, a material having a modulus of at least 1200 MPa can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Aside from UV curable acrylic resins, other transparent materials (i.e., transparent to wavelengths for writing or reading the corresponding data layers) with suitable properties may also be used. In one example, the radial tilt on the DVD side is within a limit of &#xb1;0.8 degree, and that on the BD side is &#xb1;0.7 degree.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In yet another example, prior to forming the layer <b>322</b> in the BD substrate structure, a metal or dielectric layer <b>326</b> is applied over the resin layer <b>324</b>. As shown in Table 1, this process B<b>9</b> can be done in a sputtering machine, in which a thin coating having a thickness between about 5 to 50 nm (0.005-0.050 &#x3bc;m) is formed on the layer <b>324</b>. The optimum thickness also depends on the specific material. Different materials may be used for layer <b>326</b>, including, for example, a metal such as aluminum or silicon, a dielectric, or silicon nitride. In one example, a layer of silicon nitride having a thickness in a range of 5-10 nm is used. One advantage of providing an intermediate layer <b>326</b> is that, in situations where the adhesion or coverage of layer <b>322</b> directly over layer <b>324</b> poses a problem, layer <b>326</b> can be used to improve the coverage uniformity, e.g., by managing surface tension compatibility, or providing better surface tension matching, between adjacent layers. In addition, the intermediate layer <b>326</b> also facilitates disc handling during processing.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">After bonding the two substrate structures to form the hybrid disc, a label can be printed on the DVD side (e.g., a relatively narrow band around the inner diameter so as not to interfere with the readout or normal operation of the DVD) such that the BD side faces down and the hybrid disc is used for &#x201c;label-up&#x201d; player insertion.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Disc Structure</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Thus, the present invention provides a data disc that includes a first substrate structure bonded to a second substrate structure, with the first substrate structure having at least one data layer in a first format that is different from a second format of a data layer in the second substrate structure, and one or more specific features such as those discussed above being provided in the data disc.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another embodiment, a hybrid disc is formed by bonding a first substrate structure to a second substrate structure, in which, before bonding, the first substrate structure has a first curvature (or tilt) that is opposite, and preferably, substantially equal, to a second curvature (or tilt) produced by the second substrate structure. The curvature or tilt may be produced by applying one or more UV-curable resin layers on one side of a substrate structure, or by molding a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Another embodiment of the present invention also provides a substrate structure in which at least a first curable material layer is formed on one side of a substrate associated with the substrate structure, at least a second curable material layer is formed on the other side of the substrate, and each curable material has a property that results in shrinkage of the material layer upon curing (i.e., shrinkage may occur during and/or after curing). Due to the layer shrinkage, the first curable material layer would produce a first curvature (or tilt) in the substrate structure, and the second curable material layer would produce a second curvature (or tilt) in the substrate structure that is opposite to the first curvature, such that the resulting substrate structure has a final curvature with a magnitude that is less than either the first or the second curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">One embodiment includes a first substrate structure having a substrate with a thickness less than about 0.65 mm, and the second substrate structure having a second substrate with a thickness less than about 0.55 mm. In other embodiments, the total height of the hybrid disc may have a range of about 1.2-1.4 mm (including stacking rings).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">While the discussions thus far focus on various material layers in the substrate structures, another aspect of the present invention relates to the formation of a disc substrate having different stacking ring configurations. A stacking ring, which is an annular protruded portion around an inner perimeter or diameter of an optical disc, is designed to avoid possible damage to the read surface of a disc by providing a gap between adjacent discs that are stacked together. As will be shown below, an embodiment where a stacking ring is absent on the top surface of the disc can better facilitate label printing because of a fully flat surface, and may also be a good option for providing a reduced total disc height in situations where there is a strict constraint relating to the disc height. For the purpose of this discussion, the stacking ring configurations are illustrated below in connection with a hybrid disc formed by bonding a DVD substrate to a BD substrate. However, the alternative stacking ring configuration and the corresponding process can generally be used in other applications or disc formats (including single format discs), and can be used alone or in combination with one or more features or embodiments of the hybrid disc discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As mentioned, a DVD substrate in one embodiment of the present invention may be formed as in standard or conventional DVD-9 discs. In the standard DVD molding process, the mold for forming the L<b>0</b> substrate (i.e., the substrate associated with the first data layer L<b>0</b>) has a recess for forming the stacking ring on the non-data side of the DVD molded substrate. A standard BD molding process also provides a similar stacking ring on the BD substrate. Thus, a hybrid disc formed by bonding the two substrate structures with their respective stacking ring will have two stacking rings.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which shows a hybrid disc of the present invention with two stacking rings <b>510</b>R and <b>530</b>R. In this example, the disc includes a first substrate structure <b>510</b> bonded to a second substrate structure <b>530</b> by a bonding or adhesive layer <b>520</b>. The stacking ring <b>510</b>R is formed on a first substrate of substrate structure <b>510</b>, and stacking ring <b>530</b>R is formed on a second substrate of substrate structure <b>530</b>. For clarity, other layers and substrates in the respective substrate structures (similar to those supported by substrates <b>310</b> and <b>330</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The formation of the substrate structure such as structure <b>510</b> with its stacking ring and other material layers is further discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>, which show cross-sectional views of various layers during different stages of forming a dual-layer disc, e.g., DVD.

A stamper (not shown) is used to form pits (corresponding to L<b>0</b> data) on the data side of the L<b>0</b> substrate <b>610</b>. After a semi-reflective layer <b>612</b>, e.g., metal, is formed over the data surface of the L<b>0</b> substrate <b>610</b>, a spacer layer <b>614</b> is applied over the metal layer <b>612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>shows a DVD L<b>1</b> substrate <b>650</b>, i.e., a substrate with a second data layer L<b>1</b> pattern (formed in a molding machine with a L<b>1</b> mold and a data stamper) having a metalized layer <b>616</b>, e.g., aluminum, being used as a stamper to transfer the L<b>1</b> data pattern to the spacer layer <b>614</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">After this, the DVD L<b>1</b> substrate <b>650</b> is removed (e.g., discarded, and does not form a part of the final DVD structure), leaving a substrate structure having two data layers L<b>0</b> and L<b>1</b>, with the stacking ring <b>610</b>R at the bottom of the L<b>0</b> substrate <b>610</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c</i>. A protective layer <b>618</b> is then formed over the metalized L<b>1</b> layer <b>616</b>, after which, the DVD structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d </i>may be bonded to a BD structure to form a hybrid disc such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the stacking ring <b>510</b>R (e.g., corresponding to ring <b>610</b>R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is formed on the non-data side of the DVD substrate, and the other stacking ring <b>530</b>R is formed on the bottom side (or read side) of the BD substrate. These rings are formed at different locations around the inner perimeter of the hybrid disc, e.g., outside of the data area. In one embodiment, stacking ring <b>510</b>R is located at a radial distance (r) of about 17.65 mm and ring <b>530</b>R is located at a radial distance of about 9.735 mm (the radial distance being measured from the center vertical axis OO&#x2032; of the disc).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one example, each substrate structure has a thickness (t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>) of about 0.6 mm, stacking ring <b>510</b>R has a height (h<sub>1</sub>) of about 0.22 mm, and stacking ring <b>530</b>R has a height (h<sub>2</sub>) of about 0.12 mm (the height being measured from the plane of the corresponding substrate). After bonding, the resulting hybrid disc has a total height (h), including other layers, of about 1.62 mm, which is outside of the maximum disc height/thickness specified by the BD and DVD disc standards (e.g., System Description Blu-ray Disc Read-Only Format by BDA, and the DVD specifications for ROM by the DVD Forum).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Another embodiment of the present invention provides a different molding process for forming one of the disc substrate structures, e.g., the DVD substrate, using existing commercially available equipment (or those in standard manufacturing lines) such that the DVD substrate is formed without a stacking ring. The resulting hybrid disc of this embodiment will only have one stacking ring on the BD substrate (in this case, the thinner substrate in the disc), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which shows a first substrate structure <b>710</b> being bonded to a second substrate structure via a bonding layer <b>720</b>. For clarity, the individual layers in the respective substrate structures <b>710</b> and <b>730</b> are omitted. In this example, the first substrate structure <b>710</b> is a DVD structure with a thickness (t<sub>1</sub>) of 0.6 mm, and the second substrate structure is a BD substrate structure with a thickness (t<sub>2</sub>) of 0.6 mm and a BD stacking ring with a height (h<sub>1</sub>) of 0.12 mm. This results in a hybrid disc with a final height (h) of about 1.40 mm, which is within the existing DVD and BD disc standards.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, such a hybrid disc with only a single stacking ring can be produced by using existing DVD production equipment, by interchanging the L<b>0</b> and L<b>1</b> molds used for molding the DVD L<b>0</b> and L<b>1</b> substrates for standard DVD production. That is, according to a method of the present invention, in forming the DVD substrate structure of the hybrid disc, a mold typically used for forming the L<b>0</b> DVD substrate (referred to as the &#x201c;L<b>0</b>&#x201d; mold, with a recess for forming the stacking ring) is used for molding the L<b>1</b> DVD substrate, and a mold typically used for the DVD L<b>1</b> substrate (referred to as the &#x201c;L<b>1</b>&#x201d; mold, without any recess for forming a stacking ring) is used for molding the DVD L<b>0</b> substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The stamping of the L<b>0</b> data and L<b>1</b> data are still using the respective L<b>0</b> and L<b>1</b> stampers, as in the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. However, by exchanging the L<b>0</b> and L<b>1</b> molds in the respective molding machines (i.e., in systems where separate machines are used for molding the L<b>0</b> and L<b>1</b> substrates), the stacking ring can be formed on the L<b>1</b> substrate, instead of on the L<b>0</b> substrate. This can be better understood by referring to the cross-sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>(unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, only half of the disc cross-section is shown).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>shows a DVD L<b>0</b> substrate <b>810</b> with data formed on its data side (e.g., by injection molding and stamping), but without a stacking ring. This is followed by a semi-reflective layer <b>812</b> (e.g., metal, or silicon, . . . , etc.) and a spacer layer <b>814</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> shows a DVD L<b>1</b> substrate <b>850</b> molded with a stacking ring <b>850</b>R (from the L<b>0</b> mold) and a metal layer <b>816</b>, e.g., aluminum, being used as a stamper to transfer the L<b>1</b> data to the DVD spacer layer <b>814</b> (the DVD L<b>1</b> substrate is stamped with the L<b>1</b> data pattern prior to its being metalized). The L<b>1</b> substrate <b>850</b> is then removed, e.g., in a stripper-bonder.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one embodiment, the L<b>1</b> substrate <b>850</b> is made of PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), instead of polycarbonate. The use of PMMA facilitates the stripping and removal of the L<b>1</b> substrate <b>850</b> from the metal layer <b>816</b> (because aluminum has poor adhesion to PMMA), thus leaving the transferred L<b>1</b> data pattern and reflective layer <b>816</b> intact, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In another embodiment, polycarbonate (PC) is used for the L<b>1</b> substrate <b>850</b> along with a spacer layer resin <b>814</b> that has poor adhesion to PC. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>b</i>-<b>2</b>, in which the un-metalized L<b>1</b> substrate <b>850</b> is used as a stamper to transfer the L<b>1</b> data pattern to the spacer layer <b>814</b>. After stripping the polycarbonate L<b>1</b> substrate <b>850</b> from the spacer layer <b>814</b>, a reflective layer <b>816</b> (e.g., metal) is formed over the spacer layer <b>814</b>, resulting in the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A protective layer is then formed over the reflective layer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>c</i>. This DVD substrate structure, which does not have any stacking ring, can then be bonded to a BD substrate structure to form a hybrid disc, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. This configuration of a hybrid disc without a stacking ring on the top substrate (DVD in this case) also facilitates the printing of a label for the hybrid disc, e.g., a 2-3 mm radius band around the inner diameter of the disc.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thus, by exchanging the L<b>0</b> and L<b>1</b> molds in the molding machines for the DVD substrates, existing manufacturing equipment for standard DVD production can be used to produce DVD substrate structures suitable for forming the hybrid discs of the present invention, with final disc heights (including stacking ring) being within the specified DVD and BD standards.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Hybrid Disc Fabrication Process</heading>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Another aspect of the present principles provides a method of forming a disc having at least two data formats, which includes forming a first substrate structure with at least a first data layer in a first data format, forming a second substrate structure with at least a second data layer in a second data format different from the first format, and bonding the first substrate structure to the second substrate structure. The first data layer or additional layers associated with the first substrate structure are read or accessed from a first side of the hybrid disc, and the second data layer or additional layers associated with the second substrate are read or accessed from the second side of the hybrid disc.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">One example of the hybrid disc is a double-sided double-layer disc with DVD format and BD format, respectively, e.g., with one disc substrate structure corresponding to a DVD-9, and the other disc substrate structure corresponding to a BD-50. Other embodiments of the method further include one or more steps for forming the materials layers such as those discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and Table 1 in the substrate structures. In one embodiment, the method involves forming at least two layers of curable materials, one on each side of a second substrate in the second substrate structure. Each curable material (the two curable materials may be the same or different) has a property that results in a certain amount of shrinkage after curing, which, in turn, may result in a tilt or curvature in the substrate structure. The amount of shrinkage generally depends on the specific material property and the layer thickness. By providing one or more curable material layers on opposite sides of the second substrate, the curvature of the second substrate structure can be controlled, e.g., by a combination of the material and thickness. Thus, by selecting the material property and/or thickness of the second curable material layer, the overall curvature of the substrate structure can be reduced, to conform with desired specification or standard, or sufficiently flat to allow in-line testing to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In another embodiment, the double-sided hybrid disc has only one stacking ring or an annular protruded portion, which is formed by injection molding on a thinner one of the two substrates. In the case of the hybrid disc having a first substrate structure being a DVD structure and a second substrate structure being a BD structure, the disc can be manufactured to conform to the DVD and BD standards by using conventional DVD and BD equipment. Specifically, by interchanging the two molds in a conventional DVD manufacturing tool, i.e., using the mold for a L<b>0</b> substrate in forming the L<b>1</b> substrate and vice versa, the DVD substrate structure can be formed without a stacking ring, as previously discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. When such a DVD substrate structure is bonded to a BD substrate structure to form a hybrid disc, only a single stacking ring is present on the BD substrate structure, which allows the resulting hybrid disc to have a total thickness that complies with the DVD and BD formats. By interchanging the L<b>0</b> and L<b>1</b> molds in forming the DVD substrate structure, conventional DVD manufacturing equipment can readily be integrated into a system for making hybrid discs, e.g., DVD-BD hybrid discs.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">System for Forming the Disc</heading>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Thus, another aspect of the present invention provides a system suitable for use in forming a hybrid disc of the present principles. Specifically, the system includes a first sub-system configured for use in forming a first disc substrate structure having a first disc format, a second sub-system configured for use in forming a second disc substrate structure having a second disc format that is different from the first disc format, and a third sub-system configured for bonding the first disc substrate structure to the second disc substrate structure. In one embodiment, the first disc format is a DVD format, and the second disc format is a BD format, and the data disc is formed with only one stacking ring in the second substrate structure, i.e., no stacking ring or annular protruded portion in the first substrate structure. The first and second sub-system each includes at least a molding machine, a spin-coater, a sputtering chamber, and an imprinting unit (e.g. a stamper or wet embossing unit) for performing one or more processes described above in connection with fabricating the hybrid disc. The third sub-system includes one or more units for applying resin or adhesive onto a substrate structure (e.g., a spin coater), curing materials, bonding substrate structures, and stripping or removing a stamper after an imprinting step. For example, the third sub-system can be a stripper-bonder, which includes a spin coater for applying a resin material to a substrate structure, and a ultra-violet radiation source for curing the resin.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Furthermore, the system has at least one processor and associated computer readable medium (e.g., hard drive, removable storage, read-only memory, random accessible memory, and so on). Program instructions are stored in the computer readable medium such that, when executed by the processor, will cause a method to be implemented according to one or more embodiments for forming a data disc of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Although the above examples focused on a hybrid double-sided double-layer disc having DVD and BD formats, one or more features of the present principles may be adapted or implemented, separately or in various combinations with each other, to form other data discs with different format combinations and different number of data layers, including more than two data layers associated with each substrate structure. For example, aside from pre-recorded data layers, one or more of the data layers can be a recordable data layer, which can be formed by using a suitable recordable material, such as inorganic or organic materials known to one skilled in the art, including phase change materials or dyes. Thus, the disk of the present invention also includes pre-recorded formats such as DVD-ROM and BD-ROM, as well as different recordable formats such as write-once and rewritable formats. In addition, one or more of the two substrate structures can also have at least two data layers with different formats (i.e., not all the data layers associated with one substrate structure need to be the same format).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Furthermore, although it is desirable to provide hybrid discs or disc substrate structures conforming to one or more established or known standards, the present principles may also be used to form other discs with specifications that are different from known standards.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">While the forgoing is directed to various embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof. As such, the appropriate scope of the invention is to be determined according to the claims, which follow.</p>
