<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Improvements in a gas powered engine. Said improvements include use of a piston with a fixed piston arm that extends through a seal in the lower portion of the cylinder. The piston arm operates on an elliptical crank that drives the output shaft. Valves that move air and exhaust into and out of the pistons are lifted by a cam located on the crank. A unique oil injector passes oil to the piston and the cylinder wall. An energy recovery unit recovers energy from the cooling system and from the exhaust system.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This invention relates to improvements in an internal combustion engine. More particularly each cylinder is divided into two chambers by the piston where the upper chamber is used for combustion and the lower chamber is used for air pumping and initial compression.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the internal combustion engine is used as a two-stroke engine the engine size can be reduced by up to 50% of an existing four-stroke engine.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the internal combustion engine is used as a four-stroke engine the engine will be similarly sized to an existing four-stroke engine except the chamber under the piston will work as a supercharger and improve efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 1.98</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Numerous patents have been issued on piston driven engines. The majority of these engines use pistons that move up and down in a cylinder. The piston is connected to a crank shaft and the piston pivots on a wrist pin connected to the piston connecting rod. The side-to-side motion of the piston rod eliminates the potential for a sealing surface under the piston. The design of an engine with piston rods that remain in a fixed orientation to the piston allow for a seal to exist under the piston and this area can be used as a pump to increase the volume of air being pushed into the top of the piston to turbo-charge the amount of air within the cylinder without use of a conventional turbo charger driven from the exhaust or the output shaft of the engine. Several products and patents have been issued that use piston rods that exist in fixed orientation to the piston. Exemplary examples of patents covering these products are disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is a large amount of energy that is lost due to aerodynamic drag from the piston pushing air under a piston as it moves. In existing engines that use only the top of the piston energy is wasted from the aerodynamic drag. In a dual chamber cylinder there is no aerodynamic drag.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">U.S. Pat. No. 3,584,610 issued Jun. 15, 1971 to Kilburn I. Porter discloses a radial internal combustion engine with pairs of diametrically opposed cylinders. While the piston arms exist in a fixed orientation to the pistons the volume under the pistons is not used to pump air into the intake stroke of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,945 issued Jul. 17, 1984 to Glen F. Chatfield discloses a cam controlled reciprocating piston device. One or opposing two or four pistons operates from special cams or yokes that replace the crankpins and connecting rods. While this patent discloses piston arms that are fixed to the pistons there also is no disclosure for using the area under each piston to move air into the intake stroke of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">U.S. Pat. No. 4,480,599 issued Nov. 6, 1984 to Egidio Allais discloses a free-piston engine with operatively independent cam. The pistons work on opposite sides of the cam to balance the motion of the pistons. Followers on the cam move the pistons in the cylinders. The reciprocating motion of the pistons and connecting rod moves a ferric mass through a coil to generate electricity as opposed to rotary motion. The movement of air under the pistons also is not used to push air into the cylinders in the intake stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">U.S. Pat. No. 6,976,467 issued Dec. 20, 2005 and published application US2001/0017122 published Aug. 30, 2001, both to Luciano Fantuzzi disclose an internal combustion engine with reciprocating action. The pistons are fixed to the piston rods, and the piston rods move on a guiding cam that is connected to the output shaft. These inventions use the piston was as a guide for reciprocating action and thereby produce pressure on the cylinder walls. The dual chamber design uses piston wall and a guided tube in the bottom of the lower chamber as guides for the piston in the reciprocating action. Neither of these two documents discloses using the lower chamber as a supercharger.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">What is needed is an engine where the underside of the piston is used to compress the air and work as a supercharger for the upper chamber cylinder. This application discloses and provides that solution.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders to utilize the underside of a piston to act as a supercharger or compressor for the engine use or other uses.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders to use a guided tube in the bottom of the cylinder and an ellipse shaft to convert reciprocating rectilinear motion into rotational motion.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders to use the upper chamber as a four-stroke engine and the lower chambers as a compressor or supercharger.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders to use a split cycle or two-stroke engine by using the upper chamber as combustion/exhaust and the lower portion of the cylinder as an air/compressor. This design can result in a reduction of the engine size by up to 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders to eliminate friction that is created by the piston rocking and being pushed and pulled side-to-side with the piston arm. The side-to-side force is eliminated because the piston is pushed and pulled linearly within the cylinder thereby eliminating the side-to-side rotation and friction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders to eliminate the aerodynamic forces and drag from under the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders that the area under the chamber works as a shock absorber for the area above the piston thereby making the engine operate quieter.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders to be used as an airplane engine because the engine can be lighter in weight and higher in efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders to eliminate the crankshaft camshaft, cam sprocket, timing belt, timing belt tensioner, outside supercharger or turbocharger. All of the space required by the identified components reduces the space, weight and cost and energy consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is an object of the engine with dual chamber cylinders to save energy of the dual chamber verses existing four-stroke engine because the engine is lighter, lower friction, no side forces in the piston, fewer parts and no aerodynamic drag from under the piston as it moves within the cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is still another object of the engine/compressor with dual chamber cylinders to use the engine/compressor as a compressor, pump for other function by using the motor to turn the elliptical shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is an object of the engine to use a compressor before an engine and turbine after the engine at the same shaft to create an energy recovery unit from the cooling system and from the exhaust system where this unit is ideal for energy recovery for waste heat.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is an object of the engine to use a multi-compressor before and or after the engine without using a turbine that creates a small and less expensive engine for an airplane.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is an object of the engine to use a hydraulic cylinder where the piston maintains linear movement of the combustion piston and provides high pressure oil for intercooling the piston and the cylinder walls.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is still another object of the engine to be the smallest and the most efficient and less expensive engine.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is still another object of the engine to reduce the heat temperature of the combustion cylinder by reducing the friction of the piston on the cylinder wall by using high pressure oil and this can lead the engine working at a lower temperature for combustion (LTC) and this is helpful for reducing engine output of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, thereby reducing the need to consume additional fuel for exhaust after treatment and the crankshaft will reduce fuel consumption and reduce emissions. Reference: Report on the transportation combustion engine efficiency colloquium held at UScar, Mar. 3-4, 2010 by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Department of Energy.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It is another object of the engine for the engine to be use high pressure oil to intercool the piston and the cylinder walls. This can eliminate the need for exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and eliminate the need for a water pump, and for an oil pump.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The engine/compressor can be one of four types. Type I is a two-stroke engine, Type II is a four-stroke engine with supercharger, Type III is a four-stroke engine without supercharger and Type IV is a compressor cylinder. The figures show various spaces above and below the pistons. These spaces are for the purposes of illustration only and change based upon the design requirements. In general the spacing above a piston is greater than the spacing below the piston for clearance of a spark plug, air movement and or fuel injection.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show cut-away views of a preferred embodiment of the dual chamber cylinder. An internal combustion engine has one or more cylinders <b>30</b> where each cylinder <b>30</b> is divided by a piston <b>40</b> into an upper and lower chamber. The piston(s) <b>40</b> slide with reciprocating rectilinear motion inside the cylinder <b>30</b> with a piston rod or arm <b>41</b>. The piston rod <b>41</b> exists in a fixed orientation to the piston <b>40</b> and slides in and out of the cylinder through a guided tube with seal <b>42</b> in the end of the cylinder, using low friction seal(s). There are two types of operation for the cylinders. Type <b>1</b> has one chamber for combustion/exhaust and a second chamber for air/compression which is herein called a split-cycle engine or two-stroke engine. The second type uses one chamber for air/compress/combustion/exhaust and a second chamber for air/compression which is herein called a four-cycle engine with supercharger.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The piston rod <b>41</b> will slide in and out of the cylinder through a guided tube in one end of the cylinder using a low friction seal <b>42</b>. The piston, which can slide with reciprocating rectilinear motion inside the cylinder between a bottom dead center (BDC) and top dead center (TDC) a device such as an ellipse shaft converts the reciprocating rectilinear motion of the piston into rotary motion of the engine shaft. The piston arm <b>41</b> movement distance between the bottom dead center (BDC) and the top dead center (TDC) is equal to a half difference of the major axis and the minor axis of the ellipse shaft and each shafting will turn the engine shaft at 90 degrees rather than 180 degrees as in an existing engine. The ellipse or elliptical crank <b>100</b> shaft has two walls, an inside wall <b>101</b> to push the piston rod into the cylinder and an outside wall <b>102</b> to pull out the piston rod out of the cylinder. The ellipse or elliptical crank is shown and described in more detail with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-18</figref> herein. The piston rod or arm <b>41</b> terminates in a piston arm guide <b>43</b> with two roller set against the outside wall <b>102</b> and the second roller bearings <b>45</b> set against the inside wall <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A head <b>31</b> closes the top of the cylinder <b>30</b>. The head <b>31</b> includes provisions for a fuel injector <b>70</b> for supplying fuel into the air stream of the intake and a spark plug <b>71</b> to ignite a compressed gas/air mixture with the cylinder <b>30</b>. Air enters into the cylinder from the intake port where air <b>81</b> comes in <b>80</b> through an intake check valve. Exhaust air <b>91</b> exits the cylinder from the exhaust port where exhaust air <b>91</b> comes through the exhaust valve <b>90</b>. The exhaust valve <b>90</b> is held closed by an exhaust valve spring <b>92</b> that pushes on an opposing exhaust valve spring stop <b>93</b>. The exhaust valve <b>90</b> has an exhaust valve lifter <b>94</b> that is lifted with an exhaust cam lobe <b>95</b> located on the crank <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The piston <b>40</b> seals against the inside of the cylinder <b>30</b> with a series of compression <b>50</b> and oil rings <b>51</b>. An oil tube or pipe <b>60</b> and an oil drain <b>61</b> moved oil out the piston. The oil passage into the oil pipe <b>60</b> is shown and described in more detail with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</figref>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. Because oil enters in the middle of the piston <b>40</b> there are oil rings <b>50</b> on both sides of the oil pipe <b>60</b> with compression rings <b>50</b> near the outer surfaces of the piston <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> show cut-away views of a Type III engine according to a first preferred embodiment of the one chamber cylinder.
