<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is a U.S. National Phase of International Patent Application No. PCT/IB2010/054182, filed 16 Sep. 2010, which claims priority to Estonian Patent Application No. U200900090, filed 17 Sep. 2009, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Disclosed embodiments relate to monitoring and security systems, and particularly to methods and systems for the monitoring of a territory or infrastructure and the monitoring of its perimeter and detection of intruders, that can be used for monitoring large areas or many different objects.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sensor networks have many applications, for example in security systems, environmental and industrial monitoring, military and biomedical applications. In many of these applications it is not possible to connect sensors using wires, for which reason the use of wireless sensor networks may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The monitoring and detection of vehicles, humans and other similar objects is a complicated task since reliable identification and monitoring requires a high number of sensors placed in each other's proximity. For this reason arises a demand for a wireless sensor network, which consists of cheap sensors with low energy requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,208,247 compact wireless sensor stations are described, which can be connected to a network with other similar sensor stations and enable the measurement and analysis of vibration, infrared emission, sound or other signals specific to an intruder or a specific condition of the environment. Such sensor stations are embedded computers with low energy requirements and are equipped with at least one sensor, a microcontroller, wireless communication interface and an appropriate energy source. The network is formed using multi-hop ad-hoc networking principles, where the sensor stations also operate as routers and sensor stations can join and leave the network at runtime. Such sensor stations can be placed in selected locations manually or from vehicles, including deployment from aerial and water vehicles. The sensor stations are programmed to organize into a network that employs decentralized control, meaning that there is no requirement for a central control centre.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,208,247 the sensor stations contain at least one appropriate sensor, by means of which analog signals are converted to digital signals and which selected power spectrum is compared to a sample spectrum stored in the sensor station (which may mean the existence or not existence of an alarm). As a result of the comparison the sensor station makes an appropriate decision&#x2014;takes no action, wakes up the processor from the energy saving mode and executes an additional signal processing step; starts the communication module and forwards the spectrum, forwarding the unprocessed signal. The sensor stations can be reprogrammed if required, for example new sample spectrums could be loaded to the sensor station or the sensor stations could be programmed for a longer period of activity. For communication with other sensor stations a short range multihop TDMA communication scheme is used which allows reducing energy consumption and using a small number of channels for communication. The addition and removal of sensor stations is performed easily and automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The described prior art solution has a range of shortcomings. One of the most critical aspects of wireless sensor networks is the energy consumption, most of the energy being consumed by the communication interface and the microcontroller. The prior art solution assumes that the sensor stations are constantly able to receive messages from nearby sensor stations which means that the sensor stations are constantly in a mode where they consume a substantial amount of power. The decisions are made in each sensor station based on the sensor readings of the sensor station, which means that in case of each alarm the data is forwarded, not taking into consideration the sensor readings acquired by other similar or dissimilar sensor stations, which potentially may increase the number of false alarms and also the amount of data sent out by the sensor stations and the amount of energy consumed by the network. Similarly the solution is designed to communicate the information to a central location, regardless if it was a false alarm or not. If the alarm was detected by several sensor stations the information is sent out to a central location autonomously by all such sensor stations.</p>

The system implemented according to disclosed embodiments further consumes less energy, has a longer lifetime, is more robust, produces fewer false alarms, is more intelligent and is suitable for monitoring large territories. The system is able to operate years in an outdoor environment without human intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A simplified schematic example of a monitoring system according to one disclosed embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A plurality of sensor stations <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> (any number of sensor stations may be employed) may be placed in close proximity and around the monitored asset, object, area or perimeter <b>10</b> (in various places or following a certain installation pattern). Such sensor stations can be placed in selected locations manually or from vehicles, including deployment from aerial and water vehicles. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sensor stations <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> are configured to form a network of sensor stations, and to exchange configuration information about the network and measurement information on the monitored environment acquired by sensor stations. According to an embodiment, the sensor stations <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> may be configured (programmed) to organize themselves into a wireless network of sensor stations, such as an ad hoc network, that employs decentralized control, meaning that there may not be any requirement for a central control centre. The &#x201c;ad hoc network&#x201d; is a collection of wireless sensor stations that can dynamically be set up anywhere and anytime without using any pre-existing network infrastructure. The structure of an ad hoc network is not fixed but can change dynamically, i.e. sensor stations (nodes) <b>1</b>-<b>6</b> can be added to or removed from the ad hoc network while the ad hoc network is operational, without causing irreversible failures. Thus, the ad hoc network is able to reconfigure the flow of network traffic according to the current situation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A sensor station is an autonomous computing entity in a network. Generally, sensor stations may be small, embedded computers equipped with one or more sensors, a wireless communication interface and an autonomous power supply. According to another disclosed embodiment, the sensor station may be equipped with an energy harvesting device(s) that enables collecting energy from the environment, for example a solar panel. A simplified schematic diagram of an exemplary sensor station is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A sensor station may be provided with a communication interface <b>22</b> (such as wireless communication means, e.g. radio part with a transmitter, a receiver, and an antenna <b>25</b>), a data processing unit <b>23</b> (which may include a processor and some memory as well as peripheral entities), and a power supply <b>28</b>. A data and control interface <b>24</b> may be provided between the communication interface <b>22</b> and the data processing unit <b>23</b>. The sensor station is equipped with one or more sensors <b>26</b> for measuring physical parameters (such as sound, light, vibration, magnetic field, infrared emissions) and/or detecting changes in the environment. The sensor station may also be equipped with positioning hardware <b>27</b> (for example a GPS receiver) providing location information (such as geographical coordinates), and/or means <b>29</b> (i.e. a timing device <b>29</b>, a clock) for determining and providing time (e.g. clock time, date). The wireless interface <b>22</b> employed for data exchange may be based on different communication protocols, such as a radio technology used in wireless local area networks (WLANs) or wireless personal area networks, such as IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) or IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) technology or UMTS or other wireless communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to one disclosed embodiment the sensor stations are configured to detect changes of physical parameters in the environment <b>10</b>. At least some of the sensor stations are equipped with sufficient computing power (e.g. data processing unit <b>23</b>) and configured, using suitable algorithms and methods (e.g. implemented by software running on the data processing unit <b>23</b>), to autonomously analyze the changes in physical parameters of the environment and to make decisions either autonomously or in collaboration with the other sensor stations, utilizing the information collected and forwarded by at least one of the other sensor stations, about events of interest occurring in the environment (such as an intruder <b>11</b> entering the area). An individual sensor station may be configured to transmit appropriate messages to one or more of other sensor stations or to other systems in case certain parameter values, combinations of parameter values or change in parameter values, or any other predetermined triggering event, is observed by the sensor station. Data collected by a group of sensor stations may be exchanged between the sensor stations, and appropriate results can be computed based on the data. The same or other sensor stations may be utilize that information to assess the properties of the intruder (type, level of threat) or other appropriate parameters. The sensor stations may store the collected data in their memory to communicate the data to other sensor stations or to any information consumers <b>7</b>, such as adjacent or remote data collecting devices, adjacent or remote user devices, or to systems <b>12</b> outside the ad hoc network.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When, following the data analysis step, the sensor stations come to the conclusion that an event of interest has occurred in the monitored area&#x2014;a source of alarm, such as an intruder&#x2014;one of the sensor stations may transmit information about the event (in the form of a message) using a wireless communication channel to other systems (for example a command centre, adjacent data collecting devices, adjacent user devices, or to systems outside the network), including metadata about the event. The message transmitted by the first sensor station via the ad-hoc network so that other sensor stations could transmit the message using the most appropriate (which depending on the situation could be the shortest, the most reliable or the fastest) path to a base station <b>8</b> or <b>9</b>, which in turn forwards the message to other systems <b>12</b> or to the information consumer <b>7</b>. At least some of the sensor stations may communicate directly with other systems <b>12</b> or to the information consumer. For communication with remote (or local) systems, machines, servers, or control centres various wireless (for example GPRS, CDMA, WiFi (IEEE802.11), WiMax (802.16), TETRA, satellite communication) or wired communication methods can be used. Thereby, other autonomous patrol systems or machines can obtain information on the event, such as an intruder, in a rapid and accurate way and are therefore able to react to the events.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Sensor stations may be time and location aware. According to an exemplary embodiment, the sensor station may be equipped with location information, which was determined and stored to the memory of the sensor station during the installation of the sensor station. According to another exemplary embodiment the sensor station may be equipped with positioning hardware <b>27</b> (for example a GPS receiver). In a similar manner, the sensor station according to disclosed embodiments may be equipped with means <b>29</b> for determining time. As a consequence, the information and queries sent by the sensor stations can be equipped (tagged) with time and location stamps, which allows to assess and monitor the event of interest (e.g. a source of an alarm) using different types of sensors attached to various sensor stations in several locations, and to form a complete view of the properties and movement of the source of an alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to another disclosed embodiment the sensor stations forward collected information on the monitored area or physical parameters to information consumers, such as a central computer or a command centre, where the parameters are analyzed and, in case of certain parameter values or combinations of parameter values or change in parameter values, an appropriate notification is sent to other information consumers, which could be unmanned vehicles or security patrols that are equipped with appropriate communication interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The system may be configured in a way where data is communicated to other systems outside the network only when there is need to do so. A decision on whether to communicate or not is made autonomously by the sensor stations based on the analysis of the information collected by the sensor stations.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An advantage of the system according to disclosed embodiments is that the data is processed in a distributed manner. One sensor station may query various parameters from other sensor stations which parameters are used to compute a desired result, the result being computed either by the inquiring sensor station or any other sensor station. For example, a sensor station equipped with a passive infrared sensor may transmit its measurement results, which triggers data acquisition by another sensor station equipped with a vibration sensor. Combining these measurement results a decision could be made to take a picture of the monitored area and the picture may be transmitted with appropriate metadata (including the location of the event) to a monitoring centre or a mobile patrol. All the decisions required for the processes are made by the sensor stations. The network discovers automatically the optimum route for the transmission of data, which could be the shortest, the fastest or most reliable route, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An example of an operation according to disclosed embodiments will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. The sensor stations <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> have setup an ad hoc network (step <b>302</b>) and determined their time and location (step <b>304</b>). Let us assume a situation wherein an intruder <b>11</b> crosses a periphery <b>10</b> of the monitored area. The sensor stations <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> are configured to monitor and detect changes of physical parameters in the environment <b>10</b> (step <b>306</b>). In step <b>308</b>, the sensor station <b>5</b> checks whether certain parameter values (e.g. by an infrared movement detector), combinations of parameter values or change in parameter values, or any other predetermined triggering event is detected (the detection is depicted by the arrow <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). If no trigger event is detected, the process may proceed to step <b>326</b>. If trigger event is detected, the sensor station <b>5</b> tags the detection information with time and location (<b>310</b>), and after analysing the event (step <b>312</b>) the sensor station <b>5</b> decides whether there is need to send inquiries to nearby sensor stations in order to acquire more data for evaluation of the event (step <b>314</b>). If inquiries are needed, the sensor station <b>5</b> sends inquiries <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>C to nearby sensor stations <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>1</b>, respectively (step <b>316</b>). If no inquiry is needed, the process may proceed to step <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In response to receiving an inquiry, the nearby sensor stations <b>1</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> may operate as illustrated in steps <b>326</b> and <b>328</b>, i.e. they may be triggered to perform information collecting with their sensor and/or to analyse stored historical data in their memories, or to perform any other data collecting or processing procedure or algorithm required by the respective inquiry. In the example case, the sensor station <b>1</b> also detects certain parameter values (e.g. by an infrared movement detector), combinations of parameter values or change in parameter values, or any other predetermined triggering event (the detection is depicted by the arrow <b>15</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Sensor station <b>1</b> tags the detection information with time and location and, possibly after analysing the event, sends the information as a response to the sensor station <b>5</b>. The sensor stations <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> do not detect any event, and they may either send a response message indicating that there is no data to send (after analysing the collected data), or send no response at all, or send processed or raw data to the inquiring sensor station <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The sensor station <b>5</b> receives responses from the nearby stations (step <b>318</b>). Then the sensor station <b>5</b> analyses the data collected from it self and the data received from other sensor stations <b>1</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> in order to evaluate the event (step <b>320</b>). The analysis may require further data collection inquiries to other sensor stations, or inquiries to other sensor stations to perform processing algorithms for distributing the processing required. Based on the evaluation, the sensor station <b>5</b> alone, or several sensor stations collaboratively decide(s) whether the event shall be reported or not (step <b>322</b>). For example, the conclusion may be that an intruder is moving inside the monitored area with a certain speed and in a certain direction, and therefore the event shall be reported. The event report may be transmitted with appropriate metadata (including the time and location of the event) in step <b>324</b>. The network discovers automatically the optimum route for the transmission of data, which could be the shortest, the fastest or most reliable route, for example. In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the message sent by the sensor station is routed via the sensor stations <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> to the base station <b>9</b> (the message path is depicted by the arrow <b>16</b>), and further to information consumers <b>7</b>, such as a command centre, or any other system <b>12</b> outside the network. The information consumers <b>7</b> may also be adjacent data collecting devices, adjacent user devices, unmanned vehicles or security patrols that are equipped with appropriate communication interfaces such that they are able to receive messages from the sensor stations either directly (as indicated by the arrow <b>17</b>), via base stations (as indicated by arrows <b>18</b>), or via other communication systems. After sending the information to information consumers, the process returns to monitor the area in step <b>306</b>. Also, in the case the decision in step <b>322</b> is to not send a report, the event may be ignored and the process may return to monitor the area in step <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The system may also be used for monitoring the environmental conditions in a specific area. Sensor stations equipped with sensors with different modalities (with the sensor configurations being heterogeneous across sensor stations) are placed in the monitored area. Sensor stations either may determine their locations automatically using means of positioning or the locations of sensor stations may be determined by external means and communicated to individual sensor stations. After the sensor stations have been deployed and their locations have been determined they are able to provide sensor data supplemented with temporal and spatial information. The sensor data can be pre-processed at a sensor station before it is sent out (using for example statistical data processing methods).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Determining the condition of the environment in a specific location in the monitored area may require the aggregation of data from sensors with different modalities located in the same area. These sensors may be part of distinct sensor stations. For that purpose of data aggregation the data from these distinct sensor stations must be collected and processed. The aggregation may be performed on one of the sensor stations that generated the entire source data or part of the source data, or the aggregation may be performed on a further sensor station that did not participate in the source data generation. The roles of the sensor stations may be determined at runtime, depending on the availability of algorithms, processing power and/or energy at a sensor station. A sensor station in a specific location may not acquire process and store the data from a specific sensor if the data has not been requested. A sensor data conditioning or aggregation algorithm may be executed only if the execution of such an algorithm has been requested.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">From the perspective of the sensor station it does not make a difference if the data is requested by a server, another sensor station or any other type of information consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The roles of the sensor stations may not be fixed in a specific application. To the opposite, the sensor stations may assume different roles based on the requirements of the application and the availability of resources. The sensor stations may execute different algorithms based on the requirements of the application or the requirements of other nodes. The data processing algorithms in a sensor station may be also updated during the operation of the sensor station. For example, one sensor station may request another sensor station to execute a specific algorithm which may be a data aggregation algorithm or some other type of algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It will be obvious to a person skilled in the art that, the invention and its disclosed embodiments are not limited to the example embodiments disclosed above but the inventive concept can be implemented in various ways and modified and varied within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
