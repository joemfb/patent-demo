<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a connector system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a connector system which is capable of being used to connect construction modules in a substantially horizontal and/or substantially vertical manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Previously, building modules used in the construction industry had to be aligned manually into either vertical or horizontal positions. This leads to building modules being located in incorrect positions due to manual building labourers having to use, for example, their eye or plumb lines to measure vertical and horizontal orientations. This obviously leads to inaccuracies and a reduction in the structural integrity of buildings. In the event that the modules are placed in an orientation significantly away from the vertical or horizontal orientations, then the building may be significantly weakened.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Moreover, conventionally the walls (i.e. shells) of the majority of residential property such as houses and flats, industrial property such as warehouses and factories, retail property such as shop units and shopping centres, and indeed any other type of building structure, have been constructed from bricks and/or building blocks such as breeze blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The bricks and/or building blocks are adhered to one another using cement. Constructing buildings in this manner is a time consuming process which significantly contributes to the cost of a building. A skilled tradesman is also required in the construction of a brick wall. A brick wall also tends to have imperfections such as slight curvatures and distortions which leads to, for example, difficulties when applying an outer finish such as render.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, on the completion of a brick wall, the wall goes through a &#x2018;drying-out&#x2019; process whereupon there may be some shrinkage in the wall which may lead to cracking and a loss of structural integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The building of a brick wall may also be affected by bad weather such as frost and heavy rain. Additionally, brick walls may also be susceptible to dampness as bricks and cement have a tendency to retain moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Building brick walls has the further disadvantage that brick walls are relatively heavy and require deep foundations to support the weight of a formed building. If deep foundations are required, this significantly adds to the cost of a building.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of at least one aspect of the present invention to obviate or mitigate at least one or more of the aforementioned problems.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a further object of at least one aspect of the present invention to provide a connector system which is used to improve the location and/or positioning of building modules.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is a further object of at least one aspect of the present invention to provide a method for efficiently and cost effectively constructing the framework of a building.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a connector capable of connecting construction modules in a substantially horizontal and/or vertical manner, said connector comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">a base having a perimeter and a first and a second side;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">at least one housing mounted on either the first or second side of the base, the housing comprising at least a first and second face which are either substantially perpendicular or parallel to one another;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">a passageway extending through the base and the at least one housing; and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">wherein the first and second faces on the housing are capable of connecting construction modules in a substantially horizontal and/or vertical manner.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Typically, the base may be a substantially planar structure. In particular embodiments, the base may be substantially rectangular or substantially square in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Conveniently, there may be housings on each of the first and second sides of the base. The connector may therefore comprise two housings on opposite sides of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The at least one or both housings may be substantially centrally located on the first and/or second side of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The passageway may extend through the base and both housings.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">By locating the at least one or both housings centrally, a shoulder, stop member or supporting member may be formed around at least partially or all the way around the base. The shoulder, stop member or supporting member may be used as a means to engage with a construction module.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The at least one or both housings may comprise at least a first and second face which are either substantially perpendicular or substantially parallel to one another. The faces are adapted to engage with construction modules and facilitate their placement or orientation into substantially perpendicular or substantially parallel arrangements. Typically, the at least one or both housings may comprise four faces which may be used to engage with construction modules and either facilitate their placement or orientation into substantially perpendicular or substantially parallel arrangements. The four faces may be located on opposite sides of the at least one or both housings. The faces may, for example, be chamfered edges.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The at least one or both housings may be substantially conical in shape and may, for example, be a truncated cone with the passageway extending substantially centrally therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The connector may be made of any suitable strong material such as a metal, alloy and/or composite material.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">There may be a series of connectors attached to one another. For example, there may be two, three, four, five or six connectors attached to one another. The connectors may be attached in a linear manner, an &#x2018;L&#x2019;-shape or in a 2&#xd7;2 orientation etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Construction modules may be connected using the connector. The construction modules may comprise an elongate member which may be inserted into the passageway in the connector. The elongate member may be adapted to fit snugly in the passageway extending through the connector. On insertion of the elongate member of the connector into the connector, a bottom surface of the construction module may abut against the shoulder, stop member or the supporting member formed around the base of the connector. This provides the vertical orientation. As the elongate member is fully fitted into the passageway in the connector, the faces on at least one of the housings abut against an inner surface of the construction module. Typically, there may be at least two, at least three or at least four faces on at least one or both of the housings abutting against an inner surface of the construction module. Preferably, there are four faces on both housings abutting against an inner surface of the construction module. This provides the horizontal orientation. The faces on the housing(s) may therefore connect construction modules in a substantially horizontal and/or substantially vertical manner.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The connector may also comprise openings through which settable material may be injected. This may further secure the construction modules in place by setting around the elongate member inserted into the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of connecting construction modules in a substantially horizontal and/or vertical manner, said method comprising providing a connector comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">providing a base having a perimeter and a first and a second side;</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">providing at least one housing mounted on either the first or second side of the base, the housing comprising at least a first and second face which are either substantially perpendicular or parallel to one another;</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">providing a passageway extending through the base and the at least one housing; and</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">wherein the first and second faces on the housing are capable of connecting construction modules in a substantially horizontal and/or vertical manner.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a general representation of a connector according to the present invention, generally designated <b>100</b>. The connector <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is surrounded by part of a construction module <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The connector <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> comprises a central base <b>101</b> which has four sides <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. The central base <b>101</b> is substantially planar and square in shape and may be described as being in the form of a collar.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">On both sides of central base <b>101</b> there are frusto conical sections <b>112</b>. The frusto conical section <b>112</b> are substantially centrally mounted on the base <b>101</b>. An extended shoulder <b>111</b> is formed around the frusto conical sections <b>112</b> which may be used as a stop member against a bottom surface of a construction module <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The extended shoulder <b>111</b> may therefore be used to provide vertical positioning for the construction module <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Through the centre of the central base <b>101</b> and the frusto conical sections <b>112</b> there is a passageway <b>102</b>. The passageway <b>102</b> may function to facilitate the positioning of construction modules.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Around the frusto conical sections <b>112</b> there are four angular faces <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> <b>128</b> which are capable of connecting construction modules in a substantially horizontal and/or vertical manner. The four faces <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> are oriented substantially perpendicular or parallel to one another. The four faces <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> may be considered to be chamfered edges.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, on insertion of an elongate member <b>130</b> from a construction module <b>120</b> into the passageway <b>102</b> in the connector <b>100</b>, the construction module <b>120</b> is correctly positioned. As the inside surface of the connector module <b>120</b> abuts against the frusto conical section <b>112</b>, the connector module will be slid and/or guided into place and then finally correctly aligned by using the faces <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is therefore easy and fast for a workman to correctly position the construction module <b>120</b>. As the elongate member <b>130</b> is fully inserted into the passageway <b>102</b>, the sides of the construction module <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are correctly positioned by the four faces <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> on the connector <b>100</b>. The connector <b>100</b> is therefore used to correctly connect construction modules in a substantially horizontal and/or vertical manner with the four faces <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> acting as guide members.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the construction module <b>120</b> attached to the connector <b>100</b>. The construction module <b>120</b> is therefore positioned in the correct vertical and horizontal position.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref> show a second connector <b>200</b> which is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref> but two connectors are now attached in series. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref> there are again four faces <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>224</b><i>a</i>, <b>226</b><i>a</i>, <b>228</b><i>a </i>and <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>224</b><i>b</i>, <b>226</b><i>b</i>, <b>228</b><i>b </i>around frusto conical sections <b>212</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Each of the connectors has a passageway <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>202</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref> show a third connector <b>300</b> which is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref> but three connectors are now attached in an L-shape configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 11</figref> there are again four faces <b>322</b><i>a</i>, <b>324</b><i>a</i>, <b>326</b><i>a</i>, <b>328</b><i>a</i>; <b>322</b><i>b</i>, <b>324</b><i>b</i>, <b>326</b><i>b</i>, <b>328</b><i>b </i>and <b>322</b><i>c</i>, <b>324</b><i>c</i>, <b>326</b><i>c</i>, <b>328</b><i>c </i>around frusto conical sections <b>213</b><i>a</i>, <b>312</b><i>b</i>, <b>312</b><i>c</i>, respectively. Each of the connectors has a passageway <b>302</b><i>a</i>, <b>302</b><i>b</i>, <b>302</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> show a fourth connector <b>400</b> which is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref> but four connectors are now attached into a square-like configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 14</figref> there are again four faces <b>422</b><i>a</i>, <b>424</b><i>a</i>, <b>426</b><i>a</i>, <b>428</b><i>a</i>; <b>422</b><i>b</i>, <b>424</b><i>b</i>, <b>426</b><i>b</i>, <b>428</b><i>b</i>; <b>422</b><i>c</i>, <b>424</b><i>c</i>, <b>426</b><i>c</i>, <b>428</b><i>c </i>and <b>422</b><i>d</i>, <b>424</b><i>d</i>, <b>426</b><i>d</i>, <b>428</b><i>d </i>around frusto conical sections <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b</i>, <b>412</b><i>c</i>, <b>412</b><i>d</i>, respectively. Each of the connectors has a passageway <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b</i>, <b>402</b><i>c</i>, <b>402</b><i>d. </i></p>
