<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a bearing for structures of the type including a block of flexible material, such as rubber, to be arranged between structural elements of the structure.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to allow relative movement of structural parts of a structure, such as buildings, bridges, elevated highways, and mechanical systems (machinery), bearings, such as block rubber bearings, are used. The movement between the parts must be allowed, in order to prevent damages, since some or all the structural parts may themselves be influenced by, e.g. their use (e.g. mechanically induced oscillations), seismic activity or wind. An example of such bearings may be cylindrical blocks of rubber used to allow horizontal movement between the pillars of a bridge and the parts making up the deck of the bridge. Especially the deck is influenced by wind and oscillations created by vehicles moving on the deck, and must be allowed controlled movement with respect to the pillars. Such bearings typically comprise an e.g. cylindrical rubber block being fixedly connected at each end surface of the cylindrical block to a structural part of the structure. The rubber block may to a limited extend be compressed in the vertical direction allowing vertical movement, and it may bend with respect to a vertical axis&#x2014;through the end surfaces of the block- or twist/rotate about this vertical axis thus allowing movement in a horizontal plane. Such bearings are adequate for allowing smaller oscillations from the intended use. However in order to make such bearings being able to cope with vibration or oscillations of higher amplitude, attempts has been made to reinforce the standard rubber bearing. Some bearings of this type may therefore further comprise a metal core, e.g. a lead core, or a steel spring embedded in the rubber block in order to reinforce the bearing and to ensure that the bearing and thereby the structural parts are forced back to their original position after the movement. Also known in the art, are bearings having horizontally oriented, parallel steel plates embedded in the rubber block. However, such bearings are poor in damping movements. In order to overcome this problem, rubber bearings having a set of steel braces formed between fixture plates arranged at opposing end surfaces of the rubber block, are known. These, to a certain degree provide damping of the systems in which they are positioned, but are highly inflexible. Examples of such rubber bearings are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Experience has shown that e.g. the above mentioned lead enforced bearings are not very durable, and that they will wear or break down after only tens of &#x201c;larger&#x201d; amplitude vibrations/oscillations. Since, such bearings are usually situated in structures for many years this is disadvantageous, since they may thus cause costly and technically cumbersome replacements.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hence, an improved bearing providing damping of the movement between structural parts of structures, such as buildings, bridges, elevated highways, and mechanical systems (machinery), while also allowing flexible movement between the structural parts would be advantageous, and in particular a more efficient and/or reliable bearing would be advantageous.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the invention to provide a bearing that will provide efficient dampening of movement between structural or non structural elements or parts of structures, such as buildings, bridges, elevated highways, and mechanical systems (e.g. machinery).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is another object of the invention to provide a bearing providing dampening and allowing flexible movement between the structural or on structural elements or parts, between which the bearing may be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is yet another object of the invention to provide a bearing providing dampening and allowing flexible movement between the structural or on structural elements or parts, between which the bearing may be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In particular, it may be seen as an object of the present invention to provide a bearing that solves the above mentioned problems of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It may further be seen as an object of the present invention to provide a bearing that provides an alternative to prior art bearings.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, the above described object and several other objects are intended to be obtained in a first aspect of the invention by providing a bearing comprising a block of flexible material, having two end surfaces; a first fixture element and a second fixture element connected at each of the end surfaces where at least one rotational damping device is arranged between the first and second fixture elements.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention is particularly, but not exclusively, advantageous for obtaining damping of the movements allowed by the bearing. While providing efficient damping it can handle large lateral displacements in a plane parallel to the plane defined by a fixture element, as well as large rotations. Further, the invention is particularly, but not exclusively, advantageous for obtaining high damping of the movements allowed by the bearing. The durability of the dampening of such large movements in the new type of bearing is largely improved to hundreds or thousands of oscillations, and thus the need for replacement during the lifetime of the structure in which the bearing is placed is eliminated or greatly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment the rotational damping device of the bearing may comprise a first arm having oppositely arranged first and second ends; and a second arm having oppositely arranged first and second ends, said first arm being rotationally connected to the first fixture element at its first end, and rotationally connected to a first end of said second arm at its second end; said second arm further being rotationally connected to said second fixture element at a second end of the second arm. Thereby, an extremely flexible bearing is obtained with respect to allowing movement between structural parts to which the bearing may be connected, and yet allowing damping of the movements, even high damping of the movements.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment the bearing comprises a set of two rotational damping devices oppositely arranged with respect to a perimeter of the first fixture element.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the bearing comprises two sets of two rotational damping devices, oppositely arranged with respect to a perimeter of the first fixture element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further embodiment, one or more of the damping devices of the bearing further comprises a friction element arranged between the first and second arms.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Alternatively or in combination, one or more of the damping devices of the bearing further comprises a visco-elastic element arranged between the first and second arms.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, a first arm of the rotational damping device of the bearing comprises two or more parallely arranged elongate elements. In a further embodiment a second arm of the rotational damping device of the bearing comprises two or more parallely arranged elongate elements.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For the purpose of damping large lateral displacements and/or large rotations between the fixture elements the bearings may be designed adapted for individual projects by adapting the length and size of the lever arms, and/or the angle between the arms.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The bearing according to the various embodiments of the invention may be used between structural parts of a building, (e.g. use for base isolation, pillars and decks of bridges, elevated highways, building elements/parts, etc), between structural and non structural parts of a building (e.g. for damping movement of machinery in a production facility (factory)) and between non structural parts of a building (e.g. interconnected machines).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from and elucidated with reference to the embodiments described hereinafter.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A-D</figref> is shown various prior art bearings <b>1</b>&#x2032;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows the general principle of a prior art bearing for building structures. Such a bearing typically comprises a block of a flexible material, e.g. rubber, and a fixture element <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> at each side of the block <b>10</b>. The block <b>10</b> consists in general of layers of rubber and may further comprise thin layers of steel plates <b>16</b> in between as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. In some variants, a core of e.g. lead <b>15</b> may be provided, embedded in the block <b>10</b> of rubber, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Alternatively, a steel spring (not shown) or the like may be provided embedded in the rubber block.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> may be steel plates, and serve for connection of the bearing to e.g. constructional elements of a building. The fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> and the block <b>10</b> are fixedly connected.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bearing comprises two steel plates one on the top and one on the bottom of the block <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A variant, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, have fixed connections <b>18</b> between the upper and lower fixture elements, in the form of steel braces, to ensure that the bearing returns to its original position after movement of the structural elements to which the bearing is intended to be fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> may be provided with fixing means for connecting the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> to e.g. constructional elements of a building. The fixing means may be holes/apertures in the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is shown a bearing <b>1</b> according to one advantageous embodiment of the invention. The bearing <b>1</b> comprises a block <b>10</b> of a flexible material, e.g. rubber, and a fixture element <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> at each side of the block <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The block <b>10</b> has end surfaces <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, the end surfaces being connected to the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> may be steel plates, and serve for connection of the bearing to e.g. constructional elements of a building. The fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> and the block <b>10</b> are fixedly connected. The fixed connection may be provided by gluing the parts together, by bolting them or e.g. by corresponding pins and apertures in the parts, i.e. the block <b>10</b> and the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>. The fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> may be provided with fixing means for connecting the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> to e.g. constructional elements of a building. The fixing means may be holes/apertures in the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> similar to the holes shown in connection with the prior art, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> are plates. They may be circular as shown in the drawing, or they may be square, rectangular or other shapes, e.g. pentagonal, hexagonal or octagonal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the figures, the block <b>10</b> of flexible material is cylindrical, i.e. having a circular cross section, the cross section taken perpendicularly to an axis through the end surfaces <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>. In other embodiments the block <b>10</b> may have other cross sectional shapes, e.g. oval, square, pentagonal, hexagonal or octagonal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As with the prior art, the block <b>10</b> may be formed entirely of solid mass of flexible material such as rubber, e.g. natural rubber or an artificial rubber, or it may be formed with general of layers of flexible material fixedly connected to each other. It may further comprise thin layers of steel plates <b>16</b> formed in between layers of rubber or other flexible material. Also, in some other variants, a core <b>15</b> of lead or other material may be provided, embedded in the block <b>10</b>. Alternatively, a steel spring or the like may be provided embedded in the rubber block.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, the bearing further comprises at least one rotational damping device <b>40</b> arranged between the first and second fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-7</figref> embodiment the bearing <b>1</b> shown, has four rotational damping devices <b>40</b> arranged in two pairs of two opposite to each other with respect to a perimeter of e.g. the first fixture element <b>20</b>. However, in other embodiment there may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, . . . , 16, or more rotational dampers <b>40</b> arranged around the perimeter of the bearing <b>1</b>. Advantageously the rotational dampers <b>40</b> are arranged in opposite pairs of rotational dampers <b>40</b> viewed along the perimeter of the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each rotational damper <b>40</b> comprises a first arm <b>50</b> having oppositely arranged first and second ends <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, and a second arm <b>60</b> also having oppositely arranged first and second ends <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>. The first arm <b>50</b> is rotationally connected to the first fixture element <b>20</b> by its first end <b>51</b>. Further, the first arm <b>50</b> is, at its opposite second end <b>52</b>, rotationally connected to a first end <b>61</b> of the second arm <b>60</b>. The second arm <b>60</b> is, at its opposite second end <b>62</b>, rotationally connected to the second fixture element <b>30</b>. This may be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, especially.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each rotational damper <b>40</b> thus comprises two arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> connected to each other via a rotational joint <b>70</b>, and being arranged in a V-shape, i.e. with an angle between the arms. The rotational joint <b>70</b> may further comprise a friction material element, or pad, to increase the friction between the arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> of the rotational dampers.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each arm <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, may be provided by a single elongate element, e.g. a steel plate. However, each arm may comprise two or more elongate elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>, the first arm <b>50</b> has three elongate elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, and the second arm has two elongate elements <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>. In other embodiments the respective arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> may have one and one element, respectively; one and two elements, respectively; two and two elements, respectively; two and three elements, respectively; three and three elements, respectively; three and four elements, respectively; or four and four elements, respectively. In larger structures arms having even more elongate elements may be applied. The number of elongate elements may vary according to the dimensions of the bearing <b>1</b>, in accordance with its intended use etc. In general, the number n, m of elements constituting the respective arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> should be equal (n=m) or n=m+1 or m=n+1 if odd.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> comprise a plurality of elongate elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>, a piece of friction material may be arranged between each of the alternating elongate elements of the arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, at the joint <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively or additionally a visco-elastic element or pad may be arranged between one or more of the alternating elongate elements of the first and second arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> to increase the resistance to movement (damping) between the arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> of the rotational dampers. The visco-elastic element is fixed to both of a set of adjacent elongate elements of the respective arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> of the rotational damper <b>40</b>, or in the case where each arm comprises a plurality of elongate elements, between each adjoining elongate elements of the two arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The joint <b>70</b> further comprises a pin or bolt <b>71</b> and clamping means <b>72</b> for pressing the elongate elements together at the joint <b>70</b> and to increase the damping. Such clamping means may e.g. be provided by one or more springs, such as disc springs. A nut (not shown) connected to an end of the pin/bolt <b>71</b> may complete the rotational joint <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">By this arrangement of the rotational dampers <b>40</b> around the perimeter of the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, large lateral displacements and large rotations can be achieved by proper dimensioning of the size (length) of the lever arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b>, and the angle between the arms. Experiments have shown that the angle between the arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> should be between 60-90&#xb0;. Rotational dampers having short arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> may be used for dampening vibration or oscillation of small amplitude, in the form of displacement between the fixture element <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>. Rotational dampers having longer arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> may be used for dampening vibration or oscillation of larger amplitude.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The rotational dampers <b>40</b> may be designed in different arrangements and geometries. By proper dimensioning of the block <b>10</b> and the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> the rotational dampers <b>40</b> may be concealed within the volume defined by the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, or they may as in the shown embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-7</figref>) extend partly from the side (perimeter) of the bearing <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The elongate elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>, <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> of the arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> may be formed in steel, aluminum, metal, plastic, or a composite material.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each of the rotational dampers is connected to the respective fixture elements by a pin <b>21</b>, <b>31</b>. Each of the arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> of a rotational damper <b>40</b> are fixed via the pins <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> to a different one of the two steel plates (fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>), i.e. one to the first (top) fixture element <b>20</b> and one to the second (bottom) fixture element <b>30</b>, as shown in the drawing. These pins <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> are providing free rotation for the arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> of the rotational damper <b>40</b>. In the figure the first arm <b>50</b> is represented by the three elongate elements <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>55</b>. The first arm <b>50</b> is connected to pin <b>21</b> centrally in the figure. Via the joint <b>70</b>, the first arm <b>50</b> is connected to the second arm of a rotational damping device <b>40</b>, the second arm <b>60</b>, being represented by the two elongate elements <b>63</b>, and <b>64</b>. In this side view the second arm <b>60</b> extends backwards with respect to the plane of the paper to the pin <b>31</b> extending from the second fixture element <b>30</b>. At the right side of the figure parts of another rotational damping device <b>40</b> is partly shown, the parts of this damping device carrying the same reference numerals as for the first damping device <b>40</b>, but with an apostrophe added to the reference number. Thus it may be appreciated, that the above mentioned first arm <b>60</b> extending from the central part of the figure and towards the left of the figure, in this embodiment shares the rotational join (pin <b>21</b>) with a second arm <b>60</b>&#x2032; of the next damper <b>40</b>&#x2032;. However, in other embodiments each or some the rotational dampers may have individual pins to join them with their respective fixture elements.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> the first fixture element <b>20</b> has been omitted from the figures in order to illustrate the details of the bearing <b>1</b>. From these drawings the flexibility due to the combination of the flexible material block and the rotational damping devices being alternatingly connected to the first and second fixture plate, can be envisioned.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If the bearing <b>1</b> comprises more than one rotational damper <b>40</b> different ones of the dampers may comprise friction material and visco-elastic elements. If the dampers are of a type having two or more parallely arranged elongate elements for each arm <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> a combination of friction material elements and visco-elastic elements may be used between the elongate elements in one or more of the joints, rotationally connecting the arms <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> of a damper <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other embodiments (not shown), the bearing <b>1</b> may further comprise sliding elements arranged between some of the rotational damping devices in order to further increase the flexibility of movement between the fixation elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In embodiments (not shown) a restoring element, such as a spring, may be formed on the pins <b>21</b>, <b>31</b>, and extending to and being fixed to the fixture element <b>30</b>, <b>20</b> opposite to the pin <b>21</b>, <b>31</b>, respectively. Thereby, if a relative displacement of the two fixture elements cannot be restored to its original positions by the properties of the flexible block <b>10</b> material alone, the restoration may be aided by these restoring elements. Alternatively, the spring may be arranged directly between the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In further embodiments (not shown), stopping elements may in addition to any one of the above described embodiments be provided between the two fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>. The stopping elements, is preferably in the form of a cable of a predetermined length. The cable is fixed to inward sides of each of the fixture elements <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, thereby allowing displacement of the two fixture elements relative to each other until, at a point determined by the predetermined length of the cable relative movement may be stopped. Thereby, extreme displacement may be inhibited. Alternatively, the cable may be provided between pins <b>21</b>, <b>31</b> and the opposite fixture elements <b>30</b>, <b>20</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In embodiments (not shown) the bearing <b>1</b> may in combination with any one of the above embodiments comprise two or more layers, such that an additional block <b>10</b> of flexible material is placed on e.g. the plate <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and being connected to an additional fixture element or plate at the opposite end of the additional block, and being provided with rotational dampers between the fixture elements, as described above. Alternatively, bearings <b>1</b> as e.g. shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be stacked fixture element to fixture element.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">By an appropriate choice of dimension the bearings <b>1</b> of such a stack a bearing may be obtained to dampen oscillations of different amplitudes in a wide spectra of amplitudes.</p>
