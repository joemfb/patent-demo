<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/986,882 filed on Nov. 9, 2007.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to thermoplastic siding insulation. More particularly, the present invention relates to a product for siding insulation formed of a shaped thermoplastic extrusion. The present invention also relates to a method for forming siding insulation comprising extruding the thermoplastic insulation from an extruder.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prior art discloses the use of backer insulation material on panel siding including vinyl, aluminum, steel; or other commonly used siding material. The prior art also discloses the use of various techniques of affixing backer insulation material to panel siding utilizing flexible and non-flexible adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Vinyl siding is generally made available in panels comprising longitudinally extending faces. For example, a single panel may represent two faces of a traditional wooden siding panel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,506,486 to Culpepper et al. discloses a composite siding panel. The panel is comprised of a sheet metal or vinyl outer panel and an insulating member. The insulating member is adhesively bonded to the inner surface of the outer panel. Culpepper discloses the use of foamed insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,542,222 and corresponding continuation U.S. Pat. No. 6,195,952 to Wilson et al. discloses a corner post support member operable to adjoin two perpendicular panels of siding coming together at a corner. The corner post support member includes a space separating the outer panel of the member from the adjoining wall, said space filled with an insulating member in the nature of a polystyrene foam plastic or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,029,415 and corresponding continuation U.S. Pat. No. 6,195,952 to Culpepper et al. discloses a composite interlocking vinyl or other veneer siding panel having an elongated insulating member bonded to a vinyl panel with a permanently flexible adhesive. It is claimed that the use of flexible adhesive is required because a hardened adhesive is not compatible with insulated siding panels since it does not take into account the effects of oil canning and telegraphing. Oil canning is a term for a phenomenon caused by expansion and contraction of vinyl siding. Vinyl exhibits a relatively high degree of expansion and contraction based on temperature changes, relative to similarly sized metal siding products. Prior art methods of insulation did not address the expansion and contraction requirements of vinyl siding. As a result, prior art methods of insulating vinyl siding had been known to buckle. Culpepper et al. introduced an insulating member having similar coefficients of expansion and contraction as vinyl, so that the siding presumably did not buckle. Telegraphing is a term for a phenomenon cause by the use of certain methods of applying adhesive to affix an insulating member to a siding panel. Where adhesive is applied in lines, rather than across the totality of the area where the surfaces of the insulation and panel are adjacent, the adhesive glue line can be seen under certain lighting conditions through the face of the panel. Culpepper et al. introduced a flexible adhesive that could be spread across the totality of the area of the insulation that is adjacent to the panel, so that telegraphing was presumably not a problem.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As mentioned above the insulating material disclosed in the prior art is an expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam more commonly known as beaded foam. However, this prior art foamed insulation is not impervious to moisture. This type of insulating foam is manufactured by using tiny beads of styrene impregnated with a foaming agent. Prior to forming the insulation the beads are typically expanded by aging them in air, allowing dispersion of the blowing agent. The beads are then placed in a mold and heated, causing the beads to fully expand and form the insulation. To minimize costs, a manufacturer typically uses the least number of beads possible that will expand to form the insulation. Thus each bead is relatively large when fully expanded and consequently there are large voids between the beads. These voids are known to collect moisture and bacteria, resulting in substantial rotting of the insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, the use of a minimal number of beads results in a fragile product. During the manufacturing process, breakage of the fragile product causes beads to litter a manufacturing area resulting in time consuming cleanup and an environmental nuisance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Finally, once the EPS foam insulation has been formed in a mold, a hot wire is used to burn the final shape required for the insulation material. This results in both open foam at the surfaces of the insulation and in significant smoke and air pollution.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additionally, the method used by those skilled in the art to produce EPS foam insulation does not allow flexibility in panel lengths. As the profile of the insulation must be hot-wire cut from large blocks, there are limitations in the length of hot wire that can be used while retaining the ability to cut an accurate profile. Typically, an accurate profile can be made with hot wire of between 8 and 10 feet. However, the siding industry typically produces siding in 14 feet lengths, necessitating joining EPS insulation where EPS is used.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In view of the foregoing, what is needed is a foamed siding insulation that is less susceptible to moisture collection than the prior art siding insulation materials.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">What is also needed is a foamed siding insulation material that is stronger than EPS and whose break-up does not result in messy, costly, and environmentally unfriendly debris.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also there is a need to provide a foamed insulating material that can be sized easily to any profile and any length as needed rather than relying on sizes supplied by the manufacturer due to the limitations of the EPS manufacturing process.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the description that follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification and the drawings with the same respective reference numerals. The drawings are not necessarily to scale and in some instances proportions may have been exaggerated in order to more clearly depict certain features of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention discloses both a product and a process relating to foamed siding insulation.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Thermoplastic Siding Insulation</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention discloses a thermoplastic siding insulation member that provides substantial advantages over the prior art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> illustrate the preferred embodiment of a thermoplastic siding insulation member. For clarity, a corresponding vinyl siding panel has been included in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the cross section of a thermoplastic siding insulation member. The front surface <b>30</b> of the cross section of the insulation corresponds to the rear surface <b>62</b> of a vinyl siding panel <b>64</b> to which the insulation will be adhered. More particularly, the front surface <b>30</b> of the thermoplastic siding insulation member includes a plurality of front faces <b>32</b>, each of which are generally sloping, separated by intermediate or mid-butt edges <b>34</b> that connect one face portion to another face portion, corresponding to similar faces on a corresponding rear surface <b>66</b> of a vinyl siding panel <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The rear surface <b>36</b> of the thermoplastic siding insulation member is substantially planar, except for the portion of the rear surface <b>36</b> corresponding to the ledge <b>38</b>, said ledge being described in more particularity below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the upper horizontal end <b>40</b> of the thermoplastic siding insulation member extends beyond the upper horizontal end <b>68</b> of the vinyl siding panel <b>64</b> which includes a fastening hem, and which is operable to receive nails or other fastening devices to affix the assembly to the wall of a building or structure. Conversely, the lower horizontal end <b>70</b> of the vinyl siding panel <b>64</b> extends beyond the lower horizontal end <b>42</b> of the thermoplastic siding insulation member. This configuration allows for a staggered overlapping technique whereby the overlap provided by two vertically adjacent vinyl siding panels occurs at a substantial distance from a corresponding overlap provided by two vertically adjacent thermoplastic siding insulation members. Such a configuration provides increased protection from weather elements to a building or structure, and is described in more particularity as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates two vertically adjacent thermoplastic siding insulation members. The lower horizontal end <b>42</b> of the relatively higher thermoplastic siding insulation member <b>46</b> overlaps the upper horizontal end <b>50</b> of the relatively lower thermoplastic siding insulation member <b>48</b>. Specifically, the upper horizontal end <b>50</b> of the relatively lower thermoplastic siding insulation member <b>48</b> forms a raised lip <b>52</b> from the upper face <b>54</b> of the relatively lower thermoplastic siding insulation member <b>48</b>. The lower horizontal end <b>42</b> of the relatively higher thermoplastic siding insulation member <b>46</b> forms a ledge or skirt <b>38</b>. The distance <b>58</b> between the bottom face of the ledge <b>38</b> and the rear surface of the relatively higher thermoplastic siding insulation member <b>46</b> is approximately equivalent to the distance <b>56</b> between the upper face of the raised lip <b>52</b> and the rear surface of the relatively lower thermoplastic siding insulation member <b>48</b>, such that the raised lip <b>52</b> and the ledge <b>38</b>, when arranged in an overlapping manner as illustrated, come into substantial contact or register with one another as shown. Furthermore, the width <b>88</b> of the raised lip <b>52</b> and the width <b>86</b> of the ledge <b>38</b> are made substantially equivalent such that, when arranged in an overlapping manner, the relatively higher thermoplastic siding insulation member <b>46</b> and the relatively lower thermoplastic siding insulation member <b>50</b> appear vertically to comprise a single panel.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the preferred embodiment of the horizontally adjacent arrangement of two members of thermoplastic siding insulation. In this embodiment, one of the two thermoplastic siding insulation members is designated as the receiving member <b>164</b> and the second of the two thermoplastic siding insulation members is designated as the protruding member <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The protruding member <b>162</b> has an edge or tongue <b>166</b>, being the edge adjacent to the receiving or groove member <b>164</b>, comprising what is known to those skilled in the art as a tongue joint <b>168</b>. The tongue joint <b>168</b> consists of a protrusion from the otherwise planar surface of the edge <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The receiving member <b>164</b> has an edge or groove <b>170</b>, being the edge adjacent to the protruding member <b>162</b>, comprising what is known to those skilled in the art as a groove joint <b>172</b>. The groove joint <b>172</b> consists of a recession from the otherwise planar surface of the edge <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The tongue joint <b>168</b> and the groove joint <b>172</b> are operable to come into contact such that the joint is resistant to separation in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the joint. In the preferred embodiment, the resistance to separation is provided horizontally, as the joint travels vertically along the edges of the protruding member <b>162</b> and receiving member <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The dimensions of the tongue joint <b>168</b> and the groove joint <b>172</b> are preferably determined based on the dimensions of said joints providing the minimum probability of breakage of the joints from the respective thermoplastic insulating members.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an alternate embodiment of the horizontally adjacent arrangement of two members of thermoplastic siding insulation. In this embodiment, the edges <b>166</b>, <b>170</b> of the two members of thermoplastic siding insulation are planar such that when the two members of thermoplastic siding insulation are brought into contact, they abut or share an area of adjacency equivalent to the surface area of the edges <b>166</b>, <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The tongue joint <b>168</b> and the groove joint <b>172</b> may optionally be introduced on the thermoplastic insulating member by the manufacturer following extrusion of the thermoplastic as described below, by any number of means including cutting, grinding, machining and cutting by hot wire, shaving, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Since the thermoplastic insulating members may be manufactured to any length as described below, the tongue joint <b>168</b> and the groove joint <b>172</b> may preferably be introduced on the thermoplastic insulating member by the customer. The tongue joint <b>168</b> may be introduced using the device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>a</i>. The device comprises a solid portion or member <b>102</b> that may be held by an individual and an open portion <b>104</b> that is operable to receive an edge of a thermoplastic insulating member. An inner plane <b>106</b> of the device is operable to shave thermoplastic material from the thermoplastic insulating member, by sliding the device along the edge. The lower plane <b>100</b> of the device is operable to slide along the rear surface <b>36</b> of a thermoplastic insulating member, such that the lower plane <b>100</b> acts as a sort of guide plane. The inlet <b>108</b> of the device, forming a portion of the open portion <b>104</b>, is operable to produce a tongue joint <b>168</b> on the edge of the thermoplastic insulating member. An individual may introduce a tongue joint <b>168</b> on the edge of a thermoplastic insulating member by sliding the device along the edge of the thermoplastic insulating member such that the lower plane <b>100</b> of the device slides along the rear surface <b>36</b> of the member.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The groove joint <b>172</b> may be introduced using the device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref><i>b</i>. The device comprises a solid portion <b>112</b> that may be held by an individual and an open portion <b>114</b> that is operable to receive an edge of a thermoplastic insulating member. An inner plane <b>116</b> of the device is operable to shave thermoplastic material from the thermoplastic insulating member. The lower plane <b>110</b> of the device is operable to slide along the rear surface <b>36</b> of a thermoplastic insulating member, such that the lower plane <b>110</b> acts as a sort of guide plane. The protrusion <b>118</b> of the device, forming a portion of the open portion <b>114</b>, is operable to produce a groove joint <b>172</b> on the edge of the thermoplastic insulating member. An individual may introduce a groove joint <b>172</b> on the edge of a thermoplastic insulating member by sliding the device along the edge of the thermoplastic insulating member such that the lower plane <b>110</b> of the device slides along the rear surface <b>36</b> of the member.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Alternatively, standard selected sizes of panel can be manufactured, and if the standard length needs to be cut, one end can be cut and the device used to form the tongue joint <b>168</b> or groove joint <b>172</b> as needed.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Preferred Thermoplastic Material</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A member of thermoplastic siding insulation may preferably be formed using foamed plastic that is generally selected from the group of polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene. In one embodiment a panel of thermoplastic siding insulation comprises a polystyrene with substantially smaller closed cell dimensions than the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The use of a small closed cell dimension substantially reduces the size and number of voids produced in a styrene foam sheet. Consequently, there is a greatly reduced chance of moisture collection, rotting, and bacteria growth using the product of the present invention than with the prior art.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Adhesion to Siding Panel</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A member of thermoplastic siding insulation disclosed by the present invention may be affixed to a panel of siding using an adhesive. The member of thermoplastic siding insulation disclosed by the present invention may be operable to affix to the panel of siding using a permanently flexible adhesive or a rigid adhesive. Regardless of the rigidity of adhesive used, such affixation will reduce or not exhibit the phenomenon of oil-canning.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, the member of thermoplastic siding insulation disclosed by the present invention affixed to the panel of siding using a bead or line of adhesive will reduce or not exhibit the phenomenon of telegraphing.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Method for Producing Thermoplastic Siding Insulation</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> generally illustrates the extruder <b>2</b> for producing a thermoplastic material or product <b>4</b> which shall be more fully described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Generally speaking the polystyrene material starts off as thermoplastic solids <b>10</b> which may comprise of pellets or the like that are introduced into a hopper <b>12</b> at an input end <b>14</b> of the extruder <b>2</b>. The extruder includes a barrel <b>16</b> which extends generally axially along the length of the extruder <b>2</b> about an axis <b>18</b>. The extruder <b>2</b> includes a screw conveyer <b>20</b> co-axially disposed inside the barrel <b>16</b> along the axis <b>18</b>. The screw conveyer <b>20</b> is adapted for relative rotatable movement about the axis <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In particular the screw conveyer <b>20</b> comprises a core <b>25</b> and an external flight or helical screw <b>26</b> for defining a passage <b>28</b> for conveying thermoplastic solid material <b>10</b> from the input end <b>14</b> to a thermoplastic melt zone <b>60</b> disposed between the input <b>14</b> and output <b>24</b> so as to melt the thermoplastic solid material <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The flights <b>26</b> of the screw conveyer <b>20</b> are arranged so as to convey the thermoplastic material to the passage <b>28</b> from the input <b>14</b> to the melt zone generally illustrated as <b>60</b> to the output <b>24</b> as the screw conveyer <b>20</b> rotates in a direction A about the axis <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The flights <b>26</b> of the screw conveyer <b>20</b> also convey melted thermoplastic material from the thermoplastic melt zone to the output <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In operation as the screw conveyer <b>20</b> rotates along the axis <b>18</b> in a direction A thermoplastic solid material <b>10</b> is conveyed along the passage <b>28</b> from the input end <b>14</b> through to the melt zone <b>60</b> where the thermoplastic solid material <b>10</b> is melted as it is being conveyed to the output end <b>24</b>. The melted thermoplastic material continues along the passage <b>28</b> to the output end <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The extruder <b>2</b> also includes means <b>80</b> for changing the characteristic of the thermoplastic solids <b>10</b>. The means <b>80</b> comprises an aperture <b>82</b> which is disposed through the barrel <b>16</b> so as permit a user to add thermoplastic modifying material <b>84</b> into the melted thermoplastic material. Such means <b>80</b> would typically be at the point at which a blowing or foaming agent would be injected to produce the foamed insulating member.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Such means <b>80</b> for changing the characteristic of the thermoplastic material can comprise the addition of a substance selected from the group of thermoplastic pigment, dyes, thermoplastic resin, blowing or foaming agents, or other thermoplastic modifiers to the passage <b>28</b>. For example the thermoplastic pigment may be added through the aperture <b>80</b> which is mixed with the melted thermoplastic material so as to change the colour of the melted thermoplastic material. Alternatively ultra violet stabilizers or other thermoplastic resin may be added thereto so as to change the characteristic of the melted thermoplastic material. Alternatively thermoplastic modifiers could be added to change the properties of the melted thermoplastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example the thermoplastic solid material <b>10</b> may comprise of any variety of thermoplastic material which is well known to those persons skilled in the art including polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene. Once the thermoplastic material is melted in the melt zone <b>60</b> upstream of the aperture <b>82</b> in the passage <b>28</b> such melted material would be generally homogeneous. Blowing agents may be added to the extruder <b>2</b> in a manner well known to those persons skilled in the art so as to produce an expanded extruded profile that may be cut to length.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The output end <b>24</b> includes a plate assembly <b>90</b> which includes a plate opening <b>92</b> for communication with the passage <b>28</b>. The plate assembly <b>90</b> may be operable to attach to the output end <b>24</b> by a fastening means such as, for example, a threaded attachment allowing the plate assembly <b>90</b> to screw onto the output end <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">More specifically the plate assembly <b>90</b> includes a plurality of holes <b>92</b> each spaced apart by a distance <b>96</b> approximately equivalent to the amount that the material extruded through a hole <b>94</b> will expand to come into contact with the material extruded through an adjacent hole <b>98</b>. The material extruded in each hole may be referred to as a strand. Each strand will naturally form a skin before coming into contact with an adjacent strand, as it exits the plate assembly <b>90</b>. Since this skinning process occurs prior to the strand becoming fused to adjacent strands, the strength of the foam increases and the moisture absorption of the foam is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The plurality of holes <b>94</b> can be positioned such that the totality of extruded material is outputted from the output end <b>24</b> of the extruder <b>2</b> in a predetermined shape. The extruded material in the predetermined shape is then passed through a sizing or forming block <b>120</b> to smooth the surface of the extruded shape. The sizing or forming block <b>120</b> includes a passage <b>122</b> that forms the outline of the extruded shape.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The sizing or forming block <b>120</b> may preferably be placed approximately 3 inches from the output end <b>24</b> of the extruder <b>2</b>. The sizing or forming block <b>120</b> is typically cooled and therefore typically causes the outer surface of the insulating member to form a higher density foam that EPS. Due to this density difference, the insulating member has higher strength than EPS. Each of the plurality of holes <b>94</b> may generally be round but could be any shape to facilitate manufacturing of the final shape. Each of the plurality of holes <b>94</b> may preferably between 40 and 50 thousandths of an inch in diameter, where they are round.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Furthermore, the extruder <b>2</b> can be operated so as to produce a substantially continuous extruded material which generally exits the output <b>24</b> as a profile portion the predetermined shape. The continuous extruded material may be produced in any desired length.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The preferred embodiment of the predetermined shape corresponding to the profile of the plurality of holes <b>92</b> of the plate assembly <b>90</b> is equivalent to the cross section of the thermoplastic siding insulation member illustrated above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The temperature of the extruder <b>2</b> may be operated in a manner well known to those persons skilled in the art and in one example the hopper temperature may be operated at 105&#xb0; C. while the heating zone <b>60</b> is operated at 160&#xb0; C. and the output <b>24</b> operated at approximately 80&#xb0; C. These temperatures, however, are given by way of example only and should not be limited to the invention described herein as other operating temperatures may be utilized depending on the thermoplastic material utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">During cooling of the extruded thermoplastic insulation through the cooled sizing or forming block <b>120</b> an outer skin is developed which has a different density that the inner portion of the insulation. This skin adds strength to the product and provides a barrier to moisture and bacterial growth providing a superior product to the EPS foam backerboard produced by hot wire cutting from large blocks. Furthermore in the EPS method there is substantial waste, smoke, and pollution when the insulating members are cut from solid blocks. Little if any waste is produced from the extruded polystyrene foamed insulation as it is all recycled.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Various embodiments of the invention have now been described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Since changes in and/or additions to the above-described best mode may be made without departing from the nature, spirit or scope of the invention, the invention is not to be limited to said details.</p>
