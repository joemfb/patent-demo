<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Reference is made to commonly-assigned copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/445,125, filed Apr. 12, 2012, entitled SHAPED ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR, by Schindler et al.; the disclosure of which is incorporated herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to electric motors in general and in particular to electric motors having a flat armature wherein the armature comprises a conductive pattern formed on an insulating substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electric motors are used in a wide variety of applications. In many of these applications, the weight of the motor is of critical importance. For example, in an electric car the overall weight of the vehicle is an important factor limiting the distance that the vehicle can be operated given a fixed battery capacity. However, given current designs, the electric motor itself can be among the heavier components in the vehicle. Thus while it is desirable to provide an electric motor have a high-power output for vehicle use, it is also desirable to have such a motor remain at a lower weight.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It will be appreciated that lighter weight electrical motors are otherwise desirable in many other applications as such motors and the manufactured goods in which such electric motors are incorporated are more easily transported, carried, manipulated, and used. Further, cost reductions and recycling advantages can be obtained where weight reductions are achieved by lighter weight electrical motors that require less material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, conventional wound motor designs do not readily lend themselves to weight reduction. One reason for this is that conventional wound coil motor designs require an armature or a stator having coiled conductors thereon. The coils are typically formed by winding wire on metallic laminates. The laminates provide shaped features about which the coils, typically made from a metal such as copper, can be wound.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">These laminates add significant mass to the motor. This mass affects the operation of the system in which the motor is used by lowering the power-to-weight ratio of the system. In some cases, eddy currents can arise in the laminates, further reducing motor efficiency and lowering power-to-weight ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of an armature, the laminate mass can cause motor inefficiency in two additional ways. First, this laminate mass increases the inertia that must be overcome to start and stop rotation. Second, the laminate mass is at a distance from the axis of rotation of the armature. In an armature that has a shaft that has any eccentricity, or that has laminates that are not aligned with the shaft, this can create static and dynamic balance problems that consume energy. Additionally, shaft eccentricity and misaligned laminates affect the placement of the windings on the laminates, so the effects of any shaft eccentricity or laminate misalignment are further enhanced by the mass of the windings.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One effort to reduce the use of such laminates involves pancake or flat motors. Conventional flat motors are used in a variety of applications. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,076,808 describes a flat vibration motor, such as can be used in a cellular telephone. EP 0548362A1 describes construction of a typical prior-art flat motor, also known as a &#x201c;pancake motor.&#x201d; The example described is a flat coreless DC motor having flat armature coils mounted on a disk. The coils are wound into sectors of the disk. The disk can be the rotor and can be mounted over a stator including a field magnet. When current is passed through the coils via a commutator, the rotor turns.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various ways of manufacturing pancake motors, and specifically windings and rotors for pancake motors, have been described. WO 2009/038648 describes applying insulating material over a pre-formed electrical conductor and heating the assembly to activate an adhesive that bonds the insulating material to the conductor. However, this requires an insulator that includes the heat-activated adhesive, and requires that the conductors be formed to shape before being insulated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0105237 describes a stator for a planar linear motor. The stator includes magnetic sheets (i.e., sheets of a material that can complete a magnetic circuit) set vertically and bound together, e.g., using a fluid hardening material or an epoxy resin.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, such pancake motors use laminate structures that extend typically further from an axis of rotation than do conventional motors, creating increased balance problems, and adding weight. Further such motors have limited performance characteristics compared to conventional wound laminate motors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">What is needed in the art are motors that provide conventional performance characteristics while offering reduced motor mass. What is also needed in the art are new methods for motor manufacture.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Briefly, according to one aspect of the present invention a method of making a shaped electrical conductor includes providing a first sheet of metal having a first thickness and applying a first thermoplastic adhesive pattern to a first surface. A second thermoplastic adhesive pattern is applied to a second surface and is fully justified with the first pattern. The first sheet is etched to remove metal not covered by the thermoplastic adhesive patterns so that no metal bridges remain between disconnected coated portions of the first sheet. A second sheet of metal having a second thickness is provided and a third thermoplastic adhesive pattern is applied to a first surface of the second sheet. A fourth thermoplastic adhesive pattern is applied to a second surface of the second sheet and is fully justified with the third pattern. The second sheet is etched to remove metal not covered by the thermoplastic adhesive patterns so that no metal bridges remain between disconnected coated portions of the second sheet. A first contact region is selected in the second adhesive pattern and a second contact region in the third adhesive pattern and the second and third adhesive patterns are bonded to each other at more than one point. The first and second sheets are joined so that the first contact region is in electrical contact with the second contact region.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows various embodiments of methods of making a shaped electrical conductor. Processing begins with step <b>210</b> or step <b>250</b>. In step <b>210</b>, a first sheet of metal having a first thickness is provided. The first sheet of metal, and other sheets of metal described herein, can be any electrically-conductive metal. For example, copper or aluminum can be used. Step <b>210</b> is followed by step <b>215</b> and step <b>220</b>, which can be performed in any order.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In step <b>215</b>, a first thermoplastic adhesive pattern is applied to a first surface of the first sheet. The term &#x201c;adhesive,&#x201d; as used herein, does not require a pressure-sensitive adhesive, or one that is tacky under normal environmental conditions. An adhesive has the capability of adhering during bonding, described below with reference to step <b>290</b>, but is not necessarily a glue, tape, cement, or epoxy (although it can be any of those in various embodiments). In various embodiments, step <b>215</b> includes steps <b>217</b> and <b>225</b>. Step <b>215</b> is followed by step <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In step <b>217</b>, an electrophotographic print engine is used to deposit thermoplastic particles in a corresponding deposition pattern. Electrophotography can also be used for steps <b>220</b>, <b>255</b>, and <b>260</b>. More detail of electrophotographic deposition is given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, discussed below. The first plastic pattern can also be applied by flood-coating or spin-coating over a mask that defines the deposition pattern. Step <b>217</b> is followed by step <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In step <b>218</b>, the deposited particles are fixed to the corresponding sheet under heat or pressure. This is also described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and can also be used in steps <b>220</b>, <b>255</b>, and <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In step <b>220</b>, a second thermoplastic adhesive pattern is applied to a second surface of the first sheet. The second pattern is fully justified with the applied first pattern. &#x201c;Fully justified&#x201d; means that, within tolerances, the first and second thermoplastic adhesive patterns overlap completely as viewed along a normal to the first sheet. In various embodiments, the first and second thermoplastic patterns are mirror-images of each other. As a result, within tolerances, at any point on the first sheet, a ray passing through the point along the normal to the sheet at that point either passes through both the first and second thermoplastic patterns, or through neither pattern. Step <b>220</b> is followed by step <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In step <b>225</b>, the first sheet is etched to remove metal not covered by the thermoplastic adhesive patterns so that no metal bridges remain between disconnected coated portions of the first sheet. Since the metal is covered on both sides by the fully justified first and second thermoplastic patterns, the sheet will be etched through where the patterns are absent, and protected where the patterns are present. Some under-cutting due to over-etching can occur at the edges of protected areas. Step <b>225</b> is followed by step <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In step <b>250</b>, a second sheet of metal having a second thickness is provided. This is as described above with reference to step <b>210</b>. Step <b>250</b> is followed by step <b>255</b> and step <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In step <b>255</b>, a third thermoplastic adhesive pattern is applied to a first surface of the second sheet. This is as described above with reference to step <b>215</b>. The third thermoplastic adhesive pattern can be the same as, or different from, either the first or second thermoplastic adhesive patterns. Step <b>255</b> is followed by step <b>265</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In step <b>260</b>, a fourth thermoplastic adhesive pattern is applied to a second surface of the second sheet, the fourth pattern being fully justified with the applied third pattern (as above, step <b>220</b>; same or different, as in step <b>255</b>). Step <b>260</b> is followed by step <b>265</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In step <b>265</b>, the second sheet is etched to remove metal not covered by the thermoplastic adhesive patterns so that no metal bridges remain between disconnected coated portions of the second sheet. This is as discussed above with reference to step <b>225</b>. Step <b>265</b> is followed by step <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The result of steps up to 290 is a pair of metal sheets carrying patterned conductors. The first and second patterns can be the same as, or different from, the third and fourth patterns. The first and second metal sheets can be at least 0.1 mm thick. At least one of the thermoplastic adhesive patterns can include a plurality of traces (e.g., lines, curves, or segments thereof), each having a trace width less than 2 mm (e.g., 50 mil=1.25 mm). Spaces between traces can have space widths less than 2 mm (e.g., 50 mil=1.25 mm). Traces and spaces can also be 2 mm or wider.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In step <b>280</b>, a first contact region in the second adhesive pattern is selected. In step <b>285</b>, a second contact region in the third adhesive pattern is selected. Steps <b>280</b> and <b>285</b> can be performed in any order. The first and second contact regions are selected so that current will be able to flow through the conductors. An example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Steps <b>280</b> and <b>285</b> are followed by step <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step <b>290</b>, the second and third adhesive patterns are bonded to each other at more than one point. The sheets are brought together so that the second and third patterns can be bonded. No orientation of the sheets is implied by the designation of certain patterns as the second and third. Step <b>290</b> is followed by step <b>295</b> and optional step <b>292</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step <b>295</b>, the first and second sheets are mated so that the first contact region is in electrical contact with the second contact region. Step <b>295</b> can be performed as described with reference to optional steps <b>292</b> and <b>294</b>. Step <b>295</b> is followed by optional step <b>297</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In optional step <b>292</b>, the two sheets are heated and pressed together to bond them. This step can be used with toner-based thermoplastic patterns by heating the patterns above their glass transition temperatures T<sub>g</sub>. The patterns are then pressed together to squeeze toner out from between the metal in the first and second contact regions, so that the metal areas in the two sheets come into electrical contact. The toner is then cooled below T<sub>g </sub>to fix the sheets together. This type of bonding is described below with respect to fuser <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the context of fusing toner to a receiver. In other embodiments, conductive toner can be used, or not all the toner squeezed out from between the sheets in the contact areas. In other embodiments, toner can be removed from the first and second contact regions by softening the toner (temperature &#x3e;T<sub>g</sub>) with a heat source, then removing the toner with a skive, vacuum, blow-off gun, abrasion wheel, or other mechanical device adapted to move or remove viscous toner. The heat source can be part of the device; for example, a heated skive can be used to simultaneously heat and move the toner. Step <b>292</b> is followed by step <b>295</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In optional step <b>294</b>, the mating step includes applying a conductive adhesive to the first or second contact region and bringing the two contact regions into mechanical contact with the applied adhesive. For example, dimethyl, methylhydrogen siloxane, e.g., DOW CORNING 7920, can be used. Silver-containing siloxane, e.g., DOW CORNING&#xae; DA 6524, can also be used. Adhesives can include &#x3e;80 wt % silver, or 90 wt % silver. Step <b>294</b> is followed by step <b>295</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In optional step <b>297</b>, the mating step includes soldering or welding the first contact region and the second contact region together.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In various embodiments, steps corresponding to steps <b>210</b>, <b>215</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>225</b> are performed to apply fifth and sixth fully-registered thermoplastic patterns on a third metal sheet having a third thickness. The third sheet is then etched. This is as described above. Contact areas are selected in the fourth and fifth thermoplastic layers, and the second and third sheets are bonded and mated as described above (steps <b>290</b>, <b>295</b>). This forms a three-metal-sheet structure. The thicknesses of the metal sheets can be the same as or different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In various embodiments, a third sheet of metal having a third thickness is provided. A fifth thermoplastic adhesive pattern is applied to a first surface of the third sheet, and a sixth thermoplastic adhesive pattern fully justified with the applied fifth pattern is applied to a second surface of the third sheet. The third sheet is etched to remove metal not covered by the thermoplastic adhesive patterns so that no metal bridges remain between disconnected coated portions of the third sheet. This is as described above for the first and second sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A third contact region is then selected in the fourth adhesive pattern, e.g., as described above for the first contact region. A fourth contact region is selected in the fifth adhesive pattern, e.g., as described above for the second contact region. The fourth and fifth adhesive patterns are bonded to each other at more than one point, resulting in a structure with three metal layers: the first and second metal layers bonded to each other, and the second and third metal layers bonded to each other. The second and third sheets are then mated, as described above, so that the third contact region is in electrical contact with the fourth contact region.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a top view of various examples of patterns. First pattern <b>311</b> (and also the second, hidden in the top view since the patterns are in register) is shown solid; third pattern <b>333</b> (and the fourth pattern) is shown dashed. The edges of the patterns are shown; for example, the dashed shape of third pattern <b>333</b> encloses the area in the pattern where thermoplastic and metal are intended to be. In the example shown here, the first and second patterns are circular and the third and fourth patterns are elliptical spirals. The long axis of the elliptical spirals (e.g., third pattern <b>333</b>) is twice a length of an axis of the first and second circular patterns (first pattern <b>311</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">First contact region <b>315</b> in second adhesive pattern (hidden under first adhesive pattern <b>311</b>) is a small disk. Second contact region <b>335</b> in third pattern <b>333</b> is a slightly larger disk. The two contact regions <b>315</b>, <b>335</b> overlay, forming electrical contact between the metal protected from etching in regions <b>315</b>, <b>335</b>. As a result, current into electrode <b>360</b> defined by third pattern <b>333</b> travels through the spiral conductor defined by third pattern <b>333</b>, the conductor defined by second contact region <b>335</b>, the conductor defined by first contact region <b>315</b>, electrode <b>370</b> defined by first pattern <b>311</b>, the circle defined by first pattern <b>311</b>, and out electrode <b>380</b> defined by first pattern <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Corners in the patterns can be chamfered or not. The width of the pattern can vary or not at various points on the pattern; the example shown does not vary the width of the pattern at corners.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a cross-section along the line <b>3</b>B-<b>3</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. First conductor <b>610</b> is defined by first pattern <b>311</b> and second pattern <b>312</b>. In this section, two segments of conductor <b>610</b> are visible. Second conductor <b>630</b> is defined by third pattern <b>333</b> and fourth pattern <b>334</b>. Conductor <b>630</b> is shown below conductor <b>610</b>, but can be above it. In this section, twelve segments of conductor <b>630</b> are visible. First conductor <b>610</b> and second conductor <b>630</b> are, respectively, the etched first and second metal sheets <b>319</b>, <b>339</b>. First contact region <b>315</b> and second contact region <b>335</b> are shown electrically connected by conductive adhesive <b>355</b> to carry current between them. In the embodiment shown, toner has been removed from first contact region <b>315</b> and second contact region <b>335</b> prior to applying conductive adhesive <b>355</b>, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">First pattern <b>311</b> is formed in first metal sheet <b>319</b>. For clarity, metal sheet <b>319</b> is labeled on only one of the visible conductor segments. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, all of the visible conductor segments corresponding to first pattern <b>311</b> are part of metal sheet <b>319</b>. Likewise, second pattern <b>312</b> is formed on second metal sheet <b>339</b>. The sides of the segments of first metal sheet <b>319</b> and second metal sheet <b>339</b> are shown undercut to represent graphically the possibility of over-etching of the metal sheet. No particular cross-sectional shape of the conductor segments is required.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">First metal sheet <b>319</b> has first thermoplastic pattern <b>311</b> on its top surface and second thermoplastic pattern <b>312</b> on its bottom surface. Second metal sheet <b>339</b> has third thermoplastic pattern <b>333</b> on its top surface and fourth thermoplastic pattern <b>334</b> on its bottom surface. For clarity, only one segment is labeled, even though the thermoplastic patterns are continuous within a layer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. As shown, second thermoplastic pattern <b>312</b> and third thermoplastic pattern <b>333</b> have been pressed together to bond first metal sheet <b>319</b> to second metal sheet <b>339</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In various embodiments of the use of this structure as a motor winding, fluid is passed through the winding as indicated by the &#x201c;FLUID FLOW&#x201d; arrow. The fluid can be ethylene glycol, deionized water, air, nitrogen, or another fluid adapted to remove Joule heat from the conductors in metal sheets <b>319</b>, <b>339</b>. Fluid can be pumped or otherwise moved actively, or permitted to flow passively by convection.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, bonding area <b>390</b> (shown hatched with horizontal lines) is an area in which the second and third patterns overlap. Consequently, when first metal sheet <b>319</b> and second metal sheet <b>339</b> are bonded together, the thermoplastic adhesive of second pattern <b>312</b> and of third pattern <b>333</b> in bonding area <b>390</b> adhere to each other. This adhesion of metal sheets <b>319</b>, <b>339</b> to each other provides mechanical strength to the resulting assembly. In various embodiments, a plurality of the regions of overlap between second pattern <b>312</b> and third pattern <b>333</b>, or all of the overlap regions, are bonding regions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> show several bonding regions hatched with horizontal lines. Other bonding regions besides those shown hatched can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In various embodiments described above in which three sheets of metal are used, the fifth thermoplastic pattern (not shown) is a rotation of first thermoplastic pattern <b>311</b>. That is, respective rotation centers of the first and fifth thermoplastic patterns are aligned and the fifth thermoplastic pattern is rotated about its rotation center with respect to first thermoplastic pattern <b>311</b>. Other than the rotation, the fifth thermoplastic pattern is identical to first thermoplastic pattern <b>311</b> (within manufacturing tolerances). Since the fifth and sixth thermoplastic patterns are fully justified, the sixth thermoplastic pattern is also a rotation of second thermoplastic pattern <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As is shown here, the motor so formed does not have a laminate portion and therefore can have reduced mass and density as compared to the prior art. Moreover, in embodiments in which no laminate or other core is used, there are no losses due to in-core eddy currents.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a partial perspective view showing a pancake motor according to the prior art. The pancake motor is brushless motor having housing with upper housing <b>410</b> and lower housing <b>412</b>. Printed circuit board (PCB) <b>420</b> is installed in upper housing <b>410</b>. Stator <b>430</b> is disposed over underside <b>429</b> of PCB <b>420</b>. Stator <b>430</b> includes a plurality of coil layers piled up on top of each other, e.g., by photolithography. Rotor <b>440</b> is spaced apart from the lower surface of stator <b>430</b> and includes permanent magnets <b>442</b> disposed at an inner peripheral surface of rotor <b>440</b>. The permanent magnets have opposite orientations as they are around the rotor, as shown (alternating N and S poles facing down). Rotating shaft <b>460</b> is rotatably connected to upper housing <b>410</b> by a bearing in opening <b>415</b>, and an electric signal control unit <b>470</b> installed at an end portion of the PCB <b>420</b> and periodically supplying electric current to stator <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">PCB <b>420</b> includes an annular base <b>421</b> and an elongated plate <b>423</b> integrally formed at an end portion of annular base <b>421</b>. Elongated plate <b>423</b> extends out of upper housing <b>410</b> through opening <b>418</b> formed at a side wall of upper housing <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Stator <b>430</b> can be formed over underside <b>429</b> of PCB <b>420</b> by photolithography. In various embodiments, a conductive material such as copper is applied on underside <b>429</b> of PCB <b>420</b> to form a copper layer. A photo-active solution is deposited over the copper, and a photo mask on which the coil shape is printed is placed on the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the photo mask is irradiated, a coil shape that is similar to the photo mask is patterned on the surface of the solution on the copper layer. After exposure, an etching solution is applied to PCB <b>420</b>. The etching solution reacts with the photoactive layer and copper layer so that a first coil layer is formed, i.e., by removing undesired copper. After forming the first coil layer, a first insulation layer is formed on the underside of the first coil layer. Multiple conductive layers can be formed in this way, and vias can be drilled and plated between them to connect them.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Rotor <b>440</b> is spaced apart from the underside of stator <b>430</b> by the predetermined distance. Rotor <b>440</b> has a cylindrical shape, and has permanent magnets <b>442</b> which are radially disposed on an upper surface of rotor <b>440</b> in such a manner that adjacent permanent magnets <b>442</b> have different poles from each other to generate a magnetic field which makes electromagnetic-interaction with the electric field of stator <b>430</b> to rotate rotor <b>440</b>, rotating shaft <b>460</b> is integrally formed at a center of rotor <b>440</b>, so as to rotate when rotor <b>440</b> rotates.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Upper housing <b>410</b> is formed at an upper portion thereof with a circular opening <b>415</b>, and an upper and lower bearings <b>452</b> and <b>454</b> are mounted at an inner portion of upper housing <b>410</b>. Accordingly, rotating shaft <b>460</b> is rotatably attached to upper housing <b>410</b> by upper and lower bearings <b>452</b> and <b>454</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Upper housing <b>410</b> includes bracket <b>413</b> formed on the bottom edge thereof, including hole <b>411</b>. Lower housing <b>412</b> includes bracket <b>414</b> formed on the top edge thereof, including hole <b>481</b>. A fixing member <b>416</b> such as a bolt penetrates holes <b>411</b> and <b>481</b> so that upper and lower housings <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> are integrally assembled. Other assembly techniques can also be used. Multiple brackets per housing can also be used, as shown here.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-section of a pancake motor according to various embodiments. This section is taken along the line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">There are two commonly-used types of configurations of pancake motor windings. In a first configuration type, wires are arranged to extend substantially radially on rotor <b>515</b>, and to be substantially straight where they pass magnets <b>442</b>D, <b>442</b>E. The Lorentz force on the charge carriers in the conductors is tangential, in accordance with Fleming's left-hand rule for motors. In some of these configurations, individual wires extend radially out rotor <b>515</b>, past one magnet (e.g., magnet <b>442</b>D), then radially back in past a different magnet (e.g., magnet <b>442</b>E). In other configurations, squared-off spiral windings in the plane of rotor <b>515</b> are used, and the tangential portions of those spirals are arranged beyond magnets <b>442</b>D, <b>442</b>E so they do not contribute significant radial Lorentz forces. The sections of the spirals that pass the magnets contribute tangential forces.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a second type of configurations, the wires are formed into tight, approximately circular spirals. These coils act as solenoids and produce distinct north and south magnetic poles when current is passed through them. These poles attract and repel the poles of magnets <b>442</b>D, <b>442</b>E, providing tangential forces.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this example, rotor <b>515</b> is mounted on bearings <b>518</b>. Shaft <b>510</b> is connected to the center of rotor <b>515</b> to transmit rotary motion. Magnets <b>442</b>D, <b>442</b>E, which can be permanent magnets or electromagnets, are attached on one face of rotor <b>515</b>. Any number of magnets can be used, arranged in a circle around the face of rotor <b>515</b>, as shown by magnets <b>442</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Rotor <b>515</b> can also include optional bracket supporting optional magnets <b>521</b>. Arrows indicate the direction of the magnetic field between magnets <b>442</b>D, <b>442</b>E, and <b>521</b>. Other configurations can be used, such as magnets only over or only under the stator, magnets around the stator, or combinations of these. The shaft can pass through an opening in the stator, and can be attached to the top or bottom of the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Stator <b>550</b> is arranged opposite magnets <b>442</b>D, <b>442</b>E, or between those and magnets <b>521</b>. Stator <b>550</b> includes first conductor <b>610</b> defined by first and second thermoplastic patterns <b>311</b>, <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Stator <b>550</b> also includes second conductor <b>630</b> defined by third and fourth thermoplastic patterns <b>333</b>, <b>334</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). In this section, two segments of each conductor <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> are visible. The direction of current flow in each segment is shown by vector symbols. As shown, the direction of force on each conductor segment F is to the right according to the left-hand rule (pointer finger for magnetic field direction, middle finger for current direction; thumb for resultant force on the conductor). Since the stator is fixed, the equal and opposite force turns the rotor, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>

For clarity, only the centerline of the conductors in each pattern is shown; the patterns are broader than the indicated centerlines. First pattern <b>311</b> is shown solid and third pattern <b>333</b> is shown dashed. First pattern <b>311</b> defines first conductor <b>610</b>; third pattern <b>333</b> defines second conductor <b>630</b>, which is formed from the second metal sheet. The configuration of conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> and AC supply <b>609</b> shown here is a stator; rotors can also be formed as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Where patterns <b>311</b>, <b>333</b> overlap, e.g., at bonding area <b>390</b>, conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> are bonded together for mechanical support. In various embodiments, a rotor for a brushless motor is formed. Rotors or stators can have two or any higher number of layers.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For clarity, conductors <b>610</b> and <b>630</b> are shown passing only once around the stator.

The magnets can be over or under the stator, e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Arrows on conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> represent the direction of current I in those conductors, and arrows orthogonal to conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> represent the direction of force F. The direction of the magnetic field from each magnet is shown by standard vector symbols (dots and crosses). Magnets <b>442</b>A, <b>442</b>C, <b>442</b>E, and <b>442</b>G have the magnetic field (N-S) into the plane of the drawing. Magnets <b>442</b>B, <b>442</b>D, <b>442</b>F, and <b>442</b>H have the magnetic field (N-S) out of the plane of the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Where conductor <b>630</b> passes magnet <b>442</b>A (i.e., crosses over or under, or passes near or adjacent to, magnet <b>442</b>A), the direction of current flow is in towards the center of the stator, as shown. The magnetic field is into the page. The resulting force on the stator is clockwise, as shown. Since the stator is fixed, the equal and opposite reaction will drive the rotor counter-clockwise. Conductor <b>610</b> is arranged so that the current through conductor <b>610</b> where it passes magnet <b>442</b>A is also towards the center of the stator, so the force on the stator is also clockwise, as shown. Current is also inward, and force on the stator clockwise, where conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> pass magnets <b>442</b>C, <b>442</b>E, and <b>442</b>G.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this example, the forces from conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> where they pass magnet <b>442</b>A are not entirely tangential. This is because conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> are not entirely radial where they pass magnet <b>442</b>A. Conductors can be entirely radial or not, as long as the tangential components of the forces from the magnets sum to provide torque in a particular direction. Tangential arcs <b>619</b>, <b>639</b> are shown for comparison between the directions of the force vectors and the tangential directions.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Where conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> pass magnet <b>442</b>D (and also magnets <b>442</b>B, <b>442</b>F, and <b>442</b>H), current flow is away from the center of the stator. Magnetic field is directed out of the page. Since the directions of current flow and magnetic field are both reversed from the situation over magnet <b>442</b>A, the force on the stator is still clockwise, so the rotor is driven counterclockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the rotor rotates so that magnet <b>442</b>B is passing the stator conductors that formerly passed magnet <b>442</b>A, AC supply <b>609</b> reverses polarity. Current is provided into conductor <b>610</b> and out of conductor <b>630</b>, so that the direction of force continues to be clockwise and the direction of rotation counterclockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In embodiments in which conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> form a rotor, the conductors are driven clockwise. In these embodiments, brushes can be used to transmit current between AC supply <b>609</b> and conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b>. In normal operation, the polarity of AC supply <b>609</b> reverses once per magnet, so current over magnet <b>442</b>A is directed inward in the position shown, and also inward after &#x215b; revolution of the rotor together with a polarity change of AC supply <b>609</b>. To change the direction of rotation of the motor, the polarity of AC supply <b>609</b> over each magnet is reversed. That is, in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, current over magnet <b>442</b>A is directed outward rather than inward.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown, contact regions <b>315</b>, <b>335</b> are not centered in the stator. They can be centered (e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) or not. In embodiments in which conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> are used as a rotor, an axle can be attached at center of rotation <b>628</b>. In various embodiments, particularly rotor embodiments, it is desirable to mechanically balance conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> to reduce lateral forces acting at center of rotation <b>628</b>. Static or dynamic balance, or both, can be desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In various embodiments, first pattern <b>311</b>, third pattern <b>333</b>, or both, along with corresponding second or fourth patterns, include balancing features that give the rotor uniform centrifugal force as it rotates past a selected observation point. Specifically, the first and second patterns, or the third and fourth patterns, define or include balancing features in the metal not removed from the corresponding metal sheet by the corresponding etching step. The balancing features can be located in areas of the patterns <b>311</b>, <b>333</b> that do not pass any magnets (e.g., <b>442</b>A).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this example, balancing feature <b>615</b> is an area of conductor <b>610</b> of the same mass as contact area <b>315</b>, disposed diametrically opposite contact area <b>315</b> with respect to center of rotation <b>628</b>. Consequently, while conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> rotate, contact area <b>315</b> and balancing feature <b>615</b> exert on the axis of rotation centrifugal forces equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces cancel out to maintain balance. Likewise, balancing features <b>635</b>A, <b>635</b>B together exert a centrifugal force cancelling out that of contact area <b>335</b>. A balancing feature can include one or more areas of additional mass, or one or more areas of reduced mass. Mass can be reduced, e.g., by thinning the conductors. Balancing features can also include extra mass along the length of conductors <b>610</b> or <b>630</b> except for certain areas. In this way, mass can effectively be reduced to balance, but without reducing the current-carrying capacity of the conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In another example, one or more balancing features <b>616</b> can be frangible. A frangible balancing feature can be separated from the conductor <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> of which it is part. This separation can be performed after manufacture of a complete motor, or after bonding step <b>290</b> or mating step <b>295</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Separation can provide balance adjustments to improve dynamic or static balance. Frangible balancing feature <b>616</b> can be connected to a conductor <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> with a perforated pattern or narrow neck that can be fractured, or with metal that is stamped or punched thinner than the rest of the metal sheet <b>319</b>, <b>339</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). In various embodiments, the metal sheet (e.g., sheet <b>319</b> or <b>339</b>) corresponding to frangible balancing feature <b>616</b> can be stamped or punched to define break line <b>617</b> (e.g., of thinner or perforated metal) along which frangible balancing feature <b>616</b> can be separated from the corresponding metal sheet <b>319</b>, <b>339</b>. In the example shown here, feature <b>616</b> is attached to conductor <b>610</b> at a bend thereof, along two perforated break lines <b>617</b> (for clarity, only one is shown).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3B</figref>, in other embodiments forming a rotor using conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b>, one or more of the conductors <b>610</b>, <b>630</b> is deliberately unbalanced. For example, first pattern <b>311</b> and second pattern <b>312</b> can define optional unbalanced feature <b>657</b>. Feature <b>657</b> is an area of metal not etched from first metal sheet <b>319</b> that is not balanced by a corresponding feature opposite center of rotation <b>628</b> from feature <b>657</b>. As a result, when the rotor spins, it will vibrate. This can be used for non-audio indication, e.g., in a cellular telephone. Feature <b>657</b> can be positioned and sized to produce a desired vibration. More than one unbalanced feature can be included. Specifically, first and second patterns <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, or third and fourth patterns <b>333</b>, <b>334</b>, can define an unbalanced feature <b>657</b> in the metal not removed from the corresponding metal sheet <b>319</b>, <b>339</b> by the corresponding etching step.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The electrophotographic (EP) printing process can be embodied in devices including printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimiles, and analog or digital devices, all of which are referred to herein as &#x201c;printers.&#x201d; Electrostatographic printers such as electrophotographic printers that employ toner developed on an electrophotographic receiver can be used, as can ionographic printers and copiers that do not rely upon an electrophotographic receiver. Electrophotography and ionography are types of electrostatography (printing using electrostatic fields), which is a subset of electrography (printing using electric fields).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">A digital reproduction printing system (&#x201c;printer&#x201d;) typically includes a digital front-end processor (DFE), a print engine (also referred to in the art as a &#x201c;marking engine&#x201d;) for applying toner to the receiver, and one or more post-printing finishing system(s) (e.g. a UV coating system, a glosser system, or a laminator system). A printer can reproduce pleasing black-and-white or color onto a receiver. A printer can also produce selected patterns of toner on a receiver, which patterns (e.g. surface textures) do not correspond directly to a visible image. The DFE receives input electronic files (such as Postscript command files) composed of images from other input devices (e.g., a scanner, a digital camera). The DFE can include various function processors, e.g. a raster image processor (RIP), image positioning processor, image manipulation processor, color processor, or image storage processor. The DFE rasterizes input electronic files into image bitmaps for the print engine to print. In some embodiments, the DFE permits a human operator to set up parameters such as layout, font, color, media type, or post-finishing options. The print engine takes the rasterized image bitmap from the DFE and renders the bitmap into a form that can control the printing process from the exposure device to transferring the print image onto the receiver. The finishing system applies features such as protection, glossing, or binding to the prints. The finishing system can be implemented as an integral component of a printer, or as a separate machine through which prints are fed after they are printed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The printer can also include a color management system which captures the characteristics of the image printing process implemented in the print engine (e.g. the electrophotographic process) to provide known, consistent color reproduction characteristics. The color management system can also provide known color reproduction for different inputs (e.g. digital camera images or film images).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In an embodiment of an electrophotographic modular printing machine, e.g. the NEXPRESS 3000SE printer manufactured by Eastman Kodak Company of Rochester, N.Y., color-toner print images are made in a plurality of color imaging modules arranged in tandem, and the print images are successively electrostatically transferred to a receiver adhered to a transport web moving through the modules. Colored toners include colorants, e.g. dyes or pigments, which absorb specific wavelengths of visible light. Commercial machines of this type typically employ intermediate transfer members in the respective modules for transferring visible images from the photoreceptor and transferring print images to the receiver. In other electrophotographic printers, each visible image is directly transferred to a receiver to form the corresponding print image.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Electrophotographic printers having the capability to also deposit clear toner using an additional imaging module are also known. As used herein, clear toner is considered to be a color of toner, as are C, M, Y, K, and Lk, but the term &#x201c;colored toner&#x201d; excludes clear toners. The provision of a clear-toner overcoat to a color print is desirable for providing protection of the print from fingerprints and reducing certain visual artifacts. Clear toner uses particles that are similar to the toner particles of the color development stations but without colored material (e.g. dye or pigment) incorporated into the toner particles. However, a clear-toner overcoat can add cost and reduce color gamut of the print; thus, it is desirable to provide for operator/user selection to determine whether or not a clear-toner overcoat will be applied to the entire print. A uniform layer of clear toner can be provided. A layer that varies inversely according to heights of the toner stacks can also be used to establish level toner stack heights. The respective toners are deposited one upon the other at respective locations on the receiver and the height of a respective toner stack is the sum of the toner heights of each respective color. Uniform stack height provides the print with a more even or uniform gloss.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an elevational cross-section showing portions of a typical electrophotographic printer <b>100</b>. Printer <b>100</b> is adapted to produce print images, such as single-color (monochrome), CMYK, or hexachrome (six-color) images, on a receiver (multicolor images are also known as &#x201c;multi-component&#x201d; images). Images can include text, graphics, photos, and other types of visual content. An embodiment involves printing using an electrophotographic print engine having six sets of single-color image-producing or -printing stations or modules arranged in tandem, but more or fewer than six colors can be combined to form a print image on a given receiver. Other electrophotographic writers or printer apparatus can also be included. Various components of printer <b>100</b> are shown as rollers; other configurations are also possible, including belts.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, printer <b>100</b> is an electrophotographic printing apparatus having a number of tandemly-arranged electrophotographic image-forming printing modules <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, also known as electrophotographic imaging subsystems. Each printing module <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> produces a single-color toner image for transfer using a respective transfer subsystem <b>50</b> (for clarity, only one is labeled) to a receiver <b>42</b> successively moved through the modules. Receiver <b>42</b> is transported from supply unit <b>40</b>, which can include active feeding subsystems as known in the art, into printer <b>100</b>. In various embodiments, the visible image can be transferred directly from an imaging roller to a receiver <b>42</b>, or from an imaging roller to one or more transfer roller(s) or belt(s) in sequence in transfer subsystem <b>50</b>, and then to receiver <b>42</b>. Receiver <b>42</b> is, for example, a selected section of a web of, or a cut sheet of, planar media such as paper or transparency film.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Each printing module <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> includes various components. For clarity, these are only shown in printing module <b>32</b>. Around photoreceptor <b>25</b> are arranged, ordered by the direction of rotation of photoreceptor <b>25</b>, charger <b>21</b>, exposure subsystem <b>22</b>, and toning station <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the EP process, an electrostatic latent image is formed on photoreceptor <b>25</b> by uniformly charging photoreceptor <b>25</b> and then discharging selected areas of the uniform charge to yield an electrostatic charge pattern corresponding to the desired image (a &#x201c;latent image&#x201d;). Charger <b>21</b> produces a uniform electrostatic charge on photoreceptor <b>25</b> or its surface. Exposure subsystem <b>22</b> selectively image-wise discharges photoreceptor <b>25</b> to produce a latent image. Exposure subsystem <b>22</b> can include a laser and raster optical scanner (ROS), one or more LEDs, or a linear LED array.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">After the latent image is formed, charged toner particles are brought into the vicinity of photoreceptor <b>25</b> by toning station <b>23</b> and are attracted to the latent image to develop the latent image into a visible image. Note that the visible image may not be visible to the naked eye depending on the composition of the toner particles (e.g. clear toner). Toning station <b>23</b> can also be referred to as a development station. Toner can be applied to either the charged or discharged parts of the latent image.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">After the latent image is developed into a visible image on photoreceptor <b>25</b>, a suitable receiver <b>42</b> is brought into juxtaposition with the visible image. In transfer subsystem <b>50</b>, a suitable electric field is applied to transfer the toner particles of the visible image to receiver <b>42</b> to form the desired print image <b>38</b> on the receiver, as shown on receiver <b>42</b>A. The imaging process is typically repeated many times with reusable photoreceptors <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Receiver <b>42</b>A is then removed from its operative association with photoreceptor <b>25</b> and subjected to heat or pressure to permanently fix (&#x201c;fuse&#x201d;) print image <b>38</b> to receiver <b>42</b>A. Plural print images, e.g. of separations of different colors, are overlaid on one receiver before fusing to form a multi-color print image <b>38</b> on receiver <b>42</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Each receiver <b>42</b>, during a single pass through the six printing modules <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, can have transferred in registration thereto up to six single-color toner images to form a pentachrome image. As used herein, the term &#x201c;hexachrome&#x201d; implies that in a print image, combinations of various of the six colors are combined to form other colors on receiver <b>42</b> at various locations on receiver <b>42</b>. That is, each of the six colors of toner can be combined with toner of one or more of the other colors at a particular location on receiver <b>42</b> to form a color different than the colors of the toners combined at that location. In an embodiment, printing module <b>31</b> forms black (K) print images, <b>32</b> forms yellow (Y) print images, <b>33</b> forms magenta (M) print images, <b>34</b> forms cyan (C) print images, <b>35</b> forms light-black (Lk) images, and <b>36</b> forms clear images.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In various embodiments, printing module <b>36</b> forms print image <b>38</b> using a clear toner or tinted toner. Tinted toners absorb less light than they transmit, but do contain pigments or dyes that move the hue of light passing through them towards the hue of the tint. For example, a blue-tinted toner coated on white paper will cause the white paper to appear light blue when viewed under white light, and will cause yellows printed under the blue-tinted toner to appear slightly greenish under white light.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Receiver <b>42</b>A is shown after passing through printing module <b>36</b>. Print image <b>38</b> on receiver <b>42</b>A includes unfused toner particles.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Subsequent to transfer of the respective print images <b>38</b>, overlaid in registration, one from each of the respective printing modules <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, receiver <b>42</b>A is advanced to a fuser <b>60</b>, i.e. a fusing or fixing assembly, to fuse print image <b>38</b> to receiver <b>42</b>A. Transport web <b>81</b> transports the print-image-carrying receivers (e.g., <b>42</b>A) to fuser <b>60</b>, which fixes the toner particles to the respective receivers <b>42</b>A by the application of heat and pressure. The receivers <b>42</b>A are serially de-tacked from transport web <b>81</b> to permit them to feed cleanly into fuser <b>60</b>. Transport web <b>81</b> is then reconditioned for reuse at cleaning station <b>86</b> by cleaning and neutralizing the charges on the opposed surfaces of the transport web <b>81</b>. A mechanical cleaning station (not shown) for scraping or vacuuming toner off transport web <b>81</b> can also be used independently or with cleaning station <b>86</b>. The mechanical cleaning station can be disposed along transport web <b>81</b> before or after cleaning station <b>86</b> in the direction of rotation of transport web <b>81</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Fuser <b>60</b> includes a heated fusing roller <b>62</b> and an opposing pressure roller <b>64</b> that form a fusing nip <b>66</b> therebetween. In an embodiment, fuser <b>60</b> also includes a release fluid application substation <b>68</b> that applies release fluid, e.g. silicone oil, to fusing roller <b>62</b>. Alternatively, wax-containing toner can be used without applying release fluid to fusing roller <b>62</b>. Other embodiments of fusers, both contact and non-contact, can be employed. For example, solvent fixing uses solvents to soften the toner particles so they bond with the receiver <b>42</b>. Photoflash fusing uses short bursts of high-frequency electromagnetic radiation (e.g. ultraviolet light) to melt the toner. Radiant fixing uses lower-frequency electromagnetic radiation (e.g. infrared light) to more slowly melt the toner. Microwave fixing uses electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range to heat the receivers (primarily), thereby causing the toner particles to melt by heat conduction, so that the toner is fixed to the receiver <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The receivers (e.g., receiver <b>42</b>B) carrying the fused image (e.g., fused image <b>39</b>) are transported in a series from the fuser <b>60</b> along a path either to a remote output tray <b>69</b>, or back to printing modules <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> to create an image on the backside of the receiver (e.g., receiver <b>42</b>B), i.e. to form a duplex print. Receivers (e.g., receiver <b>42</b>B) can also be transported to any suitable output accessory. For example, an auxiliary fuser or glossing assembly can provide a clear-toner overcoat. Printer <b>100</b> can also include multiple fusers <b>60</b> to support applications such as overprinting, as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In various embodiments, between fuser <b>60</b> and output tray <b>69</b>, receiver <b>42</b>B passes through finisher <b>70</b>. Finisher <b>70</b> performs various media-handling operations, such as folding, stapling, saddle-stitching, collating, and binding.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Printer <b>100</b> includes main printer apparatus logic and control unit (LCU) <b>99</b>, which receives input signals from the various sensors associated with printer <b>100</b> and sends control signals to the components of printer <b>100</b>. LCU <b>99</b> can include a microprocessor incorporating suitable look-up tables and control software executable by the LCU <b>99</b>. It can also include a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), programmable logic device (PLD), microcontroller, or other digital control system. LCU <b>99</b> can include memory for storing control software and data. Sensors associated with the fusing assembly provide appropriate signals to the LCU <b>99</b>. In response to the sensors, the LCU <b>99</b> issues command and control signals that adjust the heat or pressure within fusing nip <b>66</b> and other operating parameters of fuser <b>60</b> for receivers. This permits printer <b>100</b> to print on receivers of various thicknesses and surface finishes, such as glossy or matte.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Image data for writing by printer <b>100</b> can be processed by a raster image processor (RIP; not shown), which can include a color separation screen generator or generators. The output of the RIP can be stored in frame or line buffers for transmission of the color separation print data to each of respective LED writers, e.g. for black (K), yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and red (R), respectively. The RIP or color separation screen generator can be a part of printer <b>100</b> or remote therefrom. Image data processed by the RIP can be obtained from a color document scanner or a digital camera or produced by a computer or from a memory or network which typically includes image data representing a continuous image that needs to be reprocessed into halftone image data in order to be adequately represented by the printer. The RIP can perform image processing processes, e.g. color correction, in order to obtain the desired color print. Color image data is separated into the respective colors and converted by the RIP to halftone dot image data in the respective color using matrices, which comprise desired screen angles (measured counterclockwise from rightward, the +X direction) and screen rulings. The RIP can be a suitably-programmed computer or logic device and is adapted to employ stored or computed matrices and templates for processing separated color image data into rendered image data in the form of halftone information suitable for printing. These matrices can include a screen pattern memory (SPM).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Various parameters of the components of a printing module (e.g., printing module <b>31</b>) can be selected to control the operation of printer <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, charger <b>21</b> is a corona charger including a grid between the corona wires (not shown) and photoreceptor <b>25</b>. Voltage source <b>21</b><i>a </i>applies a voltage to the grid to control charging of photoreceptor <b>25</b>. In an embodiment, a voltage bias is applied to toning station <b>23</b> by voltage source <b>23</b><i>a </i>to control the electric field, and thus the rate of toner transfer, from toning station <b>23</b> to photoreceptor <b>25</b>. In an embodiment, a voltage is applied to a conductive base layer of photoreceptor <b>25</b> by voltage source <b>25</b><i>a </i>before development, that is, before toner is applied to photoreceptor <b>25</b> by toning station <b>23</b>. The applied voltage can be zero; the base layer can be grounded. This also provides control over the rate of toner deposition during development. In an embodiment, the exposure applied by exposure subsystem <b>22</b> to photoreceptor <b>25</b> is controlled by LCU <b>99</b> to produce a latent image corresponding to the desired print image. All of these parameters can be changed, as described below.</p>
