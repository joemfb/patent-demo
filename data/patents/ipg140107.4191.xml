No. 13/176,334, each entitled &#x201c;SLIDING MODULE FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICE&#x201d;, by Wu et al. These applications have the same assignee as the present application and have been concurrently filed herewith. The above-identified applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure generally relates to electronic devices, and particularly to a sliding module for an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Portable electronic devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are widely used. As such, the sales and use of slide-type portable electronic devices have been on the increase. A slide-type portable electronic device has two housings, of which one slides relative to the other by a slide mechanism to open/close the portable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the slide-type portable electronic devices typically only allows the two housings to slide parallel to each other. Therefore, when the slide-type portable electronic device is placed horizontally, it can be difficult for users to view a display screen on the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

One end of the elastic member <b>50</b> is mounted to the pin <b>24</b> of the first section <b>10</b>, and the other end of the elastic member <b>50</b> is mounted to the pin <b>44</b> of the sliding member <b>40</b>. Thus, the elastic springs <b>50</b> connect the first section <b>10</b> and the sliding member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The connecting plate <b>60</b> is connected to the sliding member <b>40</b> and the second section <b>20</b>. One block <b>62</b> is formed on one end of the connecting plate <b>60</b>. The block <b>62</b> is slidably engaged in the guiding slot <b>46</b>. A pivot hole <b>64</b> is defined at the other end of the connecting plate <b>60</b>. A pivot post <b>66</b> is inserted into the pivot hole <b>64</b> and the receiving hole <b>26</b> to rotatably connect the connecting plate <b>60</b> to the second section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In assembly, the sliding member <b>40</b> and the connecting plate <b>60</b> are placed on the second section <b>20</b>. The pivot hole <b>64</b> of the connecting plate <b>60</b> is connected to the receiving hole <b>26</b> of the second section <b>20</b> with the pivot post <b>66</b>. The block <b>62</b> is slidably received in the guiding slot <b>46</b> of the sliding member <b>40</b>. One end of the elastic member <b>50</b> is mounted to a pin <b>24</b> of the first section <b>10</b>, and the other end of each elastic spring <b>50</b> is mounted to a pin <b>44</b> of the sliding member <b>40</b>. The first hinged portions <b>32</b> of the rotary plate <b>30</b> are connected to the pivot seats <b>12</b> of the first section <b>10</b> with the shafts <b>36</b>. The second hinged portions <b>34</b> are connected to the hinge tabs <b>22</b> with the shafts <b>28</b>. The fixed portions <b>42</b> are rotatably connected to the connecting portion <b>14</b> of the first section <b>10</b> with the shaft <b>48</b>. Accordingly, the sliding module <b>100</b> is assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the sliding module <b>100</b> is in a flat, closed orientation, the second section <b>20</b> overlaps the first section <b>10</b>. Under the limitation of the first section <b>10</b> and the connecting plate <b>60</b>, the rotary plate <b>30</b> cannot rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, when the sliding module <b>100</b> is opened, a force F is applied to the first section <b>10</b> and the sliding member <b>40</b> to move the first section <b>10</b> away from the second section <b>20</b>. One end of the connecting plate <b>60</b> rotates around the pivot shaft <b>66</b> under the role of the sliding member <b>40</b>, the block <b>62</b> of the connecting plate <b>60</b> moves from one end of the guiding slot <b>46</b>. The sliding member <b>40</b> and the first section <b>10</b> slide relative to the second section <b>20</b>, the rotary plate <b>30</b> will rotate along the second hinged portion <b>34</b> to elevate the first section <b>10</b>. The elastic member <b>50</b> accumulates elastic energy until the sliding member <b>40</b> slides to a position where the elastic member <b>50</b> is compressed to a maximized deformation. After that, the sliding member <b>40</b> can further automatically slide towards the open position by returning the elastic member <b>50</b> from their compressed states to their original states. When the block <b>62</b> moves to the other end of the guiding slot <b>46</b>, the first section <b>10</b> is supported in a tilted position relative to the second section <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the sliding module <b>100</b> is applied in a portable electronic device <b>200</b> such as a mobile phone.
