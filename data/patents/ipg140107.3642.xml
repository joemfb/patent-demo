<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Information from one or more transmitters installed in a detection object area is received. The reception feature value of when a detection object is present in a predetermined position of the detection object area is measured. A reception pattern of when the detection object is present in the predetermined position is formed. The reception pattern is compared with reference reception patterns, and the presence position corresponding to the reference reception pattern most approximate to the reception pattern is acquired from a reference reception pattern database where the presence positions of the detection object and the reference reception patterns of when the detection object is present in the presence positions are associated with one another. The presence position of the detection object is estimated according to the acquired presence position. The estimated presence position of the detection object is associated with received detection object identification information.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">APPLICABLE FIELD IN THE INDUSTRY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a detection target identification/position estimation technology of identifying inherent information of a detection target such as a person and a thing, estimating an existence position of its detection target, and causing the inherent information of the detection target and its existence position to correspond to each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) system, which is configured of a device holding an inherent ID and a device reading off it, has a problem that an erroneous detection and a detection omission occur and resultantly the detection of the ID becomes unstable due to influences such as an antenna directivity of an ID holding device and an ID reading device, an disorder of a radio wave environment caused by a multipath etc., a change in an antenna characteristic caused by a person or a thing to which the ID holding device has been affixed, and radio wave noise from a personal computer located in the adjacent.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">So as to reduce the erroneous detection and the detection omission in the RFID system and stabilize the detection, in Patent document 1, a positional relation between the ID holding device and the ID reading device is positively changed, and simultaneously therewith, a plurality of the ID holding devices are prevented from being positionally superposed onto each other, thereby allowing the status in which the radio wave necessary for reading is obtained even in an instant to be created.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further, in Patent document 2, so as to put a limit to a range in which the detection is made by the ID reading device, providing a shielding plate allows an arrival scope of the radio wave to be limited.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0016">The first point at issue is that a limit has to be put to a utilization environment or a utilization method so as to stabilize the detection in the RFID system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0017">The reason is that the conventional RFID system is not capable of completely solving the erroneous detection or the detection omission in all of the multifarious utilization environments or utilization methods, and so as to fully reduce the erroneous detection or the detection omission responding to conditions in a single RFID system, a limit has to be put to the utilization environment or the utilization method.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0018">The second point at issue is that a problem that the detection of the RFID system becomes unstable due to a fluctuation in the utilization environment or the utilization method cannot be solved.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0019">The reason is that even though an improvement to the device itself in the conventional REID system makes it possible to improve the erroneous detection or the detection omission in a certain utilization environment or utilization method, a problem that the detection of the RFID system becomes unstable when its utilization environment or utilization method changes cannot be solved. Further, the method of stabilizing the detection cannot be dynamically altered although a fluctuation in the utilization environment or the utilization method exists, which makes compatibility of stabilization of the detection and time responsiveness or sensitivity of the detection difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0020">The third point at issue is that the conventional REID system is not capable of identifying a position in which the detection target exists, and of detecting a passage etc. of the detection target.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0070">Herein, the details of the position estimating device <b>4</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0071">The position estimating device <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, includes a reception pattern generating means <b>41</b>, a reference reception pattern storing unit <b>42</b>, a reception pattern comparing means <b>43</b>, and a position selecting means <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0072">The reception pattern generating means <b>41</b> generates and outputs a reception pattern from a result of receiving the inherent IDs of the ID transmitting devices <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, . . . received by the ID receiving devices <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, . . . The reception pattern is expressed with a feature vector having one of reception feature quantities such as the reception intensity, the communication quality, and the arrival time, or a combination thereof as a component for each of all combinations of the ID transmitting devices <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, . . . and the ID receiving devices <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, . . . For example, the reception pattern is one as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> ((ID receiving device <b>3</b><i>a</i>, ID transmitting device <b>2</b><i>a</i>), (ID receiving device <b>3</b><i>a</i>, ID transmitting device <b>2</b><i>b</i>), . . . )=(165, 200, . . . ) when the ID receiving devices <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, . . . can measure the reception intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0073">The reference reception pattern storing unit <b>42</b> pre-stores a plurality of reference reception patterns. The reference reception pattern indicates a reception pattern obtained when the detection target exists at a certain position (hereinafter, referred to as a reference position), and the reference position and the reference reception pattern are stored correspondingly to each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one example is shown of a text that is stored in the reference reception pattern storing unit <b>42</b> in the case that a position of the detection target is expressed with a two-dimension coordinate.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0074">The reception pattern comparing means <b>43</b> numerizes a difference between the reception pattern generated by reception pattern generating means <b>41</b> and each reference reception pattern stored in the reference reception pattern storing unit <b>42</b>, and outputs a reception pattern comparison result. The reception pattern comparison result is expressed with the reference position that each reference reception pattern has, and an index (hereinafter, referred to as an inter-pattern distance) obtained by numerizing a difference between the reference reception pattern that corresponds to its reference position and the reception pattern. For example, the reception pattern comparison result is expressed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in the case that the position of the detection target is expressed with a two-dimension coordinate and the inter-pattern distance is expressed with a one-dimension actual-value.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0075">The position selecting means <b>44</b> selects and decides a position of the detection target within the target area from the reception pattern comparison result obtained by the reception pattern comparing means <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0076">Next, an operation of deciding a position of the detection target will be explained in details by making a reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0077">The IDs transmitted from the ID transmitting devices <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, . . . are received by the ID receiving devices <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, . . . with radio communication (step A<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The reception pattern generating means <b>41</b> generates and outputs a reception pattern from the IDs of the ID transmitting devices <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>, . . . received by the ID receiving devices <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, . . . and one of the measured reception intensity, communication quality, and arrival time, or a combination thereof (step A<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0078">The reception pattern comparing means <b>43</b> calculates an inter-pattern distance between the reception pattern generated by the reception pattern generating means <b>41</b> and each of a plurality of the reference reception patterns pre-stored in the reference reception pattern storing unit <b>42</b>, and outputs a reception pattern comparison result (step A<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The position selecting means <b>44</b> selects a position of a detection target <b>1</b> from the reception pattern comparison result obtained by the reception pattern comparing means <b>43</b> (step A<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Comparing the reception pattern generated by the reception pattern generating means <b>41</b> and each of a plurality of the reference reception patterns pre-stored in the reference reception pattern storing unit <b>42</b> makes it possible to estimate a position of the detection target because the reception pattern changes depending upon a position of the detection target.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0079">As a specific example of the reception pattern comparing means <b>43</b>, there exists the technique of employing a Euclid distance between the feature vector having each reception feature quantity of the reference reception pattern as a component and the feature vector having each reception feature quantity of the reception pattern as a component as an inter-pattern distance between each of a plurality of the reference reception patterns pre-stored in the reference reception pattern storing unit <b>42</b> and the reception pattern generated by the reception pattern generating means <b>41</b>. The method of calculating the Euclid distance between the two vectors is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Further, as a specific example of the position selecting means <b>44</b>, there exists the technique of selecting the reference position such that the inter-pattern distance is minimized out of the inter-pattern distances of the reception pattern comparison result obtained by the reception pattern comparing means <b>43</b> and assuming it to be a position estimation result of the detection target.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0080">The position of the detection target obtained by the position selecting means <b>44</b> is output to the ID/position coupling means <b>62</b> (step A<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0081">Additionally, so as to enhance a precision at which the foregoing position estimating device <b>4</b> estimates the position, the position selecting means <b>44</b> may be configured to estimate and output a position estimation result of the object from the reception pattern comparison result output by the reception pattern comparing means <b>43</b> with the filtering employing a probability inference (Bayesian Filtering/the reference document: Dieter Fox, Jeffrey Hightower, Lin Liao, Dirk Schulz, and Gaetano Borriello, Bayesian Filtering for Location Estimation, PERVASIVE Computing July-September 2003, pp. 24-33).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0082">The method of calculating the filtering employing the probability inference as mentioned above is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and an operation thereof is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. A probability (posterior probability) that the object exists is sequentially computed from the reception pattern comparison result output by the reception pattern comparing means <b>43</b> for each of the reference positions of n reference reception patterns pre-stored in the reference reception pattern storing unit <b>42</b>. The coordinate of the reference position such that the calculated posterior probability becomes maximized is output as a position estimation result.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0083">In this embodiment, a status transition probability is calculated with a calculation equation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (step B<b>1</b>). The status transition probability calculated like this has such a property of restraining a migration range of the detection target. Two constants a and b in the calculation equation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are decided responding to a migration speed of the detection target. In this exemplary embodiment, a person, who was walking, was envisaged as a detection target, a and b were set to 0.50 m, and 1.0 m, respectively. This is equivalent to putting a limit to the migration speed, i.e. the possibility that the migration speed of a person becomes 1.0&#xf7;0.5=2.0 m/s or more when an origination time period of the ID transmitting device is 0.5 sec. does not exist. Calculating a product of the status transition probability calculated in the step B<b>1</b> and a posterior probability ahead of one step (step B<b>2</b>), and thereafter calculating a sum of the total in a primary process loop (step B<b>3</b>) make it possible to obtain a sum of the probabilities (a primary process result) that the object migrates to each reference position from within the target area.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0084">Next, a prior probability is calculated from the comparison result output by the reception pattern comparison means <b>43</b> with a calculation equation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> (step B<b>4</b>). The prior probability calculated in such a manner is adapted to include a property such that the smaller the inter-pattern distance, the bigger the probability value in the reception pattern comparison result output by the reception pattern comparison means <b>43</b>. Further, so as to allow the probability value of each of the candidate companions having a small inter-pattern distance to be easily compared with that of the other, from a result of a preliminary experiment that a person, being a detection target, migrates within a tunnel, it is assumed that an average value of the inter-pattern distances that fluctuate is an inter-pattern distance constant shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In this exemplary example, the inter-pattern distance constant was set to 50 from the preliminary experiment. Calculating a product (step B<b>5</b>) of the calculated prior probability and the primary process result, thereafter calculating a sum of the total (step B<b>6</b>) in a posterior probability calculation loop, and then normalizing it (step B<b>7</b>) make it possible to obtain the probability (posterior probability) that the object exists in respective reference positions.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0085">Each of the posterior probabilities calculated at respective reference positions is compared with the other, and the coordinate of the reference position, of which the probability value becomes maximized, is output as a position estimation result.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0086">Assuming such a configuration makes it possible to precisely estimate a position of the object by defining a prior probability distribution of the position of the object from the inter-pattern distance, and employing a constraint on the migration of the object established with the status transition probability even when, out of a plurality of the reference reception patterns stored in the reference reception pattern storing unit <b>42</b>, some of them resemble each other and resultantly an error occurs at the time of attempting to estimate a position of the object only with the inter-pattern distance.</p>
