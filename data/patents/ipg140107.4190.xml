<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Display devices, e.g., LCD displays, for a desktop computer, usually include a base, a display panel, and a support connected between the base and the display panel. The display panel can be rotatably connected to the support, such that a user can adjust the display to a suitable orientation for better viewing. Although the conventional support can satisfy basic requirements, it is always desirable and useful for a new type of support and display device using the same.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the present disclosure are now described in detail, with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a display device <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment is illustrated. The display device <b>1</b> includes a display panel <b>10</b>, a base <b>20</b>, and a support <b>30</b> connected to the display panel <b>10</b> and the base <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the support <b>30</b> includes a first housing <b>31</b>, a second housing <b>32</b>, a first rotating member <b>33</b> received in first housing <b>31</b>, a second rotating member <b>34</b> received in the second housing <b>32</b>. The first housing <b>31</b> is fixed to the display panel <b>10</b>, and the second housing <b>32</b> is fixed to the base <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first housing <b>31</b> hollow and cylindrical, and defines a chamber <b>311</b> facing the second housing <b>32</b> and includes a first edge <b>312</b> and a second edge <b>313</b> around an open end of the chamber <b>311</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first edge <b>312</b> is higher than the second edge <b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The second housing <b>32</b> includes a cylindrical main body <b>321</b> that defines a receiving chamber <b>323</b> and a fixing plate <b>322</b> detachably fixed to one end of the main body <b>321</b>. In the embodiment, the receiving chamber <b>323</b> is a stepped hole that defines an annular shoulder <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first rotating member <b>33</b> includes a fixing plate <b>331</b> and two protruding walls <b>332</b> protruding from the fixing plate <b>331</b>. The fixing plate <b>331</b> is fixed to a bottom of the chamber <b>311</b> of the first housing <b>31</b>. The two protruding walls <b>332</b> are substantially parallel to each other and each define a first hole <b>333</b> aligned with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second rotating member <b>34</b> defines a second hole <b>341</b> and includes two limiting protrusions <b>342</b> in the lateral surface of the second hole <b>341</b>. In the embodiment, the limiting protrusion <b>342</b> is v-shaped and each includes a first inclined surface <b>343</b> and a second inclined surface <b>344</b> that intersect with each other. The first inclined surface <b>343</b> of one limiting portion <b>342</b> is adjacent to the second inclined surface <b>344</b> of the other one limiting portion <b>342</b>. The second rotating member <b>34</b> further defines a plurality of fastening holes <b>345</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The support <b>30</b> further includes a connecting shaft <b>35</b> rotatably connected to the second rotating member <b>34</b> and a rotating shaft <b>36</b> rotatably connecting the first rotating member <b>33</b> to the connecting shaft <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The connecting shaft <b>35</b> includes a plate portion <b>351</b>, a shaft portion <b>352</b>, and a middle portion <b>353</b> connected between the plate portion <b>351</b> and the shaft portion <b>352</b>. The plate portion <b>351</b> is sandwiched between the two protruding walls <b>332</b> of the first rotating member <b>33</b>. The plate portion <b>351</b> defines a third hole <b>354</b> aligned with the first hole <b>333</b> of the first rotating member. The shaft portion <b>352</b> extends through the second hole <b>341</b> of the second rotating member <b>34</b>, and the middle portion <b>353</b> abuts against the second rotating member <b>34</b>. The shaft portion <b>352</b> includes two opposite cutting sides <b>356</b>. The connecting shaft <b>35</b> can rotate about its axis <b>355</b> relative to the second rotating member <b>34</b> from a first position to a second position. In the first position, two opposite cutting sides <b>356</b> of the shaft portion <b>352</b> respectively abut against the first inclined surfaces <b>343</b> of the two limiting portions <b>342</b>. In the second position, the two opposite cutting sides <b>356</b> of the shaft portion <b>352</b> respectively abut against the second walls <b>344</b> of the two limiting portions <b>342</b>. In the embodiment, the rotation range is set to be about 20 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The rotating shaft <b>36</b> includes a head <b>361</b> and a shank <b>362</b> protruding from the head <b>361</b>. The shank <b>362</b> extends through the first hole <b>333</b> of the first rotating member <b>33</b> and the third hole <b>354</b> of the connecting shaft <b>35</b>, thereby rotatably connecting the first rotating member <b>33</b> to the connecting shaft <b>35</b>. The first rotating member <b>33</b> can be rotated about the rotating shaft <b>36</b> from a first position where the first edge <b>312</b> contacts the second housing <b>32</b> to a second position where the second edge <b>313</b> contacts the second housing <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the embodiment, the support <b>30</b> further includes an accepter <b>37</b> and a number of fastening assemblies <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The accepter <b>37</b> defines a center hole <b>371</b> that the shaft portion <b>352</b> of the connecting shaft <b>35</b> extends through, and a number of through holes <b>372</b> respectively aligned with the fastening holes <b>345</b> of the second rotating member <b>34</b>. The accepter <b>37</b> is fixed to the annular wall <b>324</b> of the second housing <b>32</b>, and the second rotating member <b>34</b> is received in the accepter <b>37</b>. A number of fasteners (not shown) extend through the fastening holes <b>345</b> and through holes <b>372</b>, thereby fixing the second rotating member <b>34</b> to the second housing <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each fastening assembly <b>38</b> includes two nuts <b>381</b> and a washer <b>382</b> positioned between the two nuts <b>381</b>. Two fastening assemblies <b>38</b> are sleeved on the shaft portion <b>352</b> of the connecting shaft <b>35</b> and abut against two protruding walls <b>332</b> of the first rotating member <b>33</b> to prevent the rotating shaft <b>36</b> from disengaging from the first rotating member <b>33</b>.
