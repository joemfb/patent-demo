<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A link simulation tool for simulating high-speed communications link systems is provided. Communications links may include link subsystems such as transmit (TX) circuitry, receive (TX) circuitry, oscillator circuits that provide reference clock signals to the TX and RX circuitry, and channels that link the TX and RX circuitry. The link simulation tool may model each of the subsystems using behavioral models. The behavioral models may include characteristic functions such as transfer functions, probability density functions, and eye characteristics. The link simulation tool may have a link analysis engine that is capable of performing two-dimensional (two-variable) convolution operations and in applying dual-domain (frequency-time) transformations on the characteristic functions provided by the behavioral models to simulate the performance of the link system. The link simulation tool may have an input screen that allows a user to specify desired link parameters and a data display screen that display simulated results.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This relates generally to communications links, and more particularly, to high-speed input-output (I/O) communications links.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A typical communications link includes a transmitter (TX) module, a receiver (RX) module, and a channel that connects the TX module to the RX module. The TX module transmits a serial data bit stream across the channel to the RX module. Typical high-speed transmit data rates can be as high as 10 Gbps (gigabits per second). Communications links operating at such high data rates are often referred to as high-speed serial links or high-speed I/O links.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Circuit simulation tools such as SPICE have been used to simulate the behavior of communications links. The TX module of a communications link generally includes a driver circuit. SPICE can simulate the deterministic behavior of the driver circuit, but neglects non-deterministic effects such as noise and jitter. Simulating a communications link at a transistor level using HSPICE can often take hours or days for sufficient test coverage. Such long testing times are undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Behavior-based simulation tools have been developed to overcome the shortcomings of HSPICE. The pre-emphasis equalization link estimator (PELE) available from Altera Corporation of San Jose, Calif. is an example of a behavior-based simulation tool. The PELE takes into account deterministic characteristics and performs simulations based on one-dimensional statistical modeling (e.g., this tool models deterministic sources that affect the timing but not the amplitude of transmitted signals) to determine the optimal coefficients for TX pre-emphasis and RX linear equalizations. As a result, the PELE and other conventional behavior-based simulation tools are not always able to model high-speed communications links such as links that operate at data rates greater than 10 Gbps as accurately as desired, because random characteristics such as random jitter and noise are not taken into account.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would therefore be desirable to be able to provide an improved simulation tool that can effectively simulate modern high-speed communications links.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A link simulation tool for simulating high-speed communications links is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A communications link may include transmit (TX) circuitry, receive (RX) circuitry, and a channel that links the TX and RX circuitry. The TX circuitry may include a TX data module, a TX equalizer, a driver, a TX phase-locked loop (PLL), and a TX oscillator. The TX data module may feed data to the TX equalizer. The TX equalizer may output data to the driver. The TX PLL may receive a reference clock signal from the TX oscillator and may control the timing of the TX data module, TX equalizer, and driver to operate at a desired transmit data rate. The driver may output signals with sufficient strength across the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The TX circuitry may include a buffer, an RX equalizer, a register (e.g., a flip-flop), an RX data module, an RX PLL, and an RX oscillator. The TX and RX oscillators may be formed on-chip or off-chip. The buffer may receive signals transmitted over the channel. The buffer may output signals to the RX equalizer. The RX equalizer may provide signals to the register for latching. The flip-flop may feed latched data to the RX data module. The RX PLL may receive a reference clock signal from the RX oscillator and may include a clock recovery circuit (CRC) that generates a recovered data clock signal with a recovered clock rate based on the data rate of the received signals. The RX PLL may control the timing of the RX equalizer, the register, and the RX data module to operate at the recovered clock rate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The TX circuitry, the RX circuitry, and the channel may be represented by respective behavioral models. These behavioral models may include characteristic transfer functions, probability density functions (PDF), eye diagrams, etc. The link simulation tool may perform two-dimensional convolution and dual domain transformations (e.g., frequency-to-time domain transformations such as fast Fourier transformations FFT or Laplace transformations) on these characteristic functions to model the behavior of each link subsystem for each of the communications links that are being simultaneously simulated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The link simulation tool may provide an input screen that presents a user with an opportunity to specify link simulation tool settings. The link simulation tool settings input screen allows the user to specify a desired data rate, data pattern file, channel model file, TX/RX settings, jitter and noise levels, and other settings.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The link simulation tool may also provide a data display screen that presents the user with an opportunity to adjust data display settings. The data display screen allows the user to specify a desired plot setting, test point, target bit error rate (BER), eye plot type, axis scale, etc. The data display screen may display corresponding data plots such as a 2D eye diagram, noise and jitter histograms, a 3D BER eye plot, associated BER plots (e.g., bathtub curves), eye opening characteristics (e.g., eye height and eye width), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The link simulation tool may include a link analysis engine that performs simulation computations. The link simulation tool may provide simulation results to custom logic or programmable logic design tools for use in designing high-speed communication links for application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) or programmable logic device (PLD) integrated circuits, respectively.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">This relates to communications links, and more particularly to simulation tools that simulate the performance of communications links.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Communications links are commonly used to transport data between separate integrated circuits packages, printed circuit boards, etc. Such communications links may be used to connect integrated circuits that include communications capabilities, such as memory chips, digital signal processing circuits, microprocessors, application specific integrated circuits, programmable logic device integrated circuits, field-programmable gate arrays, application specified standard products, or any other suitable integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Systems in which the links carry high-speed digital signals are typically among the most challenging to design. A high-speed link might, as an example, carry data at several gigabits per second. A high-speed communications link is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Communications link <b>10</b> may include transmitter (TX) circuitry such as TX circuitry <b>62</b>, a channel such as channel <b>66</b>, and receiver (RX) circuitry such as RX circuitry <b>64</b>. Channel (channel subsystem) <b>66</b> may connect TX circuitry <b>62</b> to RX circuitry <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">TX circuitry <b>62</b> may be formed on a first integrated circuit while RX circuitry <b>64</b> may be formed on a second integrated circuit (as an example). The first and second integrated circuits may be mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB). Channel <b>66</b> (e.g., conductive traces on the PCB, wires, copper cables, etc.) may be used to connect the first and second integrated circuits. The first integrated may use TX circuitry <b>62</b> to transmit data to RX circuitry <b>64</b> in the second integrated circuitry through channel <b>66</b>. If desired, more than one channel may be used to link TX circuitry <b>62</b> to RX circuitry <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">This example is merely illustrative. Communications link <b>10</b> of the type described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be used provide data transport between integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, circuits within a single integrated circuit, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">TX circuitry <b>62</b> may include a TX data source such as data source <b>68</b>, a TX equalizer such as equalizer <b>70</b>, a TX driver such as driver <b>78</b>, a TX phase-locked loop (PLL) such as PLL <b>72</b>, and a TX oscillator such as oscillator <b>74</b>. Data source <b>68</b> may provide data to be transmitted. For example, data source <b>68</b> may be a parallel-in serial-out (PISO) data circuit or a serializer. In this example, data source <b>68</b> may provide TX circuitry <b>62</b> with a serial data bit stream for transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Equalizer <b>70</b> may receive data from data source <b>68</b>. Equalizer <b>70</b> may be used to provide high-frequency and direct signal level boosting to compensate for high-frequency signal loss commonly seen in high-speed serial links (e.g., losses in copper-based channels that exhibit undesired low-pass transfer characteristics that result in signal degradation at high data rates) or to enhance signal to noise ratio (SNR) in scenarios in which uncorrelated noise such as crosstalk is present. Equalizer <b>70</b> may implement linear equalization schemes such as finite impulse response (FIR) and feed forward equalization (FFE) schemes or nonlinear adaptive equalization schemes such as infinite impulse response (IIR) or decision feedback equalization (DFE) schemes (as examples).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Equalizer <b>70</b> may output equalized data to driver <b>78</b>. Driver <b>78</b> may have an output that is connected to a first terminal of channel <b>66</b>. The output of driver <b>78</b> may have an output differential resistance of 10 Ohms to provide impedance matching with channel <b>66</b> (e.g., the first terminal of channel <b>66</b> has an input differential resistance of 10 Ohms). Impedance matching may provide maximum signal power transfer from driver <b>78</b> to channel <b>66</b> and may eliminate signal reflection. Driver <b>78</b> may be used to provide sufficient drive strength to drive the data stream across channel <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">PLL <b>72</b> may receive reference clock signal REF CLK from oscillator <b>74</b>. Oscillator <b>74</b> may be an on-chip crystal oscillator (as an example). Signal REF CLK may be provided from an off-chip oscillator, if desired. PLL <b>72</b> may produce a desired transmit data clock signal over line <b>76</b> to control data source <b>68</b> and equalizer <b>70</b>. The data clock signal may have a transmit clock rate that is an integer multiple of the clock rate of reference clock signal REF_CLK. For example, consider a scenario in which signal REF_CLK has a clock rate of 3 GHz. The data clock signal may have a transmit clock rate of 6 GHz, 9 GHz, 12 GHz, 18 GHz, etc. TX circuitry <b>62</b> may transmit the serial data bit stream with a transmit data rate that is equivalent to the clock rate of the data clock signal generated by PLL <b>72</b>. For example, consider a scenario in which the transmit clock rate is 15 GHz. In this type of scenario, driver <b>78</b>, which is controlled by the corresponding transmit data clock signal, will transmit data at a transmit data rate of 15 Gbps. If desired, data can be transmitted at 30 Gbps if both rising and falling edges of the data clock signal are used to clock the data in half-rate architectures (as an example).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Channel <b>66</b> may have a second terminal that is connected to RX circuitry <b>64</b>. RX circuitry <b>64</b> may include an RX buffer such as buffer <b>80</b>, an RX equalizer such as equalizer <b>82</b>, a register (e.g., a flip-flop) such as register <b>84</b>, an RX data destination such as data module <b>86</b>, an RX PLL such as PLL <b>88</b>, and an RX oscillator such as oscillator <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second terminal of channel <b>66</b> may be connected to an input of buffer <b>80</b>. Buffer <b>80</b> may receive data from channel <b>66</b>. Buffer <b>80</b> may have an input differential resistance of 10 Ohms for impedance matching (e.g., the second terminal of channel <b>66</b> has an output differential resistance of 10 Ohms). Buffer <b>80</b> may provide additional pre-amplification for the received data, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Buffer <b>80</b> may output the received data to equalizer <b>82</b>. Equalizer <b>82</b> may provide further high-frequency boosting or direct signal level boosting to compensate for any additional undesired high-frequency signal loss. Equalizer <b>82</b> may output the received data that has been equalized to register <b>84</b>. Register <b>84</b> may latch desired data and may output the desired data to data source <b>84</b>. Data source <b>86</b> may be a serial-in parallel-out (SIPO) or a de-serializer data circuit (as an example). In this example, data source <b>86</b> may convert the serial data bit stream to parallel data for later processing.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Buffer <b>80</b> may provide the received data to PLL <b>88</b>. PLL <b>88</b> may include a clock recovery circuit (CRC) such as CRC circuit <b>90</b>. PLL <b>88</b> may receive local reference clock signal REF_CLK&#x2032; from oscillator <b>92</b>. Oscillator <b>92</b> may be an on-chip crystal oscillator (as an example). Signal REF_CLK&#x2032; may be generated by an off-chip oscillator, if desired. PLL <b>72</b> may use CRC <b>90</b> to generate a recovered data clock signal based on the data rate of the received data.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, consider a scenario in which the data rate of the received data is 16 Gbps and the clock rate of signal REF_CLK&#x2032; is 2 GHz. PLL <b>72</b> may generate a recovered data clock signal on line <b>77</b> that has a recovered clock rate that matches the data rate of the received data. The recovered data clock in this example may therefore exhibit a recovered clock rate of 16 GHz that matches the received data rate of 16 Gbps. The recovered data clock signal is provided over line <b>77</b> to control equalizer <b>82</b>, register <b>84</b>, and data source <b>86</b> to process data at the recovered clock rate.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">All the components (e.g., equalizers <b>70</b> and <b>82</b>, driver <b>78</b>, channel <b>66</b>, and buffer <b>80</b>) in the data path indicated by dotted line <b>69</b> may be implemented using differential architecture. For example, equalizers <b>70</b> and <b>82</b> may have differential inputs and differential outputs instead of single-ended inputs and outputs, and the data transmitted over channel <b>66</b> may be in the form of differential signals.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Communications link system <b>10</b> may be simulated using a link simulation tool. Each link subsystem (e.g., TX circuitry <b>62</b>, channel <b>66</b>, or RX circuitry <b>64</b>) may be simulated using a computer-aided design (CAD) simulation tool that captures the behaviors of each subsystem of the entire link system through the use of behavioral (subsystem) models. For example, first and second subsystem models may be used to model the behaviors of circuitry <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>, respectively. A third subsystem model may be used to model passive characteristics of channel subsystem, <b>66</b>. Additional behavior models may be used to model more than one channel (e.g., for multi-channel link systems), if desired. If desired, any number of link systems <b>10</b> may be simultaneously simulated using the link simulation tool.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The first, second, and third subsystem models can be used to simulate the behavior of link system <b>10</b> according to an overall link metric. The overall link metric may be a bit error rate (BER), as an example. The bit error rate is defined as the ratio of the number of error bits (e.g., received bits that have been corrupted by noise, jitter, interference, etc.) to the total number of transmitted bits within a given time period.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, consider a scenario in which two terabits were transmitted within five seconds. There may be two incorrect bits that were transferred erroneously. The BER is therefore 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>(2 divided by 2*10<sup>12</sup>). For high-speed communications links such as link <b>10</b>, it may be desirable to set the BER to 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>or smaller (e.g., 10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup>, 5*10<sup>&#x2212;14</sup>, 2.8*10<sup>&#x2212;15</sup>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The link simulation may be used to calculate partial link metrics at different test points in link system <b>10</b>. The test points refer to particular points of interest in communications link <b>10</b>. For example, a test point TP<b>1</b> may be located at the output of driver <b>78</b>, another test point TP<b>2</b> may be located at the input of buffer <b>80</b>, TP<b>3</b> may be located at the output of buffer <b>80</b>, and TP<b>4</b> may be located at the output of equalizer <b>82</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. If desired, any number of test points may be placed at any number of points in link system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The behavioral model of TX circuitry <b>62</b> may be implemented using software abstractions of the actual hardware in system <b>10</b>. For example, TX circuitry <b>62</b> may be abstracted into a schematic representation (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in which each of the components is modeled by an individual characteristic function (e.g., a transfer function, a probability density function, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each connection in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may indicate that two connected components interact with each other and that their respective characteristic functions are related. Data source <b>68</b> may be connected to equalizer <b>70</b> through line <b>96</b>. Equalizer <b>70</b> may be connected to driver <b>78</b> through line <b>98</b>. Oscillator <b>92</b> may provide signal REF_CLK to PLL <b>72</b> over line <b>110</b>. PLL <b>72</b> may provided a transmit data clock signal to equalizer <b>70</b> over line <b>76</b>. Driver <b>78</b> may be supplied by positive power supply line <b>100</b> (e.g., a line that is driven to positive power supply voltage Vcc) and by ground power supply line <b>102</b> (e.g., a line that is driven to zero volts or Gnd). Driver <b>78</b> may be connected to a TX circuitry package such as TX circuitry package <b>94</b>. There may not actually be a discrete packaging component in TX circuitry <b>62</b>. Package <b>94</b> merely serves to represent a low-pass characteristic of an integrated circuit package that contains circuitry <b>62</b> and that is used for mounting TX circuitry <b>62</b> onto a printed circuit board. Schematically, package <b>94</b> is connected to channel <b>66</b> through line <b>106</b>. The connections (i.e., lines) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may represent simulated data flow paths.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It may be helpful to examine the individual characteristic functions at the outputs of data source <b>68</b> (as indicated by point A), equalizer <b>70</b> (as indicated by point B), driver <b>78</b> (as indicated by point C), package <b>94</b> (as indicated by point D), oscillator <b>92</b> (as indicated by point E), and PLL <b>72</b> (as indicated by point F). The mechanism through which these characteristic functions may be combined to simulate an overall link subsystem behavior may sometimes be referred to as convolution (e.g., two-dimensional convolution in the time domain or in the frequency domain).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At point A, a signal such as v<sub>A</sub>(t) may be generated by data module <b>68</b>. Signal v<sub>A</sub>(t) may represent a possible data bit stream (e.g., 0100010100) that varies as a function of time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Signal v<sub>A</sub>(t) may be a differential signal that is centered at zero volts (as an example).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows an eye diagram such as eye diagram f<sub>A</sub>(t,v). Eye diagram f<sub>A</sub>(t,v) may be a two-variable function that is dependent on time and voltage (e.g., time and voltage correspond to the two axes of the eye diagram). Eye diagram f<sub>A</sub>(t,v) may be formed by repetitively sampling signal v<sub>A</sub>(t) at regular time intervals and by overlaying the sampled signals. For example, waveform <b>112</b> may represent samples having a differential value of &#x201c;1&#x201d; while waveform <b>114</b> may represent samples having a differential value of &#x201c;0.&#x201d; Diagram f<sub>A</sub>(t,v) represents an ideal eye pattern, because the transitions of waveforms <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are vertical (e.g., infinite slope) and because no variation in time (e.g., jitter) or voltage (e.g., noise) is present to distort the eye pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At point E, reference clock signal REF_CLK is generated by oscillator <b>92</b>. Signal REF_CLK may be a square wave clock signal having 50% duty cycle (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). Signal REF_CLK may exhibit more or less than 50% duty cycle, if desired. Oscillator <b>92</b> may not produce an ideal square wave. For example, oscillator <b>92</b> may generate a square wave having random jitter (e.g., random variation in the time domain) that causes the rising/fallings edges of signal REF_CLK to shift in time, as indicated by &#x394;t in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The random jitter of signal REF_CLK may be characterized by a probability density function (PDF) such as probability density function f<sub>OSC</sub>(t) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. In general, a probability density function plots the relative likelihood that a random variable with a particular value will occur. PDF f<sub>OSC</sub>(t) plots the probability for a given jitter to occur as a function of time. For example, PDF f<sub>OSC</sub>(t) has a peak that corresponds to nominal jitter &#x394;t<sub>NOM</sub>. Signal REF_CLK may therefore exhibit random jitter with a value that is approximately equal to nominal jitter &#x394;t<sub>NOM </sub>for a majority of the time (e.g., peak in PDF corresponds to highest probable occurrence). Jitter values that deviate far from the nominal jitter may still occur but with relatively less probability. The random jitter of signal REF_CLK may therefore be uniquely characterized by PDF f<sub>OSC </sub>(t).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">PLL <b>72</b> may be characterized by a transfer function such as transfer function |H<sub>PLL</sub>(f)|, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Transfer function |H<sub>PLL</sub>(f)| plots the magnitude response of PLL <b>72</b> as a function of frequency. Transfer function |H<sub>PLL</sub>(f)| may have a low-pass characteristic with a finite bandwidth BW. A phase response may be used in conjunction with magnitude response |H<sub>PLL</sub>(f)| to characterize PLL <b>72</b>, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The behavior at the output of PLL <b>72</b> may be determined by convolving PDF f<sub>OSC</sub>(t) with transfer function |H<sub>PLL</sub>(f)|. Convolution is a technique that involves integrating the product of two functions after one is reversed and shifted in the time domain. Convolution takes two functions as inputs and outputs a third function that can be viewed as a cross-correlated version of the two functions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Generally, convolution of two functions requires that the two functions be either both in the time domain or both in the frequency domain. In a scenario in which the two functions are in different domains, transformations such as the Fourier transform (e.g., fast Fourier transform FFT) or the inverse Fourier transform (e.g., inverse fast Fourier transform IFFT) may be used to convert a function from time domain to frequency domain or from frequency domain back to time domain, respectively. If desired, transformations such as the Laplace transform or the inverse Laplace transform may also be used. Superior throughput can be achieved relative to the conventional SPICE simulation method by the use of dual domain (e.g., time and frequency) operation and fast transformations between them.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The output characteristic of PLL <b>72</b> (e.g., point F) may be represented by time function f<sub>F</sub>(t) and the corresponding PDF, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In simulation, f<sub>F</sub>(t) may be calculated by convolving time function f<sub>OSC</sub>(t) with h<sub>PLL</sub>(t) (i.e., an inverse Fourier transform of |H<sub>PLL</sub>(f)|), as shown in equation 1.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>f</i><sub>F</sub>(<i>t</i>)=<i>f</i><sub>OSC</sub>(<i>t</i>)*<i>h</i><sub>PLL</sub>(<i>t</i>)&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
In equation 1, the symbol &#x201c;*&#x201d; represents the convolution function. If the PLL transfer function exhibits peaking, the corresponding output jitter will be amplified at the frequency at which the peaking occurs.
</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Equalizer <b>70</b> may be characterized by transfer function H<sub>EQ</sub>(f), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Equalizer <b>70</b> may be used to provide high-frequency boosting (region <b>71</b>) to compensate for any undesired high-frequency signal loss.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Because the plot setting of &#x201c;eye PDF&#x201d; is selected in this example, display screen <b>142</b> may plot probability density functions such as noise histogram <b>152</b> and jitter histogram <b>154</b>. Noise histogram <b>152</b> may plot the relative occurrence of reference voltage at a center strobe timing (i.e., zero ps). The peaks of the noise histogram plot correspond to nominal amplitudes of the transmitted signals at TP<b>4</b>. For example, the nominal signal amplitudes are 120 mV and &#x2212;120 mV, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The spread or deviation from these peaks indicates the amount of noise variation that affects the amplitude of the transmitted signals.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Similarly, jitter histogram <b>154</b> plots the relative occurrence of crossing points at a center reference voltage (i.e., zero volts). The peaks of the jitter histogram plot correspond to nominal crossing points (e.g., where the waveforms intersect with zero reference voltage) at TP<b>4</b>. For example, the nominal strobe timing crossing points are at &#x2212;75 ps and 75 ps, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The spread or deviation from these peaks indicates the amount of jitter variation that affects the timing constraints of the transmitted signals.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Data display screen <b>142</b> may include a region such as eye opening region <b>156</b>. Region <b>156</b> may allow the user to specify a desired voltage value and a desired strobe time for determining eye width EW and eye height EH, respectively. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the user has chosen to measure eye width EW and height EH at the zero crossing point (i.e., 0 mV) and at the center strobe time (i.e., 0 ps). Simulation tool <b>118</b> has determined that the corresponding maximum eye width EW is 126 ps and the corresponding maximum eye height EH is 151 mV (as examples). The user may specify other reference values to determine EW and EH, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In another suitable arrangement, data display screen <b>142</b> may be configured to display a 3-dimensional BER plot and other associated plots, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. For example, the user may opt to view an eye CDF (cumulative density function) plot setting with a 3D eye plot type and with a logarithmic (log) scale at test point TP<b>3</b> (e.g., at the input of buffer <b>80</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Display screen <b>142</b> may therefore display a BER eye plot such as BER plot <b>158</b>. BER plot <b>158</b> may be a 3D plot (e.g., plotting BER values on a log scale against amplitude and timing) at test point TP<b>3</b> (as an example). A BER contour plot such as BER contour plot <b>159</b> may be formed by projecting downwards the 3D BER plot onto the 2D plane of amplitude versus time. Each horizontal cross-section of the BER plot corresponds to a particular BER value and a separate contour line of plot <b>159</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Because the plot setting of eye CDF is selected in this example, display screen <b>142</b> may plot cumulative density functions (CDF) such as plots <b>160</b> and <b>162</b>. Curves in plots <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> may sometimes be referred to as bathtub curves. Plot <b>160</b> may plot BER (in log scale) as a function of reference voltage. In general, the BER is minimized at the zero crossing point (i.e., zero volts), because the crossing point corresponds to the maximum eye opening (width) with respect to the time axis. BER will increase at higher reference voltages, because of the random noise in the transmitted signals. In general, it is desirable for bathtub curves <b>161</b> to be far away from each other, because a wide bathtub characteristic indicates a larger eye opening for a respective axis (e.g., the time axis).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Plot <b>162</b> may plot BER as a function of strobe timing. In general, the BER in plot <b>162</b> is minimized at the center strobe timing (i.e., zero ps), because for a majority of the time, the center strobe timing corresponds to the maximum eye height in the voltage/amplitude domain. BER will increase at more distant strobe timing (i.e., timing farther away from zero ps), because of random jitter that is inherent to the transmitted signals. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, bathtub curves <b>163</b> are relatively wider than curves <b>161</b>, indicating that random noise has a more detrimental effect than the impact of random jitter in closing the eye diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, simulation tool <b>118</b> has determined that the corresponding maximum eye width EW is 44 ps and the corresponding maximum eye height EH is 50 mV (see, e.g., eye opening region <b>156</b>). These eye opening values are smaller than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, because signals at the input of equalizer <b>82</b> (e.g., at TP<b>3</b> before equalization) are more distorted than signals at the output of equalizer <b>82</b> (e.g., at TP<b>4</b> after equalization).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, data display screen <b>142</b> may also be used to display BER contour plot <b>159</b> using a 2D eye plot type. Contour plot <b>159</b> plots reference voltage versus time (i.e., strobe timing). Each contour line such as line <b>164</b>, <b>166</b>, or <b>168</b> corresponds to an eye opening having a respective BER value. In general, same contour lines with smaller openings have higher BER values (e.g., more degraded signals) while same contour lines with wider openings have lower BER values. For example, lines <b>164</b>, <b>166</b>, and <b>168</b> may correspond to contour curves with BER values of 10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup>, 10<sup>&#x2212;14</sup>, and 10<sup>&#x2212;16</sup>, respectively.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">At step <b>172</b>, link simulation tool <b>118</b> may run link analysis engine <b>120</b> to produce simulation results. The running of link analysis engine <b>120</b> may involve performing mathematical computations (e.g., 2D convolution operations, fast Fourier transforms, etc.), generating and displaying plots (e.g., eye diagrams, BER plots, noise/jitter histograms, etc.), and storing results in storage circuitry in the computing equipment that runs tool <b>118</b> (as examples).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Link simulation tool <b>118</b> may generate simulation results. The simulation results may be displayed on a screen such as the data display screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>. The simulation results may or may not satisfy design criteria depending on the requirements of the systems designer (step <b>180</b>). If the simulated results (e.g., eye width, eye height, jitter/noise histograms, BER contour plots, etc.) does not satisfy design criteria, processing may loop back to step <b>170</b> so that the design can be refined, as indicated by path <b>182</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">If the simulation results satisfy design criteria, link simulation tool <b>118</b> may supply output results to ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) or PLD (programmable logic device) CAD tools such as system <b>56</b>. These tools (e.g., system <b>56</b>) may then produce configuration data, masks for an ASIC, etc. (step <b>184</b>). Configuration data may be loaded onto a programmable integrated circuit such as programmable logic device integrated circuit <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> (step <b>186</b>). A programmable integrated circuit configured in this way will exhibit the desired link performance specified by the designer using link simulation tool <b>118</b> and system <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Link simulation tool <b>18</b> may be used to simultaneously simulate any number of communications links. Link simulation tool <b>118</b> serves as a generic, end-to-end statistical link simulator that can be used to design any desired high-speed communications link architecture. Link simulation tool <b>118</b> may provide coverage of any desired signal distortion/impairment mechanism (e.g., lossy medium, reflection, cross talk, interference, etc.) that affects overall link performance. Using link simulation tool <b>118</b> to design a high-speed communications link helps provide accurate and rapid link system architecture evaluation and selection results and helps provide fast performance and cost optimization results for link system and subsystem design.</p>
