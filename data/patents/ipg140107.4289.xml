<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean patent application number 10-2007-091541, filed on Sep. 10, 2007, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a programming method of a flash memory device and, more particularly, to a programming method of a flash memory device, in which 2-bits or more of data are stored in one memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A flash memory device may be a NOR and a NAND type device. The NAND flash memory device is advantageous because it supports a higher level of integration than that of the NOR flash memory device. A memory cell array of a NAND flash memory device includes a plurality of memory cell blocks. This is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating a memory cell block of a NAND flash memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a memory cell block includes a plurality of cell strings ST. The cell strings are connected to bit lines BL<b>1</b> to BL<b>3</b> (only three bit lines are illustrated to simplify description).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each cell string has a structure in which a drain select transistor DST, a plurality of memory cells C<b>0</b>-<b>1</b> to Cn and a source select transistor SST are connected in series. A drain of the drain select transistor DST included in each cell string is connected to a corresponding bit line and a source of the source select transistor SST is connected to a common source line CSL. Gates of the drain select transistors DST included in the respective cell strings are interconnected to form a drain select line DSL, and gates of the source select transistors SST are interconnected to form a source select line SSL. Gates of memory cells are interconnected to form word lines WL<b>0</b> to WLn.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To store data in the flash memory cell described above, a programming operation is performed. During the programming operation, a high program voltage of 15V or higher is applied to a selected word line (for example, WL<b>0</b>), and a pass voltage is applied to the unselected word lines irrespective of an erase state or a program state so that the memory cell is activated. Bit lines are applied with a ground voltage 0V.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">During the programming operation, a memory cell of a plurality of memory cells C<b>0</b>-<b>1</b> to C<b>0</b>-<b>3</b> that share the word line WL<b>0</b> is in an erase state (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;program-inhibited cell&#x201d;). A program-inhibited voltage (for example, Vcc) is applied to a bit line BL<b>2</b> connected to a string ST including a program-inhibited cell (for example, C<b>0</b>-<b>2</b>) that is in the erase state as described above. A channel region of the program-inhibited cell C<b>0</b>-<b>2</b> is precharged to the program-inhibited voltage. If a program voltage is applied to a word line, the voltage of a channel region is raised by channel boosting, such that a programming operation is not performed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A programming method of storing 2-bit data in one memory cell has recently been developed. Before a programming operation is performed, an erase operation of a memory cell block is performed, so that the memory cells are in an erase state. In general, all of the memory cells store 11 data in the erase state. The programming method of storing 2-bit data is performed through several programming operations, and includes a LSB programming operation of changing the 2-bit data from 11 to 10, and a MSB programming operation of changing the 2-bit data from 11 to 01 or from 10 to 00.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Generally, after the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation are sequentially performed on a selected word line, they are performed on a next word line. However, during the programming operation, the threshold voltage of a memory cell connected to a word line adjacent to the selected word line can be changed due to an interference phenomenon between memory cells. To minimize the change of the threshold voltage, the sequence of the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation and the sequence of word lines may be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">If the sequence is changed as described above, a memory cell C<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> located between the drain select transistor DST and a memory cell (for example, C<b>1</b>-<b>2</b>) connected to a selected word line, can be first programmed during a programming operation. In this case, the channel region of the memory cell C<b>0</b>-<b>2</b> located between the source select transistor SST and the memory cell C<b>1</b>-<b>2</b> connected to a selected word line is precharged to a low level, such that a channel voltage does not rise to a target voltage. Thus, a voltage difference between the word line WL<b>0</b> and the channel region of the memory cell C<b>0</b>-<b>2</b> is lowered, so that a programming operation of the memory cell C<b>0</b>-<b>2</b> is performed even though the programming operation should not be performed. Consequently, the threshold voltage may rise.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is directed towards a programming method of a flash memory device, in which a programming operation can be performed in a state where the entire channel region is precharged to the same level within a string by applying an activation voltage for activating a programmed second memory cell to a word line of the second memory cell located between a drain select transistor and a first memory cell connected to a selected word line before a program voltage is applied.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but may be implemented in various manners. The embodiments are provided to complete the disclosure of the present invention and to allow those having ordinary skill in the art to understand the scope of the present invention. The present invention is defined by the scope of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a programming method of a flash memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Numbers indicated within the squares designate the sequence of the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the programming method according to an embodiment of the present invention, in order to store 2-bit data in one memory cell, the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation are executed at every memory cell. It is to be noted that the LSB programming operation or the MSB programming operation may be performed, or a programming operation may not be performed depending on data stored in a memory cell. For example, in the event that 11 data is stored in a memory cell (that is, when the memory cell is in the erase state), a programming operation is not performed. On the other hand, when 10 data, 00 data or 01 data is stored in a memory cell, the LSB programming operation or the MSB programming operation may be performed, or both the programming operations may be performed. Hereinafter, for convenience of description, an example in which both the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation are executed is described. The following programming operation describes a programming method in which the threshold voltage of surrounding memory cells, which is changed due to an interference phenomenon, can be minimized when a memory cell is programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The LSB programming operation is first performed on memory cells C<b>0</b><i>o</i>, which are electrically connected to odd bit lines BLo while sharing a first word line WL<b>0</b>. The LSB programming operation is then performed on memory cells C<b>0</b><i>e</i>, which are electrically connected to even bit lines BLe while sharing the first word line WL<b>0</b>. Thereafter, the LSB programming operation is performed on memory cells C<b>1</b><i>o</i>, which are electrically connected to the odd bit lines BLo while sharing a second word line WL<b>1</b>. The LSB programming operation is then performed on memory cells C<b>1</b><i>e</i>, which are electrically connected to the even bit lines BLe while sharing the second word line WL<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After the LSB programming operation is performed on the memory cells sharing the first and second word lines WL<b>0</b> and WL<b>1</b> as described above, the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation are performed according to the following rule. After the LSB programming operation is performed on memory cells sharing a word line WLk (where k is an integer), the MSB programming operation is performed on memory cells sharing a word line WLk&#x2212;1.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the LSB programming operation is performed on memory cells sharing a word line WLk+1, the MSB programming operation is performed on memory cells sharing the word line WLk. Thus, the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation of memory cells sharing the word line WLk are completed. In a similar way, the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation are completed up to the last word line WLn.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If the programming operation is performed using the above method, the following phenomenon may occur in a string including program-inhibited cells.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a sectional view of a string structure for illustrating the channel boosting phenomenon during a programming operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph illustrating the operation voltage applied during a programming operation.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an N well <b>302</b> is formed in a cell region of a semiconductor substrate <b>300</b> and a P well <b>304</b> is formed in the N well <b>302</b>. A plurality of word lines WLk&#x2212;1 to WLk+2, where k is an integer (only four word lines are shown to simplify description), and select lines DSL and SSL, which intersect an isolation layer (not shown), are formed on the P well <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the event that memory cells sharing a selected word line (for example, WLk) are programmed, a program voltage Vpgm is applied to the selected word line WLk and a pass voltage Vpass is applied to the unselected word lines WLk&#x2212;1, WLk+1 and WLk+2 (only three word lines are shown to simplify description). A voltage (for example, 3V) for activating the drain select transistor is applied to the drain select line DSL, and a ground voltage (for example, 0V) is applied to the source select line SSL. A ground voltage or a positive voltage (for example, 3V) is applied to a common source line CSL connected to a source <b>306</b><i>s </i>of a string. When memory cells sharing the selected word line WLk within the string, on which programming should not be performed, include program-inhibited cells, a program-inhibited voltage (for example, 3V) is applied to a bit line BL. The program-inhibited voltage is transferred to a second channel region <b>308</b><i>b </i>through a drain <b>306</b><i>d </i>of the string and is thus precharged to the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b </i>within the string. As the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b </i>is precharged, the drain select transistor is deactivated due to the voltage difference between the gate and source of the drain select transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">During the process of performing the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation in order to store 2-bit data in one memory cell, the sequence of the LSB programming operation and the MSB programming operation and the sequence of programmed word lines are changed (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to minimize a change of the threshold voltage of adjacent memory cells due to an interference phenomenon. The programming operation can be performed on memory cells sharing a word line (for example, Wlk+1) located between the word line and the drain select line DSL before the programming operation of the selected word line WLk is performed. During a precharging operation, memory cells sharing an adjacent word line Wlk+1 are deactivated, so a channel region <b>308</b><i>c </i>is not formed below the word line WLk+1. Thus, a first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>located between the source select line SSL and the word line Wlk+1 is isolated from the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b </i>located between the drain select line DSL and the word line WLk+1. In other words, the precharge voltage is not transferred to the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>of memory cells that share the selected word line WLk and the word line WLk&#x2212;1 located between the source select line SSL and the selected word line WLk.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In order to prevent program-inhibited cells that share the selected word line WLk from being programmed, the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>is precharged, and the voltage of the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>is raised by the program voltage Vpgm or the pass voltage Vpass due to a boosting phenomenon. However, since the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>is isolated from the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b </i>during the precharging operation, only the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b </i>is precharged, so that a precharge level between the first and second channel regions <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b </i>differs. Since weak channel boosting is generated in the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a</i>, the voltage difference between the word line WLk and the channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>is increased. Further, since program-inhibited cells that share the selected word line WLk are weakly programmed, the threshold voltage is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A method of preventing these problems is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, for a programming operation, the ground voltage or a precharge voltage (e.g. a program-inhibited voltage Vbl) is applied to the bit line BL. For example, one word line WLk can be selected according to an address signal. A plurality of memory cells are connected to the selected word line WLk and the memory cells are included in different strings. The memory cells sharing the selected word line WLk can be classified into to-be-programmed memory cells and program-inhibited cells depending on data to be stored. The ground voltage is applied to a bit line connected to a string including the to-be-programmed memory cells, and the precharge voltage Vbl is applied to a bit line connected to a string including the program-inhibited cells. A programming operation within a string structure to which the precharge voltage Vbl is applied is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a precharge period T<b>1</b>, the ground voltage or the precharge voltage Vbl is applied to the bit line BL. The precharge voltage Vbl of a positive potential (for example, 3V) is applied to the bit line BL and a positive voltage Vdsl (for example, 3V) for activating the drain select transistor is applied to the drain select line DSL. The ground voltage is applied to the source select line SSL and the word lines. During a programming operation, memory cells sharing the word line WLk to which the program voltage Vpgm will be applied and the word line WLk+1 located between the word line WLk and the drain select line DSL are in a program state. Since a channel is not formed in the channel region <b>308</b><i>c </i>below the word line WLk+1, the first and second channel regions <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b </i>are isolated from each other, so the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>is not precharged. Memory cells sharing the word line WLk+2 located between the word line WLk+1 and the drain select line DSL are in the erase state, so that a channel region is formed below the word line WLk+2 and the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b </i>is precharged.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a charge transfer period T<b>2</b>, the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>is precharged so that the voltage of the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>has substantially the same level as that of the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b</i>. More specifically, a voltage sufficient to activate memory cells is applied to the word line Wlk+1 on which the programming operation has been performed. The word line WLk+1 is located between the word line WLk to which the program voltage Vpgm will be applied and the drain select line DSL. A voltage sufficient to activate memory cells may be applied to the word lines on which the programming operation has been performed including the word line WLk+1. As a channel is formed in the channel region <b>308</b><i>c </i>below the word line WLk+1, the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>and the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b </i>are connected. Consequently, the precharge voltage Vbl applied through the bit line BL is transferred to the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a</i>, so that the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>is precharged to substantially the same level as that of the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a channel voltage boost period T<b>3</b>, the pass voltage Vpass is applied to the unselected word lines but not including the selected word line WLk. The pass voltage Vpass is applied in a state where the drain select transistor is deactivated because Vgs of the drain select transistor sharing the drain select line DSL is lower than the threshold voltage. If the drain select transistor is deactivated, the channel regions <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b </i>are in the floating state. Thus, if the pass voltage Vpass is applied to the word lines, the boosting phenomenon is generated due to a capacitor coupling phenomenon, so the voltages of the channel regions <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b </i>rise. Since the first and second channel regions <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b </i>are precharged to substantially the same level, the voltages of the channel regions <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b </i>rise to the same level.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a programming period T<b>4</b>, the program voltage Vpgm is applied to the selected word line WLk on the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the boosting phenomenon can be additionally generated in the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a</i>. The voltage of the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>becomes higher than that of the second channel region <b>308</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, a voltage difference between the word line WLk and the first channel region <b>308</b><i>a </i>is further decreased. Accordingly, a program phenomenon can be further prevented from occurring in program-inhibited cells sharing the word line WLk.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">After the program voltage Vpgm is applied for a predetermined time period, the supply of the program voltage Vpgm is removed and the supply of the pass voltage Vpass is removed. The application of the voltage Vbl to the bit line and the voltage Vdsl to the drain select line DSL is removed. Accordingly, the voltages of the channel regions <b>308</b><i>a </i>and <b>308</b><i>b </i>can also be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If the programming operation is performed using the above method, a program disturbance phenomenon can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">After the programming operation is performed according to the above method, a program-verifying operation is performed. If, as a result of the program-verifying operation, memory cells have not been normally programmed, the level of the program voltage is changed and the programming operation is then performed again. This method is called a programming method of an Incremental Step Pulse Program (ISPP) method.</p>
