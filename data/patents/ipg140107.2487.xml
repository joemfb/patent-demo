<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Incorporated by reference in its entirety herein is a computer-readable nucleotide/amino acid sequence listing submitted concurrently herewith and identified as follows: 44,486 bytes ASCII (Text) file named &#x201c;708793SequenceListing.txt,&#x201d; created Aug. 9, 2011.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process for producing an L-amino acid using a microorganism having the capability of producing the L-amino acid, and having the L-amino acid transport activity higher than that of the parent strain. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for producing the L-amino acid wherein the L-amino acid productivity is increased by constructing a microorganism whose activity of transporting the L-amino acid from inside of the cell to outside of the cell is higher than that of the parent strain, allowing the microorganism to produce the L-amino acid, and efficiently exporting the produced L-amino acid from inside of the cell of the microorganism to outside of the cell.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Production of an amino acid by utilizing a microorganism is known as amino acid fermentation, and is traditionally widely conducted in the field of applied microbiology. In amino acid fermentation, in the final step thereof, amino acid transport activity, that is, how to facilitate the efflux of the resulting amino acid to the outside of the cell of the bacterium is an important process that influences amino acid productivity; various attempts have been made to date to increase the efficiency of efflux to the outside of the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Usually, active transport using bioenergy is necessary to transport an amino acid in the cell of a microorganism to outside of the cell. Proteins that export intracellular amino acids to outside of the cell (efflux proteins) have been identified; it is known that amino acid productivity can be also conferred or enhanced by enhancing the expression of the proteins. For example, a process for producing L-lysine using a strain of a microorganism of the genus <i>Corynebacterium </i>wherein the expression of the L-lysine, L-arginine efflux gene (lysE) (see non-patent document 1) is enhanced (see patent document 1); a process for producing L-cysteine, L-cystine, N-acetylserine or thiazoline derivative using a strain of a microorganism of the genus <i>Escherichia </i>wherein the expression of the efflux gene (rhtA) of L-threonine, L-homoserine (see patent document 2), and L-cysteine, L-cystine, N-acetylserine or thiazoline derivative efflux gene (ydeD/eamA) (see non-patent document 3) are enhanced (patent document 2); a process for producing L-amino acids, including L-lysine, using a strain of a microorganism of the genus <i>Escherichia </i>wherein the expression of the L-lysine efflux gene (ybjE) involved in L-lysine resistance is enhanced (patent document 3) and the like are known.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, no report is available on an efflux protein for L-serine and L-glutamine, and a process for producing the amino acids wherein the activity of the protein is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">By the way, the <i>Escherichia coli </i>norM gene is known to be an efflux pump gene related to quinolone resistance (non-patent document 4). The emrD gene is reported as an SDS transport gene (non-patent document 5). While rarD is predicted to be a drug transport gene, none of them is known to have an amino acid efflux activity (non-patent document 6). Meanwhile, the eamA(ydeD) gene is reported as a gene having efflux activity for L-cysteine, L-cystine, N-acetylserine or thiazoline derivative (non-patent document 3).</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0016">A problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide an efficient process for producing an L-amino acid by allowing a microorganism whose L-amino acid transport activity is higher than that of the parent strain to produce the L-amino acid. More specifically, the problem is to provide a novel manufacturing process of high productivity for the five neutral amino acids, including L-serine and L-glutamine, for which no manufacturing process based on enhanced L-amino acid transport activity has been available to date, by enhancing the efflux protein.</p>

</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0029">The manufacturing process of the present invention is a manufacturing process that is highly productive in producing an L-amino acid, particularly L-serine, L-glutamine, L-cysteine, L-phenylalanine or L-threonine.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0030">The manufacturing process of the present invention is a method of efficiently producing L-serine and L-glutamine using a microorganism by enhancing the activity of a protein having the activity of transporting an L-amino acid in the cell body of the microorganism to outside of the cell body. Also provided is a novel manufacturing process for L-cysteine, L-threonine and L-phenylalanine comprising enhancing the L-amino acid transport activity in the same way.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0031">The inventor of this invention found that the publicly known transport gene norM, emrD or rarD of <i>Escherichia coli </i>has the function of transporting an amino acid to outside of the cell, and also found that these transport genes can be advantageously utilized for producing L-serine or L-glutamine, or L-cysteine, L-threonine, or L-phenylalanine.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0032">The present inventor also newly found that eamA, which had been known to have L-amino acid transport activity, is also responsible for L-serine transport, and devised a process for producing L-serine by utilizing this.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0033">According to the method of the present invention, enhancing the activity of the aforementioned amino acid transport genes makes it possible to remarkably improve the production of L-amino acids by selective active transport of the produced L-amino acid to outside of the cell. Additionally, the microorganism used to produce an L-amino acid does not depend on the type of outer membrane (presence or absence of cell wall, capsule, mucus layer and the like), whether it is Gram-positive or Gram-negative. Hence, the manufacturing process of the present invention is a manufacturing process of high versatility that can be used both for Gram-positive bacteria such as genus <i>Corynebacterium</i>, genus <i>Bacillus</i>, and genus <i>Streptomyces</i>, and for Gram-negative bacteria such as genus <i>Escherichia</i>, genus <i>Serratia</i>, and genus <i>Pseudomonas. </i></p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0034">The manufacturing process of the present invention dramatically improves the production efficiency for L-serine and L-glutamine compared with conventional processes. L-serine, in particular, is an amino acid that plays an important role in living organisms despite its identity as a non-essential amino acid, and is of high utility as a raw material for amino acid mixtures in the field of pharmaceuticals and the field of cosmetics. L-glutamine is an amino acid that acts to keep normal the functions of the stomach, intestines, muscles and the like in the body, and serves as a raw material for anti-alcoholism compositions and the like. If a highly productive manufacturing process for these L-amino acids is established to enable their industrial mass-production, its industrial applicability would be very high.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0035">For L-cysteine, L-threonine and L-phenylalanine as well, the manufacturing process of the present invention has enabled more economic production. L-cysteine is an amino acid that is highly valuable in the cosmetic industry as a raw material for cosmetics because of its whitening effect. L-threonine and L-phenylalanine are both essential amino acids; L-threonine, as an ingredient of amino acid infusions and health foods, and L-phenylalanine, as a raw material for the low-calorie sweetener Aspartame (methyl ester of aspartylphenylalanine, 200 times as sweet as sugar), are useful amino acids whose productivity is expected to be improved by the manufacturing process of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0056">Amino acid sequence and nucleotide sequence homologies can be determined using the algorithm BLAST of Karlin and Altschul [Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 5873 (1993)] or FASTA [Methods Enzymol., 183, 63 (1990)]. Based on this algorithm BLAST, programs called BLASTN and BLASTX have been developed [J. Mol. Biol., 215, 403 (1990)]. When nucleotide sequences are analyzed with BLASTN on the basis of BLAST, parameters are set to, for example, score=100 and wordlength=12. When amino acid sequences are analyzed with BLASTX on the basis of BLAST, parameters are set to, for example, score=50 and wordlength=3. When the BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs are used, the default parameters of the respective programs are used. The specific ways of these analytical methods are well known.</p>
