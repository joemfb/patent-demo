<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A silicone composition is described that includes components having SiH/SiOH groupings and that can be polymerized/cross-linked by a dehydrogenative condensation reaction in the presence of a zinc catalyst and requiring a low activation temperature.</p>
</abstract>
<description id="description">
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 of FR 0902976, filed Jun. 19, 2009, and is the United States national phase of PCT/FR2010/000438, filed Jun. 15, 2010, and designating the United States (published in the French language on Dec. 23, 2010, as WO 2010/146253 A1; the title and abstract were also published in English), each hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety and each assigned to the assignee hereof.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of the catalysis of dehydrogenative condensation reactions which make possible silicone polymerization/crosslinking. The reactive entities involved are monomers, oligomers and/or polymers of polyorganosiloxane nature.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The reactive units concerned in these entities are, on the one hand, &#x2261;SiH units and, on the other hand, &#x2261;SiOH units. Dehydrogenative condensation between these silicone reactive units results in the formation of &#x2261;Si&#x2014;O&#x2014;Si bonds and in the release of hydrogen gas.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This dehydrogenative condensation is an alternative to the polymerization/crosslinking routes known in the field of silicones, namely the route of polyaddition by reaction between &#x2261;SiH and &#x2261;Si-alkenyl (vinyl) units, and the route of polycondensation by reaction between &#x2261;SiOR and &#x2261;SiOR units (with R=alkyl). All these polymerization/crosslinking routes result in more or less polymerized and more or less crosslinked silicone products which can constitute products that can be used in multiple applications: adhesives, leaktightness products, pointing products, adhesion finishes, release coatings, foams, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is known, according to French patent FR-B-1 209 131, that a reaction between a silanol Ph<sub>2</sub>Si(OH)<sub>2 </sub>and a said organosiloxane [(Me<sub>2</sub>HSi)<sub>2</sub>O] with Me=methyl and Ph=phenyl, by dehydrogenative condensation, can be catalyzed by a chloroplatinic acid (H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is also known practice to use a rhodium complex (RhCl<sub>3</sub>[(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S]<sub>3</sub>), for example as mentioned in American patent U.S. Pat. No. 4,262,107, a platinum complex such as the Karstedt catalyst, or platinum-based, rhodium-based, palladium-based or iridium-based metal catalysts. As iridium-based catalyst, mention may be made of the following compounds: IrCl(CO)(TPP)<sub>2</sub>, Ir(CO)<sub>2 </sub>(acac), Ir H(Cl)<sub>2</sub>(TPP)<sub>3</sub>, [IrCl(cyclooctene)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>, Ir I(CO)(TPP)<sub>2 </sub>and Ir H(CO)(TPP)<sub>3</sub>, in which formulae TPP signifies a triphenylphosphine group and acac signifies an acetyl acetonate group.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other examples are catalysts such as amines, colloidal nickel or dibutyltin dilaurate (see the handbook by Noll, &#x201c;Chemistry and technology of silicones&#x201d;, page 205, Academic Press, 1968-2<sup>nd </sup>edition). However, alkyltin-based catalysts, although they are very effective, most commonly colorless, liquid and soluble in silicone oils, have the drawback of being toxic (CMR2 toxic to reproduction).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other catalysts, such as boron derivatives of tris(pentafluorophenyl)-borane type, are described in French patent application 25 FR-A-2 806 930.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">American patent U.S. Pat. No. 4,262,107 describes a silicone composition comprising a polydimethyldisiloxane possessing silanol ends, a crosslinking agent consisting of a polyorganosiloxane possessing &#x2261;SiH units in the chain and possessing trimethylsilyl ends, and a catalyst consisting of a rhodium complex (RhCl<sub>3</sub>[(C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>3</sub>). This silicone composition which can be crosslinked by dehydrogenative condensation in the presence of a rhodium complex can be used for producing release coatings on flexible supports such as paper and plastic or metal films. The crosslinking is carried out at a temperature of 150&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">European patent application EP-A-1 167 424 describes the production of linear block silicone copolymers by dehydrogenative condensation of a polydimethylsiloxane possessing silanol ends and of a polyorganosiloxane comprising aromatic groups and possessing &#x2261;SiH ends, in the presence of a metal catalyst which may be platinum-based, rhodium-based, palladium-based or iridium-based, platinum being particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">French patent application FR-A-2 806 930 describes the use of boron derivatives of tri(pentafluorophenyl)borane type as a thermoactivatable catalyst for dehydrogenative condensation between a polyorganosiloxane possessing &#x2261;SiH units and a polyorganosiloxane possessing &#x2261;SiOH end units. Such silicone compositions which can be crosslinked by dehydrogenative condensation in the presence of Lewis acids of boron derivative type can be used for the production of release coatings on flexible supports, in particular on paper, and also in the production of crosslinked silicone foams in which the release of hydrogen and the quality of the crosslinking network are controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It emerges from this review of the prior art relating to the catalysis of dehydrogenative condensation between a polyorganosiloxane possessing a &#x2261;SiOH siloxyl unit and a polyorganosiloxane possessing a &#x2261;SiH siloxyl unit, that there is a significant need to:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">1) find new tin-free catalysts,</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">2) reduce the activation temperature of the catalyst, and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">3) limit the side reactions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, one of the essential objectives of the present invention is to propose a silicone composition comprising components bearing &#x2261;SiH/&#x2261;SiOH groups and which can be polymerized/crosslinked by a dehydrogenative condensation reaction, in the presence of a nontoxic catalyst which does not contain tin and which does not require a low activation temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another essential objective of the present invention is to provide a process for polymerizing and/or crosslinking a composition of the type of that mentioned in the description of the objectives above; this process must be rapid, economical and effective in terms of quality of final product obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another essential objective of the invention is to provide a process for the production of at least one release coating on a support (preferably a flexible support), which consists in using the process for crosslinking/polymerization or of the composition mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another essential objective of the invention is to provide a process for the production of at least one article made of crosslinked silicone foam, which consists in using the abovementioned crosslinking/polymerization process and/or the composition mentioned above in the objectives, this process making it possible to control the volume of hydrogen gas given off and the quality of the elastomer formed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">These objectives, among others, are achieved by means of the present invention which relates, first of all, to a siloxane composition X which can be polymerized and/or crosslinked by dehydrogenative condensation, comprising:

<p id="p-0036" num="0047">The catalyst (6) has the advantage of being liquid at ambient temperature (25&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0048">The use of such compounds, even in a small amount, makes it possible to catalyze this dehydrogenative condensation reaction between siloxane entities comprising &#x2261;SiH and &#x2261;SiOH units, under mild temperature conditions. Silicone polymers or networks are thus obtained in a few minutes, at ambient temperature, with varying &#x2261;SiH/&#x2261;SiOH ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0049">The in accordance with the invention are effective and economical, in particular with regard to platinum catalysts.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0050">They are also advantageous because, at low concentration, they require only limited amounts of energy in order to activate the dehydrogenative condensation. In particular, they can in fact be activated as soon as the temperature is at ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0051">They are in particular advantageous for preparing elastomeric silicone networks under mild and economical conditions. The applications targeted in this case relate in particular to the adhesion resistance of paper, where it is desired to replace the current systems with less expensive systems, and silicone foams, where it is desired to control the evolution of hydrogen and the quality of the network. For the first application, it is preferable to control the diffusion of the hydrogen in order to prevent the formation of bubbles. For the second application, it is necessary to manage the size of the bubbles in order to optimize the properties of the final foam.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0052">These results are all the more significant as the reactivity of siloxane entities, in particular in forming nonlinear (crosslinked) products, is not very high if it is compared with that of hydrosilanes and alcohols in dehydrogenative condensation.</p>
