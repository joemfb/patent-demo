<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The technology of the present application relates to modules associated with portable communication devices, and more specifically to monitoring and troubleshooting a module, such as a personal health module, associated with a portable communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Mobile computing devices are getting more capable with each new generation of technology. Mobile computing devices may generically be referred to as wireless devices, and include, for example, cellular telephones, wireless laptop computers, MP3 players (such as the IPOD&#xae;, by Apple, Inc.), electronic games, audio/video players, navigation devices (such as satellite position systems like the global positioning system), and the like. Moreover, as mobile devices become more and more ubiquitous in society, the distinctions and differences between various mobile computing devices are blurring. For example, many cellular telephones now contain capabilities for processing data typically associated with processing devices such as personal computers. Cellular telephones also double as digital cameras, video recorders and playback devices. Computers frequently contain voice communication capability and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As wireless devices become more ubiquitous and robust, proper operation of the devices have become more critical to the user. Critical to the user may revolve around personal information, job information, or the like including, for example, medical information, navigational information, banking and financial information, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One useful way to increase the functionality of a wireless device is to provide a portable communication device portion that provides base functionality but can couple to one or more specialty modules, for example, a personal health, module. Thus, the wireless device will have multiple and increased functionality but the base device can remain constant. In other words, using specialty modules provide a mechanism to increase the functionality of the wireless device while leaving the base portable communication device relatively unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As the uses of wireless devices increase, the need to monitor, diagnose, and troubleshoot operation of the portable communication device and the specialty modules associated with the wireless device increases. Thus, there is a need for improvements relating to monitoring, diagnosing, and troubleshooting a wireless device including the portable communication device and one or more specialty modules.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing methods for monitoring, troubleshooting, or diagnosing specialty modules connected to portable communication devices. The methods comprise, for example, identifying a specialty module connected to the portable communication device from a plurality of specialty modules adapted to be connected to the portable communication device and obtaining monitoring, testing, or diagnostic procedures based on the specialty module identified. The obtained procedures are executed by the portable communication device to generate a report. Using the report, it is determined whether a solution exists and, if so, the solution is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing a wireless device. The wireless device includes a portable communication device contained in a housing with a control processor for controlling, functions of at least fee portable communication device, a user interface to allow a user to interact with at least the portable communication device, transmit and receive circuits to provide modulation and demodulation of radio frequency signals between an antenna and the control processor and one or more specialty modules attachable to the portable communication device.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The technology of the present application will now be explained with reference to the figures. While the description and figures specifically relate to a cellular telephone for a portable communication device and a personal health module, such as a blood glucose monitor, for the specialty module, one of ordinary skill in the art on reading the disclosure would now understand that other portable communication devices and specialty modules are possible. For example, other portable communication devices may include, wireless computers, handheld computers, electronic games, MP3 players, portable digital assistance, and the like. Other specialty modules may include, financial modules, navigation modules, combining two or more portable communication devices or the like (for example, a cellular telephone with an MP3 player). Moreover, the technology of the present application will be described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof. The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any embodiment described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Moreover, unless explicitly stated, all provided examples should be considered exemplary.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wireless device <b>100</b> constructed, using the technology of the present application is illustrated. In this exemplary wireless device <b>100</b>, wireless device <b>100</b> includes a portable communication device <b>102</b> and a specialty module <b>104</b>. Wireless device <b>100</b> is shown partially exploded for convenience. Portable communication device <b>102</b> would have at least one radio frequency antenna <b>106</b>, but may have multiple antennas. Frequently, portable communication device <b>102</b> will transmit and receive radio frequency signals over multiple operational frequencies that may require either multiple antennas or a single antenna that operates over the necessary frequencies. Portable communication, device <b>102</b> may consist of any number of devices such as, for example, a wireless computer, a portable digital assistant (such as a BLACKBERRY&#xae;, from Research in Motion, Ltd), a cellular telephone, or the like. Although shown and described as a portable communication device, one of ordinary skill in the art on reading the present application will now recognize that wireless device <b>100</b> may be a wired, (or a traditionally non-portable) device including a conventional computing device that is connected to a network via a conventional modem, ISP, or the like via a wired connection. For example, instead of a portable communication device, wireless device <b>100</b> may comprise a desktop computer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Wireless device <b>100</b> as explained above also has one or more specialty modules (SMs) <b>104</b> attachable to portable communication device <b>102</b>, although only one SM <b>104</b> is shown for convenience. Optionally, portable communication device <b>102</b> has a recess <b>101</b> to accommodate SM <b>104</b> such that wireless device <b>100</b> houses both portable communication device <b>102</b> and SM <b>104</b>. SMs <b>104</b> may include, by way of non-limiting example, personal health modules, such as, a pulse meter, a blood glucose meter, a oxygen meter, a cardio monitor, etc. SMs <b>104</b> may include, by way of non-limiting example, application modules, such as, a navigation module, a financial module, a game module, a MPEG player, a MP3 player, etc. SMs <b>104</b> may be integrated into wireless device <b>100</b> or attachable to wireless device <b>100</b> as a plug-in module or the like, which would facilitate several SMs <b>104</b> being attachable to wireless device <b>100</b>. SM <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is removable from or attachable to wireless device <b>100</b> by, for example, a plurality of connections <b>108</b>, which are shown as snap fit connection <b>108</b>. As shown, snap fit connection <b>108</b> includes a protrusion <b>110</b> extending from SM <b>104</b> with a flared end <b>112</b> forming lip <b>114</b>. Protrusion <b>110</b> and flared end <b>112</b> fit into a corresponding socket <b>116</b> in wireless device <b>100</b> having a shoulder <b>118</b>. Protrusion <b>110</b> should be flexible to allow flared end <b>112</b> to pass shoulder <b>118</b> such that lip <b>114</b> and shoulder <b>118</b> abut to mechanically couple or snap fit SM <b>104</b> to portable communication device <b>102</b>. Electrical connection could be by conductive traces <b>120</b> on the snap fitting or a separate tab <b>122</b> with conductive traces <b>120</b> fitting into a slot <b>124</b> with corresponding conductive traces <b>120</b>. Electrical and mechanical coupling of SM <b>104</b> to portable communication device <b>102</b> should be arranged such that the electrical connection and mechanical connections facilitate connecting a plurality of SMs <b>104</b> to a plurality of portable communication devices <b>102</b>. Thus, for example, portable communication device <b>102</b> may couple (electrically and mechanically) to a first blood glucose meter SM <b>104</b> and a second navigation module SM <b>104</b>. Moreover, for example, first blood glucose meter SM <b>104</b> may couple (electrically and mechanically) to a cellular telephone portable communication device <b>102</b> or a personal computer portable communication device <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively to, for example, conductive traces <b>120</b> on tab <b>122</b> and corresponding conductive traces <b>120</b> in slot <b>124</b>, SM <b>104</b> may be wirelessly connected to portable communication device <b>102</b>. For example, SM <b>104</b> may include a radio frequency antenna <b>122</b><i>b </i>coupled to a corresponding radio frequency antenna <b>124</b><i>b </i>fanning a local wireless network between SM <b>104</b> and portable communication device <b>102</b>. While any radio frequency protocols couple be used to couple radio frequency antenna <b>122</b><i>b </i>and <b>124</b><i>b</i>, low power radio frequency systems used for personal area networks are particularly suited for such applications. Some exemplary personal area network protocols include IEEE 802.15, Bluetooth, Zigbee to name but three examples personal area networks. However, other wireless protocols also could be used, such as those protocols more commonly associated with IEEE 802.11 of which will is but one example.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Wireless device <b>100</b> is described generally as a compact device for mobility, but one of ordinary skill is the art will recognize that wireless device <b>100</b> also may be a special processor uniquely designed for the above system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a functional block diagram of portable communication device <b>102</b> and SM <b>104</b> are shown in more detail in an exemplary embodiment. Portable communication device <b>102</b> includes several components including a control processor <b>202</b>. Control processor <b>202</b> controls the major functions of portable communication device <b>102</b> including providing computing functionality to process the inputs and/or data required for the operation of portable communication device <b>102</b>. Transmit/receive circuitry <b>204</b> is connected to control processor <b>202</b> and antenna(s) <b>106</b>. Transmit/receive circuitry <b>204</b> may be one or more actual circuits and may work over various protocols and wavelengths. Transmit/receive circuitry <b>204</b> functions typical of such components as used in wireless communications, such as modulating signals received from the control processor <b>202</b> that are to be transmitted from antenna <b>206</b>, and demodulating signals received at antenna <b>206</b>. The demodulated signal is provided to control processor <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Portable communication device <b>102</b> includes a user interface <b>256</b>. User interface <b>256</b> may comprise a user interface typical of a cellular phone or typical of the wireless device, such as, for example, a keyboard, alphanumeric pad, mouse, track ball, touch screen, voice recognition, microphones, speakers, data ports, input ports, or the like. Optionally, as in this exemplary embodiment, user interface <b>256</b> may include features typical of SM <b>104</b>. Alternatively, SM <b>104</b> may have, a separate user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Portable communication device <b>102</b> includes a memory <b>208</b> connected to control processor <b>202</b>. Memory <b>208</b> may store data and processing instructions necessary or convenient for operation of portable communication device <b>102</b>. Memory <b>208</b> may include volatile and/or nonvolatile memory on any suitable media. Moreover, memory <b>208</b> may include a protected portion accessible only on entry of an authentication code, such as, for example, a password, or biometric data. Moreover protected portion may be encrypted. Memory <b>208</b> may store data relating to information recorded by SM <b>104</b> as well. For data contained in memory <b>208</b> relating to SM <b>104</b>, the data may be stored in memory <b>208</b> as if memory <b>208</b> was a primary store of data, a backup store of data for a memory contained in SM <b>104</b> (not specifically shown), used to check data stored in primary memory, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Portable communication device <b>102</b> includes a power source <b>210</b>. Power source <b>210</b> may be any conventional power source and is typically a battery pack. Power source <b>210</b> is connected to a recharge port <b>218</b> that is connectable to, for example, a wall socket, a car lighter, or the like. Portable communication device <b>102</b> also may include a data port <b>212</b> (data port <b>212</b> may sometimes be referred to as an input port <b>212</b> or an output port <b>212</b> depending on the context) connected to control processor <b>202</b>. While not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, portable communication device <b>102</b> includes additional components and connections, such as, for example, cables, interfaces, circuit boards, and the like conventional in such devices for operation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some cases, it may be desirous to isolate operation of SM <b>104</b> and portable communication device <b>102</b>. In those cases, portable communication device <b>102</b> may include an isolation circuit <b>214</b>. Isolation circuit <b>214</b> provides electrical isolation between portable communication device <b>102</b> and SM <b>104</b> to inhibit failures or operations of portable communication device <b>102</b> from electrically interfering with SM <b>104</b>. Alternatively, isolation circuit <b>214</b> may be contained in SM <b>104</b>. Additionally, shielding <b>216</b>, which may reside in portable communication device <b>102</b> or SM <b>104</b> may be provided to further isolate portable communication device <b>102</b> and SM <b>104</b>. For example, shielding <b>216</b> may include electromagnetic shielding to inhibit radio frequency transmissions from antenna <b>106</b> or other RF transmission components from interfering with the SM <b>104</b> or the associated SM control processor <b>220</b>. Types of electromagnetic shielding are generally well known in the art and will not be further explained herein. Shielding <b>216</b> may include beat shielding as is generally know in the art, such as, fiberglass insulation, phase change material insulations, or the like to regulate the temperature internal to SM <b>104</b>. Heat shielding may be necessary in some cases where SM <b>104</b> requires operation in a controlled, temperature (additional temperature precautions are described below). Heat shielding may be particularly useful as portable communication device may include electronic components that generate sufficient heat to impact the SM <b>104</b> operation. Shielding <b>216</b> also may include sealing components such as a gasket or o-ring to provide a moisture barrier to inhibit moisture from impacting SM <b>104</b>. Sealing components may include hermetic sealing components to reduce environmental impacts to SM <b>104</b>. Sealing components additionally may include antibacterial or anti microbial components and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown, control processor <b>202</b> contains a monitoring, troubleshooting, and diagnostic (MTD) component or unit <b>224</b>. While shown integrated in control processor <b>202</b>, MTD unit <b>224</b> may be a separate component integrated with portable communication device <b>102</b>. Operation of MTD unit <b>224</b> will be explained further below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a wireless communication system <b>300</b> is provided. Wireless communication system <b>300</b>, for example, may be a cellular communication system, such as, for example CMDA, GSM, or the like, in this system, wireless device <b>100</b> communicates, through antenna <b>206</b> for example, via a data link <b>308</b> to a base station <b>310</b>. Base station <b>310</b> has an antenna <b>312</b>. Antenna <b>206</b> and base station antenna <b>312</b> can transmit and receive respective radio frequency signals to allow data transfer between wireless device <b>100</b> and base station <b>310</b>. Base station <b>310</b> may have a network interface <b>314</b> such that it is interconnected to a network <b>316</b>. Network <b>316</b> may be several networks, but network <b>316</b> will be described as a single network for convenience. Network <b>316</b> typically is connected to servers <b>318</b> and/or service centers <b>320</b> as necessary. Servers <b>318</b> may include a remote monitoring, troubleshooting, and diagnostic (Remote MTD) component or unit <b>322</b>, the operation of which will be explained further below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Wireless communication system <b>300</b> is shown with a single wireless device <b>100</b> connected to a single base station <b>310</b>. It is envisioned, however, that wireless communication system <b>300</b> would support multiple wireless devices <b>304</b>, multiple base station <b>310</b> and multiple networks as a matter of design choice. In these instances, it may be beneficial to incorporate security measures in the system and assign unique identifiers to the remote stations.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As mentioned above, for a cellular telephone portable communication device <b>102</b> associated with wireless device <b>100</b>, it may communication with base station <b>310</b> using a conventional protocol, such as CDMA or the like, although any analog or digital protocol is acceptable. Moreover, while described using a cellular network for communication and data transfer between wireless device <b>100</b> and base station <b>310</b>, other wireless or wired networks are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As will be further explained in exemplary diagrams illustrating the operation of the technology, it can be appreciated that wireless communication system <b>300</b> provides MTD unit <b>224</b> to provide local monitoring, troubleshooting, and diagnostics locally of the wireless device <b>100</b> including portable communication device <b>102</b> and SM <b>104</b>. Wireless communication system <b>300</b>, however, additionally provides Remote MTD unit <b>322</b> to provide remote monitoring, troubleshooting, and diagnostic support to wireless device <b>100</b>. Remote MTD <b>322</b> may provide back-up functionality for MTD unit <b>224</b> as well as augmented and/or different monitoring, troubleshooting, and diagnostic functions that wireless device <b>100</b> may not have the capacity or speed to perform.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an exemplary flow chart <b>400</b> illustrating one possible operation of an embodiment of the technology of the present invention. The operations described here and below provide step by step illustrations of operation. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize now on reading the disclosure that these may be other, more, or less steps in the disclosed or alternative orders are possible. First, at step <b>402</b>, MTD <b>224</b> detects whether a SM <b>104</b> is connected to a portable communication device <b>102</b>. Detecting SM <b>104</b> may include mechanical means <b>170</b>, such as a switch or other mechanical switch connection (mechanical means <b>170</b> is shown as a switch depressed by protrusion <b>110</b>), and/or electrical connectivity, such as through conductive traces <b>120</b> on the snap fitting or a separate tab <b>122</b> with conductive traces <b>120</b> fitting into a slot <b>124</b> with corresponding conductive traces <b>120</b>. Detecting SM <b>104</b> may in combination or alternatively occur when user <b>302</b> inputs through the user interface or the like, that a SM <b>104</b> is connected. Next, at step <b>404</b>, MTD <b>224</b> determines or identifies SM <b>104</b>. Determining or identifying SM <b>104</b> may occur as SM <b>104</b> sends a positive indication of what type of module it is, such as, for example, a financial module, a cardio module, or the like, alternatively, control processor <b>202</b> may send a polling signal or interrogation signal requesting the identification information from SM <b>104</b>. Alternatively still or in some combination with the aforementioned, user <b>302</b> may input the type of module manually through a user interface. As can be appreciated from the above, different SMs <b>104</b> may be designed for connect with portable communication device <b>102</b>; therefore, for MTD <b>224</b> to run proper tests or the like, it likely should first identify the module connected. For example, MTD <b>224</b> may have a first set of tests or the like for a personal health module and a second set of tests of the like for a navigation module. Once identified, MTD <b>224</b> obtains testing, monitoring, and/or diagnostic procedures, step <b>406</b>. The procedures may be stored, within MTD <b>224</b>. Optionally, the procedures may be fetched from memory <b>208</b> or from servers <b>318</b>, step <b>408</b>. Once obtained, the testing, monitoring, and/or diagnostic procedures are executed on the identified SM <b>104</b>, step <b>410</b>. After execution, optionally, a report is generated regarding the procedures, step <b>412</b>. The report simply may be identification of deficiencies, unsatisfactory performance, errors, issues or the like associated with specialty module. Alternatively still, the MTD process may be remotely invoked by a network based service provider based on preset conditions, such as, for example, when a user initiates a session by signing in or the like, due to a period of inactivity of the specialty module for a period exceeding a predetermined threshold, based upon a reported problem from the user of the specialty module or the like, or upon the reception of unusual data.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Testing, monitoring, or diagnosis of SM <b>104</b> may result from standard procedures for all modules or be specifically related to the type module involved. Some test include, for example, mechanical connection, tests, electrical connection tests, software operation diagnostic tests, providing test signals and receiving proper return signals, or the like. Additional, and non-limiting, examples of types of testing and diagnostics include service availability testing (verifying the availability of network based services from the user's location); performance testing such as response time, available throughput, or the like; usage tracking logs; and security reporting, such as failed logins, suspicious packets from the network and certain unusual subscriber behaviors; and configuration and version testing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an exemplary flowchart <b>500</b> is provided illustrating one possible operation of an embodiment of the technology of the present invention. First, the report regarding the testing, monitoring, and/or diagnostic procedures is obtained, step <b>502</b>. The report may be contained in local or remote memory. The control processor <b>202</b> reviews the report to determine whether the SM <b>104</b> is operating satisfactory, step <b>504</b>. If the report indicates the SM <b>104</b> is operating satisfactory, the process terminates, step <b>506</b>. If the report indicates one or more non-satisfactory results, the control processor <b>202</b> reviews a troubleshooting database in memory (local or remote), step <b>508</b>, and determines whether a potential, solution to the one or more non-satisfactory result, step <b>510</b>. If a solution is not available, a warning or exception report may be, for example, communicated to the user <b>302</b>, step <b>512</b>. Alternatively, the procedures may be transferred to a remote system, see below (which may include escalating the issue to a human technician for trouble shooting). If a potential solution is available, the solution is applied, step <b>514</b>. Such solution may involve numerous troubleshooting and corrective procedures and steps such as, for example, powering down the SM <b>104</b> and restarting the SM <b>104</b>, booting the processors, installing a patch, transferring information and application between processors using simple network management protocols, downloading new software, updating versions, or the like as are generally known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">While MTD unit <b>224</b> may be completely installed on a portable unit, the portable unit limitations may require MTD unit <b>224</b> to be limited due to constraints associated with processing power, costs, and the like related to the portable communication device. Thus, the technology of the present application provides a Remote MTD unit <b>322</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an exemplary flowchart <b>600</b> is provided illustrating one possible operation of an embodiment of the technology of the present invention. First, a communication path is established between the wireless device and the servers, step <b>602</b>. The communication path may be established, for example, by the wireless device calling the servers, the servers calling the wireless device, or the like depending on the actual network protocols recognizing that calling is typically associated with cellular networks, such as CDMA or GSM networks. Next, a signal is transmitted to Remote MTD unit <b>322</b> requesting testing, monitoring, and/or diagnostic procedures, step <b>604</b>. The signal transmitted to Remote MTD unit <b>322</b> may be initiated by the wireless device to for a variety of reasons including, for example, the MTD unit <b>224</b> identified, but could not resolve a problem, the MTD unit <b>224</b> is not operating correctly, the MTD unit <b>224</b> did not identify a problem although the module is not working properly. Alternatively, Remote MTD unit <b>322</b> may poll wireless devices to see if services are necessary and/or the services may be scheduled in advance. Once requested, Remote MTD unit <b>322</b> would initiate monitoring, troubleshooting, and/or diagnostic procedures similar to those described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, step <b>606</b>. Next, remote MTD unit <b>322</b> would generate a report from the procedures and solve the identified issues similar to the operation described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, step <b>608</b>. Once the solution is presented, the process would terminate by disconnecting the connection, step <b>610</b>. Alternatively, as shown by the alternative flow path in dashed lines, Remote MTD <b>322</b> would receive information generated by MTD <b>224</b>, step <b>612</b>. Based on the information received, Remote MTD <b>322</b> may tailor a testing procedure or protocol, step <b>614</b>. Once developed, control would continue with initiating the testing procedure at step <b>606</b>.</p>
