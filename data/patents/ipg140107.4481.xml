<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Application JP 2006-055217 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Mar. 1, 2006, the entire contents of which being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a radio communication apparatus and a radio communication method for transmitting and receiving a signal by radio.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a radio communication system, there is known a radio communication apparatus that changes a modulation system and a transmission rate for data using information such as reception sensitivity and an error rate to perform optimum communication. For example, in general, a radio communication apparatus used for a wireless LAN or the like has a function of changing a transmission rate by switching an encoding rate in a convolutional encoder and a transmission rate of a modulation system in a modulator and realizing improvement of a communication quality.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such a radio communication apparatus, for example, JP-A-2003-209537 discloses a technique in which a communication apparatus sets measurement conditions for transmission line characteristics corresponding to types of information transmitted, performs ranking of transmission systems on the basis of a measurement result of the transmission line characteristics, and selects a transmission system used for communication.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">JP-A-2005-252718 discloses a technique for selecting one modulation system from plural modulation systems, which have different transmission rates, and modulating data while transmitting the data.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Most of radio communication apparatuses used in a radio communication system perform communication with one another with a certain degree of distance apart from one another. However, there are also known radio communication apparatuses that perform communication with one another in a state in which the radio communication apparatuses are close to or in contact with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When apparatuses communicate with each other in a state in which the apparatuses are remote from each other (a remote state) and when the apparatuses communicate with each other in a state in which the apparatuses are in contact with each other (a contact state), there is a limit in control based on the information such as reception sensitivity and an error rate Thus, it is not easy to judge these states and it is difficult to optimize modulation systems and the like in the respective states.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, it is desirable to provide a radio communication apparatus and a radio communication method that can surely discriminate a state in which radio communication apparatuses are remote from one another and a state in which radio communication apparatuses are in contact with one another and perform optimum communication in the respective states.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the invention, there is provided a radio communication apparatus that performs radio communication with another communication apparatus, the radio communication apparatus including an antenna unit, contact detecting means for detecting contact with the another communication apparatus, a first modulating and demodulating unit for performing communication in a state in which the radio communication apparatus is remote from the another communication apparatus, a second modulating and demodulating unit for performing communication in a state in which the radio communication apparatus is in contact with the another communication apparatus, and a control unit that performs control such that, while the contact detecting means does not detect contact with the another communication apparatus, the first modulating and demodulating unit is selected and the radio communication apparatus performs radio communication with the another communication apparatus via the antenna unit and, when the contact detecting means detects contact with the another communication apparatus, the second modulating and demodulating unit is selected and the radio communication apparatus performs radio communication with the another communication apparatus via the antenna unit.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An embodiment of the invention will be hereinafter explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a schematic structure of a radio communication apparatus according to the embodiment of the invention. A radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes an antenna unit <b>11</b>, a contact sensor <b>12</b> serving as contact detecting means that detects contact with another communication apparatus, a first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b> for performing communication in a state in which the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> is remote from the another communication apparatus, a second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b> for performing communication in a state in which the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> is in contact with the another communication apparatus, and a controller <b>15</b> for controlling operations of the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b>. The controller <b>15</b> is inputted with a contact detection signal from the contact sensor <b>12</b> and mainly controls a transmitting and receiving unit <b>16</b> including the antenna unit <b>11</b>, the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b>, and the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b>. The controller <b>15</b> performs control such that, while the contact sensor <b>12</b> does not detect contact with the another communication apparatus, the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b> is selected and the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> performs radio communication with the another communication apparatus via the antenna unit <b>11</b> and, when the contact sensor <b>12</b> detects contact with another communication apparatus, the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b> is selected and the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> performs radio communication with the another communication apparatus via the antenna unit <b>11</b>. In other words, the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> basically has two communication modes. One is a remote communication or separated communication mode suitable for communication in a state in which apparatuses are remote from each other and another is a contact communication mode suitable for communication in a state in which apparatuses are in contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block circuit diagram showing a more specific example of a structure of the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a signal input/output terminal <b>21</b> is connected to a common terminal of a changeover switch <b>22</b>, a selected terminal &#x201c;s&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>22</b> is connected to a terminal <b>23</b> of the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b> serving as a remote communication unit that performs modulation and demodulation in a communication system suitable for remote communication, and a terminal <b>24</b> of the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b> is connected to respective selected terminals &#x201c;s&#x201d; of plural, for example, four changeover switches <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, <b>25</b><i>c</i>, and <b>25</b><i>d</i>. Common terminals of these changeover switches <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, <b>25</b><i>c</i>, and <b>25</b><i>d </i>are connected to four antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>, and <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the antenna unit <b>11</b> via four phase regulators <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c</i>, and <b>26</b><i>d </i>of a phase control unit <b>26</b>, respectively. A selected terminal &#x201c;c&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>22</b> is connected to a terminal <b>27</b> of the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b> serving as a contact communication unit that performs modulation and demodulation in a communication system suitable for contact communication. Terminals <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>, <b>28</b><i>c</i>, and <b>28</b><i>d </i>of the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b> are connected to selected terminals &#x201c;c&#x201d; of the four changeover switches <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>, <b>25</b><i>c</i>, and <b>25</b><i>d</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The controller <b>15</b> subjects changeover switches <b>22</b> and <b>25</b> for switching and selecting the first and the second modulating and demodulating units <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> corresponding to the remote communication mode and the contact communication mode to changeover control and controls operations of the phase control unit <b>26</b> according to a contact detection signal from the contact sensor <b>12</b>. As the control of the phase control unit <b>26</b> by the controller <b>15</b>, in the remote communication mode, the controller <b>15</b> adjusts phases of signals to the respective antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the antenna unit <b>11</b> using the phase regulators <b>26</b><i>a </i>to <b>26</b><i>d</i>, controls directivity of the antenna unit <b>11</b>, and converges beams to cause the antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>to perform communication in a single channel In the contact communication mode, the controller <b>15</b> causes the antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the antenna unit <b>11</b> to perform communication in plural channels (four channels) in parallel. The controller <b>15</b> performs internal operation control (e.g., control for switching transmission and reception) for the first and the second modulating and demodulating units <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the first modulator and demodulator <b>13</b> for the remote communication mode, it is preferable to use a circuit of a communication system that, even if a symbol rate and a data rate are lowered, optimizes a signal by performing communication robust against multi-path, converging beams in plural antenna elements, and correcting a waveform distortion of a transmission channel using an equalizer. For example, it is possible to use a BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) spectrum-spread modulator and demodulator <b>31</b>. In the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b> for the contact communication mode, it is preferable to use a circuit that performs independent communication in each of plural antenna elements, parallelizes the antenna elements to increase a data rate, and performs simple high-speed communication. For example, it is possible to use a serial-parallel converter <b>51</b> and DBPSK (Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying) modulators and demodulators <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>, <b>52</b><i>c</i>, and <b>52</b><i>d </i>that operate inparallel in plural channels (four channels). Specific examples of internal structures of these devices will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a state in which radio communication is performed in the remote communication mode. In the remote communication mode, a symbol rate (the number of symbols that can be transmitted in a unit time) and a data rate (the number of bits that can be transmitted in a unit time) are controlled low to perform communication robust against multi-path. Antenna elements converges beams to optimize a signal.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a state in which radio communication is performed in the contact communication mode. In the contact communication mode, respective antenna elements perform independent communication. In the contact communication mode, the antennal elements are parallelized to increase a data rate. In the contact communication mode, it is possible to perform simple high-speed communication because a transmission line is short and there is no long multi-path.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the remote communication mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, both the changeover switches <b>22</b> and <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are changed over and connected to the selected terminal &#x201c;s&#x201d; side and the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b> comes into an operation state. In the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> on a transmission side, a transmission signal inputted from the data input/output terminal <b>21</b> is inputted to the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b>, subjected to, for example, BPSK modulation described later, and sent to the phase control unit <b>26</b> via the changeover switch <b>25</b>. The phase control unit <b>26</b> adjusts phases of signals outputted to the respective antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the antenna unit <b>11</b> and gives directivity to a radio wave outputted.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the remote communication mode, in the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> on a reception side, the antenna unit <b>11</b> receives a radio wave transmitted from the transmission side and signals from the respective antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>are sent to the respective phase regulators <b>28</b><i>a </i>to <b>28</b><i>d </i>of the phase control unit <b>26</b>. The phase control unit <b>28</b> estimates an arrival direction of the radio wave according to delays in arrival times of the signals from the respective antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d</i>. The phase control unit <b>28</b> multiplies respective antenna signals by a weight on the basis of the estimated arrival direction and combines the antenna signals to extract a signal arriving from a specific direction. The first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b> subjects a signal received by the antenna to, for example, BPSK demodulation and outputs the signal to the outside from the terminal <b>21</b> via the changeover switch <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the contact communication mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, both the switches <b>22</b> and <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are changed over and connected to the selected terminal &#x201c;c&#x201d; side and the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b> comes into an operation state. In the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> on the transmission side in this contact communication mode, a transmission signal inputted from the data input/output terminal <b>21</b> is inputted to the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b>, serial-parallel converted into signals in plural channels (four channels, for example). The signals are subjected to, for example, DBPSK modulation described later in parallel and sent to the antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the antenna unit <b>11</b>, respectively, via the change over switch <b>25</b> and the phase control unit <b>26</b>. In DBPSK modulation, since a transmission signal is subjected to differential coding, a circuit configuration is simplified, for example, carrier synchronization of a demodulator is unnecessary. Moreover, a satisfactory demodulation characteristic is obtained in fading that occurs in a transmission line. In this contact communication mode, a carrier wave is a millimeter wave having a wavelength longer than that of a microwave. The millimeter wave has a frequency of 30 GHz to 300 GHz. Thus, it is possible to realize a reduction in sizes of an antenna and an apparatus and use a wide band. The millimeter wave has a characteristic that the millimeter wave can be transmitted in multiple stages using the same frequency making use of a nature that a radio wave hardly reaches the distance. The millimeter wave is suitable for high-capacity communication. In this embodiment, a data rate of in a unit of 10 Gbps (bit per second) is assumed. Modulated waves are outputted in parallel using the four antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> on the reception side in the contact communication mode, radio waves transmitted from the transmission side are received by the antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>in parallel, demodulated (e.g., DBPSK demodulation) in the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b> in parallel, parallel-serial converted, and then outputted to the outside from the terminal <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As the contact sensor <b>12</b>, for example, there are an electric sensor that detects contact according to a change in an electrostatic capacity, an optical sensor that checks contact according to a state of reflection of light, and a mechanical switch that detects contact according to depression of a switch.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The number of antenna elements and the number of parallel channels are not limited to four. It is also possible to design the antenna elements and the parallel channels in an arbitrary number. The modulators and demodulators used in the first and the second modulating and demodulating units <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are not limited to the BPSK spectrum-spread modulator and demodulator and the DBPSK modulator and demodulator. For example, a DQPSK (Differential Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) modulator and demodulator may be used instead of the DBPSK modulator and demodulator. Instead of arranging the phase control unit <b>26</b> between the changeover switch <b>25</b> and the antenna unit <b>11</b>, a phase control unit or a phase combining unit for controlling phases of signals to respective antenna elements and controlling directivity may be provided between the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b> and the changeover switch <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart for explaining an operation for switching the communication modes by the controller <b>15</b>. The controller <b>15</b> performs switching of the remote communication mode and the contact communication mode on the basis of a detection result of the contact sensor <b>12</b> or the like. A default or initial state of switching processing in this embodiment is set as the remote communication mode.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step S<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the controller <b>15</b> starts communication in the remote communication mode. In step S<b>2</b>, when the contact sensor <b>12</b> detects contact with another communication apparatus, the controller <b>15</b> proceeds to step S<b>3</b> and informs, using remote communication, the radio communication apparatus of the communication partner that the remote communication mode is switched to the contact communication mode. When confirmation is received from the communication partner (step S<b>4</b>; YES), the controller <b>15</b> shifts to step S<b>5</b>. On the other hand, when confirmation from the communication partner is not received (step S<b>4</b>; NO), the controller <b>15</b> returns to step S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step S<b>5</b>, the controller <b>15</b> switches the communication mode to the contact communication mode and makes contact with the communication partner in a state in which the communication mode is switched to the contact communication mode. In the contact communication mode, as in the remote communication mode, when confirmation of the communication partner is received (step S<b>6</b>; YES), the controller <b>15</b> shifts to step S<b>7</b>. On the other hand, when confirmation is not received from the communication partner (step S<b>6</b>; NO), the controller <b>15</b> returns to step S<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described above, when confirmation from the communication partner is not received in steps S<b>4</b> and S<b>6</b>, the controller <b>15</b> returns to step S<b>1</b>. This is for the purpose of switching the contact communication mode to the remote communication mode and surely performing communication when it is difficult to perform effective communication in the contact communication mode.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step S<b>7</b>, the controller <b>15</b> transmits binary data for transmission in the contact communication mode (parallel channel transmission) When the communication in the contact communication mode is interrupted or a wrong reply is received in step S<b>7</b>, the controller <b>15</b> returns to step S<b>1</b> and switches the contact communication mode to the remote communication mode.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As explained above, in the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> according to the embodiment, it is possible to execute both communication suitable for a contact state and communication suitable for a remote state. The remote communication mode at the time when the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> is remote from the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> of the communication partner and the contact communication mode at the time when the communication apparatus <b>10</b> is in contact with the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> of the communication partner are switched.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the remote communication mode, reliability of communication is given priority. The remote communication mode is set to spread the data and be robust against multi-path. Although processing is complicated and a symbol rate and a data rate are not high, it is possible to perform stable and highly-reliable communication even if a distance to a communication partner is long. In the contact communication mode, priority is given to a communication capacity. Although communication becomes unstable when a distance to a communication partner is long, a modulation system is simplified, a large quantity of data are processed at high speed, and antenna elements are parallelized to further increase a data rate. In the contact communication mode, a millimeter wave suitable for a large capacity communication is used to increase a data rate.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is difficult to judge the remote communication mode and the contact communication mode only from a signal received. However, in the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> according to the embodiment, since the contact sensor <b>12</b> is provided, it is possible to easily detect contact. In the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> according to the embodiment, communication in the stable remote communication mode is performed first and, when the contact sensor <b>12</b> detects contact, switching of the modes is confirmed using remote communication and then the remote communication mode is switched to the contact communication mode. Consequently, wrong recognition of the contact sensor <b>12</b> or the like is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Specific examples of internal structures of the first and the second modulating and demodulating units <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block circuit diagram showing the BPSK spectrum-spread modulator and demodulator <b>31</b> as a specific example of a structure of the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b> for performing communication suitable for the remote state. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the BPSK spectrum-spread modulator and demodulator <b>31</b> has a structure in which a modulating circuit system <b>33</b> and a demodulating circuit system <b>41</b> corresponding to transmission and reception or modulation and demodulation are switched and selected by changeover switches <b>32</b> and <b>40</b>. The changeover switches <b>32</b> and <b>40</b> are subjected to changeover control by the controller <b>15</b> according to transmission and reception (or modulation and demodulation) operations. In other words, the terminal <b>23</b> of the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b> is connected to a common terminal of the changeover switch <b>32</b>, a selected terminal &#x201c;t&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>32</b> is connected to an FEC (Forward Error Correction) encoder <b>34</b> on an input side of the modulating circuit system <b>33</b>, a multiplier <b>39</b> on an output side of the modulating circuit system <b>33</b> is connected to a selected terminal &#x201c;t&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>40</b>, and a common terminal of the changeover switch <b>40</b> is connected to the terminal <b>24</b> of the first modulating and demodulating unit <b>13</b>. A selected terminal &#x201c;r&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>40</b> is connected to a multiplier <b>42</b> on an input side of the demodulating circuit system <b>41</b> and an FEC decoder <b>49</b> on an output side of the demodulating circuit system <b>41</b> is connected to a selected terminal &#x201c;r&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>32</b>. At the time of a transmission (modulation) operation, both the changeover switches <b>32</b> and <b>40</b> are changed over and connected to the selected terminal &#x201c;t&#x201d; side. At the time of a reception (demodulation) operation, both the changeover switches <b>32</b> and <b>40</b> are changed over and connected to the selected terminal &#x201c;r&#x201d; side.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The modulating circuit system <b>33</b> has a structure of a normal BPSK spectrum-spread modulator. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the modulating circuit system <b>33</b> includes, in order from the input side, the FEC encoder <b>34</b> that inserts redundant data of the FEC into a transmission signal, a synchronous-data inserting unit <b>35</b> that inserts synchronous data, a multiplier <b>36</b> that performs spectrum spread modulation using a PN code (Pseudo-Random number), an impulse adjuster <b>37</b> that adjusts an impulse response, a waveform shaper <b>38</b> that shapes a spectrum shape of the transmission signal to be within a necessary band, and the modulator (a multiplier) <b>39</b> that modulates a carrier wave using the transmission signal.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The FEC encoder <b>34</b> inserts redundant data for correcting an error using a Reed-Solomon code, a Trellis code, and the like. The synchronous-data inserting unit <b>35</b> inserts synchronous data into the front, the end, and the like of the Reed-Solomon code. The multiplier <b>36</b> multiplies an output from the synchronous-data inserting unit <b>35</b> by a fast pseudo-random code irrelevant to an inputted transmission signal called a PN code and applies spectrum spread modulation for spreading the transmission signal to a wide band to the output. The waveform shaper <b>38</b> performs band limitation for a signal. The impulse adjuster <b>37</b> adjusts an impulse of the waveform shaper <b>38</b> to prevent inter-symbol interference. The modulator (the multiplier) <b>39</b> modulates a carrier wave signal cos(2&#x3c0;f<sub>0</sub>t+&#x3c6;<sub>k</sub>) using the transmission signal.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The carrier wave signal modulated is extracted from the terminal <b>24</b> via the switch <b>40</b> and sent to the phase regulators <b>26</b><i>a </i>to <b>26</b><i>d </i>of the phase control unit <b>26</b> via the selected terminals &#x201c;s&#x201d; of the plural changeover switches <b>25</b><i>a </i>to <b>25</b><i>d </i>of the changeover switch <b>25</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, respectively.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The demodulating circuit system <b>41</b> has a structure of a normal BPSK spectrum-inverse-spread demodulator. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the demodulating circuit system <b>41</b> includes the demodulator (a multiplier) <b>42</b> that demodulates a received signal using a carrier wave signal, an equalizer <b>43</b> that returns a deteriorated waveform of a reception signal to an original signal waveform, a sampling unit <b>44</b> that samples an output of the equalizer <b>43</b> at a predetermined period, a multiplier <b>45</b> that multiplies an PN code by a sampled signal and subjects the PN code and the signal to spectrum inverse spread processing, an integrator <b>46</b> that integrates an output from the multiplier <b>45</b>, a determinator <b>47</b> that determines symbol data, a synchronous-data detecting unit <b>48</b> that detects synchronous data, and an FEC decoder <b>49</b> that performs error correction according to forward error correction.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At the time of signal reception, when a radio wave is received, the phase control unit <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> estimates an arrival direction of the radio wave according to delays in arrival times of signals in the antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>of the antenna unit <b>22</b>. The phase control unit <b>26</b> multiplies the respective antenna signals by a weight on the basis of the arrival direction estimated, combines the antenna signals to extract a signal arriving from a specific direction, and sends the signal to the terminal <b>24</b>.

In BPSK, phase modulation is performed in a unit of one bit. For example, it is determined that, when a phase is 0, transmission data is &#x201c;0&#x201d; and, when a phase is &#x3c0;, transmission data is &#x201c;1&#x201d;. The synchronous-data detecting unit <b>48</b> detects synchronous data. The FEC decoder <b>49</b> performs error correction using inserted redundant data.

<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block circuit diagram showing a specific example of a structure of the DBPSK modulator and demodulator <b>52</b> of the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b> for performing communication suitable for the contact state. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the terminal <b>27</b> is connected to a serial side of the serial-parallel converter <b>51</b> and the plural (e.g., four) DBPSK modulators and demodulators <b>52</b><i>a </i>to <b>52</b><i>d </i>are connected to a parallel side thereof. Since all of the DBPSK modulators and demodulators <b>52</b><i>a </i>to <b>52</b><i>d </i>have the same structure, only an internal structure of the DBPSK modulator and demodulator <b>52</b><i>a </i>is shown. Concerning the other DBPSK modulators and demodulators <b>52</b><i>b </i>to <b>52</b><i>d</i>, illustration of internal structures are omitted and explanations thereof are also omitted. The DBPSK modulator and demodulator <b>52</b><i>a </i>has a structure in which a modulating circuit system <b>54</b> and a demodulating circuit system <b>61</b> corresponding to transmission and reception or modulation and demodulation are switched and selected by changeover switches <b>53</b> and <b>60</b>. The changeover switches <b>53</b> and <b>60</b> are subjected to changeover control by the controller <b>15</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> according to transmission and reception (or modulation and demodulation) operations. In other words, a common terminal of the changeover switch <b>53</b> is connected to the parallel side of the serial-parallel converter <b>51</b>, a selected terminal &#x201c;t&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>53</b> is connected to an FEC encoder <b>55</b> on an input side of the modulating circuit system <b>54</b>, a multiplier <b>59</b> of the modulating circuit system <b>54</b> is connected to a selected terminal &#x201c;t&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>60</b>, and a common terminal of the changeover switch <b>60</b> is connected to the terminal <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the second modulating and demodulating unit <b>14</b>. A selected terminal &#x201c;r&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>60</b> is connected to a multiplier <b>62</b> on an input side of the demodulating circuit system <b>61</b> and an FEC decoder <b>67</b> on an output side of the demodulating circuit system <b>61</b> is connected to a selected terminal &#x201c;r&#x201d; of the changeover switch <b>53</b>. As the time of a transmission (modulation) operation, both the changeover switches <b>53</b> and <b>60</b> are changed over and connected to the selected terminal &#x201c;t&#x201d; side. At the time of a reception (demodulation) operation, both the changeover switches <b>53</b> and <b>60</b> are changed over and connected to the selected terminal &#x201c;r&#x201d; side.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At the time of transmission, the serial-parallel converter <b>51</b> serial-parallel converts a signal from the terminal <b>27</b> into 1-bit input/4-bit output and sends each bit of the output four bits to the DBPSK modulators and demodulators <b>52</b><i>a </i>to <b>52</b><i>d</i>, respectively. At the time of reception, the serial-parallel converter <b>51</b> parallel-serial converts signals from the DBPSK modulators and demodulators <b>52</b><i>a </i>to <b>52</b><i>d </i>into 4-bit input/1-bit output and sends the signals to the terminal <b>27</b>. This serial-parallel conversion/parallel-serial conversion is also subjected to changeover control by the controller <b>15</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The modulating circuit system <b>54</b> in the DBPSK modulator and demodulator <b>52</b><i>a </i>constitutes a normal DPSK modulator. The modulating circuit system <b>54</b> includes the FEC encoder <b>55</b> that inserts redundant data of the FEC into binary data for transmission, a synchronous-data inserting unit <b>56</b> that inserts synchronous data, an adder <b>57</b>, a delay circuit <b>58</b> that returns an addition output to the adder <b>57</b> with a delay of a predetermined time, and a modulator (a multiplier) <b>59</b> that modulates a carrier wave using a transmission signal.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The FEC encoder <b>55</b> inserts redundant data for correcting an error using a Reed-Solomon code, a Trellis code, and the like. The synchronous-data inserting unit <b>56</b> inserts synchronous data into the front, the end, and the like of the Reed-Solomon code. The modulator <b>59</b> modulates a carrier wave signal cos(2&#x3c0;f<sub>1</sub>t+&#x3b8;) using a transmission signal. The carrier wave signal modulated is extracted from the terminal <b>28</b><i>a </i>and sent to the antenna element <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the antenna unit <b>11</b> via the changeover switch <b>25</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the phase regulator <b>26</b><i>a </i>of the phase control unit <b>26</b>. Concerning the DBPSK modulators and demodulators <b>52</b><i>b </i>to <b>52</b><i>d</i>, modulated carrier waves are sent to the antenna elements <b>11</b><i>b </i>to <b>11</b><i>d </i>in the same manner. The carrier waves are transmitted to a communication apparatus of a communication partner in parallel in four channels.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The demodulating circuit system <b>61</b> in the DBPSK modulator and demodulator <b>52</b><i>a </i>constitutes a normal DPSK demodulator. The demodulating circuit system <b>61</b> includes the demodulator (the multiplier) <b>62</b> that multiplies a received signal by a carrier wave and demodulates the signal, a delay circuit <b>63</b> that delays the signal demodulated, an adder <b>64</b> that adds a signal from the demodulator (the multiplier) <b>62</b> and a signal from the delay circuit <b>63</b>, an LPF (low-pass filter) <b>65</b> that removes noise of a signal, a synchronous-data detecting unit <b>66</b> that detects synchronous data, and an FEC decoder <b>67</b> that performs error correction according to forward error correction.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The demodulator <b>62</b> demodulates a received signal using a carrier wave signal cos(2&#x3c0;f<sub>2</sub>t+&#x3b8;). The LPF <b>65</b> removes noise of the signal demodulated. A determinator determines a symbol of the received signal. The synchronous-data detecting unit <b>66</b> detects synchronous data. The FEC decoder <b>67</b> performs error correction using inserted redundant data.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this contact communication mode, phase adjustment in the phase regulators <b>26</b><i>a </i>to <b>26</b><i>d </i>of the phase control unit <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is not always necessary. However, it is possible to shift phases of carrier waves transmitted in parallel to control interference by delaying the carrier waves and match phases of carrier waves received in the antenna elements <b>11</b><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>d</i>. It is possible to use the phase adjustment for identification of channel interference and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As explained above, in the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> according to the embodiment, it is possible to switch both the contact communication mode suitable for the contact state and the remote communication mode suitable for the remote state. In the remote communication mode, reliability of communication is given priority. Data is spread and the remote communication mode is set to be robust against multi-path. Although processing is complicated and a symbol rate and a data rate are not high, it is possible to perform stable and highly-reliable communication even if a distance to a communication partner is long. In the contact communication mode, priority is given to a communication capacity. Although communication becomes unstable when a distance to a communication partner is long, a modulation system is simplified, a large quantity of data are processed at high speed, and antenna elements are parallelized to further increase a data rate.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is difficult to switch the remote communication mode and the contact communication mode only from a signal received. However, in the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> according to the embodiment, since the contact sensor <b>12</b> is provided, it is possible to easily and surely detect contact. In the radio communication apparatus <b>10</b> according to the embodiment, communication in the stable remote communication mode is performed first and, when the contact sensor <b>12</b> detects contact, switching of the modes is confirmed using remote communication and then the remote communication mode is switched to the contact communication mode. Consequently, wrong recognition of the contact sensor <b>12</b> or the like is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The invention is not limited to the embodiment. For example, in the embodiment, BPSK and DBPSK are explained as examples of a modulation system. However, the modulation system is not limited to these systems. When communication is performed between two radio communication apparatuses, the contact sensor only has to be provided in at least one of the radio communication apparatuses. In the embodiment, the radio communication apparatus has both the transmission function and the reception function. However, one radio communication apparatus only has to have the transmission function and the other radio communication apparatus only has to have the reception function. Besides, various modifications are possible without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations, and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
