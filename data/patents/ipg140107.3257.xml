No. 60/873,899, filed Dec. 8, 2006; the disclosures of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Stress engineering is an important technique for enhancing the performance of sub-100 nanometer (nm) metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), and a variety of stress-inducing techniques have been developed. Earlier techniques have limitations; specifically, the magnitude of stress that a technique may deliver may not be sufficiently large. Also, for many previously developed techniques, the channel stress decreases as the device is scaled up. Therefore, there is continued interest in strain-inducing techniques that can provide large magnitudes of strain in the channel and whose effectiveness is not decreased with increased scaling.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A technique is provided for inducing strain in a MOSFET channel by using elastic relaxation of a thin, buried strained layer (e.g., a SiGe layer) to induce tensile strain in an overlying layer (e.g., a Si layer). Embodiments include relaxation via an creation of a free surface via an amorphization implant and anneal and/or removal of semiconductor material, creation of a free surface on top of a channel by amorphization and anneal of the gate and/or removal of a sidewall spacer, the use of an unusually large sidewall spacer to increase the strain for very short gate lengths, utilization of other strain-inducing techniques including stress memorization, and implementation of the technique on a strained semiconductor-on-insulator (SSOI) substrate or strained silicon on a SiGe graded buffer to reduce plastic relaxation of originally present strain.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated through stress simulations of MOSFETs with a buried SiGe layer. The simulations were executed for different values of the key determinant of channel stress in a particular material system: a SiGe layer stress, a SiGe layer thickness, and an overlying silicon layer thickness. The design space is explored from L<sub>g</sub>=25 nm to L<sub>g</sub>=9 nm. More specifically, stress simulations were undertaken to examine the effectiveness of the technique in delivering stress to MOSFETs from the ITRS 65 nm node (L<sub>g</sub>=32 nm) through the 22 nm node (L<sub>g</sub>=13 nm). These simulations examined the preferred thicknesses of the two most important layers of the structure, the SiGe layer and the silicon layer disposed thereover, across technology generations. Large average stress levels [exceeding 1 gigapascal (GPa)] may be achieved using practically relevant thicknesses of silicon and SiGe. Significantly, the stress level appears to increase with decreasing gate length, so the technique is particularly relevant for future technology nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an aspect, the invention features a method for forming a structure. Embodiments of the method include forming a first crystalline strained semiconductor layer having a first lattice constant over a substrate. A second crystalline semiconductor layer having a second lattice constant different from the first lattice constant is formed on a top surface of the first crystalline semiconductor layer. A portion of the first crystalline semiconductor layer and a portion of the second crystalline semiconductor layer are amorphized and annealed to induce a change in the strain in the first crystalline semiconductor layer and in the second crystalline semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One or more of the following features may be included. Amorphizing may include performing an amorphization implant, and/or annealing may include a rapid thermal anneal. The first crystalline semiconductor layer may include an alloy of silicon and germanium, or it may consist essentially of silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably, the substrate is, e.g., (100) silicon, a strained-silicon-on-insulator substrate or a strained-semiconductor-on-insulator substrate. A thickness of the first crystalline semiconductor layer may be greater than a critical thickness of the first crystalline semiconductor layer disposed over silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a thickness of the first semiconductor layer is greater than a critical thickness and annealing is performed at a temperature sufficiently low to prevent relaxation of the first semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The structure may include an n-type field-effect transistor (N-FET). A strain-inducing overlayer may be disposed above the first crystalline semiconductor layer. The amorphized region may include a source or a drain of a field-effect transistor (FET).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect of the invention, a method for forming a structure is provided. In an embodiment, a first crystalline semiconductor layer is formed over a substrate, the first crystalline semiconductor layer being strained and having a first lattice constant. A second crystalline semiconductor layer is formed on a top surface of the first layer, the second crystalline semiconductor layer having a lattice constant different from the first lattice constant. A transistor is defined including a gate electrode, a source, a drain, and a channel region, the channel region including at least a portion of the second crystalline semiconductor layer. At least a portion of the gate electrode, source, and/or drain is amorphized to induce strain in the channel region.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another aspect of the invention features a method for forming a structure. In an embodiment, a first crystalline semiconductor layer that is strained and has a first lattice constant is formed over a substrate. A second crystalline semiconductor layer having a lattice constant different from the first lattice constant is formed on a top surface of the first crystalline semiconductor layer. A transistor including a gate electrode disposed above the second crystalline semiconductor layer is formed, as well as a sidewall spacer adjacent the gate electrode, and a channel region disposed below the gate electrode and at least partially in the second crystalline semiconductor layer. A free surface is created above the channel region in the gate electrode and/or the sidewall spacer.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>e</i>, the fabrication process of a buried layer strain-inducing technique, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, may proceed as follows. A substrate <b>100</b> may includes a crystalline semiconductor material. The substrate <b>100</b> may be, for example, a bulk silicon wafer, a bulk germanium wafer, an SOI substrate, or an SSOI substrate. The substrate <b>100</b> may include or consist essentially of a semiconductor material, such as a group IV element, e.g., germanium or silicon. In an embodiment, substrate <b>100</b> includes or consists essentially of (100) silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Substrate <b>100</b> is processed through a typical CMOS fabrication process up to and including the formation of first and second shallow trench isolation (STI) regions <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032; that define an active area therebetween and also provide isolation between subsequently formed adjacent devices. Each of the STI regions <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032; includes a dielectric material, e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) or silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), disposed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The STI regions may be formed using techniques well known in the art, for example as follows. Shallow trenches are etched into the substrate using a mask, e.g., a silicon nitride mask. The trenches may be filled with an oxide. The oxide material may be planarized by, e.g., chemical mechanical polishing, and the mask removed to reveal active areas disposed between the trenches.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The substrate <b>100</b> may be n-type doped or p-type doped and may include n-type wells where p-type MOSFETs may be formed; p-type wells where n-type MOSFETs may be formed; or twin wells (both n-type and p-type wells). The active areas may be implanted with an n-type or p-type implant to adjust the threshold voltage of the subsequently formed transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, a first semiconductor layer <b>120</b> is formed selectively over the crystalline semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, e.g., over an exposed portion of the substrate <b>100</b> disposed between two STI regions <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032;. The first semiconductor layer <b>120</b> includes a first semiconductor material and is strained. A second semiconductor layer <b>130</b> is formed over the first semiconductor layer <b>120</b>. The second semiconductor layer <b>130</b> includes a second semiconductor material and is relaxed. The first and second semiconductor layers may be formed on all of the active area regions on the substrate. In another embodiment, a masking layer may be deposited and patterned so that the first and second semiconductor layers are only formed on some of the active area regions. For example, the active areas in which PMOSFETs will subsequently be formed may be covered, while those in which the NMOSFETs will subsequently be formed may be revealed, so that the first and second semiconductor layers are only grown in the NMOSFET active areas and not in the PMOSFET active areas. In an embodiment, at least a top portion of substrate <b>100</b> consists essentially of relaxed Si, the first semiconductor layer <b>120</b> includes compressively strained SiGe and the second semiconductor layer <b>130</b> includes relaxed Si. In another embodiment, the first semiconductor material includes tensilely strained SiC and the second semiconductor material includes Si. In some embodiments, prior to the formation of the first semiconductor layer <b>120</b>, the exposed portion of the substrate <b>100</b> disposed between two STI regions <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032; is etched back slightly prior to the formation of the first semiconductor layer <b>120</b>, such that a top surface of the second semiconductor layers <b>130</b> is co-planar with a top surface of the STI regions <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, the substrate <b>100</b> is a strained-silicon-on-insulator substrate, and a thickness of the first crystalline semiconductor layer is greater than a critical thickness of the first crystalline semiconductor layer disposed over silicon. In some embodiments, the thickness of the first semiconductor layer may range from 5 nm to 50 nm, e.g., 12 nm, and a thickness of the second semiconductor layer may range from 1 nm to 25 nm, e.g., 6 nm. For more effective inducement of strain, the top second semiconductor layer is as thin as practically possible, and the underlying first semiconductor layer is as thick as practically possible. However, if the second semiconductor layer is too thin, carrier mobility may decrease, and if the first semiconductor layer is too thick, dislocations may be generated, thereby possibly causing transistor leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first crystalline semiconductor layer may have a first lattice constant and the second crystalline semiconductor may have a second lattice constant that is different from the first lattice constant.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, a transistor <b>140</b> is formed over the substrate <b>100</b>, first semiconductor layer <b>120</b>, and second semiconductor layer <b>130</b>, in accordance with methods known to one of skill in the art. Formation of the transistor <b>140</b> may include growing a gate dielectric layer, e.g., silicon dioxide, silicon oxy-nitride or a high-k dielectric <b>150</b>, followed by the formation of a gate electrode layer, e.g., polysilicon or metal. A masking layer <b>160</b>, e.g., silicon nitride, may be disposed over the gate electrode layer. The gate electrode layer and masking layer <b>160</b> are etched to define a gate electrode <b>165</b>. A shallow ion implant is performed to define source and drain extension regions <b>170</b>, <b>170</b>&#x2032;. A halo implant of opposite type (for example p-type if the extension is n-type) can be performed to control short-channel effects (the halo implant is not shown). The depths of the source and drain extension regions <b>170</b>, <b>170</b>&#x2032; are typically less than about 10 nm. Sidewall spacers <b>175</b>, <b>175</b>&#x2032;, formed from, e.g., silicon dioxide disposed over a silicon nitride layer <b>177</b>, are defined proximate the gate electrode <b>165</b> and over portions of the source and drain extension regions <b>170</b>, <b>170</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>, free surfaces <b>180</b>, <b>180</b>&#x2032; are defined by etching through portions of the first and second semiconductor layers <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> proximate sidewall spacers <b>175</b>, <b>175</b>&#x2032; by, e.g., a reactive ion etch or a selective wet etch. Thus, at least a portion of each of the first and second semiconductor layers <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> is removed to define recesses <b>185</b>, <b>185</b>&#x2032;. The free surfaces <b>180</b>, <b>180</b>&#x2032; are configured to allow relaxation of at least a portion of the strained first semiconductor layer <b>120</b>, i.e., the free surfaces are positioned to allow lateral expansion of the first semiconductor layer <b>120</b>. An edge of the first semiconductor layer <b>120</b>, i.e., a buried layer, is thereby exposed. The relaxation of the first semiconductor layer <b>120</b> induces strain in at least a portion of the overlying second semiconductor layer. A channel <b>187</b> may be defined in the second semiconductor layer <b>130</b> under the gate electrode <b>165</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the free surfaces <b>180</b>, <b>180</b>&#x2032; are lateral free surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>e</i>, a third semiconductor material <b>190</b> is re-grown in the recesses <b>185</b>, <b>185</b>&#x2032;. The third semiconductor material <b>190</b> may be relaxed and may include substantially the same material as the substrate, e.g., Si. In an embodiment, the relaxed third semiconductor material <b>190</b> has a lattice constant less than the lattice constant of the substrate material and induces tensile strain in the second semiconductor layer <b>130</b>. For example, the substrate <b>100</b> may include or consist essentially of Si, and the third semiconductor material <b>190</b> may include or consist essentially of SiC. In another embodiment, the relaxed third semiconductor material <b>190</b> has a lattice constant greater than the lattice constant of the substrate material and may induce compressive strain in the second semiconductor layer. For example, the substrate <b>100</b> may include or consist essentially of Si, and the third semiconductor material <b>190</b> may include or consist essentially of SiGe.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The third semiconductor material <b>190</b> may be doped n- or p-type to define source and drain regions <b>195</b>, <b>195</b>&#x2032;. The n-type/p-type doping may include arsenic and/or phosphorous/boron dopants and with a peak concentration of greater than 10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>and have a junction depth of about 90 nm. An activation anneal may be performed, and a CMOS process may be completed by metallization and definition of contacts (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>f </i>illustrates an alternative embodiment in which, after the definition of source and drain regions <b>195</b>, <b>195</b>&#x2032; and an activation anneal, a metal-semiconductor alloy, e.g., a silicide (not shown), is formed over the source and drain regions <b>195</b>, <b>195</b>, in accordance with methods known to those of skill in the art. A strained layer <b>197</b> is deposited over the gate electrode <b>165</b> and source and drain regions <b>195</b>, <b>195</b>&#x2032;. The strained layer <b>197</b> may include, e.g., tensilely strained silicon nitride. The strained layer <b>197</b> induces strain in the underlying transistor <b>140</b>, including in a channel <b>199</b> disposed under the gate electrode <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>f</i>, in some embodiments, the physical mechanism by which stress is induced in silicon is enabled by elastic deformation of a high aspect ratio Si/SiGe/Si stack created by the etch step. In terms of the fabrication process, the technique is similar to the SiGe source/drain stress technique widely used for PMOSFET fabrication. All tools and unit processes, therefore, suitable for implementing this technique are commonly available in a modern CMOS fabrication facility.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>b</i>, an alternative method for defining free surface <b>180</b> includes performing an amorphization implant and a subsequent thermal annealing step. Transistor <b>140</b> may be processed through the processing point illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, i.e., through the fabrication of the gate electrode <b>165</b> and source and drain extension regions <b>170</b>, <b>170</b>&#x2032;, but without forming masking layer <b>160</b> over the gate electrode <b>165</b>. An amorphization implant is performed to amorphize crystalline material in the gate electrode <b>165</b> and in portions of the crystalline first and second semiconductor layers <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> and substrate <b>100</b> disposed between the sidewall spacers <b>175</b>, <b>175</b>&#x2032; and STI regions <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>&#x2032;. Typical parameters for an appropriate amorphization implant may be, for example, a germanium implant with an energy of 60 keV and a dose of 5&#xd7;10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">After the amorphization implant, a thermal anneal is performed to recrystallize the amorphized portions of the gate electrode <b>165</b> and first and second semiconductor layers <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. Exemplary parameters for the thermal anneal are, e.g., a 1 second spike anneal at 1100&#xb0; C. The recrystallization of the amorphized materials creates the free surfaces <b>180</b>, <b>180</b>&#x2032; proximate the first semiconductor layer <b>120</b> in the source and drain regions, as well as in the overlying gate electrode <b>165</b>, and allows the portion of the first semiconductor layer <b>120</b> underlying the gate electrode <b>165</b> to relax and expand, thereby inducing strain in the overlying portion of the second semiconductor layer <b>130</b>. Additionally, the amorphization of the gate enables a higher level of strain to be transferred to the channel because a free surface is created on top of the channel, as well as adjacent to the channel. Because of amorphization, the channel is not constrained by the gate material, allowing the second semiconductor layer to be strained more effectively by the first semiconductor layer. CMOS processing may be completed by metallization and definition of contacts (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c</i>-<b>2</b><i>d</i>, in some embodiments, additional strain is induced by means of stress memorization. A strain-inducing layer <b>200</b> is deposited over the transistor <b>140</b> after amorphization of the gate, source, and drain but before a thermal anneal. The strain-inducing layer <b>200</b> may be tensilely strained. For example, if the substrate <b>100</b> is Si, then the strain-inducing layer <b>200</b> may comprise or consist essentially of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. A thermal anneal is then performed to re-crystallize the gate, source, and drain, and create a free surface adjacent to the channel in the source and drain and above the channel in the gate. Strain is transferred both to the channel and to the gate from both the underlying strained layer and the overlying strained layer.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Subsequently, the strain-inducing layer <b>200</b> is removed. Because of stress memorization, strain remains in the gate, causing additional strain in the second semiconductor layer <b>130</b> disposed under the gate electrode <b>165</b> and the channel <b>187</b>. A CMOS process may be completed by metallization and definition of contacts (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Stress memorization may be especially effective in combination with the strained buried layer technique. In many embodiments, the total effect of combining two strain-inducing techniques is linear, i.e., the strain in the channel as a result of the combination of the techniques is equal to the strain in the channel using the first technique plus the strain in the channel using the second technique. However, the combination of stress memorization and the strained buried layer may be super-linear, i.e., the strain in the combination may be greater than the strain obtained by only using stress memorization plus the strain obtained by only using the strained buried layer technique. The reason for this behavior is that the two techniques naturally reinforce one another. The stress memorization technique naturally provides a free surface on the top of the channel, therefore more strain is induced in the channel by the first semiconductor layer than if stress memorization was not used. Conversely, the strain in the first buried layer adds strain to the gate during the anneal step of stress memorization. Therefore, more strain may be incorporated into the gate, and therefore the channel as well, when stress memorization is combined with the strained buried layer technique, than when it is implemented without the strained buried layer technique.</p>

In some embodiments, the semiconductor layer <b>500</b> may be strained such that substrate <b>100</b> is an SSOI wafer. Transistor <b>140</b> may be formed as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>e </i>on the SOI or SSOI wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<b>6</b><i>e</i>, substrate <b>100</b> may include a strained layer <b>600</b> disposed over a graded buffer layer <b>610</b>. Strained layer <b>600</b> may include tensilely strained Si, and the graded buffer layer <b>610</b> may include SiGe.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The stress inducement techniques described herein are especially effective when used with SSOI or strained silicon on a graded buffer for two reasons. First, SSOI and strained silicon on SiGe graded buffer are susceptible to stress relaxation after a source/drain implantation. The mechanism of stress relaxation is the opposite of the stress-inducement process described herein: the source/drain implantation creates a lateral free surface and relaxes the desired strain. The problem of stress relaxation becomes severe for short gate lengths. For very small gate lengths (&#x3c;30 nm), a large portion of the stress at the surface of a MOSFET on an SSOI or a strained silicon wafer may be lost due to this phenomena. The strained buried layer described herein may be used to counteract the relaxation, and therefore make SSOI and strained silicon effective even for very short gate lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The second reason that the strained buried layer technique is especially effective on SSOI or strained silicon on a SiGe graded buffer is that it may be possible to use a more highly strained buried layer than on an unstrained substrate. As shown in the simulations below, the strain induced in the second semiconductor layer increases in proportion to the strain in the first semiconductor layer. Therefore, it is desired that the first semiconductor layer have a high level of strain. However, the strain level of the first semiconductor layer may be limited by the creation of dislocations. If the strain in the first semiconductor layer is too large, dislocations may be created that may cause leakage in a MOSFET which is subsequently formed. The strain energy in the first semiconductor layer is proportional to the square of the difference between the lattice constant of the substrate and natural lattice constant of the first semiconductor layer. Therefore, using a strained substrate layer (i.e., SSOI or strained silicon on SiGe graded buffer) may allow the first semiconductor layer to have more strain without generating dislocations.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, if the substrate material is silicon and the first semiconductor is SiGe with a germanium percentage of 25%, then the natural lattice constant of the first semiconductor layer is about 1% larger than the substrate lattice constant. Dislocations may be formed for a given thickness of the first semiconductor layer, and these dislocations may cause leakage in a MOSFET. In another case, the substrate is SSOI, the silicon is tensilely strained, and its lattice constant is about 0.5% greater than that of silicon, and the same SiGe film is used as the first semiconductor layer. In the latter case, the difference between the lattice constant of the substrate material and the natural lattice constant of the first semiconductor layer is about 0.5%. Therefore the strain energy in the SiGe is lower, and dislocations may not form. This thickness and strain of the first semiconductor layer may be usable on SSOI because substantially no dislocations are formed, whereas it may not be useable on silicon because of the formation of dislocations.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref><i>a</i>-<b>7</b><i>c</i>, sidewall spacers <b>175</b>, <b>175</b>&#x2032; may be engineered to induce a desired level of strain in second semiconductor layer <b>130</b> and the channel <b>187</b>.

A wide spacer may usefully allow a large amount of stress to be transferred to the second semiconductor layer even for very short gate lengths. For gate lengths that are very short, e.g., about 18 nm and with a standard spacer width, e.g., about 20 nm, the total width of the first semiconductor layer (gate length plus twice the spacer width) may be too small to transfer a large amount of stress to the semiconductor layer. Using a wider spacer results in a large total width of the first semiconductor layer, even with a very short gate length. However, the use of a wide spacer may be disadvantageous because of the high electrical resistance beneath the spacer from the channel to the deep source drain. Therefore, it may be useful to use the wide spacer as a sacrificial spacer, and remove it after etching, and then replace it with a device sidewall spacer (see, e.g., process flow discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a</i>-<b>9</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A typical width of the wide spacer is about 15-100 nm, and a typical width of the standard spacer is 10-30 nm. If the gate length is 12 nm, a typical spacer width may be about 10 nm. However, the total width of the first semiconductor layer after the recess formation may be only 32 nm. Using a wide spacer of about 18 nm instead of 10 nm may increase the total width of the first semiconductor layer to 48 nm, and may increase the amount of strain induced in the second semiconductor layer beneath the gate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Stress Simulations</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Stress simulations of the buried layer stress technique were carried out using the TSUPREM4 finite element analysis program. This program calculates the stress in a structure given an initial stress and the fabrication process steps. Stress contours were simulated in a SiGe layer and an overlying silicon layer for a simulated 22 nm node device with L<sub>g</sub>=13 nm, t<sub>spacer</sub>=14 nm, t<sub>Si</sub>=4 nm, t<sub>SiGe</sub>=16 nm, t<sub>etch</sub>=50 nm, and &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe</sub>=&#x2212;2.6 GPa (where &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe </sub>is the in-plane stress in the SiGe film prior to source/drain recess etch). The structure of the device is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>. Only the right half of the device was simulated because the structure is symmetric and simulation of the entire device would be redundant. For this example, the average stress under the gate at the gate oxide/silicon interface was 1.13 GPa, or 43% of the magnitude of the stress in the as-grown SiGe film prior to etch.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Stress simulations were conducted with various dimensions of t<sub>Si</sub>, t<sub>SiGe</sub>, t<sub>etch</sub>, and &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe</sub>, and the average stress at the gate oxide/silicon interface (&#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiAvg</sub>) was recorded for each case. Two initial conclusions were drawn from these simulations: 1) &#x3c3;<sub>SiAvg </sub>is insensitive to t<sub>etch </sub>as long as t<sub>etch </sub>is significantly greater than t<sub>Si</sub>+t<sub>SiGe</sub>, and 2) &#x3c3;<sub>SiAvg </sub>is a linear function of &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe </sub>(i.e., if &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe </sub>increases by a factor, then &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiAvg </sub>increases by the same factor). With this understanding, further simulations were conducted to determine the effectiveness of the buried stress layer for ITRS technology nodes from the 65 nm node (L<sub>g</sub>=32 nm) to the 12 nm (L<sub>g</sub>=10 nm) node. For each node, the gate length and spacer thickness (t<sub>spac</sub>) were set according to the 2005 ITRS road-map. See ITRS 2005, page 23. In these simulations, t<sub>Si </sub>was varied between 1 and 12 nm and t<sub>SiGe </sub>between 2 and 20 nm. t<sub>etch </sub>was kept constant at 50 nm and &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe </sub>was kept constant at &#x2212;2.6 GPa.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">A summary of the simulation results is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. These figures show the average channel stress relative to the SiGe stress prior to etch (abs(&#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiAvg</sub>/&#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe</sub>)) as a function of the gate length. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the relative average stress for different t<sub>Si</sub>, for t<sub>SiGe</sub>=12 nm. This plot shows that for a thin silicon layer, the average tensile strain transferred to the surface of the silicon layer increases as the gate length is reduced. However, the technique becomes less effective for thicker silicon layers. The transferred stress is reduced for thicker layers for all gate lengths, and it is reduced most greatly for short gate lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> explores the effect of the buried SiGe layer thickness. This figure shows the relative average stress at the silicon surface as a function of gate length for different values of t<sub>SiGe </sub>and a t<sub>Si </sub>of 4 nm. The average stress increases with increasing t<sub>SiGe </sub>for all values of L<sub>g</sub>. However, increasing t<sub>SiGe </sub>is not effective at increasing stress in the silicon film for a thick t<sub>SiGe </sub>at a short L<sub>g</sub>. This figure demonstrates that increasing the SiGe thickness improves the effectiveness of the technique, but that it is not useful to exceed a t<sub>SiGe </sub>of about 16 nm if the gate length of interest is less than about 16 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The simulation study showed that a thin silicon layer and a thick underlying SiGe layer are preferable for increasing tensile stress transfer into the silicon film. However, the simulations were done without regard for the practical limits of these layers. Previous work on MOSFETs built on biaxial strained silicon on a SiGe graded buffer layer has shown that a minimum silicon thickness is determined by Ge diffusion from the underlying SiGe layer. A silicon thickness of at least 4 nm is preferred for avoiding degradation of the channel mobility. The limit of the thickness of the SiGe is determined by dislocation formation in the SiGe. The compressed buried layer structure is particularly sensitive to dislocations in the SiGe layer since this layer extends between the source and drain, and dislocations in this position are known to form an electrical short due to enhanced dopant diffusion along the dislocation. The exact SiGe thickness limit to avoid the formation of dislocations is, however, unclear. A lower bound estimate is the equilibrium critical thickness, t<sub>crit</sub>. But this limit may be far too conservative, as it is well known that meta-stable films may be grown to several times the equilibrium critical thickness without dislocation formation if the growth temperature is low enough. Therefore, it may be possible to grow the SiGe layer several times the critical thickness while still avoiding the formation of dislocations.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> demonstrates the effectiveness of the strained buried layer technique using practical limits to t<sub>Si </sub>and t<sub>SiGe</sub>. Using specific data from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, this figure shows the average stress level at the surface of the silicon as a function of L<sub>g </sub>for t<sub>Si</sub>=4 nm and several different levels of the magnitude of stress &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe</sub>. For each level of stress t<sub>SiGe </sub>is set to two values, t<sub>SiGe</sub>=t<sub>crit </sub>and t<sub>SiGe</sub>=2&#xd7;t<sub>crit</sub>, where t<sub>crit </sub>is the equilibrium critical thickness of SiGe on Si. A table inset in the plot shows the magnitude of &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe</sub>, the corresponding Ge % in the SiGe film, and the critical thickness for the data that was used. As can be seen, high levels of tensile stress exceeding 1 GPa may be achieved using this technique for useable values of &#x3c3;<sub>xx</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub><sub>SiGe</sub>, t<sub>SiGe </sub>and t<sub>Si</sub>.</p>
