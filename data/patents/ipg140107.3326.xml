<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefit of Taiwan application serial no. 100101971, filed Jan. 19, 2011. The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a semiconductor structure and a manufacturing method thereof. More particularly, the invention relates to a package carrier and a manufacturing method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A chip package provides a chip with proper signal and heat transmission paths and protects the chip structure. A leadframe often serves as a carrier of a chip when a conventional wire bonding technique is applied. As contact density in a chip gradually increases, the leadframe which is unable to further improve the contact density can be replaced by a package substrate which can achieve favorable contact density. Besides, the chip is packaged onto the package substrate by conductive media, such as metal conductive wires or bumps.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the well-known common light emitting diode (LED) package structure, an LED chip need be packaged before the LED chip is used, and the LED chip generates a significant amount of heat when emitting light. Given the heat cannot be dissipated and continues to accumulate in the LED package structure, the temperature of the LED package structure is increasingly raised. As such, the overly heated LED chip may have luminance decay, shortened life span, or even permanent damages. Therefore, heat sinks are configured in the existing LED package structure, so as to dissipate heat of the LED chip.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The conventional package substrate is comprised of a plurality of patterned conductive layers and at least one insulating layer. The insulating layer is configured between two adjacent patterned conductive layers for electrical insulation. A thermal conductive block is fixed to a lower surface of the package substrate through an adhesive layer. In most cases, the LED chip is electrically connected to the package substrate, and heat generated by the LED chip can be conducted from the patterned conductive layers and the insulating layer to the thermal conductive block. Since the thermal conductivity of the adhesive layer and the insulating layer is unfavorable, thermal resistance increases when the heat generated by the LED chip is conducted from the insulating layer and the adhesive layer to the thermal conductive block, which leads to unsatisfactory heat dissipation. Hence, how to dissipate the heat generated by the LED chip to the external surroundings in an effective manner has become a focus to researchers and designers in this field.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention is directed to a package carrier suitable for carrying a heat-generating element.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention is further directed to a manufacturing method of a package carrier. By applying the manufacturing method, the aforesaid package carrier can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment of the invention, a manufacturing method of a package carrier is provided. The manufacturing method includes following steps. A substrate is provided. The substrate includes a first metal layer, a second metal layer, and an insulating layer configured between the first and second metal layers. A thickness of the second metal layer is greater than a thickness of the first metal layer, and the second metal layer has a top surface and a bottom surface opposite to the top surface. A first opening passing through the first metal layer and the insulating layer is formed. The first opening exposes a portion of the top surface of the second metal layer. The first metal layer is patterned to form a patterned conductive layer. A plurality of second openings are formed on the bottom surface of the second metal layer. The second metal layer is divided into a plurality of thermal conductive blocks by the second openings, and the second openings do not communicate with the first opening. A surface passivation layer is formed on the patterned conductive layer and the portion of the top surface of the second metal layer exposed by the first opening.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an embodiment of the invention, the step of providing the substrate includes providing the insulating layer and the first and second metal layers that are located at two opposites sides of the insulating layer. A thermal compression process is performed, such that the first metal layer, the insulating layer, and the second metal layer are integrated to form the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment of the invention, the step of forming the first opening includes stamping, routing, or laser drilling.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an embodiment of the invention, the thickness of the second metal layer is 1&#x2dc;100 times the thickness of the first metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an embodiment of the invention, a material of the first metal layer is copper foil.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an embodiment of the invention, a material of the second metal layer includes copper, copper alloy, aluminum, or aluminum alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an embodiment of the invention, a material of the insulating layer includes resin, liquid crystal polymer (LCP), or polyimide (PI).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an embodiment of the invention, the step of forming the second openings includes a photolithography and etching process, a mechanical drilling process, or a laser drilling process.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an embodiment of the invention, the step of forming the surface passivation layer includes electroplating.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment of the invention, a package carrier suitable for carrying a heat-generating element is provided. The package carrier includes an insulating layer, a patterned conductive layer, a thermal conductive block, and a surface passivation layer. The insulating layer has an upper surface, a lower surface opposite to the upper surface, and a first opening connecting the upper surface and the lower surface. The patterned conductive layer is configured on the upper surface of the insulating layer and exposes the first opening. The thermal conductive block is configured on the lower surface of the insulating layer. Besides, the thermal conductive block has a top surface, a bottom surface opposite to the top surface, and a plurality of second openings. The first opening exposes a portion of the top surface of the thermal conductive block to define a device bonding region, and the second openings do not communicate with the first opening. The surface passivation layer is configured on the patterned conductive layer and the portion of the top surface of the thermal conductive block exposed by the first opening. The heat-generating element is configured on the surface passivation layer correspondingly located above the device bonding region.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to an embodiment of the invention, a material of the patterned conductive layer is copper foil.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an embodiment of the invention, a material of the thermal conductive block includes copper, copper alloy, aluminum, or aluminum alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to an embodiment of the invention, a material of the insulating layer includes resin, LCP, or PI.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Based on the above, the package carrier described in the embodiments of the invention is formed by two different metal layers with respective thicknesses. Hence, the relatively thick metal layer can act as a thermal conductive block. Besides, the surface of the relatively thick metal layer can be exposed by openings, and the exposed surface can serve as a device bonding region. When a heat-generating element is configured on the package carrier, the heat-generating element is configured on the surface of the thermal conductive block, i.e., configured in the device bonding region. Accordingly, the heat generated by the heat-generating element can be rapidly conducted to external surroundings directly without being blocked by the insulating layer and the adhesive layer. As such, the package carrier described in the embodiments of the invention can effectively dissipate the heat generated by the heat-generating element, and the efficiency and the life span of the heat-generating element can both be improved.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views illustrating a manufacturing method of a package carrier according to an embodiment of the invention. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in the manufacturing method of the package carrier of this embodiment, a first metal layer <b>110</b>, a second metal layer <b>120</b>, and an insulating layer <b>130</b> configured between the first metal layer <b>110</b> and the second metal layer <b>120</b> are provided. The second metal layer <b>120</b> has a top surface <b>122</b> and a bottom surface <b>124</b> opposite to the top surface <b>122</b>. The insulating layer <b>130</b> has an upper surface <b>132</b> and a lower surface <b>134</b> opposite to the upper surface <b>132</b>. Specifically, in this embodiment, the thickness T<b>2</b> of the second metal layer <b>120</b> is greater than the thickness T<b>1</b> of the first metal layer <b>110</b>. Preferably, the thickness T<b>2</b> of the second metal layer <b>120</b> is 1&#x2dc;100 times the thickness T<b>1</b> of the first metal layer <b>110</b>. Besides, a material of the first metal layer <b>110</b> is copper foil, and a material of the second metal layer <b>120</b> is copper, copper alloy, aluminum, aluminum alloy, or other metal with good conductivity, for instance. A material of the insulating layer <b>130</b> is resin, LCP, or PI, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a thermal compression process is performed, such that the first metal layer <b>110</b>, the insulating layer <b>130</b>, and the second metal layer <b>120</b> are integrated to form the substrate <b>101</b>. Namely, by performing the thermal compression process, the first metal layer <b>110</b> is fixed onto the upper surface <b>132</b> of the insulating layer <b>130</b>, and the second metal layer <b>120</b> is fixed onto the lower surface <b>134</b> of the insulating layer <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a first opening S<b>1</b> passing through the first metal layer <b>110</b> and the insulating layer <b>130</b> is formed. The first opening S<b>1</b> exposes a portion of the top surface <b>122</b> of the second metal layer <b>120</b> to define a device bonding region <b>123</b>. In this embodiment, the first opening S<b>1</b> is formed by performing a stamping process, a routing process, a laser drilling process, or any other appropriate process, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the first metal layer <b>110</b> is patterned to form a patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032;. The patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; exposes a portion of the upper surface <b>132</b> of the insulating layer <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, a plurality of second openings S<b>2</b> are formed on the bottom surface <b>124</b> of the second metal layer <b>120</b>. The second metal layer <b>120</b> is divided into a plurality of thermal conductive blocks <b>126</b> by the second openings S<b>2</b>, and the second openings S<b>2</b> do not communicate with the first opening S<b>1</b>. Namely, the second openings S<b>2</b> do not communicate with the top surface <b>122</b> of the second metal layer. Here, the second metal layer <b>120</b> having the second openings S<b>2</b> can act as thermal conductive blocks <b>120</b>&#x2032;, and the second openings S<b>2</b> can serve as a fluid passage. In addition, according to this embodiment, the second openings S<b>2</b> are formed by performing a photolithography and etching process, a mechanical drilling process, or a laser drilling process, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be mentioned that even though the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; is formed before the second openings S<b>2</b> are formed in this embodiment, the steps of forming the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; and the second openings S<b>2</b> are not limited herein. According to another embodiment, the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; can also be formed after the second openings S<b>2</b> are formed. In still another embodiment, the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; and the second openings S<b>2</b> can be simultaneously formed if the etching rate is well monitored. In brief, the step of sequentially forming the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; and the second openings S<b>2</b> is exemplary and should not be construed as a limitation to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, a surface passivation layer <b>140</b> is formed on the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; and the portion of the top surface <b>122</b> of the second metal layer <b>120</b> exposed by the first opening S<b>1</b>. In other words, the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> is located on the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; and in the device bonding region <b>123</b>. Here, the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> serves to protect the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; and the portion of the top surface <b>122</b> of the second metal layer <b>120</b> exposed by the first opening S<b>1</b>, so as to reduce the oxidation rate. In this embodiment, a material of the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> is nickel gold, for instance, and the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> is formed by electroplating, for instance. So far, the fabrication of the package carrier <b>100</b> is substantially completed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The package carrier <b>100</b> of this embodiment structurally includes the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032;, the thermal conductive blocks <b>120</b>&#x2032;, the insulating layer <b>130</b>, and the surface passivation layer <b>140</b>. The insulating layer <b>130</b> has the upper surface <b>132</b>, the lower surface <b>134</b>, and the first opening S<b>1</b> connecting the upper surface <b>132</b> and the lower surface <b>134</b>. The patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; is configured on the upper surface <b>132</b> of the insulating layer <b>130</b> and exposes the first opening S<b>1</b>. The thermal conductive blocks <b>120</b>&#x2032; are configured on the lower surface <b>134</b> of the insulating layer <b>130</b> and have the top surface <b>122</b>, the bottom <b>124</b>, and a plurality of second openings S<b>2</b>. Specifically, the first opening S<b>1</b> exposes a portion of the top surface <b>122</b> of the thermal conductive blocks <b>120</b>&#x2032;, so as to define the device bonding region <b>123</b>, and the second openings S<b>2</b> do not communicate with the first opening S<b>1</b>. The surface passivation layer <b>140</b> is configured on the patterned conductive layer <b>110</b>&#x2032; and the portion of the top surface <b>122</b> of the thermal conductive blocks <b>120</b>&#x2032; exposed by the first opening S<b>1</b>. That is to say, the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> is configured in the device bonding region <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating that the package carrier depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> carries a heat-generating element. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment, the package carrier <b>100</b> is suitable for carrying a heat-generating element <b>20</b>. The heat-generating element <b>20</b> is configured on the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> correspondingly located above the device bonding region <b>123</b>. Here, the heat-generating element <b>20</b> is an electronic chip or a photoelectric device, for instance, which should not be construed as a limitation to the invention. For instance, the electronic chip can be an integrated circuit chip, e.g., a chip module or an individual chip that includes a graphic chip, a memory chip, a semiconductor chip, and so forth. The photoelectric device is a light emitting diode (LED), a laser diode, or a gas discharge light source, for instance. In this embodiment, the heat-generating element <b>20</b> is an LED, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specifically, the heat-generating element <b>20</b>, e.g., a semiconductor chip, can be electrically connected to the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> by wire bonding through a plurality of bonding wires <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the heat-generating element <b>20</b>, the bonding wires <b>22</b>, and a portion of the package carrier <b>100</b> can be encapsulated by a molding compound <b>24</b>, so as to secure the electrical connection among the heat-generating element <b>20</b>, the bonding wires <b>22</b>, and the package carrier <b>100</b>. In addition, the heat-generating element <b>20</b> can be directly configured on the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> correspondingly located above device bonding region <b>123</b>. Namely, the heat-generating element <b>20</b> is configured on the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> that is made of a metallic material (e.g., nickel gold) and located above the thermal conductive blocks <b>120</b>&#x2032;. Thereby, the heat generated by the heat-generating element <b>20</b> can be rapidly conducted to external surroundings through the thermal conductive blocks <b>120</b>&#x2032; and the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> which is made of the metallic material. Compared with the related art, in this embodiment, it is not necessary to additionally attach the thermal conductive blocks to the bottom of the package carrier through the adhesive layer, and the heat generated by the heat-generating element <b>20</b> need not be conducted through the insulating layer and the adhesive layer. As a result, the package carrier <b>100</b> not only can effectively dissipate the heat generated by the heat-generating element <b>20</b> but also can improve the efficiency and life span of the heat-generating element <b>20</b>. Moreover, the manufacturing costs can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note that the way to bond the heat-generating element <b>20</b> and the package carrier <b>100</b> and the type of the heat-generating element <b>20</b> are not limited in the invention. Although the heat-generating element <b>20</b> described in this embodiment is electrically connected to the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> of the package carrier <b>100</b> by wire bonding, the heat-generating element <b>20</b> in another embodiment can also be electrically connected to the surface passivation layer <b>140</b> located above the device bonding region <b>123</b> by flip-chip bonding through a plurality of bumps (not shown). In another embodiment of the invention, the heat-generating element <b>20</b> can be a chip package (not shown) and is installed to the package carrier <b>100</b> by conducting a surface mount technology (SMT). The way to bond the heat-generating element <b>20</b> and the package carrier <b>100</b> and the type of the heat-generating element <b>20</b> are exemplary and should not be construed as limitations to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In light of the foregoing, the package carrier described in the embodiments of the invention is formed by two different metal layers with respective thicknesses. Hence, the relatively thick metal layer can act as a thermal conductive block. Besides, the surface of the relatively thick metal layer can be exposed by openings, and the exposed surface can serve as a device bonding region. When a heat-generating element is configured on the package carrier, the heat-generating element is configured on the surface of the thermal conductive block, i.e., configured in the device bonding region. Accordingly, the heat generated by the heat-generating element can be rapidly conducted to external surroundings directly without being blocked by the insulating layer and the adhesive layer. As such, the package carrier described in the embodiments of the invention can effectively dissipate the heat generated by the heat-generating element, and the efficiency and the life span of the heat-generating element can both be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the invention has been described with reference to the above embodiments, it will be apparent to one of the ordinary skill in the art that modifications to the described embodiment may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention.
