<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/304,167, filed Feb. 12, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the field of rotary tool bits and more particularly to hole saws used with rotary power tools.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hand-held rotary tools are widely used by many people, including drywallers, professional remodelers, tile installers, homeowners, and artists. These rotary tools typically include an outer housing designed to be easily held within a human hand. The housing retains an electric motor which is operable to drive a rotatable collet or chuck of the rotary tool. An accessory may be releasably coupled with the collet thereby enabling the rotary tool to rotatably drive the accessory.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The widespread use of hand-held rotary tools is a result, in part, of the wide variety of accessories that may be used with the tools. The accessories include various cutting bits, cut-off wheels, polishing wheels, grinding wheels, and sanding discs. Another accessory is a device used to form larger holes in a material. This accessory is referred to as a &#x201c;hole saw.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some conventional hole saws share design features that prohibit such saws from being capable of removing chips from the cutting site in an efficient manner. The major design features that cause this inefficiency appear to include the number of teeth, the side clearance, and the absence of a chip conveyance device. When the teeth in these devices become filled with debris, the cutting process slows dramatically due to energy wasted to compact or churn the wood chips.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, some prior art hole saws have either a four or six teeth per inch (tpi) configuration which causes small gullets, or the open area adjacent to the cutting edge of the teeth, to have quite a small cross-sectional area. These small &#x201c;primary&#x201d; gullets can be easily clogged by chips during the cutting process which prevents each tooth from cutting effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The lack of an efficient means for removing debris is compounded by the practice in many known hole saws of using an alternating set pattern on the teeth. An &#x201c;alternating set&#x201d; is a pattern wherein one tooth is configured to cut along an arc with a diameter larger than the diameter of the body of the saw while an adjacent tooth cuts along an arc with a diameter smaller than the diameter of the body of the saw. The alternating set thus provides the necessary clearance for the outside diameter (&#x201c;OD&#x201d;) and inside diameter (&#x201c;ID&#x201d;) of the saw body. The generation of a cut line that is wider than the nominal width of the saw is acceptable when the tooth exits the cutting media, as in the case of circular saws, since the excess material is easily removed from the area whereat material is being removed by the saw. In the case of a hole saw, however, the excess material simply adds to the problem of clogging.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One hole saw which overcomes some of the problems identified above is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,803,677 of Brutscher, et al. which issued on Sep. 8, 1998. The device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,803,677 includes a cup with two cutting teeth positioned on the open end of the cup. The two cutting teeth are substantially diametrically opposed to one another to provide a balanced cutting engagement of the media and are spaced apart by a chord length of between about 45 to about 180 degrees. A pair of secondary gullets are positioned in the cup proximate to a forward cutting edge of the two cutting teeth. The secondary gullets have a predetermined depth and shape along a longitudinal axis of the cup to suitably remove debris from the cup during a portion of the duration of the hole cut. A plurality of raker teeth may be positioned on the chords defining the spacing between the cutting teeth. The raker teeth are disposed below the cutting teeth, approximately 0.030 inches to engage and move cutting debris formed by the cutting teeth. Accordingly, the device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,803,677 provides for improved removal of debris.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is a configuration for a hole saw that provides increased speed.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and described in the following written specification. It is understood that no limitation to the scope of the invention is thereby intended. It is further understood that the present invention includes any alterations and modifications to the illustrated embodiments and includes further applications of the principles of the invention as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> depict a rotary tool accessory <b>100</b> which includes a cup <b>102</b> with two grouped cutting sets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> spaced substantially diametrically opposed from each other about the cup <b>102</b>. In this manner, the rotational thrusts of the cutting sets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are balanced upon engagement and cutting of a media.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A center drill <b>108</b> may be secured to the base <b>110</b> of the cup <b>102</b> by an arbor assembly <b>112</b>. The center drill <b>108</b>, which may be permanently or removably coupled to the cup <b>102</b>, includes a fluted end <b>114</b> and a coupling end <b>116</b>. The coupling end <b>116</b> is configured for retention in a chuck or collet of a rotary tool while the fluted end <b>114</b> is used to provide precise positioning of the accessory <b>100</b> with respect to a work piece. The drill <b>108</b> defines an axis of rotation <b>118</b> for the accessory <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cup <b>102</b> includes a circular wall <b>120</b> which extends upwardly from the base <b>110</b> to a rim <b>122</b> which extends between an inner face <b>124</b> and an outer face <b>126</b>. Each of the grouped cutting sets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> include an outwardly extending tooth <b>130</b>/<b>132</b>, an inwardly extending tooth <b>134</b>/<b>136</b>, and a gullet <b>138</b>/<b>140</b>. The grouped cutting sets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are separated from each other by a toothless expanse <b>142</b> and a toothless expanse <b>144</b> of the rim <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The outwardly extending teeth <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> extend from a location above the rim <b>122</b> to a location farther from the axis of rotation <b>118</b> than the outer face <b>126</b> as shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The inwardly extending teeth <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> extend from a location above the rim <b>122</b> to a location closer to the axis of rotation <b>118</b> than the inner face <b>124</b>. The outwardly extending teeth <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> and the inwardly extending teeth <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> in this embodiment are configured to overlap a centerline <b>146</b> of the rim <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the inwardly extending teeth and outwardly extending teeth overlap the centerline at a leading tip of each of the inwardly and outwardly extending teeth. For instance, a leading tip <b>131</b> of the outwardly extending tooth <b>130</b> which is defined by an intersection of sides of the tooth <b>130</b>, is aligned with the centerline <b>146</b>. A leading tip <b>135</b> of the inwardly extending tooth <b>134</b>, which is defined by an intersection of the sides of tooth <b>134</b>, is also aligned with the centerline <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The gullets <b>138</b> and <b>140</b> form openings completely through the wall <b>120</b> and extend downwardly from the rim <b>122</b> toward the base <b>110</b>. The gullets <b>138</b> and <b>140</b> open to the rim <b>122</b> through ramped portions <b>150</b> and <b>152</b>, respectively, which are wider than the lower portions of the gullets <b>138</b> and <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each of the teeth in the grouped cutting sets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are associated with the gullet of the respective grouped cutting set <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. As used herein, a tooth is associated with the gullet through which a majority of the debris formed by the tooth is expelled as the accessory <b>100</b> progresses into a work piece. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts the accessory <b>100</b> as a cut is being made in a work piece <b>160</b>. As the outwardly extending tooth <b>130</b> encounters the work piece <b>160</b>, a curl <b>162</b> of debris is formed. The curl <b>162</b> is pushed by the extending tooth <b>130</b> in the direction of rotation which is indicated by the arrow <b>164</b>. The curl <b>162</b> is thus forced in the direction of the gullet <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Accordingly, as the accessory <b>100</b> progresses deeper into the work piece <b>160</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the debris <b>166</b> generated by the outwardly extending tooth <b>130</b> is propelled into the channel <b>168</b> formed by the work piece <b>160</b>, the core <b>170</b> being formed by the accessory <b>100</b>, and the gullet <b>138</b>. The debris <b>166</b> is thus forced upwardly by newly formed debris until the debris <b>166</b> can exit the gullet <b>138</b> above the work piece <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Similarly, debris formed by the inwardly extending tooth <b>134</b> is directed into the gullet <b>138</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, as the outwardly extending tooth <b>130</b> rotates through the work piece <b>160</b> in the direction of the arrow <b>172</b>, a channel <b>174</b> is formed. The channel <b>174</b> extends from a location about directly beneath the centerline <b>146</b> of the rim <b>122</b> (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to a location slightly outwardly of the outer face <b>126</b> with a width defined by the width of the outwardly extending tooth <b>130</b>. As the inwardly extending tooth <b>134</b> rotates in the direction of the arrow <b>172</b>, a channel <b>176</b> is formed. The channel <b>176</b> extends from a location about directly beneath the centerline <b>146</b> of the rim <b>122</b> (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) to a location slightly inwardly of the inner face <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The debris formed by the outwardly extending tooth <b>130</b>, as described above, is transported into the gullet <b>138</b>. Accordingly, the channel <b>174</b> is substantially free of debris when it is initially formed. As the inwardly extending tooth <b>134</b> generates debris, the debris is pushed in the direction of the gullet <b>138</b>. So long as the inwardly extending tooth <b>134</b> is close to the gullet <b>138</b>, the debris is pushed forward with sufficient force to become entrained in the flow of debris formed by the outwardly extending tooth <b>130</b> up the gullet <b>138</b>. Thus, the channel <b>174</b> and the channel <b>176</b> are substantially free of debris, reducing the potential for binding of the accessory <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The configuration of the grouped cutting sets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, with the inwardly extending teeth <b>134</b>/<b>136</b> immediately behind the outwardly extending teeth <b>130</b>/<b>132</b>, which are in turn immediately behind the gullets <b>138</b>/<b>140</b>, respectively, thus reduces the potential for binding of the accessory <b>100</b>. If desired, the order of the components of the grouped cutting sets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> can be modified. By way of example, the inwardly extending teeth <b>134</b>/<b>136</b> may be positioned immediately behind the gullets <b>138</b>/<b>140</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts an embodiment of an accessory <b>190</b> including grouped cutting sets <b>192</b> and <b>194</b> wherein the order of the components are modified from the order of the components in the grouped cutting sets <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. The grouped cutting set <b>192</b> includes an outwardly extending tooth <b>196</b>, an inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> and a gullet <b>200</b>. The grouped cutting set <b>194</b> includes an outwardly extending tooth <b>202</b>, an inwardly extending tooth <b>204</b> and a gullet <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> in the grouped cutting set <b>192</b> is located ahead of the gullet <b>200</b> (with reference to the direction of rotation). The inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> is still associated with the gullet <b>200</b>, however, since the gullet <b>206</b> of the grouped cutting set <b>194</b> is not proximate the extending tooth <b>198</b>. Specifically, while debris generated by the extending tooth <b>198</b> is pushed initially in the direction of the gullet <b>206</b>, the debris becomes entrapped in the channel formed by the outwardly extending tooth <b>202</b> prior to reaching the gullet <b>206</b>. The debris is subsequently expelled through the gullet <b>200</b> along with the debris generated by the outwardly extending tooth <b>196</b>. The flow of debris generated by the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> into the gullet <b>200</b> can be assisted by positioning the gullet <b>200</b> immediately behind the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In configurations with a leading tooth such as the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b>, the potential for binding may be reduced by providing a difference in height between the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> and the outwardly extending tooth <b>202</b>. By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> and the outwardly extending tooth <b>202</b> positioned side by side for purpose of comparing the relative height of the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> and the outwardly extending tooth <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The outwardly extending tooth <b>202</b>, which precedes the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> as the accessory <b>190</b> rotates, extends to a height above the rim of the accessory <b>190</b> indicated by the line <b>208</b> while the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> extends to a height indicated by the line <b>210</b>. The inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> thus moderates the speed at which the accessory bores into a work piece.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, the increased height of the outwardly extending tooth <b>202</b> creates a deeper channel adjacent to the channel being formed by the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b>. The deeper channel thus provides an increased volume for accumulating debris formed by the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b>. The increased volume reduces the potential for binding of the accessory <b>190</b> by debris formed by the inwardly extending tooth <b>198</b> but not yet drawn into the gullet <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition to modification of the order of the components in grouped cutting sets, the number of grouped cutting sets may be modified. The accessory <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example, includes four groups of cutting sets <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b>. As the number of cutting sets is increased, the location of the cutting sets about the perimeter of the accessory is preferably balanced such that each cutting set is separated from each adjacent cutting set by an equal spacing. Thus, the cutting sets <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, and <b>228</b> are separated by about 90 degrees. Balanced spacing can also be accomplished with odd numbers of cutting sets. The accessory <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, for example, includes three groups of cutting sets <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b> which are evenly spaced at about 120 degrees apart.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same should be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character. It is understood that only the preferred embodiments have been presented and that all changes, modifications and further applications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected.</p>
