<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to an electronic control and amplification device for a local piezoelectric force measurement probe under a particle beam.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATE OF PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The field of this invention is control and amplification electronics for local piezoelectric force probes, for combined use under illumination of an electron beam in scanning electron microscopes (SEM) or transmission electron microscopes (TEM) or in a focussed ion beam (FIB) probe, or in any environment in which there is a high energy charged particle beam present. The omnipresence of tools like SEM, TEM and FIB for industry and fundamental research, that is applied in micro-fabrication or microelectronics, illustrates the benefits of a device for in situ measurement of forces or mechanical and electronic characteristics occurring in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) used at the sub-micrometric scale, while displaying the system by far field microscopy in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For more than twenty years, local Atomic Force Measurement (AFM) type probes have had a unique potential to characterise forces over a range varying from a microNewton to a picoNewton over sections of a few nanometers through the apex of a microtip as described in document reference [1] at the end of the description. Standard AFM force measurement systems typically use laser optical detection to detect deflection of a microlever probing the surface of a sample through the apex of the microtip fixed to the end of said microlever. This detection technique known to those skilled in the art has the disadvantage that it is difficult to integrate into a constrained operating environment such as the vacuum chamber of a scanning electron microscope SEM or an FIB probe. Therefore, the local probe is constrained on several degrees of freedom in space. Document reference [2] discloses a system integrating a local force measurement probe in a SEM or TEM electron microscope or an FIB probe. Document reference [3] discloses integration of a local probe into such a far field microscope.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Local probes with built-in sensors can solve integration and movement problems. As described in document reference [1], local piezoelectric probes thus enable a sensitive detection in force overcoming a laser deflection detection system. A local piezoelectric resonant probe may be in the form of a monolithic quartz or a tuning fork supporting a microtip that probes the surface of the sample. This piezoelectric resonator is kept in oscillation. The interaction between the microtip and the surface of the sample causes a change in the resonant properties of this piezoelectric resonator; oscillation amplitude, drift in the resonant frequency, change in the excitation energy. Measurement of this change in resonance properties, for example the frequency drift, enables knowledge of the forces involved on the scanned sample, due to prior calibration. But this requires a precise measurement of the electrical displacement current (less than one nano-Ampere) generated by the probe. In an environment under a beam of electrically charged particles (electrons in SEM or TEM electron microscope, ions in a focussed ion beam (FIB) probe)), the emission current created in the sample by the beam prevents any combined use with the local piezoelectric probe. Preamplifiers according to known art for example as disclosed in document reference [4], cannot overcome this problem of a precise measurement of the probe displacement electrical current when the probe is illuminated by the beam of electrically charged particles. Furthermore, under the illumination of the beam of electrically charged particles, electrostatic discharge problems can damage preamplifiers used to measure the probe displacement current, under high energy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The purpose of the invention is to solve this technical problem by offering an electronic device for control and amplification of a local force measurement piezoelectric probe for integration and operation of this probe under a beam of charged or uncharged particles in an environment found particularly frequently in SEM or TEM type electron microscopes and focussed ion beam (FIB) probes, as conventionally used in microelectronics and micro-manufacturing to characterise and machine chips and micro-electromechanical and nano-electromechanical (MEMS, NEMS) systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention relates to an electronic control device for a local probe with piezoelectric resonator and preamplification and processing of its signals, this probe being designed for local measurement of the physical properties of a sample in an environment with a particle beam directed towards the probe, characterised in that:

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">an excitation voltage generated by excitation means is applied to the piezoelectric resonator through a first galvanic isolation transformer, and in that a current for measurement of mechanical oscillations of the piezoelectric resonator is applied through a second galvanic isolation transformer to preamplification means on the output side,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">the first and second transformers have a sufficiently high primary/secondary breakdown voltage to resist the overvoltage generated by the particle beam,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">the impedances of the transformer windings are sufficiently low so that the electrical current generated in the conducting elements by the electrical pulse induced by the particle beam is incapable of damaging the first stage of the preamplification means placed on the output side.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">Preferably, all windings in these transformers have one pole connected to the ground or to a virtual ground, in other words one input of an operational amplifier, the other input of which is connected to the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">The particle beam may be a beam of electrically charged particles, for example an electron or ion beam or a beam composed of electrically neutral particles such as atoms or neutrons.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0012">When the particle beam induces an electrical pulse, this parasite source behaves like a current source with an extremely high impedance (of the order of 10 or 100 MOhms or even more). The primary/secondary breakdown voltage of transformers according to the invention is chosen to be greater than the voltage induced by the product of this current and the impedance of the transformer winding.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">However, this induced voltage will drop as soon as the electrical pulse is received by an electrical conducting element because according to the invention, it is galvanically connected to a winding with a very low DC impedance (a few Ohms and preferably a fraction of an Ohm). The resulting voltage at the terminals of this conducting element is divided by the ratio between the impedances (for example 100&#xd7;10<sup>6</sup>/0.5), in other words a practically zero voltage. Obviously according to the invention, this voltage must be less than the breakdown voltage at the preamplifier input. However, this obvious condition is not always stated in the claim because it is always achieved with the impedance mismatch described above; this voltage induced at the terminals of the very low impedance winding of the transformer is typically of the order of one &#x3bc;V. Due to this mismatch, the pulse induced by the charged particle beam on the electrode of the local piezoelectric resonator probe connected to the transformer winding is not more than an induced voltage (of the order of one &#x3bc;V) which is much less than the breakdown voltage at the preamplifier input.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0014">The very low parasite current, when the particle beam induces an electrical pulse, is applied to the terminals of the piezoelectric resonator contained in the probe, the input impedance of which is of the order of 100 M&#x3a9; away from resonance, and 10 k&#x3a9; at resonance. However, since resonance is very sharp, it can be assumed that most of the energy due to the particle beam covers the piezoelectric resonator away from its natural frequency, in other words at 100 M&#x3a9;. The low impedance of the transformer winding connected to it, of the order of a few ohms and preferably less than one ohm, means that it can only apply an extremely low voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0015">According to the invention, the voltage induced by this extremely low current (typically of the order of one &#x3bc;A and preferably less) must be sized by the choice of components so that it does not induce any damage on the input stage of the preamplification means. Normally, these preamplification means are fitted with FET transistors and their electrical breakdown characteristics are known.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0016">Galvanic isolation transformers are chosen to be adapted to the frequency band of the piezoelectric resonator. Parameters to be considered for the piezoelectric resonator are its resonant frequency f0 and its quality factor Q=f0/Df, where Df is the band width at &#x2212;3 dB from its resonance curve in amplitude. For each winding, the primary inductance, the DC resistance, the inter-winding capacitance (between the primary and the secondary), the leakage inductance and the E.T. constant are controlling parameters for matching the frequency response of transformers around the resonant frequency f0 of the piezoelectric resonator. The inductance L<sub>prim </sub>of the primary winding of the transformer is the main parameter determining the low cutoff frequency f<sub>1 </sub>of the transformer, the DC resistance of the winding participating to a lesser extent. f<sub>1 </sub>is defined by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>f</i><sub>1</sub><i>=X</i><sub>1min</sub>/(2<i>*pi*L</i><sub>prim</sub>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where L<sub>prim </sub>is the inductance of the primary and X<sub>1min </sub>is the minimum reactance to achieve an attenuation G (in dB) of the signal amplitude at frequency f<sub>1</sub>. This reactance depends on the resistance of the input source, such that:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>X</i><sub>1min</sub><i>=Rg/(</i>2*&#x221a;{square root over ((<i>A</i><sup>2</sup>&#x2212;1))})<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where Rg is the resistance of the voltage source, and A=10<sup>(G/20) </sup>
<br/>
The high cutoff frequency f<sub>h </sub>of the transformer is determined by the leakage inductance L<sub>leak</sub>, and the inter-winding capacitance C<sub>i </sub>such that:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>fh=</i>1/(2<i>*pi*</i>&#x221a;{square root over ((<i>L</i><sub>leak</sub><i>*C</i><sub>i</sub>)))}<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Saturation of the magnetic core of the transformer may induce a distortion of the signal output from the secondary. The E.T. constant denoted K<sub>ET </sub>gives the limitation of the signal frequency that can pass through the transformer without any distortion effect for a given amplitude in volts of the signal input into the primary, such that:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>K</i><sub>ET</sub><i>=U*T </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where U is the amplitude of the input signal in volts and T is the period of the signal in microseconds. The theoretical parameter settings or the experimental measurement of dynamic parameters of the transformer are well known to those skilled in the art. Concerning calculation methods to configure the frequency passband of the transformer, it would for example be possible to use the document reference [6]. Document reference [7] discloses an accepted equivalent model known to those skilled in the art, to digitally simulate the transformer at low and high frequency, for example on a SPICE digital simulation engine. Methods of experimental characterisation of dynamic parameters of the transformer are given in reference document [8].

<p id="p-0015" num="0017">Advantageously, the first transformer is a symmetric point transformer, for which the ratio of the number of winding turns is 1:1+1.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0018">Advantageously, the second transformer has a ratio of the number of winding turns 1:1, with the same electrical characteristics as the first transformer. In this respect, the modulus of the output voltage applied to the secondary(ies) of the transformers will be equal to the modulus of the input voltage applied to the primary of the transformers. These characteristics of the two transformers enable a pass band type unit gain response within a frequency range around resonance f0 of the piezoelectric resonator and greater than the band width Df at &#x2212;3 dB from the resonance curve in amplitude of the piezoelectric resonator.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0019">Galvanic isolation transformers can resist an electric shock caused by a particle beam directed onto the probe. The emission current produced by the particle beam directed towards the probe and the sample is used to define the minimum breakdown voltage and the maximum pulse current from these two transformers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0020">Advantageously, the galvanic isolation transformer windings have a low input impedance at the emission current generated in the probe by the charged particle beam. The voltage thus generated at the terminals of the primary winding is equal to the product of the impedance of the winding and the emission current due to the presence of the beam on the piezoelectric probe. With a DC resistance of the order of one ohm and preferably less, the voltage induced by the particle beam is equal to not more than one microVolt. Furthermore, the low frequency almost DC component of the voltage on the transformer primary caused by the presence of the charged particle beam, is eliminated at the terminals of the secondary winding by the transformer galvanic isolation. Thus, all risks of breakdown on the high impedance input to the output operational amplifier is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0021">Concerning the possible electrical breakdown in galvanic isolation transformers, this breakdown only occurs when there is a difference in the threshold potential between the two windings (primary and secondary of each transformer) separated by electrical insulation.

<p id="p-0036" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first embodiment of the device according to the invention for local measurement of mechanical properties (force, stress, pressure) on a sample <b>10</b> with a piezoelectric probe <b>11</b> fitted with a microtip (tip) in an environment <b>14</b> with a beam of electrically charged particles <b>12</b> (SEM or TEM electron microscope or local FIB ion probe) oriented towards the piezoelectric probe <b>11</b> and the sample <b>10</b>, with an interaction between the microtip <b>22</b> (shown on the diagrams in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) and the sample <b>10</b> shown by a double arrow <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0046">This first embodiment comprises the following modules:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">

<p id="p-0038" num="0052">This first embodiment can give a total isolation between the local probe high frequency displacement current to simultaneously measure its mechanical oscillation movement, and the emission current generated by the electrically charged particle beam with continuous flow. It then becomes possible to make a characterisation by SEM, TEM or FIB imagery, while simultaneously measuring local forces at a scale of a few picoNewtons. The lack of external detection, as in the case of AFM laser detection, means that the local piezoelectric probe can enjoy degrees of freedom of movement in the three dimensions. Far field imagery (SEM, TEM or FIB) helps in judicious placement of the local probe for measurement of mechanical properties of the sample. Thus, it then becomes possible to machine a three-dimensional microstructure using an FIB probe, while measuring local forces, pressures or stresses on the sample at the same time. The force feedback can help optimum repositioning of the FIB probe ion beam.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0053">A second embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be used to make a local measurement of electronic properties (conductance, tunnel current) on a sample <b>10</b>, in addition to the local measurement of mechanical properties (force, stress, pressure) on the same sample by means of the piezoelectric probe <b>12</b> in an environment <b>14</b> in which there is an electrically charged particle beam.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0057">This second embodiment can make simultaneous local force and electronic current measurements between the microtip <b>22</b> and the sample <b>10</b>.

</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0065">The primary and secondary windings of the two transformers TR_<b>1</b> and TR_<b>2</b> are connected to the same ground potential (which includes the virtual mass of an operational amplifier input, of which the other input is the ground).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0066">The excitation stage comprising the first operational amplifier U<b>1</b> and resistances R<b>2</b> and R<b>1</b> is a voltage divider that excites the resonant piezoelectric probe <b>23</b> with very small oscillation amplitudes at the resonant frequency varying from a few tens of kiloHertz to several tens of megaHertz. Oscillation amplitudes of the order of one Angstr&#xf6;m guarantee very good force detection sensitivity without significantly disturbing the probed sample. The impedance matching stage R<b>3</b>-C<b>3</b> enables optimised impedance matching on the first isolation transformer TR_<b>1</b>. This transformer TR_<b>1</b> enables firstly transmission of the electrical excitation onto the piezoelectric resonator <b>23</b>, but also eliminates parasite capacitance effects known to those skilled in the art, related to the inter-electrode capacitance of the piezoelectric resonator but also to the length of the probe connection wires, due to the adjustment of the variable capacitor C_comp. The mechanical response of the piezoelectric resonator <b>23</b> interacting with the sample <b>10</b> causes a modification to the electric displacement current transmitted by the same wire on the second isolating transformer TR_<b>2</b>. Therefore the secondary of this transformer TR_<b>2</b> transmits this displacement current onto the second operational amplifier U<b>2</b> with the current-voltage conversion resistance R_trans_mecha. The network R<b>4</b>-C<b>4</b> enables optimised impedance matching with the second transformer TR_<b>2</b>. The first differential instrumentation amplifier U<b>3</b> outputs a voltage that can be used by a measurement system on the output side to extract modifications to resonance properties of the piezoelectric resonator <b>23</b> in interaction with the sample <b>10</b>, and therefore obtain local mechanical measurements. The presence of the two isolating transformers TR_<b>1</b> and TR_<b>2</b> acts like an electrical barrier that avoids contamination of the useful signal by the presence of the electrically charged particle beam on the probe, in the SEM, TEM or FIB chamber. Grounding of the microtip <b>22</b> through an electrode of the piezoelectric resonator <b>23</b> and the sample <b>10</b> enables evacuation of electrical charges due to the electrically charged particle beam and therefore avoids the appearance of disturbing electrostatic forces between the microtip <b>22</b> and the sample <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0067">The transformer TR_<b>2</b> has the advantage that it has a low input impedance at the signal from the piezoelectric probe <b>11</b> exposed to the charged particle beam. The voltage thus generated at the terminals of the primary winding of the transformer TR_<b>2</b> is equal to the product of the impedance of the winding and the emission current due to the presence of the beam on the piezoelectric probe. The result is thus a maximum voltage of one microVolt, the DC resistance of the winding being of the order of one ohm. During operations in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), a fraction of the secondary electrons that do not escape from the sample flows through the electrical ground. These secondary electrons are caused by the high energy electron beam. This current may be measured by placing an ammeter between the sample and the ground. This so-called &#x201c;absorbed&#x201d; current or &#x201c;probe&#x201d; or emission current varies from the order of one picoAmpere to a maximum of one microAmpere. Further details about this emission current can be found for example in documents reference [9) or [10].</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0068">Furthermore, the low frequency almost DC component of the voltage on the primary of the transformer TR_<b>2</b>, caused by the presence of the charged particle beam <b>12</b>, is eliminated at the terminals of the secondary winding of the transformer TR_<b>2</b> by galvanic isolation of the transformer. This avoids all risk of a breakdown charge on the high impedance input of the operational amplifier U<b>2</b>. Without the presence of the low impedance galvanic isolation of the transformer, the electrical transient of the emission current caused by ignition of the charged particle beam on the probe could cause a breakdown charge on the high impedance input of the output operational amplifier (typically of the order of one TeraOhm for an OPA657 type amplifier made by the Burr Brown company). The input stage of the output operational amplifier U<b>2</b> is usually fitted with FET transistors provided with an oxide gate of a few tens of nanometers, sensitive to a dielectric breakdown above an applied voltage of a few volts. The breakdown charge is proportional to the thickness of this oxide gate. Further details about the breakdown phenomenon of oxide gates in FET transistors are given for example in documents reference [11] or [12].</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0069">Similarly, transformer TR_<b>1</b> is capable of eliminating the low frequency almost DC component of the voltage created on its secondary, caused by the presence of the charged particle beam <b>12</b> on the probe <b>11</b>. Thus, this signal does not appear at the primary of TR_<b>1</b> so that the output from amplifier U<b>1</b> is not disturbed through resistance R<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0070">Concerning the possibility of an electrical breakdown in transformer TR_<b>1</b> or TR_<b>2</b>, this breakdown will only occur if there is a threshold potential difference between the two windings (primary and secondary of each transformer) separated by electrical insulation. This difference in potential becomes less than the breakdown voltage given in the manufacturer's technical datasheet for said transformer. In this invention, the electrical diagrams in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show that the primary and secondary windings of the transformer TR_<b>1</b> are directly connected to the same electrical ground. Thus, under the low frequency almost DC conditions of use of the charged particle beam <b>12</b> on the probe <b>11</b>, the primary and secondary of TR_<b>1</b> are connected to the same potential and therefore there will be no electrical breakdown. The primary winding of transformer TR_<b>2</b> is also directly connected to the ground; its secondary winding being connected to the same ground through the resistance R<b>4</b>. Considering a DC or low frequency condition under which capacitor C<b>4</b> can be treated like an open circuit, or a high frequency condition in which capacitor C<b>4</b> can be treated like a closed circuit on the virtual ground provided by the inverting (&#x2212;) input of the amplifier U<b>2</b>, it can be seen that the secondary winding is also at the same electrical potential as the primary winding of the transformer TR_<b>2</b>. Therefore, the risk of an electrical breakdown for TR_<b>2</b> is also avoided under these conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0071">However, for precautionary reasons, a certain value is kept for the transformer breakdown threshold to prevent any breakdown during the electrical transient caused by ignition of the electron beam <b>12</b> on the probe <b>11</b>. This requirement is satisfied by using a threshold value of 2 kiloVolts for transformers TR_<b>1</b> and TR_<b>2</b> used in a specific implementation of the device according to the invention.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0076">This second example embodiment uses the same structure as the first example embodiment except that the sample, instead of being connected to the ground, is polarised by a voltage V_charact by connecting it to the amplifier U<b>4</b> and to the current-voltage conversion resistance R_trans_elec. The differential instrumentation amplifier U<b>5</b> outputs a voltage that can be used by a measurement system on the output side to extract the microtip-sample surface current for a given voltage V_charact, and therefore to obtain local electronic conduction measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0077">Capacitive measurements on microsystems or on a chip may also be envisaged in an SEM electron microscope with the device according to the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by using the EFM (Electrostatic Force Microscopy) technique described in document [5].</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Specific Implementation of the Device According to the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a global view of the first example embodiment of the device according to the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> packaged and ready for use. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows details of such packaging. The first and second transformers TR_<b>1</b> and TR_<b>2</b> used for galvanic isolation <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> of the excitation stage <b>15</b> and preamplification stage <b>18</b> are chosen to be adapted to the frequency band of the piezoelectric resonator. In this embodiment, the first transformer TR_<b>1</b> is a symmetric point transformer in which the ratio of the number of winding turns is 1:1+1, and for each winding there is an inductance of 3 mH, a DC resistance of 1.3 ohms, an inter-winding capacitance of 30 pF (between the primary and the secondary), a leakage inductance of 8 uH and an E.T. constant of 200 V.us. The ratio of the number of winding turns in the second transformer TR_<b>2</b> is 1:1, and the electrical characteristics are the same as for transformer TR_<b>1</b>. These characteristics of the two transformers enable a unit gain response of the pass band type in a frequency range between 3 kHz and 1 MHz. The piezoelectric probe <b>22</b> used in this case has a resonant frequency of 32 kHz and a quality factor of 10,000.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0079">The electronic device according to this invention has been used successfully to observe a microelectromechanical system (MEMS), for example an extended spiral type nano-spring <b>25</b>, spirals being obtained by controlled growth of InGaAs/GaAs, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6E</figref>, under an SEM electron microscope and at the same time to analyse the mechanical force of this MEMS system. One end of this spiral <b>25</b> may be connected to the apex of the microtip <b>26</b> of the piezoelectric probe. The other end may be connected to a PicoProbe microtip <b>27</b> connected to a nanotranslator that is capable of extending or compressing the nano-spring in discrete steps of a few tens of nanometers. Furthermore, the first and second transformers TR_<b>1</b> and TR_<b>2</b> used for galvanic isolation <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> of the excitation stage <b>15</b> and preamplification stage <b>18</b> are chosen to resist an electric shock caused by the charged particle beam <b>12</b> directed onto the piezoelectric probe <b>11</b>. In this case, breakdown voltages (primary-secondary) of 2 kiloVolts for these transformers TR_<b>1</b> and TR_<b>2</b> can efficiently isolate the effect of an electron beam with an acceleration energy of 50 keV. The SEM images in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6D</figref> were obtained with an electron beam with an acceleration energy of 4 keV.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> thus represent SEM images of this nano-spring <b>25</b> glued at its two ends between the microtip <b>26</b> of the piezoelectric probe (in this case a quartz Tuning Fork) and the microtip <b>27</b> of the Picoprobe nanotranslator.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6C and 6D</figref> show two SEM images extracted from the film acquired during extension and then compression of the nano-spring <b>30</b> to the initial point.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> shows a frequency drift curve of the piezoelectric probe acquired simultaneously due to the electronic device according to this invention. The variation in the resonant frequency drift of the piezoelectric probe can thus be observed when the nano-spring <b>25</b> is stretched to a maximum of 1.5 &#x3bc;m and then compressed to its initial position due to the nanotranslator.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0083">The discrete steps of the nanotranslator are clearly visible, with the minimum and maximum in the curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> corresponding to the extreme positions of the images shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6C and 6D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0084">This result demonstrates real time monitoring by SEM imagery of a microelectromechanical system with a combined local measurement of forces involved, by measuring the frequency drift of the piezoelectric resonator. The frequency steps of the curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> correspond to a force of 3 nanoNewton per step of the nanotranslator.</p>
