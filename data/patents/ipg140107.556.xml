<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 of U.S. provisional application Ser No. 61/285,304 filed Dec. 10, 2009, and Canadian patent application Ser. No. 2,679,992 filed Oct. 13, 2009.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This document relates to the field of applying conductor cover, and more specifically to applying conductor cover on energized cables.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conductor cover may be installed over cables in order to protect energized cables from wildlife and other incidental contact that may cause power system faults or outages. Conductor covers such as Instant Insulation or Stinger Covers sold by Salisbury are examples of the type of cover used in the industry for this purpose. There are three basic work methods for applying conductor cover: application to a grounded (de-energized) system; application by a worker using rubber gloves to apply the conductor cover to a system that could be energized or de-energized; and application by a worker using a hotstick to apply the conductor cover to an energized or de-energized system. The hotstick method is the most desirable because it eliminates the risks to workers of working in the vicinity of energized components such as lightning arrestors and fused disconnects. Unfortunately, applying conductor cover over a cable is often difficult to accomplish, as the cover may be resilient in nature and awkward to handle. Also, the conductor is often free to move during installation and this can pose a risk to the individual applying the cover and/or to the energized system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One type of applicator used in the industry for applying such cover on energized conductor is the 2494 applicator, also sold by Salisbury. The 2494 applicator has two rigid closely-parallel prongs attached to one another at both ends. To install the conductor cover on a cable, one end of the Instant Insulation or other conductor cover is first flattened and inserted in between the applicator prongs. The prongs are then rolled to coil the insulation around the prongs. The prongs hold the cover flat, and a user can then place the flattened cover over a cable by unrolling the cover onto the cable.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An applicator is disclosed for applying a tubular conductor cover to a cable, the conductor cover being split longitudinally to define a first longitudinal edge and a second longitudinal edge, the applicator comprising: a head having a separator shaped to contact, in operation of the applicator, an interior surface of the conductor cover to spread open the first longitudinal edge and the second longitudinal edge along a portion of the conductor cover to allow the portion of the conductor cover to be applied to a cable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method is also disclosed of applying tubular conductor cover to a cable, the conductor cover being split longitudinally to define a first longitudinal edge and a second longitudinal edge, the method comprising: spreading open the first longitudinal edge and the second longitudinal edge of a portion of the conductor cover with a separator on a head, the separator contacting an interior surface of the conductor cover; and applying a length of conductor cover to the cable through the head.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Immaterial modifications may be made to the embodiments described here without departing from what is covered by the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Tubular conductor covers, such as resilient conductor covers, may be applied to electric cables as a permanent cover to protect against outages caused by weather, trees and animals. Conductor covers typically resist ozone and ultraviolet deterioration, while remaining flexible even at low temperatures. Conductor covers may be made from resilient material, in order to stay firmly wrapped around an energized cable after application. Conductor covers are made from, for example, SALCOR elastomer, silicon rubber tubing, or other polymeric material. Conductor covers are generally dielectrics that act as a barrier to prevent the inadvertent transfer of electrical energy from the cable.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate two different types of conductor cover. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a cover <b>10</b> is illustrated with cover <b>10</b> split longitudinally to form an overlapping portion defined by longitudinal ends <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. This type of cover <b>10</b> can typically be installed and secured with zero or very little extra fastening. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a cover <b>10</b> is illustrated that is split longitudinally such that first and second longitudinal ends <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> define respective flanges <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> that provide surfaces through which fasteners <b>20</b> may be used to secure flanges <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> together. Another type of cover (not shown), may be a regular tube of material sliced longitudinally and radially down the side such that first and second longitudinal ends <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> contact one another. Other cover types may be used with the applicators and methods disclosed herein, including heavy and light duty cover. Also, this document should not be limited to conductor cover brands or materials of construction presently on the market. With some types of cover, tape and/or tie wraps may be required as a fastener to secure the cover in place after application.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an applicator <b>50</b> for applying a tubular conductor cover <b>10</b>, such as a resilient tubular conductor cover, to a cable <b>26</b> is illustrated. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, applicator <b>50</b> comprises a head <b>52</b>. The applicator <b>50</b> may also comprise a handle <b>54</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, head <b>52</b> has a separator, which may comprise two or more separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. Elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be surfaces, of the separator, that may be oriented away from one another. Head <b>52</b> may be made out of various materials, for example steel, aluminum, or carbon fiber. Head <b>52</b> may be partly or completely constructed of dielectric materials.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The separator <b>130</b> is shaped to contact an interior surface <b>22</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> to spread open or maintain the first longitudinal edge <b>12</b> and the second longitudinal edge <b>14</b> along a portion <b>24</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> to allow the portion <b>24</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> to be applied to a cable <b>26</b>, when the applicator <b>50</b> is in operation. In some embodiments such as the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, separating elements <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> may be spaced to contact interior surface <b>22</b>. In the embodiment illustrated, the separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> are defined by a pair of inwardly wrapped arms connected to head <b>52</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an exemplary portion <b>24</b> is illustrated as head <b>52</b> of applicator <b>50</b> passes along a length of cover <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a cable passage <b>28</b> may also be at least partially defined by the separator, for example between the separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the separating elements <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> may be integrally connected, for example as shown where separating elements <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are formed from a U-shaped separator <b>59</b> that also defines cable passage <b>28</b>. Each separating element may include more than one piece.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments the head further comprises a roller element having a roller surface for contacting and guiding the conductor cover <b>10</b> through the head <b>52</b> in operation. An example of such a roller element is roller element <b>60</b>, which has a roller surface <b>66</b> positioned for contacting an exterior surface <b>32</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> to hold the portion <b>24</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> open against the separator, for example against the separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. The roller element may guide the conductor cover <b>10</b> through the head <b>52</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as head <b>52</b> is moved along the length of cover <b>10</b> in a direction <b>34</b>, roller surface <b>66</b> rolls and guides cover <b>10</b>, facilitating the passage of cover <b>10</b> through head <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, handle <b>54</b> may be present for positioning the head <b>52</b>. The handle <b>54</b> may be connected to, or integral with the head <b>52</b>. In some embodiments, head <b>52</b> is pivotally connected to the handle <b>54</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, head <b>52</b> may be suspended from the handle <b>54</b>, for example by a U or L-bracket <b>87</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments more than one roller element may be provided to perform the same or a similar function, such as rollers <b>66</b> and rollers <b>62</b>, <b>64</b>. Thus, roller elements may be mounted on opposite sides of cover <b>10</b> for example in opposing orientation to reduce the force required to pass cover <b>10</b> through head <b>52</b>. It should be understood that the roller elements are not limited to standard rollers, and some or all rollers may be driven by gear, track, hydraulic, or chain and sprocket drives, for some examples, or by other drive systems. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 12</figref>, in some embodiments the roller surface comprises conductor cover gripping element. For example, the roller surface may grip the conductor cover <b>10</b> using ridging <b>59</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), tread, texturing <b>61</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), ribbing <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>), or contouring. The presence of a cover gripping element creates traction and minimizes slippage between the conductor cover and the applicator head as the conductor cover is driven through the applicator head.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments, the roller surface, for example surfaces <b>67</b> and <b>69</b> of roller elements <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>, may be positioned for contacting the interior surface <b>22</b> of the portion <b>24</b> of cover <b>10</b>. A similar effect may be achieved using a single roller element across cable passage <b>28</b> instead of roller elements <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. In some embodiments, roller elements <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> are contained as part of separating elements <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, respectively. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, roller elements <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> may have their respective axes <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> parallel with an axis <b>72</b> of roller element <b>60</b> in order to further facilitate the passage of cover <b>10</b> through head <b>52</b>, although this is not required. The one or more roller elements may be biased towards the conductor cover <b>10</b>, for example if the applicator <b>50</b> comprises a biasing mechanism such as springs for biasing the roller element toward the cover <b>10</b> in use. For further example, at least one of roller elements <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> may be biased towards the roller element <b>60</b> of the head <b>52</b>. Biasing may be accomplished using an adjustable spring element or a resilient arm, for example. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an embodiment is illustrated where roller element <b>60</b> is biased towards the conductor cover <b>10</b>. This may be accomplished by mounting an axle <b>57</b> of roller element <b>60</b> on a bracket <b>73</b> biased towards the separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> by one or more spring elements <b>75</b>. A screw <b>77</b> may be used to limit the distance of the roller <b>60</b> from the cover <b>10</b>. Screw <b>77</b> allows the roller tension to be adjusted for a specific type of conductor cover. In general, various tool settings, such as roller tension and spacing of spacer elements to name a few, may need to be adjusted in the field for each type of conductor cover used. Once cover <b>10</b> is in head <b>52</b>, screw <b>77</b> may be tightened to apply additional pressure against bracket <b>73</b> to tightly secure cover <b>10</b> within head <b>52</b>. Other means may be used to temporarily hold the end of the conductor cover in place while the applicator is being positioned. In other embodiments, one or more of roller elements <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> may be replaced by a respective biasing element (not shown). The biasing element may be for example a resilient arm oriented to bias cover <b>10</b> towards, or into contact with, roller element <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, applicator <b>50</b> may further comprise an actuator lever <b>162</b> for advancing and retracting the roller element <b>60</b> towards and away from, respectively, the cover <b>10</b> (not shown) in use. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</figref>, lever <b>162</b> is a cam-operated lever that retracts and extends a secondary lever <b>164</b> into and out of the head <b>52</b> as shown. Lever <b>164</b> connects to a roller axle frame <b>166</b> that is normally biased towards cover <b>10</b> in use with springs <b>168</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, two positions of roller element <b>60</b> are illustrated, with the advanced position shown in dotted lines, and the retracted position shown in solid lines. Rotation of actuator lever <b>162</b> downwards operates a cam connection to secondary lever <b>164</b> to allow secondary lever <b>164</b> to be pushed downwards by springs <b>168</b>. Thus, roller element <b>60</b> is advanced into engagement with cover <b>10</b> (not shown) in use.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> the roller surface, such as surface <b>66</b>, may be flat or contoured for example by beveling or shaping surface <b>66</b>. For further example, the roller surface may be at least partially concave or convex. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, an example of roller surface <b>66</b> is illustrated as concave. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the roller surfaces <b>67</b> and <b>69</b> of one or more of rollers <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>, respectively, are illustrated as convex. Contouring the roller surface may allow the roller surface, for example surfaces <b>67</b> and <b>69</b>, to be more closely contoured to fit, in this case the inner surface <b>22</b> of, cover <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the roller surface <b>66</b> of roller <b>60</b> may be at least partially concave. This modifications may allow the roller surface <b>66</b> to be more closely contoured to fit and shape to the exterior surface <b>32</b> of cover <b>10</b> as cover <b>10</b> passes through channel <b>82</b> of applicator head <b>52</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, an embodiment is shown with roller elements <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> having roller surfaces <b>115</b> and <b>117</b> that are concave and convex, respectively. It should be understood that embodiments exist where one of roller elements <b>111</b> and <b>113</b> is not present. This embodiment illustrates that a single roller <b>111</b> may be used to contact the interior surface <b>22</b> instead of dual rollers <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>. Roller elements are understood to include one or more of a belt, pulley, chain and sprocket, gear element, and gear reducing element as examples.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the applicator <b>50</b> may comprise a drive system for one or more of driving and pulling the conductor cover <b>10</b> through the head <b>52</b>. One or more roller elements may be connected for rotation to the drive system. The drive system may comprise a power source (not shown) such as a motor contained within, near, or at some distance from the head <b>52</b>. The drive system, which may be at least one drive system, may comprise a drive shaft made at least partially out of dielectric material. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary drive shaft <b>74</b> for powering roller element <b>60</b> is illustrated. In some embodiments, drive shaft <b>74</b> is connected to rotate the roller element via a bevel gear connection <b>78</b>. A bevel gear assembly may be advantageous in situations where head <b>52</b> is pivotally connected to the handle <b>54</b>. Other gear arrangements are possible. In some embodiments, the gear connection may involve gear reduction. The drive system may comprise a hydraulic drive system that acts directly on the applicator head, in some cases eliminating the need for a drive shaft. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of applicator <b>50</b> where drive shaft <b>74</b> is contained at least partly outside of and along the handle <b>54</b>, for example parallel to handle <b>54</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the drive shaft may be held close to handle <b>54</b> along its length by a series of alignment brackets <b>76</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an embodiment is illustrated where drive shaft <b>74</b> is contained at least partly within the handle <b>54</b> of applicator <b>50</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in some embodiments as discussed above, the drive system may incorporate a power source, for example if drive shaft <b>74</b> is connected to a power source located at a user end <b>80</b> of handle <b>54</b>. A suitable power source may comprise one or more of a battery, a hydraulic power supply, a power drill <b>71</b>, and a human being <b>38</b>. Drive shaft <b>74</b> may be connected to be rotated using a rotatable handle, or through an attachment <b>73</b> for a powered drill <b>71</b> as shown. In some embodiments, the operation of the drive source may be controlled at head <b>52</b>. In some embodiments, the power source, for example, a hydraulic motor, may be located at or near the applicator head, eliminating in some cases the need for a drive shaft and accompanying drive transmission mechanism. It should be understood that any suitable mechanism for transferring the rotational torque from a power source (not shown) to any of the one or more roller elements may be used. The drive system may incorporate for example one or more of the roller element, a ratchet handle, and a pump. In use, the drive system may be located one or more of ahead of, as part of, and behind, the head <b>52</b>. The drive system may comprise a drive unit that attaches to the conductor cover apart from the head, in order to pull or push the conductor cover through the head. In this way, the drive system may be separate and distinct from the head, and may directly grip, for example by one or more of surrounding and enclosing, the conductor cover at some point distant from the applicator head to drive the conductor cover. An example of this (not shown) may be a roller system connected to the head <b>52</b>, for example by a chain, the roller system in use gripping the conductor cover and progressing up the length of the conductor cover to draw the cover through the head <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the head <b>52</b> and separator <b>130</b>, for example separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, may define a channel <b>82</b>, for example a U-channel, contoured to fit the portion <b>24</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b>. Channel <b>82</b> allows a lateral cross-section of the portion of the conductor cover to be held open by applicator <b>50</b>, so that a suitable length of conductor cover may be fed through the head <b>52</b>. Channel <b>82</b> may be a flat slot in some cases, like a mail slot in a door for example. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, channel <b>82</b> may be other suitable shapes, such as a W-channel. Channel <b>82</b> may be shaped to correspond with the shape of the portion <b>24</b> of cover <b>10</b> as portion <b>24</b> opens into engagement with head <b>52</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, some part of the channel <b>82</b>, for example an end <b>84</b>, may comprise a spacer element <b>86</b>. One or more spacer elements may be used to adjust the size and shape of the channel <b>82</b> to correspond with the particular cover size being used. For example, one or more of the length and width of the channel <b>82</b> may be adjusted using spacers. For example, spacer element <b>86</b> is used for fitting up adjacent the first longitudinal edge <b>12</b> when in use, to modify the length of the channel <b>82</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also shows an embodiment where a second end <b>88</b> of the channel <b>82</b> comprises a spacer element <b>90</b> for fitting up adjacent the second longitudinal edge <b>14</b>, or for otherwise modifying the length of the channel <b>82</b> when in use. Spacer elements allow the length of channel <b>82</b> to be tailored to fit different sizes of covers <b>10</b>. Spacer elements also may be used to prevent off-centre lateral migration of cover <b>10</b> within the head <b>52</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a head <b>52</b> with adjustable spacer elements <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>. Depending on the size of the conductor cover and how the conductor cover was inserted into the channel <b>82</b>, the spacer elements may be adjusted for a more secure fit of cover <b>10</b> in channel <b>82</b>. Spacer element <b>86</b> is illustrated here as positioned further down the channel <b>82</b> on the left than spacer element <b>90</b> is positioned on the right, although this is not required and may be reversed. Spacers used may be inserts that can be snapped into place, or they may be adjustable, for example adjustable pieces or spring-loaded elements. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, spacer elements <b>86</b> and <b>90</b> may be adjustable pieces fitted on a track within channel <b>82</b> for example. Once in position, the spacer elements may be locked in place. The use of spacer elements allows the head <b>52</b> to fit a variety of sizes of conductor covers <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The channel <b>82</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be contoured to fit the type of cover <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, whereas the channel <b>82</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be contoured to fit the type of cover <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In other embodiments, channel <b>82</b> may be contoured to fit plural types of covers <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in some embodiments with handle <b>54</b>, the handle <b>54</b> comprises a hot stick made at least partially of a dielectric material, for example if handle <b>54</b> comprises a dielectric shaft. For energized application the handle may comprise a rated dielectric material that has passed an industry standard test. In some embodiments, the entire handle <b>54</b> is a dielectric shaft. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> a hot stick may be used for applying conductor cover <b>10</b> to energized cable <b>26</b> from outside of the limits of approach <b>36</b>. A hotstick allows a user <b>38</b> to apply cover <b>10</b> from a position outside the safe limits of approach <b>36</b>. Standard limits of approach are generally set by the IEEE for live electrical systems. It should be understood that the limits of approach may vary according to region. The limits of approach <b>36</b> around energized equipment generally widens as the voltage increases. In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the limits of approach <b>36</b> correspond to increasing voltages, and thus increasing radii, from limits of approach <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<b>36</b><i>c</i>. The hotstick may be provided in a length or lengths that are suitable for the various limits of approach standards in all jurisdictions.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the separator <b>130</b>, for example two or more of the separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, may converge inwardly to define a wedge element <b>92</b> for spreading the first longitudinal edge <b>12</b> and the second longitudinal edge <b>14</b> apart during axial movement of the conductor cover <b>10</b> through the head <b>52</b>. Wedge element <b>92</b> may guide first longitudinal edge <b>12</b> and second longitudinal edge <b>14</b> into the open position as shown. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 11C</figref>, wedge element <b>92</b> may have a groove <b>94</b> for defining cable passage <b>28</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, an embodiment of a wedge element <b>92</b> comprising a wire rack <b>93</b> is illustrated connected to head <b>52</b>. The wire rack <b>93</b> may comprise one or more guide arms <b>95</b>A, <b>95</b>B, and <b>95</b>C arranged to guide the conductor cover (not shown) into the head <b>52</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref> and B, the orientation of wire rack <b>93</b> on head <b>52</b> may be reversible. An example of this is illustrated by installing installation ends <b>99</b> of wire rack <b>93</b> on alternate sides of head <b>52</b> through holes <b>101</b> that pass through head <b>52</b>. The wedge element <b>92</b> may define one or more of the separating elements. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, another embodiment of a wedge element <b>92</b> is illustrated. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24A-B</figref>, cover <b>10</b> is illustrated as being spread open and loaded into applicator <b>50</b> for application to a cable <b>26</b> (not shown). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, wedge element <b>92</b> may be angled upwards as shown. Thus, cover <b>10</b> may be bent at the point of roller contact in order to increase the surface area of cover <b>10</b> that is contacted by the roller. Angling of the cover <b>10</b> with respect to the cable <b>26</b> is discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a method of installing tubular conductor cover over a cable is illustrated. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in stage <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) the first longitudinal edge <b>12</b> and the second longitudinal edge <b>14</b> of portion <b>24</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> are spread open with a separator, for example a pair of separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> of the separator. The separator, for example separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, may contact interior surface <b>22</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b>. As shown, roller surface <b>66</b> of the roller element <b>60</b> may contact outer surface <b>32</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> to hold the portion <b>24</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> against the separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> and/or to assist in driving the conductor cover through the applicator head. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, head <b>52</b> may be positioned over a cable <b>26</b>, for example using handle <b>54</b>, which further may be connected to head <b>52</b>, to ensure that the cable <b>26</b> is located sufficiently adjacent to the interior surface <b>22</b> of the portion <b>24</b> of cover <b>10</b>. In this fashion, cable <b>26</b> is indirectly positioned or inserted for example through cable passage <b>28</b>. This positioning is illustrated using arrow <b>40</b> to indicate the relative path of movement for cable <b>26</b> into cable passage <b>28</b>. It should be understood that the head may be positioned by relative movement between the cable <b>26</b> and applicator <b>50</b>, for example movement of the applicator <b>50</b> over a stationary cable <b>26</b>. In some cases the cable <b>26</b> may be moved. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in stage <b>102</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) a length of conductor cover <b>10</b> is applied to the cable <b>26</b> through the head <b>52</b>, for example by guiding the head <b>52</b> along the cable <b>26</b> using the handle <b>54</b>. Through the head may mean across the head in some cases. This movement is illustrated by arrow <b>34</b>. The cover <b>10</b> may be clamped against the separator prior to application, for example clamped between opposing roller elements as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Applying may further comprise rolling the conductor cover <b>10</b> through the head <b>52</b> using the one or more roller elements, for example roller elements of the head <b>52</b> in contact with the conductor cover <b>10</b>. Applying may comprise one or more of driving and pulling the conductor cover <b>10</b> through the head <b>52</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the length of conductor cover <b>10</b> desired may be supplied from a conductor cover supply <b>42</b>. The conductor cover <b>10</b> may be cut to the desired length before, after, or during the application of the length of conductor cover <b>10</b>. Cover <b>10</b> may be cut to length using utility snips <b>44</b> for example. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the conductor cover <b>10</b> may be secured to the cable <b>26</b> using fasteners <b>20</b>, for example after a length of cover <b>10</b> is applied. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in some embodiments with the head <b>52</b> being connected to a handle <b>54</b> that comprises a hot stick made at least partially of a dielectric material, the conductor cover <b>10</b> may be applied to an energized cable <b>26</b> by a user <b>38</b> outside the limits of approach <b>36</b>. The handle may be guided in an axial direction relative to the cover <b>10</b>. Applying may comprise guiding head <b>52</b> along the cable as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, separating elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may simply be surfaces on head <b>52</b>, for example opposed surfaces. In some embodiments plural heads <b>52</b> in series may be used to apply the cover <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 1</figref>, the separator may contact the interior surface of the cover <b>10</b> in a contiguous or non-contiguous fashion, respectively, as shown. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a surface <b>119</b> of the separator <b>121</b> may be contiguous between the separating elements <b>56</b>, and <b>58</b>, so that the separating elements <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> are merely defined at different locations along the surface <b>119</b> according to the shape of the separator <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an embodiment of applicator <b>50</b> is illustrated that doesn't define a cable passage between separating elements. A roller element (not shown) may contact interior surface <b>22</b> of cover <b>10</b> to facilitate the passage of head <b>52</b> through cover <b>10</b>. A cable <b>26</b> is illustrated as being inserted into cover <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an embodiment of applicator <b>50</b> is illustrated that doesn't wrap around the exterior surface <b>32</b> of cover <b>10</b>. In this and other embodiments, the edges <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> of cover <b>10</b> may hook onto the separator <b>130</b>, which acts as a separating element, to prevent the cover <b>10</b> from popping off of the head <b>52</b>. This may be achieved for example by providing one or more indents <b>55</b> in head <b>52</b>, or by sizing the separator small enough to allow one or more of edges <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> to hook over one or more ends <b>57</b> of the separator. A drive system may be employed to drive the cable <b>26</b> into the cover <b>10</b>. A suitable drive system may employ one or more roller elements <b>51</b> and <b>53</b>. Ghost lines are used to indicate the optional positions of roller elements <b>51</b> and <b>53</b>. The drive system may be adapted to remotely connect to the cable <b>26</b> by suitable means. For example, drive roller <b>53</b> may snap into place over cable <b>26</b> when cable <b>26</b> is in position in head <b>52</b>. Other drive systems may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments of the applicator <b>50</b> disclosed herein, application may be improved by securing or holding one end of cover <b>10</b> to the cable <b>26</b> before the head <b>52</b> is used to apply the cover <b>10</b>. Securing or holding may be achieved using a hotstick for example, or by other methods.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Embodiments of the apparatuses and methods disclosed herein may provide the advantages of the hotstick work method disclosed in the background information section, albeit in an improved manner. In some embodiments, the applicator <b>50</b> may be a handheld device. Such a device may not require a hotstick handle. In further embodiments, such an applicator <b>50</b> may have for example a hand-grip (not shown) on the head. In other embodiments, a handle may be used. It should be understood that the methods disclosed herein may be used with any of the embodiments of applicators disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-18</figref> illustrate another embodiment of an applicator <b>50</b>, with no roller elements. In this embodiment, the separator includes wedge element <b>92</b> configured to separate the longitudinal ends of the cover <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> only). Also, a backing <b>150</b>, such as a bearing surface as shown, may be configured to maintain the cover against the separator.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> includes an axis <b>152</b> about which the head <b>52</b> may hinge. A hinge axis such as <b>152</b> may be positioned elsewhere on the applicator <b>50</b>. In order for hinging to occur, the head may be split into two of more parts <b>52</b>A and <b>52</b>B, although this is not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. The parts may be joined by a hinge or other joining mechanism. Axis <b>152</b> through the head <b>52</b> is drawn as an example of a location for a hinge (not shown) between parts <b>52</b>A and <b>52</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-25D</figref>, an applicator <b>50</b> is illustrated with a gate <b>170</b>. Gate <b>170</b>, which may be hinged, has an at least partially closed position, such as the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25B</figref>, C, D, and is shaped to guide, when in the at least partially closed position, the first longitudinal edge <b>12</b> at least partially across the cable passage <b>28</b> and under the second longitudinal edge <b>14</b> as the cover <b>10</b> exits the applicator <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>). The gate <b>170</b> may be movable across a range of positions from open to closed, within which range the at least partially closed position may be located. The gate <b>170</b> may be comprised at least in part of flexible material, for example if the gate <b>170</b> has a living hinge (not shown) or if the gate <b>170</b> is a flexible flap (not shown). In other embodiments the gate <b>170</b> may guide edge <b>12</b> over edge <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref>, gate <b>170</b> may hold the more tightly curled edge of the two edges <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>, for example edge <b>12</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> shown, open longer so edge <b>12</b> will not undesirably curl up against itself as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref>. Thus, gate <b>10</b> may form part of a larger exit separator <b>191</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>) shaped to converge about cable <b>26</b> much like wedge element <b>92</b> in order to ensure proper closure of cover <b>10</b> about cable <b>26</b>. In general, the separator <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>) may converge inwardly at a cover exit end <b>176</b> of the head <b>52</b> for closing the first longitudinal edge <b>12</b> and the second longitudinal edge <b>14</b> together about the cable <b>26</b> during axial movement of the conductor cover <b>10</b> through the head <b>52</b>. The portion of separator <b>130</b> that converges inwardly at cover exit end <b>176</b> may be considered to be an exit separator <b>191</b> that is distinct from the rest of separator <b>130</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the separator <b>130</b> may be comprised of multiple parts, for example exit separator <b>191</b> and an inlet separator such as wedge element <b>92</b>. The gate <b>170</b> may at least partially close the cable passage <b>28</b> (see transition from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-25B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref>). Gate <b>170</b> may not close passage <b>28</b> entirely, for example in order to allow cable <b>26</b> to be removed if necessary during closure. At least when open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>), gate <b>170</b> allows sufficient clearance for cable <b>26</b> to fit within passage <b>28</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-B</figref>, the gate <b>170</b> may be biased to close in the presence of cover <b>10</b>, for example when cover <b>10</b> passes through head <b>52</b> upon exiting the separator, as shown. Gate <b>170</b> is illustrated as being hinged along axis <b>172</b>, so that as cover exits head <b>52</b>, the cover <b>10</b> contacts the gate <b>170</b> and pushes gate <b>170</b> closed or partially closed over passage <b>28</b>. Gate <b>170</b> may also be biased closed by indirect contact, such as through intermediate components (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A</figref> and D and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, gate <b>170</b> may comprise one or more cover edge guide ridges <b>174</b>. Ridges <b>174</b> may be provided for restricting the first longitudinal edge <b>12</b> from curling back on itself. Ridges <b>174</b> stand out from the exterior surface of the gate <b>170</b> and are adapted to direct the movement of longitudinal edges of the cover <b>10</b> radially under or over one another as the cover begins to close over the cable <b>26</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref>, which illustrates in dotted lines portions of ridges <b>174</b> that are covered in the figure by cover <b>10</b>, one or more of the cover edge guide ridges <b>174</b> may be angled across the cable passage <b>28</b> with increasing distance across the cable passage <b>28</b> towards an exit end <b>173</b> of the gate <b>170</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25D</figref>, ridges <b>174</b> may be defined by a sloped entry surface <b>181</b> in order to guide edge <b>12</b> up and over ridge <b>174</b> and to prevent edge <b>12</b> from contacting ridge <b>174</b> and curling back in on itself.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown, gate <b>170</b> guides the first longitudinal edge <b>12</b> toward the second longitudinal edge <b>14</b> as the cover <b>10</b> exits the applicator <b>50</b> in use. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26B</figref>, guiding at least one of edges <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> in this fashion promotes proper closing of cover <b>10</b> as shown. Thus, avoided is the situation of improper closing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref> where edge <b>12</b> curls inwards back on itself to leave a portion of cable <b>26</b> exposed. If the situation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A</figref> occurs, a universal tie stick or other type of hook (not shown) may be run longitudinally through the conductor cover <b>10</b> after application to unhook the curled edge <b>12</b> and ensure proper closure.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A-D</figref> illustrate an applicator <b>50</b> with a single gate <b>170</b> for one of edges <b>12</b> or <b>14</b>, one or more gates <b>170</b> may be provided. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> for example, a second trailing gate <b>170</b>B may be hingedly connected to the applicator <b>50</b> (not shown) for guiding edge <b>14</b> over edge <b>12</b>. The first gate <b>170</b>A and the second gate <b>170</b>B may overlap when in the respective at least partially closed positions as shown. One or more of gates <b>170</b>A and B may be adjustable in position, for example to reverse the overlap so that edge <b>12</b> curls over edge <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-33</figref>, a further applicator <b>50</b> is illustrated with a cover exit guide <b>177</b>.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, guide <b>177</b> may comprise a roller element <b>179</b> such as a roller as shown, and may contact cover <b>10</b> at an intermediate portion <b>183</b> between edges <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. Roller element <b>179</b> may be held in place by a rearwardly extending frame <b>189</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 33</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, separator <b>130</b> and guide <b>177</b> may be arranged relative to each other to ensure that cover <b>10</b> is applied to cable <b>26</b> at a desired application angle <b>175</b> with respect to cable <b>26</b>. For example, wedge element <b>92</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>) may be directed to accept entry of cover <b>10</b> at an angle, such as an acute angle, relative to cover exiting the applicator <b>50</b> at end <b>176</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, guide <b>177</b> may also laterally align edges <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> of cover <b>10</b> within the applicator <b>50</b>, for example by partially flattening the cover <b>10</b> on exit. Angling the entry and exit of cover <b>10</b> is advantageous because it has been found to be more efficient to apply conductor cover <b>10</b> at an angle relative to the cable. In addition, angling reduces the effective longitudinal length of the applicator <b>50</b> that is required to be positioned over the cable <b>26</b> and also allows the applicator <b>50</b> to be further tilted relative to cable <b>26</b> to avoid an obstructing component (not shown) for example at the termination of cable <b>26</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34 and 35</figref>, cover exit guide <b>177</b> may comprise more than one guide, such as roller elements <b>179</b>A and <b>179</b>B. Roller element <b>179</b>B may have its axis angled, for example perpendicular, relative to the axis of roller element <b>179</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, applicator <b>50</b> may be provided in combination with a hot stick tool <b>178</b> for maintaining control over a free portion, such as free end <b>180</b>, of the conductor cover <b>10</b> positioned upstream of the applicator <b>50</b> in use. Tool <b>178</b> may also be used to guide free end <b>180</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> into the applicator <b>50</b> in use. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> a method of use of hot stick tool <b>178</b> with applicator <b>50</b> is disclosed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a stage <b>104</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>), a free end <b>180</b> or portion of the conductor cover <b>10</b> is guided with hot stick tool <b>178</b>. Tool <b>178</b> may be a hot stick tool suited to grip conductor cover <b>10</b>. In a stage <b>106</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>), an end <b>182</b> of the conductor cover <b>10</b> is applied to the cable <b>26</b> with a conductor cover applicator <b>10</b>. Thus, hot stick tool <b>178</b> may be used to guide cover <b>10</b> into applicator <b>50</b> during use. Because of the rigidity of some types of cover <b>10</b>, this method may be advantageous in allowing cover <b>10</b> to pass through head <b>52</b> with less drag and without binding or catching.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, channel <b>82</b> may be shaped to impart reverse curl on one or more of edges <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> at cover exit end <b>176</b> of head <b>52</b>. For example, an inside surface <b>193</b> of terminal end <b>185</b> of channel <b>82</b> may curve outward and terminal end <b>185</b> may be adapted to become shorter in length relative to terminal end <b>189</b> nearer to exit end <b>176</b> of applicator <b>50</b>, thus forcing edge <b>12</b> to reverse curl as shown. In another embodiment (not shown), the channel itself may have a reverse curl profile at one or more of terminal ends <b>189</b> and <b>185</b> to impart the reverse curl. Reverse curl is understood as curling in a direction opposite to the natural direction of curl of cover <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, reverse curl is observed at portion <b>187</b> of cover <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, thus, the chances that edge <b>14</b> will curl inward on itself upon exit from applicator <b>50</b> are reduced. In addition, reverse curling of edge <b>14</b> may aid in positioning edge <b>14</b> overtop of edge <b>12</b> upon closing of the cover <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>).</p>
