<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A kit is provided to convert a compound archery bow into a left or right handed inline (vertical limb) crossbow. The conversion kit includes a mounting plate attachable to a side of the bow riser section to hold a socket to receive a draw-lock bar which can be removed for take-down and storage. The draw-lock bar has a series of laterally spaced bolt holes to attach a grip with a trigger release latch assembly at a selectable draw length. The bar can be rotated and attached to either side of the bow, and the trigger and grip can be reposition within the trigger housing for left, right or horizontal shooting. The string latch assembly has an anti-dryfire lever that is only moved from the blocking position when an arrow is nocked. The kit also provides a hinged cocking stirrup, and a front hand vertical grip on the riser side opposite the draw-bar socket. Also disclosed is a dedicated hybrid compound bow for dedicated use with kit as an inline or traditional crossbow. The hybrid compound bow is made especially. The hybrid bow has no forehand grip, and has a shoot through riser to provide vertical and horizontal centering of the arrow to the string.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the general classification of archery bows, and more particularly to cross bows and vertical bows operated with draw-locking and release features.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bow hunters strive for high speed/flat trajectory and deep penetration energy when using either compound bows or crossbows, but each type of bow produces its arrow's flight energy in a different manner. A compound bow typically has a lower maximum draw weight (e.g., 50-80 lbs, with a 50% or greater drop-off at full draw), but a longer power stroke (e.g. 18-24 inches) than the crossbow&#x2014;which by comparison typically has a high draw weight (150-225 lbs) but a short power stroke (10-14 inches). These differences produce commensurate differences in arrow/bolt speed and penetration. For example, a 70 lb pull compound bow will typically launch an arrow at a higher velocity than a 150 lb crossbow does with its shorter and lighter bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Power stroke is the distance the bow string travels from full draw to the rest position. For example, a compound bow with a 30 inch draw length and a 7 inch brace height (distance from grip to the string at rest) has a 23 inch power stroke (30&#x2212;7+23). A person using a 30 inch draw will shoot the same weight arrow faster than one using the same draw weight and arrow with a 28 inch power stroke. The same relationship exists with the crossbow&#x2014;longer power stroke causes higher velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The power stroke and draw weight variations have other effects beyond speed and energy. The most noticeable effect of the draw weight is the effort and techniques used to draw the bow. The heavy draw weight of the cross bow usually requires two-handed cocking using leg and back muscles to draw the string against a foot stirrup or bar. Some archers may not have enough strength for even that two-handed maneuver, and must rely upon a mechanical crank. This effectively limits a crossbow hunter to a single shot at game, since it is cumbersome to re-cock the cross bow and nock a bolt in a tree stand or cramped blind. On the other hand, a hunter can hold the loaded crossbow on an approaching target for an extended time while waiting for the range and cover to present an opportunity for a lethal shot, since there is no draw weight acting against the archer's muscles. De-cocking the crossbow is another difficult task, and many find it more convenient to simply fire the bolt into soft ground to de-cock.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The compound bow is the more accurate weapon in the hands of an experienced archer because of its consistent anchoring point when using string loop and mechanical release, which defines the nock point more consistently than does the crossbow latch, but the crossbow allows much faster mastery by beginners, as its aiming and trigger systems closely resemble a shoulder mounted firearm. The crossbow is also heavier than a compound bow, and less maneuverable in brush or tree branches.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Considering that the main advantage of the crossbow is its ability to draw and lock it at full draw until ready to shoot, it is not surprising that innovators have devised mechanisms to lock a compound bow at full draw. A representative example of these draw-locking mechanisms is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,671,723 by the present inventor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Even after the advent of draw-locking devices, there is still a place for a kit to convert a compound bow into a configuration that can be aimed and fired like a cross-bow, and then disassembled to allow the bow to be used in a traditional fashion. This invention provides components of a kit for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, the invention also provides a hybrid compound bow for use with the kit as a dedicated crossbow. Consequently, there are two different aspects of this invention: (1) a kit for converting a compound bow into a left or right handed inline crossbow, and (2) a dedicated hybrid compound bow to use with the kit that eliminates or modifies some features of the traditional compound bow, and which can be mounted to the conversion kit as an inline crossbow or a traditional horizontal limb crossbow.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The conversion kit of the invention provides a draw-lock bar that simulates a forearm stock, having a pistol grip and trigger-actuated string release at the butt end. The trigger has a regular cross bar safety. An additional anti-dryfire lever stops the string latch from releasing the string loop when there is no arrow nocked, even if the safety is off and the trigger is accidently pulled.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The draw-lock bar mounts into a receiver socket that is attached at an adjustable angle to a mounting plate at the compound bow's arrow rest screw taps. The bar can be quickly detached from the receiver socket to break down the bow/kit into two parts for compact storage The bar can also be hinged in the middle to fold in half for storage. The bar is a hollow tube with square cross section, and has a series of holes spaced along its length to adjust the draw length. A compound bow can be mounted to the draw-lock bar in either right hand or left hand inline (vertical limbs) configuration, and the hybrid compound bow can be mounted as an inline or traditional crossbow (horizontal limbs) configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The kit also provides a cocking stirrup attached to the draw-lock mounting plate in front of the draw lock socket. The stirrup has a pivoting hinge connection to the mounting plate so that the stirrup can be folded back 180 degrees to lie along the outside edge of the bar. When using the hybrid crossbow (horizontal limb) configuration the stirrup can also be stopped at a 90 degree position under the bar and used as a bipod rest, or stopped at 45 degrees under the bar as a kickstand supporting the bow with the arrowhead angled upward. The kit also includes a vertical hand grip attached to the bow riser on the opposite side from the bar socket.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The hybrid compound bow of the invention is made specifically for use with the conversion kit. It has forward curving riser sections that locate the limb pockets well in front of the riser center point. The limbs extend backward from the pockets in an essentially parallel or slightly closing orientation, such that the axle to axle distance between the eccentric pulley wheels is very short, on the order of 18-19 inches. This provides a very compact compound bow with a power stroke that can be over 20 inches, depending of the draw bar length selected. With the aid of the cocking stirrup, even a 75-80 lb draw weight is easily handled by almost any adult. The hybrid bow does not itself have a handgrip, and thus is not a stand alone bow. The forward handle is provided by the vertical grip of the conversion kit. The lack of an integral handle, however, allows the bow to use a shoot-through riser with a contained arrow rest (such as a whisker biscuit) that locates the arrow exactly on vertical and horizontal center from the nocking point through the center cut-out in the biscuit. This exact centering improves accuracy by reducing arrow torque and string vibration, and is the most efficient location (the center) of the string for top speed and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention will be described below with reference to the conversion kit in combination with the hybrid bow. It should be apparent from this description how it can be used to convert a traditional compound bow in a similar manner, although some explanation of the differences will be provided at times where appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings, description and claims.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref> show the combination <b>10</b> of a hybrid bow and conversion kit <b>11</b> to make it useable as an inline crossbow or a traditional crossbow, depending upon the limb orientation. The hybrid bow is specifically adapted for use with this conversion kit. It has most of the features of a traditional compound bow, such as limbs <b>12</b> extending from adjustable angle limb pockets <b>14</b> to tips with eccentric cable pulleys <b>13</b>. The bow has forward curving riser sections (<b>15</b> is the combined upper and lower sections of the riser) that locate the limb pockets well in front of the risers' center point. The limbs extend back from the pockets in an essentially parallel or slightly closing orientation, such that the axle to axle distance between the eccentric pulley wheels is very short, on the order of 18-19 inches at rest. This provides a very compact compound bow, but with a power stroke that can still be over 20 inches, depending of the draw length selected with the conversion kit. The hybrid bow also has other normal compound bow elements, such as a bow string <b>18</b> (including a draw loop <b>28</b>) attached to cables <b>20</b>, a cable guard <b>22</b> and a cable slide <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0068">Because it is specifically designed for use with the conversion kit, the hybrid bow's riser <b>15</b> is a shoot-through riser <b>15</b> where the riser sections are split to allow the arrow to pass through the riser rather than along a side of it. This split riser configuration is well known and found on several traditional compound bows. The riser has a circular cut-out for a contained type of arrow rest that envelops and constrains the arrow centered on the rest even when the bow is canted, such as the Whisker Biscuit by Trophy Ridge Archery or the Catawba Still Shot rest. This cutout places the arrow slot in the rest at the horizontal centerline of the riser, and thus allows the alignment of the flocking point on the string with the center of the arrow rest to position the arrow in the plane of the horizontal centerline of the bow. This allows the string <b>18</b> to be approximately aligned with the vertical center line <b>15</b>-<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the horizontal center of the riser. Thus, the arrow has both vertical and horizontal centering on the bow, whether the limbs are positioned vertically or horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0069">Note that the hybrid bow does not have a forehand grip at the riser. This hybrid bow is dedicated to be used with the conversion kit, which supplies a vertical forehand grip <b>26</b> to be attached on the side opposite to the draw-lock bar assembly to accommodate right or left hand shooting.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0070">Both sides of the riser on the hybrid bow have a mounting plate <b>44</b> for mounting elements of the conversion kit to the bow. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the mounting plates can be made integral into the hybrid bow, or can be separate plates supplied in the kit to be used with a traditional compound bow. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when configured for right hand shooting, a square-profile hollow tube socket <b>48</b> is attached to the right side mounting plate <b>71</b> by bolts <b>50</b>. The socket <b>48</b> receives the distal end of the draw-lock bar <b>16</b>. The socket can be attached to the mounting plate at an adjustable angle by the bolts <b>50</b> passing through a fixed hole and an elongated slot, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0071">The mounting plates for a traditional compound bow are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The mounting plate to which the draw-lock socket is attached has a bolt hole and a bolt slot. The slot allows the socket to be adjusted to set the bar at a small angle set-off from the bow centerline so that it does not interfere with the cables and draw string. By making this offset angle with the socket, there is no need to bend the bar. The bar remains straight no matter whether it is mounted on the left or right side of the bow.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0072">The draw-lock bar <b>16</b> that is inserted into the socket <b>48</b> simulates a forearm stock, having a pistol grip and trigger-actuated string release at the butt end. The trigger assembly has a regular crossbar safety <b>54</b> behind the trigger <b>52</b>, and an anti-dryfire lever <b>62</b> that stops the string release latch <b>60</b> from moving enough to release the string loop if there is no arrow on the string, even if the trigger is accidently pulled. The draw bar can optionally be extended to terminate in a butt stock <b>68</b> for shoulder mounting (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), but since the bow does not produce a rearward recoil to be absorbed by the shoulder, there is no need for any shoulder contact.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0073">The draw lock bar <b>16</b> has a series of bolt holes <b>36</b> at least near the trigger grip end that are spaced at about one inch between centers. These holes are used to attach the grip and trigger assembly to the bar at a selected length to adjust the distance between the string latch and the bow string at rest (adjusting draw length). The string latch is part of the pistol grip and trigger assembly (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>), which comprises a pistol grip <b>32</b>, a trigger section <b>34</b>, a safety, a string latch <b>60</b>, and an anti-dryfire lever <b>62</b>. The grip and trigger assembly attach to the bar by bolts using the adjustable length draw length holes <b>36</b> to select the draw length.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0074">Note that the pistol grip and trigger assembly can be individually located on either side of the draw-lock bar for right or left hand shooting. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the assembly is always bolted to the inside (side facing the bow string) side of the bar, placing the string latch <b>60</b> and anti-dryfire lever in a line with the string and arrow rest. If the bow were configured to be shot left handed, the drawlock bar wound be attached to the mounting plate on the left side of the riser, and the pistol grip and trigger assembly again attached to the inside side of the bar. To place the trigger and grip in the proper downward extending orientation, bolts holding the grip and trigger can be removed, the grip and trigger rotated 180 degrees, and the bolts replaced to hold them in place. Note that the grip and trigger could also be placed in a horizontal position for either left or right handed shooting by only rotating the grip and trigger 90 degrees. Some archers may like this horizontal trigger position. The two trigger bolts can also attach a scope mounting bracket (not shown)</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0075">At the front end of the bow, the conversion kit provides a foot stirrup <b>30</b> that is attached to the mounting plate <b>71</b> on the side having the socket for the draw-lock bar. The stirrup mount is hinged, so that it can be extended in front of the riser for cocking the bow, folded back 180 degree along the bow to be stored out of the way, stopped at 45 degrees as kickstand for resting the bow on the ground or a platform in an inline configuration, or folded 90 degrees downward to act as a bipod shooting rest when using the horizontal limb configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0076">Using his foot in the stirrup, an archer can draw the string with two hands and hook the string release loop <b>28</b> over the release latch <b>60</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). The anti-dryfire lever <b>62</b> is a curved piece with a pawl bit formed on one end to engage with a catch on the string release <b>60</b>. The opposite end of the anti-dryfire lever extends above the draw-lock bar just in front of the release. When an arrow is nocked, the shaft displaces the anti-dryfire level such that the pawl bit can not engage the catch on the string release. When the trigger is actuated, it will allow the string loop to push down the latch. If no arrow is nocked, however, the pawl will engage the catch when the trigger is pulled and hold the release against the pressure of the string loop.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the trigger <b>60</b> is kept from rotating by a roller release <b>61</b> that is blocked from turning by a trigger pin <b>58</b>. The trigger pin is pushed forward by the trigger spring <b>56</b>. As the trigger is drawn back against the spring pressure, the pin travels behind the center point of the roller release, and allows the roller to tumble. The tumbling roller allows the string latch to pivot and release the string loop. This gives the sensation of a trigger with a short creep followed by a crisp break. Other types of triggers can be used, however. A conventional crossbar safety <b>54</b> is used to prevent accidental firing when an arrow is nocked. When an arrow (not shown) is knocked onto the string, the arrow shaft w displaces the anti dryfire lever from blocking the release latch.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0078">The hunter can mount the hybrid bow <b>10</b> by holding the forward vertical grip <b>26</b> and the pistol grip <b>32</b>. When a target is sighted, the hunter can follow its movement with the mounted bow until a good shot opportunity presents, then push the cross bar safety to the firing position, acquire a final sight picture and squeeze the trigger backward against the pressure of the trigger spring <b>56</b> until the roller release allows the string latch to rotate and release the string loop.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0079">The conversion kit can also be used to mount the hybrid compound bow to the draw lock bar with its limbs horizontal to the ground like a traditional cross bow. The bow is held in the horizontal orientation when the draw lock bar is inserted into the socket. The trigger and grip can be individually relocated on the trigger assembly for left, right or horizontal shooting by removing the bolts and moving the trigger and grip either 90 degrees or 180 degrees to the appropriate holes and slot. The two grip bolts can be used to attach a scope mounting bracket.</p>
