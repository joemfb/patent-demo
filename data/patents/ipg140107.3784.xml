<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention seeks to provide an integrated display and input device, improved user interfaces and user interface functionalities, particularly useful for displays, such as those employed with computers, televisions, personal communicators and other mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention an integrated display and input device including a pixel array operative to provide a visually sensible output, at least one sensor operative to sense at least a position of at least one object with respect to the pixel array when the at least one object has at least a predetermined degree of propinquity to the pixel array and circuitry receiving an output from the at least one sensor and providing a non-imagewise input representing the position of the at least one object relative to the pixel array to utilization circuitry. Preferably, the integrated display and input device also includes at least one IR illuminator for illuminating the at least one object when it has the at least a predetermined degree of propinquity to the pixel array. Additionally, the at least one illuminator also functions as at least one backlighting illuminator associated with the pixel array. Alternatively or additionally, the at least one illuminator is located in a plane coplanar with or parallel to the at least one sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the at least one illuminator is located generally in the same plane as at least one backlighting illuminator associated with the pixel array.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the at least one sensor senses light reflected from the at least one object. Additionally, the at least one sensor senses ambient light reflected from the at least one object. Alternatively or additionally, the at least one sensor senses IR light reflected from the at least one object.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the at least one object is at least one finger. Alternatively or additionally, the at least one object is at least one located device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the integrated display and input device also includes utilization circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the utilization circuitry provides chording functionality. Additionally or alternatively, the utilization circuitry provides functionality to distinguish at least between positions of the at least one object when touching and not touching the device. Alternatively or additionally, the utilization circuitry provides functionality to distinguish at least between directions of motion of the at least one object towards and away from the device as well as directions of motion laterally thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the utilization circuitry provides functionality to compute at least one characteristic of a trajectory of motion of the at least one object generally parallel to the pixel array. Additionally, the at least one characteristic includes at least one of location, direction, velocity and change in direction. Preferably, the utilization circuitry provides functionality for panning and scrolling. Alternatively or additionally, the utilization circuitry provides functionality for one-handed zooming.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the utilization circuitry provides functionality for employing a sensed distinction between instances when the at least one object touches and does not touch the device. Additionally or alternatively, the utilization circuitry provides functionality for mouse over and click. Preferably mouse over functionality is provided when a user's finger is not touching a screen or other object but within a predetermined range of propinquity. In such a case, mouse click functionality is provided when a user's finger touches the screen or other object. In a preferred case, within the predetermined range of propinquity, the extent of propinquity is not of significance, however alternatively, the extent of propinquity may be sensed and utilized in various functionalities, as described herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively or additionally, the utilization circuitry provides functionality for turning pages. Additionally or alternatively, the utilization circuitry provides functionality for gaining. Additionally or alternatively, the utilization circuitry provides functionality utilizing differences in sensed relative positions of a user's fingers. Alternatively or additionally, the utilization circuitry provides interactive television functionality. Additionally or alternatively, the utilization circuitry provides portable computer functionality. Preferably, the at least one sensor includes a plurality of detector elements arranged in a plane parallel to a viewing plane.
