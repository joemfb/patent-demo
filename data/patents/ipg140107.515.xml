<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit and priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/241,888, filed on Sep. 12, 2009, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure is related to mattresses and particularly flexible foam mattresses having support surfaces that include at least one layer with large diameter cleaved channels or holes producing enhanced elongatability and elastic performance in the lateral (horizontal) direction.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, flexible foam mattresses achieve anatomical support primarily by way of progressively layering foam layers of various degrees of softness and by creating defined support areas through the use of construction layers that have been shaped and contoured by way of the surface specific location, extraction or shaping of the foam to create differing load bearing regions of support. Such products usually create a number of anatomic support regions (or zones) to accommodate the neck, shoulders, lumbar, hips and thigh. Such products also typically are designed with such other zones below the thigh to mimic the neck, shoulder and lumbar support when these products are rotated in orientation from head to toe.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a mattress having anatomical support, such as lumbar support, achieved through the use of a specialized support layer including large diameter, through and through, cloven holes or channels. The cloven holes increase the elongatability and the elastic performance of the specialized foam layer, causing the specialized foam layer to essentially creep laterally when placed under compression, mimicking the performance of fluid while accommodating the human form in a more compliant manor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This sleep support method produces enhanced anatomic performance unconventionally. The foam construction layer includes large diameter holes or channels (over &#xbd;&#x2033; diameter) across all or most of its surface. In one aspect the holes do not come within 4 inches of the perimeter of the layer to allow perimeter only fastening which also enhances the lateral creep of the layer and the fluid like performance of the sleep support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, a layered mattress is provided including a first layer having a first support surface facing substantially externally and a second support surface opposite the first support surface; a specialized layer having a top support surface adjacent the second support surface of the first layer, a bottom support surface, and a plurality of holes defined to extend through the specialized layer and include openings on the top and bottom support surfaces; a second layer having a third support surface adjacent the bottom support surface of the specialized layer and a fourth support surface opposite the third support surface; and a pad having a fifth support surface adjacent the fourth support surface of the second layer and a sixth support surface opposite the fifth support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect, a layered mattress is provided including a first layer having a first support surface facing substantially externally and a second support surface opposite the first support surface; a specialized layer having a top support surface adjacent the second support surface of the first layer, a bottom support surface, and a plurality of holes defined to extend through the specialized layer and include openings on the top and bottom support surfaces, the holes including a constant circular cross section having a diameter of at least &#x215d; inch; a second layer having a third support surface adjacent the bottom support surface of the specialized layer and a fourth support surface opposite the third support surface, at least a portion of the second support surface is adhered to at least a portion of the top support surface of the specialized layer, and at least a portion of the third support surface is adhered to at least a portion of the bottom support surface of the specialized layer; and a pad having a fifth support surface adjacent the fourth support surface of the second layer and a sixth support surface opposite the fifth support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A more complete understanding of the invention can be obtained by reference to the following detailed description of the embodiments thereof in connection with the attached drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a mattress <b>100</b> including a plurality of layers <b>102</b> in accordance with an embodiment. The mattress <b>100</b> has length and width dimensions sufficient to support a reclining body of an adult. In one embodiment, the layers <b>102</b> include a first or surface layer <b>104</b>, a specialized layer <b>106</b>, a second layer <b>108</b>, a pad <b>110</b> and a third layer <b>112</b>. The layers <b>102</b> may be covered and held together using an outer covering (not shown). For example, the covering may include a removable outer fabric cover. It should be understood that the specialized layer <b>106</b> may be used with some, all or any combination of these layers while not departing from the scope of the invention. It should also be understood that the total number of layers <b>102</b> may vary between implementations, including the use of more than one specialized layer <b>106</b> while not departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The first layer <b>104</b> includes a generally planar first support surface <b>104</b><i>a </i>adapted to substantially face externally, and a generally planar second support surface <b>104</b><i>b </i>opposite the first support surface. In one embodiment, the first layer <b>104</b> includes a substantially uniform thickness of about 1 inch to about 3 inches. In one embodiment, the first layer <b>104</b> may be a rigid or flexible, natural, polyurethane, or visco-elastic foam bedding materials that are available from a variety of sources, and which are well known in the art, such as an open surface foam or comfort flex foam. In one example, with no intent to be limiting, the first layer <b>104</b> may have a density in the range of between about 2 to about 8 lbs/ft<sup>2</sup>. In one example, the indentation load deflection (ILD), the force required to indent the foam 25%, may range from between about 6 to about 20 lbs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The second layer <b>108</b> includes a generally planar third support surface <b>108</b><i>a</i>, and a generally planar fourth support surface <b>108</b><i>b </i>opposite the third support surface. In one embodiment, the second layer <b>108</b> includes a substantially uniform thickness of about 1 inch to about 3 inches. In one embodiment, the second layer <b>108</b> may also be rigid or flexible, natural, polyurethane or visco-elastic foam bedding materials. These bedding materials, such as memory foam or transition foam, are well known in the art and are available from a variety of sources. In one example, with no intent to be limiting, the second layer <b>108</b> may have a density in the range of between about 2 to about 4 lbs/ft<sup>2</sup>. In one example, the ILD may range from between about 15 to about 20 lbs.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The pad <b>110</b> includes a generally planar fifth support surface <b>110</b><i>a</i>, and a generally planar sixth support surface <b>110</b><i>b </i>opposite the fifth support surface. In one embodiment, the pad <b>110</b> includes a substantially uniform thickness of between about 1 inch to about 7 inches. In one embodiment, the pad <b>110</b> may be made of support core foam, which is well known in the art. In one example, with no intent to be limiting, the pad <b>110</b> may have a density in the range of between about 1 to about 2 lbs/ft<sup>2</sup>. In one example, the ILD may range from between about 30 to about 60 lbs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the specialized layer <b>106</b> may be made of a cellular material, such as polyurethane foam, a visco-elastic foam and the like. In one embodiment, the specialized layer <b>106</b> includes a substantially uniform thickness of between about 1 inch to about 5 inches. In one embodiment, the specialized layer <b>106</b> may be made of elastic foam or anatomic support foam, which are well known in the art. In one example, with no intent to be limiting, the specialized layer <b>106</b> may have a density in the range of between about 2 to about 8 lbs/ft<sup>2</sup>. In one example, the ILD may range from between about 6 to about 20 lbs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the specialized layer <b>106</b> includes a plurality of holes or channels <b>114</b> defined to extend vertically through the specialized layer <b>106</b> from a top surface <b>116</b> to a bottom surface <b>118</b> of the specialized layer. In fabricating the specialized layer <b>106</b>, the holes <b>114</b> are cleaved or cut into the layer using a well-known type of foam cleaving technique. The cloven holes <b>114</b> are made completely through the entire thickness of the specialized layer <b>106</b>. Openings <b>120</b> at each end of the holes <b>114</b> are defined on the top and bottom surfaces <b>116</b> and <b>118</b>, since the holes extend completely through the specialized layer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one embodiment, the holes <b>114</b> may be evenly and symmetrically distributed on the specialized layer <b>106</b>. In alternative embodiments, the holes <b>114</b> may be distributed in alternative layouts. The alternative layouts may include, for example, the clustering of the holes with varying dimension in certain areas of the mattress. By varying the diameter of holes <b>114</b> and/or their density of distribution, the mattress <b>100</b> may be made more flexible. The variableness of the size and distribution of the holes <b>114</b> provides for the mechanical characteristics of the mattress and its anatomic support performance.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">To provide the desired anatomic performance of the mattress, it is important that the holes <b>114</b> cut into the specialized layer <b>106</b> be of a relatively large diameter. The inclusion of large diameter, through and through holes <b>114</b>, formed through the specialized layer <b>106</b> provides a higher level of suppleness in the lateral or horizontal direction. The cloven holes <b>114</b> increase the elastic performance of the specialized foam layer <b>106</b> allowing the layer to creep laterally between the surface layer <b>104</b> and the second layer <b>108</b> when placed under compression. The creep effect mimics the performance of a fluid causing the specialized layer <b>106</b> to bulge or swell in the areas under less compression to accommodate the human form in a more compliant manor. It has been found that holes <b>114</b> with diameters of &#xbd; inch to &#x215d; perform the functions of the mattress as described, however, &#x215d; inch or larger diameter holes, produce the greatest swelling or bulging effect.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Once the first support layer <b>104</b>, the specialized layer <b>106</b>, the second support layer <b>108</b> and the pad <b>110</b> have been stacked together, the stack may be combined on the third layer <b>112</b>, which is, for example, a rigid base foam, such as a sheet of a reticulated filter polyurethane foam, a Rebond (Recycled Foam) Composite of scrap memory foam or the equivalent. The third layer <b>112</b> may include a uniform thickness of between about 1 inch and 3 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the layers <b>102</b> may or may not be adhered together. For example, the surface layer <b>104</b> may not be adhered to the specialized layer <b>106</b>. Similarly, the second layer <b>108</b> may not be adhered to the specialized layer <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, only a portion of the top and bottom surfaces <b>116</b> and <b>118</b> adjacent the perimeter of the specialized layer <b>106</b> may remain free of holes to allow perimeter only gluing of the specialized layer <b>106</b> to one or both of the surface layer <b>104</b> and the second layer <b>108</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a gluing area <b>402</b> may be reserved adjacent the perimeter of the specialized layer <b>106</b> for gluing or the equivalent. The gluing area may have a dimension L, which may be between 3 and 5 inches wide, preferably 4 inches wide. In one embodiment, perimeter only gluing of the specialized layer <b>106</b> to the other layers enhances the lateral creep of the specialized layer <b>106</b> and thus, the fluid like performance of the specialized layer <b>106</b> is increased. In one embodiment, the layers may be adhered together using, for example, an adhesive as are well known in the industry.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, when placed under compression, such as by accommodating a human form, side walls <b>302</b> of the holes <b>114</b> collapse into a space or void <b>304</b> created by the holes <b>114</b>. The increased diameter holes allow the material of the specialized layer <b>106</b> to move laterally into the hole space <b>304</b> to a degree that allows the specialized material to creep creating a bulge or swelling in areas under less compression.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">This inclination toward lateral compression results due to the combined effects of the removal of a predetermined amount of material from within the holes <b>114</b>, for example, the volume of a cylinder &#x215d;&#x2033; diameter or greater; and the lateral collapse of the holes <b>114</b> into the hole space.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mattress <b>100</b> including specialized layer <b>106</b> with cleaved holes <b>114</b> functions to produce anatomic support without the need for shaping or other contouring of the mattress that is so common. For example, the area A under the shoulder and area B under the hip are generally under substantial compression in the areas immediately under these body protrusions. Under compression, the cloven holes <b>114</b> are of such a diameter that allows the side walls <b>302</b> to substantially buckle or collapse as described above. The foam material of the specialized layer <b>106</b> tends to creep laterally causing the mattress to bulge or swell in the areas C, D and E immediately adjacent the compressed areas A and B. Thus, in this example, the shoulder (area A) and hip (area B) receive soft vertical support while the neck (area C), the ribs (area D) and the upper thigh (area E) each receive enhanced anatomic support.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
