<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a method and an apparatus for making a metallic casing, particularly, for making a metallic casing used in portable electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Metallic casings are considered attractive candidates for use in various portable electronic devices such as an MP3 player, personal digital assistance (PDA), and mobile phone because of their sturdiness and appealing appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a typical metallic casing <b>10</b><i>a </i>includes an approximately rectangular base <b>11</b><i>a</i>, a first sidewall <b>12</b><i>a</i>, a second sidewall <b>13</b><i>a</i>, a third sidewall <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and a fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>a</i>. The first sidewall <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the second sidewall <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the third sidewall <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>a </i>all extend around a periphery of the base <b>11</b><i>a</i>. The first sidewall <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the second sidewall <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the third sidewall <b>14</b><i>a</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>a </i>respectively connect to each other. The first sidewall <b>12</b><i>a</i>, the second sidewall <b>13</b><i>a</i>, the third sidewall <b>14</b><i>a</i>, the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>a</i>, and the base <b>11</b><i>a </i>cooperatively define a cavity (not labeled) with an opening. The cavity is configured for receiving electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The metallic casing <b>10</b><i>a </i>is made from a preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>is made from a metal plate by a drawing process. The preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>includes an approximately rectangular base <b>11</b><i>b</i>, a first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b</i>, a second sidewall <b>13</b><i>b</i>, a third sidewall <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and a fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>b</i>. The first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the second sidewall <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>b </i>all extend around a periphery of the base <b>11</b><i>b</i>. The first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the second sidewall <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>b </i>respectively connect to each other. The first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the second sidewall <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>b</i>, and the base <b>11</b><i>b </i>cooperatively define a cavity with an opening. An end of each of the first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the second sidewall <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>b </i>bends outward and respectively forms a first excess <b>121</b><i>b</i>, a second excess <b>131</b><i>b</i>, a third excess <b>141</b><i>b</i>, and a fourth excess <b>151</b><i>b</i>. The first excess <b>121</b><i>b</i>, the second excess <b>131</b><i>b</i>, the third excess <b>141</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth excess <b>151</b><i>b </i>respectively connect to each other. Each of the first excess <b>121</b><i>b</i>, the second excess <b>131</b><i>b</i>, the third excess <b>141</b><i>b</i>, the fourth excess <b>151</b><i>b</i>, and the base <b>11</b><i>b </i>form a corresponding connecting portion <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, <b>142</b><i>b</i>, and <b>152</b><i>b</i>. In other words, the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>includes an article portion and an excess portion. The article portion of the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>consists of the base <b>11</b><i>b </i>and the sidewalls <b>12</b><i>b</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>. The excess portion of the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>consists of the excesses <b>121</b><i>b</i>, <b>131</b><i>b</i>, <b>141</b><i>b</i>, <b>151</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an apparatus <b>100</b> includes an upper mold <b>110</b>, a lower mold <b>130</b>, and a positioning member <b>150</b>. The upper mold <b>110</b> is opposite to the lower mold <b>130</b>, and the upper mold <b>110</b> is movable relative to the lower mold <b>130</b>. The upper mold <b>110</b> defines a rectangular depression (not labeled) opposite to the lower mold <b>130</b>. The rectangular depression forms a first side surface <b>112</b>, a second side surface <b>113</b>, a third side surface <b>114</b>, and a fourth side surface <b>115</b>. The first side surface <b>112</b>, the second side surface <b>113</b>, the third side surface <b>114</b>, and the fourth side surface <b>115</b> respectively connect to each other. The side surface <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>115</b> respectively forms a first sharp edge <b>1121</b>, a second sharp edge <b>1131</b>, a third sharp edge <b>1141</b>, and a fourth sharp edge <b>1151</b>. The first sharp edge <b>1121</b>, the second sharp edge <b>1131</b>, the third sharp edge <b>1141</b>, and the fourth sharp edge <b>1151</b> respectively connect to each other. The lower mold <b>130</b> includes cutting side <b>131</b>. The cutting side <b>131</b> includes a first cutting edge <b>132</b>, a second cutting edge <b>133</b>, a third cutting edge <b>134</b>, and a fourth cutting edge <b>135</b>. The first cutting edge <b>132</b>, the second cutting edge <b>133</b>, the third cutting edge <b>134</b>, and the fourth cutting edge <b>135</b> correspond to the first sharp edge <b>1121</b>, the second sharp edge <b>1131</b>, the third sharp edge <b>1141</b>, and the fourth sharp edge <b>1151</b>, respectively. A horizontal width of the first cutting edge <b>132</b> is substantially equal to that of the first sharp edge <b>1121</b>. A horizontal width of the second cutting edge <b>133</b> is substantially equal to that of the second sharp edge <b>1131</b>. A horizontal width of the third cutting edge <b>134</b> is substantially equal to that of the third sharp edge <b>1141</b>. A horizontal width of the fourth cutting edge <b>135</b> is substantially equal to that of the fourth sharp edge <b>1151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a process of making the metallic casing <b>10</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>is placed into the rectangular depression of the upper mold <b>110</b>. The connecting portions <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, <b>142</b><i>b</i>, <b>152</b><i>b </i>are located at the cutting edges <b>1121</b>, <b>1131</b>, <b>1141</b>, <b>1151</b> respectively. The positioning member <b>150</b> is placed into the cavity of the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>so that the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>is fixed in the rectangular depression of the upper mold <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The upper mold <b>110</b> moves vertically to the lower mold <b>130</b> to keep the first sharp edge <b>1121</b>, the second sharp edge <b>1131</b>, the third sharp edge <b>1141</b>, and the fourth sharp edge <b>1151</b> substantially coplanar with the first cutting edge <b>132</b>, the second cutting edge <b>133</b>, the third cutting edge <b>134</b>, and the fourth cutting edge <b>135</b>, respectively. The lower mold <b>130</b> moves horizontally in a first direction at a predetermined distance such that the first cutting edge <b>132</b> moves beyond the first sharp edge <b>1121</b>. Thus, the first excess <b>121</b><i>b </i>is sliced from the first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, the lower mold <b>130</b> moves horizontally in a second, third, and fourth direction at a predetermined distance in that order, such that the second cutting edge <b>133</b>, the third cutting edge <b>134</b>, and the fourth cutting edge <b>135</b> moves beyond the second sharp edge <b>1131</b>, the third sharp edge <b>1141</b>, and the fourth sharp edge <b>1151</b>. Thus the second excess <b>131</b><i>b</i>, the third excess <b>141</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth excess <b>15</b> lb are sliced from the second sidewall <b>13</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>14</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The rotary cutting process is completed, thereby yielding an article <b>10</b><i>c </i>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). After that, the first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b </i>defines a slot <b>123</b> for receiving electronic components such as a connector. Thus, a metallic casing <b>10</b><i>a </i>is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a process of making the metallic casing <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the first excess <b>121</b><i>b</i>, the second excess <b>131</b><i>b</i>, the third excess <b>141</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth excess <b>151</b><i>b </i>respectively connect to each other. After the first excess <b>121</b><i>b</i>, the second excess <b>131</b><i>b</i>, and the third excess <b>141</b><i>b </i>are sliced from the preform <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the excess portion of the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>is not separated from the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>completely because the fourth excess <b>151</b><i>b </i>of the excess portion is still connected with the fourth sidewall <b>15</b>. When the fourth excess <b>151</b><i>b </i>is sliced from the preform <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the excess portion of the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>is separated from the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>completely. The location where the excess portion is completely separated from the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>is at a boundary between the first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>b</i>. The excess portion of the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>moves together with the lower mold <b>130</b> at the moment that the fourth excess <b>151</b><i>b </i>separates from the preform <b>10</b><i>b</i>, thereby generating a tearing effect to the boundary between the first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>b</i>. Hence, after the rotary cutting process is completed, a gap <b>16</b><i>b </i>is formed at the top edge of the boundary between the first sidewall <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the fourth sidewall <b>15</b><i>b</i>. The gap <b>16</b><i>b </i>makes a case made from the preform <b>10</b><i>b </i>having poor appearance. Thus an extra process, such as polishing, is required to remove the gap <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, a new method and apparatus is desired in order to overcome the above-described shortcomings.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An apparatus for use in making a metallic casing includes a first mold and a second mold. The first mold is opposite and movable relative to the second mold. The first mold defines a rectangular depression opposite to the second mold. The rectangular depression forms a plurality of side surfaces connected to each other respectively. Each side surface has a sharp edge. The second mold includes a plurality of cutting edges corresponding to the sharp edges respectively and one of the cutting edges has a secondary-cutting edge.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present apparatus is used for making metallic casings. Any kind of metal or alloy can be used as a material of the casing. In one embodiment, aluminum alloy is the material used in the apparatus for making the metallic casing.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an apparatus <b>200</b> for making a metallic casing includes an upper mold <b>210</b>, a lower mold <b>230</b>, and a positioning member <b>250</b>. The positioning member <b>250</b> is a substantially flat plate. The upper mold <b>210</b> and the lower mold <b>230</b> are on opposite sides of the positioning member. The upper mold <b>210</b> is movable relative to the lower mold <b>230</b>. The upper mold <b>210</b> defines a rectangular depression opposite to the lower mold <b>230</b>. The rectangular depression forms a first side surface <b>212</b>, a second side surface <b>213</b>, a third side surface <b>214</b>, and a fourth side surface <b>215</b>. The first side surface <b>212</b>, the second side surface <b>213</b>, the third side surface <b>214</b>, and the fourth side surface <b>215</b>, respectively connect to each other. The first side surface <b>212</b>, the second side surface <b>213</b>, the third side surface <b>214</b>, and the fourth side surface <b>215</b> respectively forms a first sharp edge <b>2121</b>, a second sharp edge <b>2131</b>, a third sharp edge <b>2141</b>, and a fourth sharp edge <b>2151</b>. The lower mold <b>230</b> has a cutting side <b>231</b>. The cutting side <b>231</b> includes a first cutting edge <b>232</b>, a second cutting edge <b>233</b>, a third cutting edge <b>234</b>, and a fourth cutting edge <b>235</b>. The first cutting edge <b>232</b> is adjoining to the fourth cutting edge <b>235</b>, and the first cutting edge <b>232</b> defines a cutout <b>2321</b> adjacent to the fourth cutting edge <b>235</b>. The cutout <b>2321</b> is a groove defined in the first cutting edge <b>232</b>, and the groove forms a sidewall <b>2322</b>. An edge of the sidewall <b>2322</b> forms an arcuate secondary-cutting edge <b>2323</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the apparatus <b>200</b> is used for processing a preform <b>20</b><i>b </i>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) by a rotary cutting process, thereby yielding an article <b>20</b><i>c </i>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The preform <b>20</b><i>b </i>is manufactured by a drawing process. The preform <b>20</b><i>b </i>includes an approximately rectangular base <b>21</b><i>b</i>, a first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b</i>, a second sidewall <b>23</b><i>b</i>, a third sidewall <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and a fourth sidewall <b>25</b><i>b</i>. The first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the second sidewall <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>25</b><i>b </i>all extend around a periphery of the base <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the second sidewall <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>25</b><i>b</i>, respectively connect to each other. Each end of the first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the second sidewall <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>25</b><i>b </i>bends outwardly and respectively forms a first excess <b>221</b><i>b</i>, a second excess <b>231</b><i>b</i>, a third excess <b>241</b><i>b</i>, and a fourth excess <b>25</b> lb. The first excess <b>221</b><i>b</i>, the second excess <b>231</b><i>b</i>, the third excess <b>241</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth excess <b>251</b><i>b</i>, respectively connect to each other. The excesses <b>221</b><i>b</i>, <b>231</b><i>b</i>, <b>241</b><i>b</i>, <b>251</b><i>b</i>, and the sidewalls <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>23</b><i>b</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>form connecting portions <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>232</b><i>b</i>, <b>242</b><i>b</i>, <b>252</b><i>b</i>, respectively. In other words, the preform <b>20</b><i>b </i>includes an article portion and an excess portion. The article portion consists of the base <b>21</b><i>b</i>, the first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the second sidewall <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>25</b><i>b</i>. The excess portion consists of the first excess <b>221</b><i>b</i>, the second excess <b>231</b><i>b</i>, the third excess <b>241</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth excess <b>251</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the making process, the preform <b>20</b><i>b </i>is placed into the rectangular depression of the upper mold <b>210</b>. The connecting portion <b>222</b><i>b </i>between the first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b </i>and the first excess <b>221</b><i>b </i>is located adjacent to the first sharp edge <b>2121</b>. The connecting portion <b>232</b><i>b </i>between the second sidewall <b>23</b><i>b </i>and the second excess <b>231</b><i>b </i>is located at the second sharp edge <b>2131</b>. The connecting portion <b>242</b><i>b </i>between the third sidewall <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the third excess <b>241</b><i>b </i>is located at the third sharp edge <b>2141</b>. The connecting portion <b>252</b><i>b </i>between the fourth sidewall <b>25</b><i>b </i>and the fourth excess <b>251</b><i>b </i>is located at the fourth sharp edge <b>2151</b>. The positioning member <b>250</b> is placed into the cavity of the preform <b>20</b><i>b </i>so that the preform <b>20</b><i>b </i>is fixed in the rectangular depression of the upper mold <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The upper mold <b>210</b> moves vertically against (toward) the lower mold <b>230</b> until the first sharp edge <b>2121</b>, the second sharp edge <b>2131</b>, the third sharp edge <b>2141</b>, and the fourth sharp edge <b>2151</b> are substantially coplanar with the first cutting edge <b>232</b>, the second cutting edge <b>233</b>, the third cutting edge <b>234</b>, and the fourth cutting edge <b>235</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The lower mold <b>230</b> then moves horizontally in a first direction at a predetermined distance such that the first cutting edge <b>232</b> moves beyond the first sharp edge <b>2121</b>. As a result, the first excess <b>221</b><i>b </i>is sliced from the first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The first cutting edge <b>232</b> defines a cutout <b>2321</b> adjacent to the fourth cutting edge <b>235</b>, by controlling the predetermined distance, a portion of a connecting portion formed between the first excess <b>221</b><i>b </i>and the first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b </i>can be kept un-sliced (uncut/separated). In the preferred embodiment, the predetermined distance is a distance such that the cutout <b>2321</b> does not go beyond the first sharp edge <b>2121</b>, thus leaving an uncut portion.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The lower mold <b>230</b> then moves horizontally in a second, third, and fourth direction at a predetermined distance in that order, such that the second cutting edge <b>233</b>, the third cutting edge <b>234</b>, and the fourth cutting edge <b>235</b> moves beyond the second sharp edge <b>2131</b>, the third sharp edge <b>2141</b>, and the fourth sharp edge <b>2151</b>. Thus the second excess <b>231</b><i>b</i>, the third excess <b>241</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth excess <b>251</b><i>b </i>are sliced from the second sidewall <b>23</b><i>b</i>, the third sidewall <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth sidewall <b>25</b><i>b</i>, respectively. A partial cut procedure is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After the partial cut procedure, an uncut portion remains. The lower mold <b>230</b> then moves horizontally in the first direction at a greater distance than the first time such that the secondary-cutting edge <b>2323</b> moves beyond the first sharp edge <b>2121</b>. Thus the uncut portion is cut or sliced. A final cut procedure is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">After the final cut procedure, the first excess <b>221</b><i>b</i>, the second excess <b>231</b><i>b</i>, the third excess <b>241</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth excess <b>251</b><i>b </i>are completely removed from the preform <b>20</b><i>b</i>. That is, the excess portion is separated from the preform <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and then the article portion of the preform <b>20</b><i>b </i>is extracted, yielding an article <b>20</b><i>c </i>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The position member <b>250</b> is separated from the top mold and the article <b>20</b><i>c </i>is removed out of the rectangular depression. Finally, a slot <b>223</b>, configured for receiving electronic components such as a connector, is defined in the first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the article <b>20</b><i>c</i>. Thus, a metallic casing <b>20</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the above mentioned process, when the uncut portion is cut or sliced, a gap <b>26</b><i>b </i>is defined in the top edge of the first sidewall <b>22</b><i>b </i>because the uncut portion is a part of the first sidewall. In addition, the first sidewall <b>22</b> is generally required to define a slot <b>223</b> for receiving electronic components such as a connector, and the slot <b>223</b> can be defined at an area where the gap <b>26</b><i>b </i>is located. The gap <b>26</b><i>b </i>can then be eliminated when defining the slot <b>223</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the slot <b>223</b> can be defined by a side punching process with a mold. The appealing appearance is achieved without extra process.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The preform <b>20</b><i>b </i>may includes three sidewalls, five or more sidewalls. When the number of the cutting edges is equal to that of the edges and the sidewalls of the preform <b>20</b><i>b</i>, the number of the cutting edges of the upper mold and the edges of the lower mold may increase or decrease correspondingly. In an alternative embodiment, the cutout may be defined in another location such as a middle portion of the first cutting edge or a portion of the second cutting edge. In another embodiment, the cutout may be an inclined plane, the shape of the secondary-cutting edge may be an ellipse, linear, or any other shape.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Depending on the embodiment, certain of the steps described may be removed, others may be added, and the sequence of steps may be altered. It is also to be understood that the description and the claims drawn to a method may include some indication in reference to certain steps. However, the indication used is only to be viewed for identification purposes and not as a suggestion as to an order for the steps.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is believed that the present embodiments and their advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the application or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the examples hereinbefore described merely being embodiments of the application.</p>
