<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A desmodromic valve system which provides direct bidirectional displacement of a valve stem of an internal combustion engine without the aid of a rocker arm, utilizing a semirigid basket operating in conjunction with a plurality of cams for each valve. The basket is disposed about the camshaft of the engine and secured to the valve stem by an integral retainer on a bottom portion of the basket, and is constrained to motion along the valve stem axis. The basket has a pair of downwardly oriented cam followers in the upper portion thereof, spaced apart from the valve stem axis. A central cam and a parallel pair of side cams are fixedly mounted on the camshaft so as to rotate therewith, the cams substantially surrounded by the basket and cooperating therewith to provide reciprocating valve action with positive bidirectional drive. The central cam is aligned with the valve stem axis, and the side cams are spaced apart from the valve stem axis, parallel to the central cam and respectively aligned with the cam followers. During a first part of a valve cycle, the central cam pushes the valve stem down so as to positively open the associated valve, and the valve stem pulls said basket down with it via the retainer. During a second part of the valve cycle, the side cams push the basket up via their respective cam followers and thereby cause the basket to pull the valve stem so as to positively close the valve.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to desmodromic valve systems, and more particularly to desmodromic valve systems which provide direct bidirectional displacement of a valve stem without the aid of a rocker arm.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A desmodromic valve system positively opens and closes a valve in an internal combustion engine. This is in contrast to the conventional system in which the valve is positively opened with a cam but closed with a return spring.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The main benefit of a desmodromic system is the prevention of valve float. In traditional spring valve actuation, as engine speed increases, the inertia of the valve tends to overcome the spring's ability to close the valve completely before the piston reaches TDC (Top Dead Center). In severe cases, the piston contacts the open valve and causes damage to both engine parts. More generally, if a valve does not completely return to its seat before combustion begins, it can allow combustion gases to escape prematurely, leading to a reduction in cylinder pressure which causes a major decrease in engine performance. This can also overheat the valve, possibly warping it and leading to catastrophic failure. The traditional remedy for valve float is to use a stiffer return spring. This increases the seat pressure of the valve, i.e., the static pressure that holds the valve closed, and reduces valve float at higher engine speeds. However, the engine has to work harder to open the valve. The higher forces between spring and cam cause higher stress on the parts resulting in higher temperature and faster wear or failure in the valve drive system. A desmodromic system can avoid the problem to some extent because, although it has to work against the inertia of the valve opening and closing, it does not have to overcome the energy of the spring.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite their advantages, desmodromic valve drive systems have had limited success in commercial application for various reasons such as design complexity, poor reliability, and valve train binding. Numerous approaches to the various problems have been taken since the earliest days of engine development, more than a hundred years ago, as evidenced by the following patents:</p>

<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, presently, all known desmodromic valve designs have drawbacks which make them undesirable for use in several significant applications, such as production automobiles, and there is no obvious path to a better solution.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a rockerless desmodromic valve system comprising a first cam rotating on a camshaft and cyclically pushing a valve stem, a second cam on the camshaft, and a band extending circumferentially around the second cam and engaging the valve stem, the second cam rotating within the band and causing it to reciprocate so as to cyclically lift the valve stem. The system preferably but not necessarily has a wide band in the form of a basket large enough to encompass multiple cams and to extend completely around them circumferentially.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the invention is a desmodromic valve system comprising a semirigid band, which may be in basket form, disposed about a camshaft of an internal combustion engine, the semirigid band attached to a valve stem and constrained to motion along the valve stem axis. The system includes rotatable cam means mounted on the camshaft and disposed within the band for coacting with it without substantially changing its shape to positively drive the valve stem in both directions along its axis and thereby provide reciprocating valve action with positive bidirectional drive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The objects and advantages of the present invention will be more apparent upon reading the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For the purpose of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended, such alterations and further modifications in the illustrated device and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated therein being contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, wherein like numerals represent like parts throughout the several views, depict a first embodiment <b>10</b> of a rockerless desmodromic valve system according to the present invention. In this embodiment, which is to be understood as one example of a desmodromic valve system according to the present invention, a central cam <b>12</b> and a parallel pair of side cams <b>14</b> are fixedly mounted on a camshaft <b>15</b> so as to rotate therewith, and are substantially surrounded by a semirigid band or &#x201c;basket&#x201d; <b>16</b> which does not rotate with the camshaft and is constrained by the cams and by its attachment to the stem <b>20</b> of a valve <b>22</b>. Except as described herein, the camshaft and valve may be conventional parts mounted in a conventional manner in the cylinder head of an internal combustion engine in which each valve has an associated port <b>24</b> and has a valve guide (not shown) which closely surrounds the valve stem.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Basket <b>16</b> engages paired side cams <b>14</b> and the associated valve stem <b>20</b> so as to pull the valve stem after it is pushed by central cam <b>12</b>. The basket and cams cooperate to provide reciprocating valve action with positive bidirectional drive. That is, the system positively drives the valve from its closed position, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, to its open position, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, by conventional cam action by means of cam <b>12</b> in contact with the valve stem, and positively drives the valve back to its closed position using the basket, which is secured to the valve stem and raised by paired cams <b>14</b> acting through associated cam followers <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each cam <b>14</b> has a main portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>with a concavo-convex cross-section, and a peripheral portion or shoulder <b>14</b><i>b </i>with a circular cross-section. The concavo-convex cross-section of the main portion of cam <b>14</b> is readily apparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the concave part <b>14</b><i>c </i>of main portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>of cam <b>14</b> is below the camshaft axis (and axially separated from the valve stem), and the convex portion engages the associated cam follower <b>18</b> and thereby holds the basket in its raised position. Cams <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> operate in coordinated fashion such that, at this point in the cycle, lobe <b>12</b><i>a </i>of cam <b>12</b> is oriented away from the valve stem and thereby allows the valve to be lifted and thus closed by the basket. Conversely, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, part <b>14</b><i>c </i>of cam <b>14</b> is above the camshaft axis and lobe <b>12</b><i>a </i>of cam <b>12</b> is oriented toward the valve stem, whereby cam follower <b>18</b>&#x2014;and thus basket <b>16</b>&#x2014;is in its lowest position and the valve is open. A cam follower, such as a snug-fitting cup (not shown), is preferably also provided on the upper end of the valve stem for contact with cam <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As one example of a set of suitable dimensions for valve system <b>10</b>, cam <b>12</b> may have a maximum radius of 1 inch (at the outermost point on lobe <b>12</b><i>a</i>) and a minimum radius of &#xbd; inch, thereby producing a valve lift&#x2014;the valve displacement between open and closed positions&#x2014;of &#xbd; inch. Cam portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>has the same maximum and minimum radii as cam <b>12</b>, and its radius at any given point is a function of the radius of cam <b>12</b> at a diametrically opposed point. Specifically, cam <b>12</b> and cam portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>are designed such that, at any two diametrically opposed points X and Y on their respective surfaces (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>),
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>r</i><sub>x</sub><i>+r</i><sub>y</sub><i>=c </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The cams are thus complementary. With the above example dimensions, the sum of the radius of cam <b>12</b> and the radius of cam portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>at such points X and Y is 1.5&#x2033;. For example, the outermost point on lobe <b>12</b><i>a </i>is diametrically opposed to the center of concave part <b>14</b><i>c </i>of cam <b>14</b>, and the respective radii at those points are 1.0&#x2033; and 0.5&#x2033;, the sum of which is 1.5&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Basket <b>16</b> has a retainer <b>26</b> integrally formed in a reinforced bottom portion thereof. The retainer cooperates with a plurality of keys or keepers <b>28</b> to secure the basket to the valve stem. The retainer has a downwardly tapered hole and the keepers are likewise downwardly tapered such that the retainer and associated keepers together form a valve stem lock. The keepers are shaped so as to extend into the groove of the valve stem and are held therein by wedging action of the cooperatively tapered portion of the retainer. The retainer may alternatively be formed as a separate part fitted into a hole in the basket. Examples of retainer/keeper sets are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,327,677 and 4,922,867, which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an alternative embodiment suited for valves in which the groove is closer to the tip of the stem than in the first embodiment, the retainer is formed in the top of a hollow conical member extending up from the bottom of the basket enough to enclose the groove. The system may also provide an extension of the valve guide as additional lateral support for the stem in retrofit applications involving removal of a return spring. In cases with replaceable valve guides, a longer valve guide may be installed which extends into the space formerly occupied by the return spring. In other cases, e.g., heads with cast guides, the guide may be drilled and tapped to receive a threaded cylindrical extension, preferably with an oil seal and/or a roller guide on top.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The basket also includes a reinforced upper portion or flange <b>16</b><i>a </i>adjacent each axial end for a cam follower <b>18</b>, the flange and cam follower having complementary shapes for retaining the cam follower as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. A hole <b>17</b> is provided in the top of the basket for insertion of the cam followers. The cam follower may comprise a roller.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The basket preferably has a unitary, or monocoque, construction, with solid side walls and open ends, and is semirigid, i.e., slightly flexible but sufficiently rigid that it experiences less than 1% elongation in response to forces applied to it during a cycle of operation of the valve to which it is connected&#x2014;including in particular the forces applied in the process of returning the valve to its closed position&#x2014;at camshaft speeds from zero to 5,000 RPM. For example, a basket with a nominal height of 2.5&#x2033; experiences elongation of less than 0.025&#x2033; as it pulls the valve stem to close the valve at camshaft speeds up to 5,000 RPM. Basket elongation is the primary contributor to the dynamic lash of the valve, which is understood to be the variable lash occurring in operation, i.e., the clearance between the valve stem and cam <b>12</b> during operation. Basket elongation of up to 0.100&#x2033; may be suitable with certain engine designs, but the basket is preferably sufficiently rigid that it limits the dynamic lash to 0.020-0.030&#x2033;, more preferably less than 0.010&#x2033; and, most preferably, 0.005&#x2033; or less. One suitable material is thin-wall cast titanium. There is preferably a gap between the bottom portion of the basket and shoulder <b>14</b><i>b </i>when the valve is closed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and, likewise, a gap between the top portion of the basket and shoulder <b>14</b><i>b </i>when the valve is open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). The basket is preferably dimensioned to provide a gap of at least 0.001&#x2033; at substantially all points between it and cam <b>14</b> at rest.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The assembly process begins by mounting the baskets on the camshaft before the camshaft is installed in the head. The baskets are moved axially over the cams on the camshaft to their respective cams <b>12</b> and <b>14</b>. When all the baskets are so mounted, the camshaft is placed in the bearing blocks in the head and secured. Each valve is then installed by sliding its stem through a valve guide and through the hole in the bottom of an associated basket. With the cams oriented as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the stem is advanced and the basket is lowered as necessary for the groove in the stem to pass beyond the retainer in the basket, and the keepers are then inserted through one or both open ends of the basket and placed in the groove, after which the retainer is moved into place surrounding the keepers, thereby holding them in the groove. Each cam follower <b>18</b> is then inserted through the hole <b>17</b> in the top of the basket and slid into a flange <b>16</b><i>a</i>, where it is preferably secured in place with a fastener, e.g., screw <b>19</b>, extending into the flange through the top of the basket. Screws <b>19</b> are preferably aircraft bolts with anti-rotation features, e.g., drilled heads having a common safety wire through them. The top of the cam follower may be tapered in the direction away from hole <b>17</b> to provide a wedge shape to facilitate insertion into the flange. Insertion of cam follower <b>18</b> pre-loads the valve stem and tensions, i.e., slightly stretches or elongates, the basket. Cam follower <b>18</b> is suitably dimensioned to perform this function.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In operation, starting from the valve-closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the camshaft rotates nearly 135&#xb0; to a point at which cam lobe <b>12</b><i>a </i>begins to engage the valve stem and cam follower <b>18</b> simultaneously begins to engage a smaller-radius portion of cam portion <b>14</b><i>a</i>. Cam lobe <b>12</b><i>a </i>then exerts a downward force on the valve stem until the camshaft has rotated 180&#xb0;, to the valve-open position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The valve stem is free to move down because cam follower <b>18</b> engages the smaller-radius portion of cam portion <b>14</b><i>a</i>, including concave part <b>14</b><i>c</i>, during this part of the cycle, and the valve stem pulls the basket down with it as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Further camshaft rotation causes cam lobe <b>12</b><i>a </i>to rotate away from the valve stem and correspondingly brings cam follower <b>18</b> into contact with points of progressively larger radius on cam portion <b>14</b><i>a</i>. Cam portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>thereupon exerts an upward force on cam follower <b>18</b> which lifts the basket, which in turn pulls the valve stem up. When the camshaft has rotated a little more than 45&#xb0; from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, cam follower <b>18</b> again bears against the maximum-radius portion of cam portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the valve is closed. The valve and basket positions at this point are as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and remain so for the remainder of the cycle. It will be understood that the above-mentioned angles of 135&#xb0; and 45&#xb0; are mere examples and that the angles at which cam lobe <b>12</b><i>a </i>engages and disengages from the valve stem are functions of desired cam action for a desired valve application.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The circular peripheral portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>of cam <b>14</b> are provided to resist flexing of the basket and thereby limit its maximum elongation as the valve closes, at which time the concave part <b>14</b><i>c </i>of cam <b>14</b> moves toward one side of the basket and opens up a significant gap. By virtue of their fixed <b>1</b>&#x2033; radius, portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>maintain a minimum of 2&#x2033; spacing between the opposed sides of the basket at least where they make contact with it. Portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>(shoulders) may be on either or both sides of each side cam <b>14</b> on the camshaft axis, i.e., the side closer to the central cam, the opposite side, or both. The side closer to the central cam is closer to the line of force (tension) between stem <b>22</b> and cam follower <b>18</b> during valve closure. Alternatively, a constant-radius disc such as portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be provided on either or both sides of central cam <b>12</b>, and such a disc may help with camshaft balancing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an alternative embodiment, the desmodromic valve system has a parallel pair of rings or bands instead of the basket described above. The bands are preferably joined at the bottom by a bridge which includes a retainer such as described above, in a unitary construction or as separate parts. A single band with a single cam <b>14</b> is also contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The basket with cam follower(s) <b>18</b> is effectively a clamp. In cooperation with cam(s) <b>14</b>, it clamps the central cam (cam <b>12</b>) to the valve stem, whereby the valve stem is virtually an ideal cam follower throughout the valve cycle. It is strongly preferred to have the clamp extend completely around the central cam circumferentially as shown in the drawings and described above. However, in some applications, it may be adequate for the clamp to extend around the cam on only one side of the camshaft, i.e., the left or right side as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, akin to a C-clamp, with curved or straight vertical and horizontal segments. The clamp may comprise one half of the basket described above, i.e., the left or right half as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, but including the full retainer and keys and the cam followers as described above. The cam followers may be fixed in position in supporting flanges as described above, or may be vertically adjustable by means of a threaded connection to the top of the clamp or otherwise. Alternatively, the cam followers may be integral parts of the clamp. Such a clamp is provided, if necessary, with suitable means to keep it aligned with the valve stem. For example, a horizontal support bar or guard rail may be provided on the head so as to abut the back side of the half basket (the side opposite the cam) at the level of the camshaft axis. The support bar may, for example, be bolted or otherwise secured to adjacent bearing blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As an alternative to the half basket just described, a clamp in the form of a half ring akin to a C-clamp may be adequate in some applications. This clamp may have approximately the same width along the camshaft axis as cam <b>14</b>, and be aligned with that cam, but have an axial projection rigidly connecting it to the valve stem. It may have the same general cross-sectional shape as the left or right half of the basket as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. If necessary, a horizontal support bar or guard rail, as described above, is provided which includes a vertical guide, such as a slot to receive the back of the clamp, to keep the clamp vertically aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Cams <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> have complementary shapes as described above, and they are preferably complementary around their entire circumferences, but may be partially complementary in certain applications. It is particularly advantageous for cam <b>14</b> to complement cam <b>12</b> for the valve-closing portion of the valve cycle, so as to generate a lifting force via the basket or other clamp as soon as the maximum-radius portion of cam lobe <b>12</b><i>a </i>is past the valve stem. However, an upward force is not necessarily required from the basket during every part of the valve cycle, e.g., during the compression stroke and power stroke of a four-stroke engine, and so, in some applications, the side cam may have a relatively small radius for a significant part of its circumference corresponding to such parts of the cycle (and thus have less rotating mass), provided that the basket is suitably secured to the valve stem and kept aligned with it. The basket may be secured by means of a cap screwed over the keys to keep them in place, or, for some applications, a threaded connection without keys may be adequate. A horizontal support bar or guard rail as described above may be provided on each side of the basket for alignment purposes if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">One example of such a side cam is cam <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. Cam <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; is designed for clockwise rotation. It extends approximately 120&#xb0; around the camshaft as illustrated, and it has the same radius as cam <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the first embodiment for approximately 90&#xb0;, in the circumferential range from point A to point B, which includes the valve-closing portion of the valve cycle. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that cam <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and cam <b>12</b> are complementary for that part of the valve cycle. This embodiment preferably includes a circular portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>joined to cam <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and having a constant <b>1</b>&#x2033; radius as in the first embodiment. A counterweight <b>30</b> is optionally provided on the opposite side of the camshaft from cam <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; for balancing purposes, and may be mounted on portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>as shown. Camshaft balance can also be achieved by removing weight, e.g., by machining away areas of portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>adjacent to cam <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, and/or by initially forming such adjacent areas and cam <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; itself with apertures therein, such as in a spoked wheel. Camshaft balance can be achieved by adding or deleting material or a combination of the two.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Depending on the rigidity of the basket, portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be made with a greater axial width (along the camshaft axis) than portion <b>14</b><i>b </i>in the first embodiment, for purposes of structural integrity. Alternatively, a cam <b>14</b> may have a part <b>14</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) with the axial width of original part <b>14</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and also include the remainder of original part <b>14</b><i>a </i>but with half its width, whereby some part of cam <b>14</b> engages cam follower <b>18</b> throughout the cycle, thus maintaining the pre-load on the valve stem and reinforcing portion <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another embodiment <b>110</b> of the invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, wherein like numerals represent like parts throughout the several views. This embodiment and variations thereof may be the same as the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> and its variations as discussed above, with exceptions as discussed below. A central cam <b>112</b> and a parallel pair of side cams <b>114</b> are fixedly mounted on a camshaft <b>115</b> so as to rotate therewith, and are substantially surrounded by a semirigid band or &#x201c;basket&#x201d; <b>116</b> which does not rotate with the camshaft and is constrained by the cams and by its attachment to the stem of a valve <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The primary difference with this embodiment is that the basket and cams are designed for a &#xbc; inch valve lift. Basket <b>116</b> engages paired side cams <b>114</b> and the associated valve stem so as to pull the valve stem after it is pushed by central cam <b>112</b>. The basket and cams cooperate to provide reciprocating valve action with positive bidirectional drive. That is, the system positively drives the valve from its closed position, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, to its open position, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, by conventional cam action by means of cam <b>112</b> in contact with the valve stem, and positively drives the valve back to its closed position using the basket, which is secured to the valve stem and raised by paired cams <b>114</b> acting through associated cam followers <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Each cam <b>114</b> has a main portion with a concavo-convex cross-section, and a peripheral portion or shoulder with a circular cross-section. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the concave part of cam <b>114</b> is below the camshaft axis (and axially separated from the valve stem), and the convex portion engages the associated cam follower <b>118</b> and thereby holds the basket in its raised position. Cams <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> operate in coordinated fashion such that, at this point in the cycle, the lobe of cam <b>112</b> is oriented away from the valve stem and thereby allows the valve to be lifted and thus closed by the basket. Conversely, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, the concave part of cam <b>114</b> is above the camshaft axis and the lobe of cam <b>112</b> is oriented toward the valve stem, whereby cam follower <b>118</b>&#x2014;and thus basket <b>116</b>&#x2014;is in its lowest position and the valve is open.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character, it being understood that only preferred embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected.</p>
