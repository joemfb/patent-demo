<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a rotating valve as well as to a heat pump.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the alternating connection of a plurality of fluid flows for controlling a heat pump with a large number of respectively thermodynamically active flow channels fundamentally the use of rotating valves is known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">WO 2007/068481 A1, which corresponds to U.S. Publication No. 20090000327, and which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a heat pump of a stack of plate-like hollow elements fixedly connected to one another, wherein the hollow elements comprise adsorber/desorber regions and one hollow element respectively represents one flow channel. The plurality of flow channels are alternately connected to one another in series via pairs of rotating valves arranged at the end side of the hollow elements in order to achieve an optimization of the power of the heat pump with given size.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A heat pump of this type as defined by the invention has many possible uses, e.g., waste heat recovery in steady-state technology, e.g., building engineering, solar air conditioning or also stationary air-conditioning systems for vehicles, in particular commercial vehicles.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the invention to further improve a rotating valve and a heat pump in terms of size, construction cost and efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is attained according to an embodiment of the invention for a rotating valve, whereby through the realization of a switching device of the rotating valve with axially directed openings, an effective and particularly compact solution is provided for alternating connections of the fluid flows. From the conventional art referenced at the outset only radially directed flow openings in the region of the alternating connection are known, which, at least with respect to the installation space, leads to expensive solutions, e.g., double-walled cylinders with openings arranged therein in a radially directed manner and offset with respect to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A rotating valve according to the invention is suitable not only for controlling a plurality of fluid flows of different temperatures for a heat pump, for example, for the recovery of heat, but also in general for the alternating connection of fluid flows, e.g., also for the recovery of the components of a solution, e.g. with chemical reactors.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The switching device can be embodied as an axial longitudinal body, which is accommodated in a fixed, essentially cylindrical wall, wherein either the inlets or the outlets are connected via radially directed openings of the wall. In particular for the connection of a stack of parallel flow channels, a suitable arrangement of the inlets or outlets can be achieved hereby in particular in an evenly spaced straight line.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The longitudinal body can have a number of axially directed separate channels for the fluid flows corresponding to the plurality of inlets, wherein each channel has a radial opening for connecting to one of the openings of the wall. The axially separate channels can be produced, e.g., by axially longitudinally directed bores. In particular the channels can run straight and parallel, so that a coiling of the channels known in the prior art can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Particularly advantageously it is provided to avoid the mixing of adjacent fluid flows that at least one of the two, longitudinal body or wall, has full perimeter annular sealing members, which interact in a sealing manner with the respective other of the two, longitudinal body or wall, so that the axially offset openings of the wall are separated from one another. Preferably, in the interest of a simple production, an annular seal can be accommodated on radial projections of at least one of the two, longitudinal body or wall. Alternatively or additionally, the seal can also be embodied in one piece with the longitudinal body and/or the wall. With a suitable choice of material for the longitudinal body and wall, the material of the corresponding component can additionally have a sealing effect, for example, with a suitable choice of material pairings of plastics or plastic and metal. A one-piece embodiment of seals on the respective component can also be provided in the sense that the seals of a different material from the component are sprayed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a first advantageous embodiment of the invention, the longitudinal body can be formed as an essentially one-piece component. This can be, e.g., an injection molded part of a plastic, which in particular is reworked through one or more reworking steps, e.g., by inserting bores for longitudinally directed channels.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an alternative embodiment, the longitudinal body can also be embodied as a plurality of longitudinal body elements stacked in the axial direction. This type of division into several longitudinal body elements renders possible a modular construction, which can be adapted to different numbers of flow channels in the sense of a component sharing concept in a simple manner. Preferably, at least some of the longitudinal body elements are thereby embodied as shared components.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further embodiment, the switching device can be penetrated in the axial direction by a rotatable shaft, wherein the shaft in preferred detail embodiment is embodied as a tie rod to hold several components of the switching device arranged axially one behind the other. The switching device can hereby be dismantled easily for purposes of maintenance or the replacement of worn parts.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the switching device can be rotatably supported on the end side via a bearing member, wherein the bearing member has a rotation seal to seal the fluid. In general, a precise guidance of the switching device with the reduction of frictional forces is hereby rendered possible, wherein the rotation seal represents an additional barrier to fluid leaks, which in particular is useful with fluids harmful to health or the environment. Expediently, respectively one bearing member can be provided on opposite ends of the switching device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A rotating valve according to the invention is particularly suitable for switching a large number of inlets and outlets, so that in a preferred embodiment respectively at least four, in particular at least eight, inlets and outlets are available.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The object of the invention is also attained for a rotating valve. With this solution according to the invention of a rotating valve, through the provision of a separate seal in the end-side regions of the division walls and the sealing support thereof a particularly good sealing of the separate channels of the switching device is achieved, whereby the effectiveness and operational safety of the rotating valve is clearly improved with respect to the prior art with simple means.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The seal can have in particular a U-shaped, H-shaped or X-shaped cross section. Other suitable cross sections are also conceivable. In an embodiment, the seal can be embodied with an elastic sealing tab, which bears against the inner wall. Generally advantageously, the seal is thereby inserted positively into a groove of the division wall, whereby measures such as adhesion or other complex attachments can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Generally advantageously, in an embodiment of this type the channels for changing the position are alternately covering openings, offset in the circumferential direction and radially directed, of the inner wall of a fixed inner cylinder, wherein annular chambers separate from one another, arranged one behind the other in the axial direction are provided between the inner cylinder and an outer housing surrounding it. With this design, the connection is achieved by alternating overlapping of radially directed openings. A desired separation of the openings and channels in the course of the sweeping over can be achieved hereby in particular by a suitable design of the width of the seal in the circumferential direction. With sufficiently wide design of the seal, a connection of adjacent flow channels at any time of the circulation of the rotating switching device can thereby be prevented, wherein the average opening times for all of the flow channels are correspondingly reduced. Alternatively, a narrower seal in the circumferential direction can also be provided, wherein to avoid an unfavorable connection of adjacent flow channels, the rotating switching device is rotated in step-like switching movements that are sufficiently quick to avoid a mixture of the fluid flows.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The object of the invention is furthermore attained for a rotating valve. In this embodiment according to the invention, through the concentric annular grooves a compact, reliable and cost-effective connection of inlet channels to rotating switching channels of the switching device is achieved. This type of structural solution is expedient in particular for rotating valves with only relatively few, e.g. two to four, flow channels. Fundamentally, however, it can also be used for embodiments with more flow channels. In this solution it is also expedient that the channels for changing the position overlap with radially directed openings, offset in the circumferential direction, of the inner wall of a fixed inner cylinder, wherein annular chambers separated from one another and arranged one behind the other in the axial direction are provided between the inner cylinder and an outer housing surrounding it.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The object of the invention is attained for a heat pump. The combination of a rotating valve according to the invention with a heat pump is particularly advantageous, since through the optimization of the rotating valve with respect to tightness or size, the properties of the heat pump with respect to size or output are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The object of the invention is furthermore attained for a heat pump. Through the embodiment of the hollow elements as a respective stack of several parallel layers of sub-elements, a particularly good heat conduction between the fluid flowing around and the thermodynamically active regions of the hollow elements is guaranteed. The output of the heat pump with given installation space can be increased hereby.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first fluid in exchange with the first zone and the second fluid in exchange with the second zone are different from one another and have no connection in the circulations. Depending on the requirements, for the purposes of the invention they can also be fluids that are identical in material which can also have a connection with one another, depending on the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment of the heat pump, the hollow elements are embodied as adsorber elements, which have an adsorption/desorption region for the working fluid in the region of the first zone and in the region of the second zone have a condensation/evaporation region for the working fluid. Depending on the field of application of the heat pump, the working fluid and adsorption/desorption means can be selected to be different.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a detailed arrangement, at least one of the flow channels has end-side connection pieces, wherein the fluid is distributed in the region of the connection pieces among a plurality of flow paths. In an expedient detail arrangement, in a simple manner one or more flow paths for the fluid can be embodied by one or more gaps between sub-elements arranged on top of one another. In an arrangement, the gaps can be with surface enlarging.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, the hollow elements can be respectively embodied as separate modules, which in particular are not in thermal contact with one another. In this manner an undesirable exchange of thermal energy between adjacent flow paths is reduced. This is important in particular for those adjacent flow paths that have a high temperature difference from one another due to the current connection. In a preferred further development, a layer of a thermally insulating, in particular elastic material can thereby be arranged between adjacent hollow elements. For example, this can be a foamed plastic or a fibrous blanket insulator.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one possible embodiment of the invention, the valve arrangement can be embodied as a connection of a number of discrete multiway valves, in particular, which can be actuated electromagnetically. In particular in the case of heat pumps with a relatively small number of flow paths, a connection of this type of discrete valves can be expedient, wherein rotating valves according to the invention are advantageous in particular with an increasing number of flow paths.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, the valve arrangement comprises at least one, in particular at least two, rotating valves, since the fluid flows can be switched cost-effectively and reliably by the rotating valves according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, at least some of the flow channels of the hollow elements are connected via elastically deformable connecting pieces to the inlets and/or outlets of the rotating valve. Expansions of the heat pump caused thermally can hereby be compensated in a simple manner, which is useful in particular with large stacks of hollow elements.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment of the invention, the second fluid can be composed of air. Air can hereby be guided for the purpose of conditioning, such as, for example, heating or cooling, directly via the hollow elements in particular of the second zone. Depending on the design and mode of operation of the heat pump, the air flow can thereby the used to heat or cool, for example, a building or a vehicle. However, for the purposes of the invention the air can also be regarded quite generally as a heat transporting medium, without it being used as a conditioning ambient air, e.g., for people or technical equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment according to the invention, the rotating valve of the second fluid can have a switching device with a division wall coiled in steps, wherein in particular a number of steps of the coiling corresponds to a number of hollow elements. A switching device of this type can hereby be combined with an only single-walled surrounding cylinder, without a continuous coiling of the division walls, which is relatively expensive to produce, having to be provided. A construction of this type is desirable in particular for gaseous fluids such as air with high volume flows and at the same time small pressure differences, since measures such as, for example, annular chambers of double-walled outer cylinders could be an interference here. In the interest of a particularly simple production, the switching device is thereby embodied from a plurality of switching device elements in particular embodied as shared components arranged axially one behind the other.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a further embodiment of the invention, the second fluid can be distributed via a rotating valve with two flow channels over the two zones (B) of the hollow elements. A distribution of this type over only two channels is advantageous in particular for gaseous fluids of relatively low thermal capacity such as air, since large flow cross sections and thus large volume flows can thereby be realized with a small pressure difference.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Another embodiment of the rotating valve can have at least one inlet of the plurality of inlets connected to an associated outlet in a first heat exchanger allocation, in particular via a first heat exchanger, such as a heater. The heat exchanger is preferably a heat source that is arranged outside the rotating valve. At least one further inlet of the plurality of inlets is connected to an associated outlet in a second heat exchanger allocation, in particular via a second heat exchanger, such as a cooler. The second heat exchanger is preferably a heat sink, which is likewise arranged outside the rotating valve. The other inlets of the plurality of inlets are connected to associated outlets in a passage allocation, in particular via respective one through channel, with associated outlets. The rotating valve described above can replace two rotating valves controlled in phase, such as are described above. The number of seals required can be clearly reduced thereby. Furthermore, the friction moments occurring during the operation of the rotating valve can be reduced. The rotating valve described above requires less installation space than the rotating valves described therebefore, which, assembled in pairs, fulfill the same function as a single rotating valve described above. The material used to produce a rotating valve of this type is likewise reduced. Furthermore, long internal parallel fluid paths, which lead to undesirable pressure losses, as well as inner heat transfers can be reduced. Furthermore, a synchronous operation in phase of several rotating valves, which requires a high expenditure in terms of control engineering, can be omitted. The rotating valve according to the invention makes it possible in a simple manner to connect associated inlets and outlets directly to one another in a stepwise manner or via one of the two heat exchangers. The production costs of the rotating valve can be reduced substantially thereby. Furthermore, a more compact flat arrangement of the overall apparatus is rendered possible.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Another exemplary embodiment of the rotating valve is characterized in that the switching device has a rotating member with a plurality of through channels, which connect the other inlets in the through allocation with the associated outlets. The rotating valve described renders possible in a simple manner the control of a closed fluid circulation through a plurality of thermally active modules either via one of the heat exchangers, in particular a heat source and a heat sink, or via one of the through channels in the manner of a bypass past the heat exchangers. The location of the interconnection of the heat exchangers between respectively two thermally active modules can be shifted in a stepwise manner by a movement of the rotating member.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another exemplary embodiment of the rotating valve is characterized in that the through channels extend in the axial direction through the rotating member. The through channels extend preferably in a straight line through the rotating member.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another exemplary embodiment of the rotating valve is characterized in that several, in particular four, annular chambers extend around the rotating member, which chambers are connected to respectively one of the inlets and/or one of the outlets depending on the position of the rotating member. The annular chambers are limited on the radial inside by the rotating member and on the radial outside by a housing of the rotating valve. In the axial direction, the annular chambers are preferably delimited by radial limiting walls which extend from the rotating member radially outwards.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Another embodiment of the rotating valve is characterized in that respectively two of the annular chambers are connected to one another in pairs via one of the heat exchangers. The associated fluid channel runs from one of the inlets via one of the annular chambers to one of the heat exchangers. From the heat exchanger the fluid channel then runs via the associated next annular chamber to the associated outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another embodiment of the rotating valve is characterized in that the annular chambers are connected in pairs to one of the inlets or one of the outlets via radial openings and a connecting channel uninterrupted in the axial direction. The connecting channels are interrupted in that they connect an associated inlet via one of the heat exchangers to the associated outlet. In comparison, the through channels represent bypasses, which render possible a fluid flow past the heat exchangers, that is, directly between an inlet and the associated outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A further exemplary embodiment of the rotating valve is characterized in that the rotating member is embodied and rotatable in a stepwise manner in a stationary housing such that the inlets are successively connected to the associated outlets via various through channels or the annular chambers and one of the heat exchangers. It is thereby rendered possible in a simple manner for two inlets to always be connected via respectively one of the heat exchangers to the associated outlet. The other inlets are directly connected to the associated outlets via the through channels.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another exemplary embodiment of the rotating valve is characterized in that the housing has essentially the form of a hollow circular cylinder. The jacket of the hollow circular cylinder is preferably interrupted only by connecting channels that connect the annular chambers to the associated heat exchangers. The inlets and outlets preferably extend through the otherwise closed front walls of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Another exemplary embodiment of the rotating valve is characterized in that the rotating member comprises a plurality of longitudinal body elements stacked in the axial direction. The longitudinal body elements can be stacked, for example, on a drive shaft, which extends through the rotating valve. The longitudinal body elements can be connected to one another by adhesive force, for example, by welding or adhesion. However, it is also possible to brace the longitudinal body elements with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Another exemplary embodiment of the rotating valve is characterized in that at least some of the longitudinal body elements are embodied as shared components. The production and/or installability of the rotating valve are simplified thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a heat pump in which a plurality of, in this case, a total of twelve hollow elements <b>1</b> are arranged parallel to one another in the manner of a stack. The stack of hollow elements <b>1</b> is connected in a detachable manner to a structural unit via a tie rod <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Each of the hollow elements <b>1</b> has a first zone A in the form of an adsorption/desorption zone and a second zone B in the form of an evaporation/condensation zone. The first zone A for each of the hollow elements <b>1</b> is penetrated by a respectively first flow channel <b>3</b> of a first fluid flowing around, conveyed by a pump (not shown), and the second zone B is penetrated for each of the hollow elements <b>1</b> by a second flow channel <b>4</b> of a second fluid, which is different from the first fluid in the present example, but does not need to be so. Each of the flow channels <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> has thereby front face connections <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, which lie opposite to one another and respectively serve as inlets or outlets from the fluid flowing through the flow channels <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The stack of hollow elements <b>1</b> held together by the tie rod <b>2</b> is arranged in a support frame <b>5</b> of the heat pump. On the outside of the support frame <b>5</b> a total of four rotating valves are arranged and connected to the stack of hollow elements <b>1</b>, wherein two essentially identically constructed rotating valves <b>6</b> are connected to the inlets and outlets <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the sorption side A. Two of these rotating valves <b>7</b> designed in general differently in particular with respect to the number of flow channels separated in the valve but identical to one another in terms of structure are connected to the second zone or the evaporation/condensation side B of the hollow elements <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The rotating valves <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are all aligned parallel to one another, wherein central rotary shafts <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the rotating valves <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are connected to a modular drive unit <b>8</b>, which is shown diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The drive unit <b>8</b> comprises an electric motor <b>8</b><i>a</i>, through which four drive wheels <b>8</b><i>c </i>for driving the respective axes <b>7</b><i>a</i>, <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the rotating valves <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are moved in a synchronized manner via a cam belt <b>8</b><i>b</i>. In the present construction, all of the rotating valves <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are driven with, the same angular velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The rotating valves <b>6</b> of the sorption side A of the hollow elements <b>1</b> have an inlet region <b>6</b><i>b</i>, which has twelve separate inlets <b>6</b><i>c</i>, so that each of the twelve hollow elements <b>1</b> corresponds to a separate channel inside the rotating valve <b>6</b>. The rotating valves <b>7</b> of the evaporator side B have a smaller number of only four separate inlets <b>7</b><i>c </i>in an inlet region <b>7</b><i>b</i>, since on this side of the heat pump such a strongly differentiated separation of the flow channels is not necessary as on the sorption side as a rule. Accordingly, respectively several of the hollow elements <b>1</b> are simultaneously connected with respect to their second zone B to respectively one of the flow channels in the valves <b>7</b>. To this end, we refer to the explanations in the prior art WO 2007/068481.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The adjacent hollow elements <b>1</b> are held spaced apart from one another, which in this case is achieved through suitable spacer pieces <b>9</b> between the hollow elements. Respectively one air gap thus remains between the hollow elements <b>1</b> so that they are thermally well insulated from one another. For the further improvement of the thermal insulation, batts <b>43</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) e.g., of foamed polymer or fibrous insulating materials can be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The individual connections <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the hollow elements <b>1</b> are connected to corresponding connections <b>6</b><i>d</i>, <b>7</b><i>d </i>of the rotating valves <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, which extend respectively aligned in a row radially from the walls of a removal region of the essentially cylindrically shaped rotating valves. To compensate for expansions of the heat pump caused thermally, the connections <b>7</b><i>d</i>, <b>6</b><i>d </i>of the rotating valves <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are connected to the connections <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>of the stack of hollow elements <b>1</b> via elastic connecting pieces, e.g., hose pieces or corrugated bellows.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As can be seen in particular from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the individual hollow elements <b>1</b> to optimize the heat exchange with the fluid are respectively embodied as a stack of sub-elements <b>10</b>, which are respectively flowed around by the fluid. Each of the sub-elements <b>10</b> is embodied as a plate-like flat element, in which several adsorber elements <b>11</b> are arranged next to one another in the flow direction of the fluid and are separated from one another in a substance-tight manner via webs <b>12</b> perpendicular with respect to the fluid flow direction. The adsorber elements <b>11</b> are arranged predominantly in the region of the first zone A (see representation according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), wherein evaporation/condensation structures likewise separated from one another by the webs <b>12</b> are arranged in zone B. These structures (not shown) can be composed, e.g., of capillary structures, which can hold a sufficient quantity of a working fluid in the liquid phase. The adsorber elements <b>11</b> are composed in the current exemplary embodiment of activated carbon, wherein the working fluid is methanol. Depending on the temperature range and target use of the heat pump, any combinations of adsorption material, working fluid and embodiment of the evaporator region are conceivable. In principle, a heat pump according to the invention is not limited to the adsorption/desorption principle either, any suitable thermodynamically active hollow elements <b>1</b> can be provided, for example hollow elements acting in a chemisorptive manner.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Each of the sub-elements <b>10</b> is formed as a plate element closed in substance-tight manner by means of cover plates <b>10</b><i>a</i>. These closed elements <b>10</b> are stacked via small spacer pieces <b>14</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) spaced apart from one another and held spaced apart from outer closing plates <b>13</b> of the hollow elements. In each of the hollow elements <b>1</b>, which in this case are stacked of respectively three sub-elements <b>10</b>, are thus located four flat flow through paths <b>14</b> for the fluid. These flow through paths <b>14</b> are further divided by spacer pieces <b>14</b><i>a </i>extending continuously in the fluid flow direction. In order to further reduce the components, the spacer pieces <b>14</b><i>a </i>can also be embossings in the cover plates <b>10</b><i>a </i>and/or closing plates <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Furthermore, the flow through paths <b>14</b> can be equipped with area-enlarging structures (not shown) such as, for example, ribs.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the end-side connecting regions of the hollow elements <b>1</b> for the fluid, connecting pieces <b>15</b> are provided, which distribute the fluid in the manner of a supplying accumulator or scoop among the several flow through regions <b>14</b> between the sub-elements <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Respectively one filler tube <b>16</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) projects laterally from each of the chambers of the sub-elements <b>10</b> hermetically separated by the cover plates <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the webs <b>12</b>, via which filler tube the individual chambers can be evacuated and filled with working fluid. After the filling, the filler tubes <b>16</b> are permanently closed, e.g., by squeezing. In order to simplify the filling operation, a filler tube <b>16</b> is arranged on each of the opposite front sides of a respectively hermetically separated chamber, so that the chambers can be flowed through by the working fluid in their longitudinal direction, i.e., perpendicular to the flow direction of the fluid. In the course of the filling operation, on one side a vacuum can thus be applied and on the opposite side the working medium can be fed via the corresponding filler tube.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Overall through this modular structure of the heat pump from separate hollow elements <b>1</b> with sub-elements <b>10</b>, not only is the thermal efficiency improved by thermal insulation of the separate hollow elements, but a construction that is easy to maintain is also created in which only one defective hollow element and not the entire stack of hollow elements needs to be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The rotating valves <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> shown diagrammatically in the views of the heat pump according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> correspond in their structure to the prior art in that the alternating connection of the various flow channels is carried out via radially directed division walls in connection with annular chambers adjoining thereto in double-walled cylinders</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The division walls form in connection with the openings of the cylinder walls a switching region of the rotating valve.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a further development according to the invention of a rotating valve of this type which in a particularly preferred embodiment can be directly combined with the heat pump described above and which has advantages, among other things, with respect to a smaller installation size a simpler producibility and a better sealing of the separate channels.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A rotatably driven switching device <b>16</b> is thereby arranged in an only single-walled hollow cylinder <b>17</b>, which has the equidistant connecting openings <b>17</b><i>a </i>arranged in a straight row to connect to the connections <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the stack of hollow elements <b>1</b>. The switching device <b>16</b> is shown separately in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This is an element embodied as an essentially cylindrical longitudinal body, which can be rotated about a central shaft or axis <b>18</b>. The switching device <b>16</b> has in its circumferential direction a number of axial, parallel bores <b>16</b><i>a</i>, the number of which in this case is twelve and corresponds to the number of hollow elements or separate flow channels connected alternately. A row of in this case annular, peripheral radial projections <b>16</b><i>b </i>are provided over the length of the switching device <b>16</b> embodied as a cylindrical longitudinal body. The projections <b>16</b><i>b </i>are embodied in pairs, so that between a pair of projections a ring seal (not shown) is held in a positive manner. Overall sealing members to embody equidistant annular chambers <b>16</b><i>c </i>are hereby formed, which are separated from one anther in a fluid-tight manner by the sealing rings. Each of the annular chambers <b>16</b><i>c </i>has a bore <b>16</b><i>d </i>directed radially with respect to the fluid flow, which bore opens in respectively exactly one of the axial channels <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The radial bores <b>16</b><i>d </i>are accordingly arranged offset to one another in the circumferential direction so that they form a continuous spiral with the pitch <b>1</b>. In all, thus each of the front axially opening channel bores <b>16</b><i>a </i>is radially connected to precisely one annular chamber <b>16</b><i>c</i>. Each of the annular chambers <b>16</b><i>c </i>is thereby aligned in a fluid-tight manner sealed against the other annular chambers with one of the connecting openings <b>17</b><i>a </i>to the stack of hollow elements <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, the front axial openings of the channels <b>16</b><i>a </i>sweep over corresponding axially directed opening bores <b>19</b><i>a </i>of a control disk <b>19</b>, which is placed on the rotating valve, closing the front face, and is connected in a stationary and sealing manner to the outer cylinder <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the course of a rotation of the switching device <b>16</b>, the individual axial channels <b>16</b><i>a </i>are thus aligned in the manner of axial openings moved therewith alternately with the various stationary, axially directed inlet openings <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the control disk <b>19</b>. In this embodiment the control disk <b>19</b> forms an inlet region as defined by the invention and at the same time is a part of the switching region of the rotating valve.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In order to reduce or completely avoid an undesirable fluid exchange of adjacent channels in the region of this switching transition of the openings <b>19</b><i>a </i>to the openings <b>16</b><i>a</i>, a star-shaped sealing element <b>20</b> is inserted between the control disk <b>19</b> and the front face of the switching device <b>16</b>. The star-shaped fingers <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the sealing element <b>20</b> thereby engage in radial grooves <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the front face of the switching device <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A system of connecting hoses (not shown) is connected to the inlet openings <b>19</b><i>a </i>of the control disk <b>19</b> and leads on the other side according to the basic concept of the heat pump to other openings <b>19</b><i>a </i>or also to an outer heat exchanger. To connect to outer heat exchanger or heat sources in general we refer to the prior art WO 2007/068481 A1.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a modification of the switching device <b>16</b> identical in terms of function to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The switching device <b>16</b> is thereby embodied as a stack of longitudinal body elements <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) as well as an end piece <b>22</b> embodied in a different manner. At least some of the longitudinal body elements <b>21</b> are thereby identical in structure and placed rotated to one another by a fractional angle according to the number of channels. For the further simplification of a structure of this type, a positive receptacle <b>23</b> in the longitudinal body elements <b>21</b> is provided for the positive connection to a central drive shaft, wherein the receptacles <b>23</b> has a symmetry corresponding to the number of channels. In this case, the receptacle <b>23</b> has a rotational symmetry divided only six-fold, so that two longitudinal body elements <b>21</b> that are different with respect to the positioning of the radial opening <b>16</b><i>d </i>relative to the receptacle <b>23</b> are used alternately to compose the entire stack of twelve longitudinal body elements.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">One variant is not shown in which the shaft and receptacle have a symmetry divided 12-fold, wherein only one type of longitudinal element is then required.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the present case the rotating valves <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are produced from a sufficiently temperature-resistant plastic, wherein the stack of hollow elements <b>1</b> is essentially composed of metal sheets with respect to its walls and connections. In particular the use of postreticulated thermoplastics is recommended as a plastic for the structure of the rotating valves <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Through the construction described above of the switching device <b>16</b>, a change of the connection of the flow channels by overlapping with respect to the fluid flow of axially directed openings is achieved, whereby the construction length is substantially reduced and the number and shaping of the components are reduced or simplified. In particular, a double-walled cylinder with annular chambers embodied between the fixed cylinder walls in the region of the connections with the stack of hollow elements <b>1</b>, as in the prior art, can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> show embodiments and modifications of a rotating valve with a switching device <b>24</b> with radial division walls. The channels separated by the division walls <b>25</b> extending radially are thereby moved via an inner cylinder with bores <b>26</b> offset in the circumferential direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) so that the channels in the course of the movement of the division walls <b>25</b> respectively overlap successively with various openings <b>26</b>. Each of the bores <b>26</b> thereby opens into an annular chamber <b>29</b> embodied between the stationary inner cylinder <b>27</b> and a stationary outer cylinder <b>28</b>. In the outer cylinder <b>28</b>, connections <b>30</b> arranged equidistantly are thereby provided in a straight row to connect to the stack of hollow elements <b>1</b>. The switching operation for the alternating connecting of the flow channels is carried out in an embodiment of this type by the division walls <b>25</b> sweeping over the openings <b>26</b> embodied in a radial manner with respect to the fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">For an embodiment of this type of a rotating valve, a number of improvements according to the invention compared to the prior art are explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> thereby shows an arrangement of the switching device <b>24</b> of a rotating valve of this type together with an inlet region <b>31</b>, which in its design is formed in a similar manner to the switching device <b>16</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, but here does not take over the function of a switching device, since no change of the positions of the flow channels takes place in the inlet region. The inlet region <b>31</b> and the switching device <b>24</b> are connected to one another as separate components rotationally fixed via a shaft <b>18</b> penetrating them both in the manner of a tie rod by means of a self-locking bolt <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The division walls <b>25</b> extending radially in a star-shaped manner have in their radial end regions advantageously elastically arranged sealing means <b>33</b> in the manner of axially extending sealing strips. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment in which the sealing strips <b>33</b> have a U-shaped cross section, wherein an additional elastic element <b>34</b> is inserted between the front face of the division wall <b>25</b> and the sealing means <b>33</b>. A particularly good seal of the individual axial channels with respect to one another is hereby achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A modification of a sealing strip of this type on the radial end regions of the division walls <b>25</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The seal <b>33</b> is thereby embodied in the manner of a sealing lip brushing over the inner wall, which sealing lip is inserted positively via a bead-like thickening <b>35</b> into a corresponding front groove of the division wall <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Another advantageous further development is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in which the central shaft <b>18</b> of the switching device <b>24</b> is supported on at least one end of the rotating valve in a bearing bushing <b>36</b>, which furthermore has a rotation seal <b>37</b>. The rotation seal <b>37</b> additionally seals any possible leaks of fluid with respect to the outer area.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Another exemplary embodiment of a rotating valve according to the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>. Also with this valve the connection of the flow paths is carried out by means of radially directed division walls <b>25</b> and radially directed openings in the wall of an inner cylinder <b>27</b>, which open into annular chambers of an outer cylinder (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In contrast to the embodiment, e.g., according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the inlet region of the fluid flows to the axial chambers divided by the division walls <b>25</b> is designed in a simple and compact manner. This is achieved in that each of the axially longitudinally directed chambers of the switching device separated by the division walls <b>25</b> is connected by respective one bore <b>38</b> to respectively one different concentric annular groove <b>39</b>, wherein each of the annular grooves <b>39</b> is located in one plane with the other annular grooves <b>39</b>, but has a different diameter. In the present exemplary embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, only two annular grooves <b>39</b> are shown for corresponding alternating switching of only two flow paths. More than two concentric annular grooves can also be provided, wherein in general a particularly high number of flow paths, such as, e.g., twelve flow paths as in the exemplary embodiments described above, are structurally increasingly complex. A rotating valve of this type, however, is very well suited for use, e.g., for the connection of the evaporator/condenser region of a heat pump explained above, since there usually only a few, e.g., two or four separate flow paths are switched.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The connection of annular grooves <b>39</b> of the switching device with outer inlets of the fluid flows is carried out via bores <b>40</b> in an inlet plate <b>41</b> connected in a stationary manner to the cylinder. Each of the bores <b>40</b> thereby opens into precisely one of the annular grooves <b>39</b>, so that, according to the representation <b>17</b>, each of the openings <b>40</b> of the inlet plate <b>41</b>, regardless of the turn position of the switching device, is connected to precisely one of the axial chambers of the switching device formed by the axial division walls <b>25</b>. To ensure the fluid-tight separation of the annular grooves, O-ring seals <b>42</b> are respectively provided between the inlet plate <b>41</b> and the walls of the annular grooves <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the drawings <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> the outer cylinder with its annular chambers surrounding the inner cylinder <b>27</b> is not shown for reasons of clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows diagrammatically the switching function of a rotating valve with seven alternately switched flow paths or fluid flows. Three switch positions A, B, C are shown, wherein position C is transferred into position A again after a further step. On the inlet side respectively the numbering of the fluid flows <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> is found, and on the outlet side the numbering of the hollow elements <b>1</b>-<b>7</b>. After seven changes of the position or a full rotation of the rotating valve, the original connection is reached again.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The exemplary embodiment of a rotating valve <b>7</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> for combination with a heat pump according to the invention has only two chambers or flow channels <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> and is particularly suitable to be combined with air as a second fluid for the exchange of heat with the second zones B of the hollow elements <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The rotating valve <b>7</b> of this exemplary embodiment has an only single-walled outer cylinder <b>47</b>, which has radial openings <b>48</b> arranged in a straight row for connection to the hollow elements <b>1</b>. A rotating switching device <b>24</b> accommodated in the cylinder <b>47</b> comprises a hub or shaft <b>46</b>, from which two division walls <b>25</b> extend radially to the cylinder wall. In contrast to the exemplary embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the division walls <b>25</b> are not straight in the axial direction nor, as known from the prior art WO 2007/068481 A1, embodied in a continuously coiled manner. Instead the division walls <b>25</b> are coiled in a stepwise manner, as shown in particular in the uncoiled representations according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The stepwise coiling of the division walls <b>25</b> of the switching device <b>24</b> renders possible a simple structure of several switching device parts <b>49</b>, <b>50</b> arranged axially one behind the other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> thereby shows a switching device <b>49</b>, as is provided in the center region as a repetition of shared parts, which respectively are arranged offset to one another by a specific number of degrees. The switching device parts <b>49</b> have flat division wall sections <b>49</b><i>a </i>extending parallel to the rotation axis as well as cover sectors <b>49</b><i>b</i>, of in the current example an opening angle of 30&#xb0;, extending perpendicular to the rotation axis and adjoining the division wall segments <b>49</b><i>a</i>, by means of which in total the stepwise coiled chambers or flow channels <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> of the switching device <b>24</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The switching device parts <b>50</b> arranged on the end and forming closing pieces have an individual cover sector <b>50</b><i>b </i>with an opening angle of 180&#xb0;, wherein these 180&#xb0; cover sectors are arranged inversely to one another at the opposite ends of the switching device <b>24</b>. An outer inlet and an outer outlet to the chambers <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> are hereby formed in a simple manner, since the fluid (in this case, air) can be fed only at the one front face of the outer cylinder <b>47</b> and discharged at the opposite front face (see also the uncoiled representation according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). Depending on the current operating condition of the hollow elements of the second zone B, the fed air can thereby be referred to as evaporator air or as condensation air.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">A further preferred detail of the rotating valve, which however is not necessary for the basic principle, lies in a cover tab <b>51</b> provided on the radial end side of the division wall sections <b>25</b>, <b>49</b> and following the curvature of the cylinder <b>47</b>. The opening angle of the cover tab <b>51</b> is approximately as large as the opening angle of the openings <b>48</b> of the cylinder wall, so that in one position (see representation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) respectively individual or, with a corresponding design, also several of the hollow elements <b>1</b> are closed with respect to the second zone B. In operation this represents an adiabatic intermediate step of the connections of the flow paths, whereby the effectiveness of the heat pump can be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the present example, twelve hollow elements <b>1</b> are available, so that in total twelve switching device parts <b>49</b>, <b>50</b>, aligned rotated by respectively 30&#xb0; to one another, are combined to form a switching device <b>24</b>. However, deviating stages with a given number of hollow elements are also conceivable without the function of the rotating valve being substantially affected.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows the switching function of a rotating valve <b>100</b> according to a further exemplary embodiment as a two-dimensional diagram. The rotating valve <b>100</b> comprises a plurality of inlets <b>101</b> to <b>112</b> and outlets <b>201</b> through <b>212</b>, which can be individually assigned to the inlets <b>101</b> through <b>112</b> via connecting lines <b>126</b> or <b>128</b> and <b>129</b>. The inlets and outlets are connected, e.g., to thermally active modules <b>301</b> through <b>312</b>. The rotating valve <b>100</b> comprises a switching device <b>114</b>, which in turn comprises a rotating body <b>115</b>, which is rotatable, as indicated by an arrow <b>116</b>. In the rotating body <b>115</b> a first heat exchanger is shown in the form of a cooler <b>118</b>, to which a pump <b>119</b> is connected downstream. A second heat exchanger is embodied as a heater <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The rotating valve <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is used to control the through flow of twelve thermally active modules, as described above based on the exemplary embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 24</figref>, with a heat transfer fluid. With the rotating valve <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the twelve thermally active modules <b>301</b> through <b>312</b> can be flowed through in series by a heat transfer fluid. The heat source, in particular the heater <b>120</b>, and the heat sink, in particular the recooler <b>118</b> are switched between respectively two of the modules. The rotating valve <b>100</b> has the function of shifting the location of the interconnection of the heater <b>120</b> and the recooler <b>118</b> in a stepwise manner without this having to be rotated too, as would be necessary with a direct conversion of the diagrammatic switching. Deviating from the representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the cooler <b>118</b>, the pump <b>119</b> and the heater <b>120</b> are therefore arranged in a stationary manner outside the rotating valve <b>100</b> in the following figures of an exemplary structural conversion.</p>

Analogously, the rotating valve <b>100</b> comprises twelve outlets <b>201</b> through <b>212</b>, which can also be referred to as exits, and are combined to form an outlet region <b>82</b>. The inlets <b>101</b> through <b>112</b> can be connected with the aid of the switching device <b>114</b>, which comprises the rotating body <b>115</b>, in a different manner to the outlets <b>201</b> through <b>212</b> when the rotating body <b>115</b> rotates in the direction of the arrow <b>116</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref> the cooler <b>118</b> and the heater <b>120</b> are arranged outside a housing <b>125</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The rotating valve <b>100</b> has, among other things, the following advantages: high integration of switching function replaces two conventional rotating valves; reduced expenditure for drive and control; compact, material-saving design; simple, cost-effective producibility, for example of plastic injection molded parts; easily realized, wear-resistant area seal via ceramic disks or ceramic plates <b>151</b>, <b>152</b>; short flow paths with low heat exchange between the individual flow paths; low friction and necessary input torque; low bypass losses.</p>
