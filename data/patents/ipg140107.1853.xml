<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method is disclosed for making incisions in the sclera of an eye to form a scleral pocket to receive a scleral prosthesis. The system and method comprises a surgical tool comprising a surgical blade for making incisions in the sclera of an eye. When a surgeon places the surgical blade on the sclera of the eye a pressure sensor in the surgical tool determines whether there is sufficient pressure between the surgical tool and the sclera of the eye for the surgical tool to operate properly. The surgeon activates the surgical tool to cause the surgical blade to advance through the sclera to form an incision having dimensions to receive a scleral prosthesis. When the incision is complete the surgical blade is rotated back out of the incision. The incision has the exact dimensions to receive a scleral prosthesis.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0012">The present invention relates generally to the treatment of presbyopia, hyperopia, primary open angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension and other similar eye disorders. The present invention comprises a system and method for making incisions within the sclera of an eye for the eye to receive a scleral prosthesis. Scleral prostheses are capable of increasing the amplitude of accommodation of the eye by increasing the effective working range of the ciliary muscle of the eye.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0013">In order for the human eye to have clear vision of objects at different distances, the effective focal length of the eye must be adjusted to keep the image of the object focused as sharply as possible on the retina. This change in effective focal length is known as accommodation and is accomplished in the eye by varying the shape of the crystalline lens. Generally, in the unaccommodated emmetropic eye the curvature of the lens is such that distant objects are sharply imaged on the retina. In the unaccommodated eye near objects are not focused sharply on the retina because their images lie behind the retinal surface. In order to visualize a near object clearly, the curvature of the crystalline lens is increased, thereby increasing its refractive power and causing the image of the near object to fall on the retina.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0014">The change in shape of the crystalline lens is accomplished by the action of certain muscles and structures within the eyeball or globe of the eye. The lens is located in the forward part of the eye, immediately behind the pupil. It has the shape of a classical biconvex optical lens, i.e., it has a generally circular cross section having two convex refracting surfaces, and is located generally on the optical axis of the eye, i.e., a straight line drawn from the center of the cornea to the macula in the retina at the posterior portion of the globe. In the unaccommodated human eye the curvature of the posterior surface of the lens, i.e., the surface adjacent to the vitreous body, is somewhat greater than that of the anterior surface. The lens is closely surrounded by a membranous capsule that serves as an intermediate structure in the support and actuation of the lens. The lens and its capsule are suspended on the optical axis behind the pupil by a circular assembly of very many radially directed elastic fibers, the zonules, which are attached at their inner ends to the, lens capsule and at their outer ends to the ciliary body and indirectly to the ciliary muscle, a muscular ring of tissue, located just within the outer supporting structure of the eye, the sclera. The ciliary muscle is relaxed in the unaccommodated eye and therefore assumes its largest diameter. According to the classical theory of accommodation, originating with Helmholtz, the relatively large diameter of the ciliary muscle in this condition causes a tension on the zonules which in turn pulls radially outward on the lens capsule, causing the equatorial diameter of the lens to increase slightly and decreasing the anterior-posterior dimension of the lens at the optical axis. Thus, the tension on the lens capsule causes the lens to assume a flattened state wherein the curvature of the anterior surface, and to some extent the posterior surface, is less than it would be in the absence of the tension. In this state the refractive power of the lens is relatively low and the eye is focused for clear vision for distant objects.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0015">When the eye is intended to be focused on a near object, the ciliary muscles contract. According to the classical theory, this contraction causes the ciliary muscle to move forward and inward, thereby relaxing the outward pull of the zonules on the equator of the lens capsule. This reduced zonular tension allows the elastic capsule of the lens to contract causing an increase in the anterior-posterior diameter of the lens (i.e., the lens becomes more spherical) resulting in an increase in the optical power of the lens. Because of topographical differences in the thickness of the lens capsule, the central anterior radius of curvature decreases more than the central posterior radius of curvature. This is the accommodated condition of the eye wherein the image of near objects falls sharply on the retina.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0016">Presbyopia is the universal decrease in the amplitude of accommodation that is typically observed in individuals over forty years of age. In the person having normal vision, i.e., having emmetropic eyes, the ability to focus on near objects is gradually lost, and the individual comes to need glasses for tasks requiring near vision, such as reading.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0017">According to the conventional view the amplitude of accommodation of the aging eye is decreased because of the loss of elasticity of the lens capsule and/or sclerosis of the lens with age. Consequently, even though the radial tension on the zonules is relaxed by contraction of the ciliary muscles, the lens does not assume a greater curvature. According to the conventional view, it is not possible by any treatment to restore the accommodative power to the presbyopic eye. The loss of elasticity of the lens and capsule is seen as irreversible, and the only solution to the problems presented by presbyopia is to use corrective lenses for close work, or bifocal lenses, if corrective lenses are also required for distant vision.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0018">Contrary to the conventional view, it is possible to restore the accommodative power to a presbyopic eye by implanting a plurality of scleral prostheses within the sclera of the eye. For each individual scleral prosthesis an incision is made in the sclera of the globe of the eye near the plane of the equator of the crystalline lens. The incision is then extended under the surface of the sclera to form a scleral &#x201c;pocket.&#x201d; The scleral prosthesis is then placed within the pocket. A typical scleral prosthesis comprises a generally rectangularly shaped bar approximately five millimeters (5.0 mm) long, one and one half millimeters (1.5 mm) wide, and one millimeter (1.0 mm) tall. The anterior edge of the scleral prosthesis applies an outward force on the anterior edge of the scleral pocket which elevates the anterior portion of the sclera attached thereto and the ciliary body immediately beneath the sclera to increase the working distance of the ciliary muscle. This method is described more fully in the A Presbyopia and Related Eye Disorder Patent Documents that have been incorporated by reference into this patent document.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0019">A physician who makes the incisions to form a scleral pocket must be a very skilled surgeon. The surgeon must use great care to ensure that the incisions are made properly. The incisions that must be made to form a scleral pocket are quite small. The incisions must be made at precisely the correct depth. The width and length of the scleral pocket must also be formed by precise incisions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0020">It is well known that physicians may differ significantly with respect to the level of surgical skill that they possess. Physicians who practice surgery regularly generally become quite skilled. Other physicians who do not practice surgery regularly are less skilled. Even skilled surgeons may find it difficult to make the precise incisions that are required to correctly form a scleral pocket.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0021">If scleral pocket incisions are not made with sufficient precision the resulting scleral pocket will not be able to correctly support a scleral prosthesis. An incorrectly supported scleral prosthesis is not able to provide an acceptable level of vision correction.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0022">It would be desirable if a system and method existed that would allow a surgeon to make the precise incisions that are required to form a scleral pocket. Accordingly, a need exists in the art for a system and method that is capable of making the precise incisions within the sclera of an eye to form a scleral pocket to receive a scleral prosthesis.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0023">The system and method of the present invention comprises a surgical tool that is capable of making incisions within the sclera of an eye to form a scleral pocket to receive a scleral prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0024">An advantageous embodiment of the surgical tool of the present invention comprises a base housing and a drive shaft housing. The base housing of the surgical tool receives electrical power and control signals from an external surgical tool controller. The drive shaft housing comprises a blade mount housing that is mounted on the drive shaft housing at an angle to a central axis of the drive shaft housing. A surgical blade for making incisions in the sclera of an eye is mounted on the blade mount housing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0025">A surgeon,positions the surgical blade of the surgical tool over the sclera of an eye by aligning an external reference line on the blade mount housing with the limbus of the eye. The surgeon then places the blade mount housing on the sclera of the eye. A pressure sensor determines when there is sufficient pressure between the surgical tool and the sclera of the eye for the surgical tool to operate properly. When the pressure sensor detects sufficient pressure the surgical tool may be activated. The surgeon sends an activation signal to the surgical tool to cause the surgical blade to advance through the sclera to form an incision having dimensions to receive a scleral prosthesis. The sclera of the eye and the surgical tool are restrained from moving while the surgical blade is moved through the sclera to make an incision. When the incision is complete the surgical blade is moved back out of the incision. The incision then has the exact dimensions to receive a scleral prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0026">It is an object of the invention to provide a surgical tool that is capable of making precise incisions in the sclera of an eye to create a scleral pocket that has exact dimensions to receive a scleral prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0027">It is an additional object of the invention to provide a surgical tool controller for controlling the operation of a surgical blade of a surgical tool for making incisions in the sclera of an eye to create a scleral pocket.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0028">It is yet another object of the invention to provide an improved surgical blade for making incisions in the sclera of an eye to create a scleral pocket.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0029">It is also another object of the present invention to provide an improved blade guide for guiding the motion of a surgical blade in the surgical tool of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0030">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a scleral tissue fixation tool that is capable of restraining the movement of the sclera of the eye away from the surgical blade of the surgical tool of the present invention when an incision is being made in the sclera of the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0031">It is another object of the present invention to provide a vacuum operated blade guide that is capable of restraining the movement of the sclera of the eye away from the surgical blade of the surgical tool of the present invention by applying a vacuum to the surface of the sclera of the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0032">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an improved surgical blade of the surgical tool of the present invention that is capable of implanting a scleral prosthesis in a scleral pocket of an eye.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0033">Additional objects of the present invention will become apparent from the description of the invention that follows.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0034">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the Detailed Description of the Invention that follows. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject matter of the claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they may readily use the conception and the specific embodiment disclosed as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 48</figref>, discussed below, and the various embodiments used to describe the principles of the present invention in this patent document are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in any way to limit the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present invention may be implemented in any suitably arranged surgical tool and with any suitable surgical method.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0085">The system and method of the present invention comprise a surgical tool that is capable of making incisions in the sclera of an eye in order for the eye to receive a scleral prosthesis. Scleral prostheses are used to treat presbyopia (and other similar eye disorders) by increasing the effective working distance of the ciliary muscle of the eye. This is accomplished by increasing the distance between the ciliary muscle and the lens equator by increasing the diameter of the sclera in the region of the ciliary body.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0086">The effective working distance of the ciliary muscle is increased by implanting in pockets surgically formed in the sclera of the eye a plurality of scleral prostheses designed to place an outward traction on the sclera in the region of the ciliary body. The relevant anatomy of the eye for locating the scleral pockets may be seen by reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The outermost layer of the eye <b>100</b> comprises the white, tough sclera <b>102</b> which encompasses most of the globe and the transparent cornea <b>104</b>, which constitutes the anterior segment of the outer coat. The circular junction of the cornea and sclera is the limbus <b>106</b>. Within the globe of the eye, as illustrated in the cross-section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the crystalline lens <b>108</b> is enclosed in a thin membranous capsule and is located immediately posterior to the iris <b>112</b>, suspended centrally posterior to the pupil <b>114</b> on the optical axis of the eye. The lens <b>108</b> is suspended by zonules <b>115</b> extending between the lens capsule at the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b> and the ciliary body <b>116</b>. The ciliary body <b>116</b> lies just under the sclera <b>102</b> (i.e., just inwardly of the sclera <b>102</b>) and is attached to the inner surface of the sclera <b>102</b>. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ciliary body <b>116</b> lies generally in a plane <b>130</b> defined by the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b>. The plane <b>130</b> can also be extended to intersect the sclera <b>102</b> whereby it forms a generally circular intersection located about two (2) millimeters posterior to the limbus <b>106</b>. The external muscles <b>118</b> of the eyeball control the movement of the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0087">A generally outwardly directed traction is exerted on the sclera in the region of the ciliary body to expand the sclera <b>102</b> in that region. This expansion of the sclera <b>102</b> produces a corresponding expansion of the attached ciliary body <b>116</b> and moves the ciliary body <b>116</b> outwardly away from the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b>, generally in the plane <b>130</b> of the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b>. The sclera <b>102</b> is preferably expanded approximately in the plane of the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b>. However, any expansion of the sclera <b>102</b> in the region of the ciliary body <b>116</b>, i.e., in the region of the sclera somewhat anterior or posterior to the plane of the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b> is within the scope of the invention, provided that such expansion of the sclera <b>102</b> moves the ciliary body <b>116</b> away from the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b>. Typically, the expansion of the sclera will be accomplished in the region from about one and one half millimeters (1.5 mm) anterior to the plane <b>130</b> of the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b> to about two and one half millimeters (2.5 mm) posterior to that plane, i.e., from about one half millimeter (0.5 mm) to about four and one half millimeters (4.5 mm) posterior to the limbus <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the anterior margin <b>122</b> of a scleral pocket <b>120</b> will be located in that region of the sclera.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0088">An exemplary scleral pocket <b>120</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. An incision is made in the surface of sclera <b>120</b> along the line indicated with reference numeral <b>130</b>. The incision is then extended under the surface of sclera <b>120</b> between the-anterior margin <b>122</b> and the posterior margin <b>124</b> of scleral pocket <b>120</b>. This forms a &#x201c;pocket&#x201d; under the surface of sclera <b>102</b>. The incision may also be extended through the surface of sclera <b>102</b> along the line indicated with reference number <b>132</b>. This forms a &#x201c;belt loop&#x201d; type structure in the surface of sclera <b>102</b>. For convenience the &#x201c;pocket&#x201d; type structure and the &#x201c;belt loop&#x201d; type structure will both be referred to as scleral pocket <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0089">The scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> is designed to be placed within scleral pocket <b>120</b>. Scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> within scleral pocket <b>120</b> applies an outwardly directed traction to the sclera <b>102</b> at the general position of the anterior margin <b>122</b> of the scleral pocket <b>120</b>. The position of prosthesis <b>200</b> within scleral pocket <b>120</b> and its operation to expand the sclera are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0090">An advantageous embodiment of eye implant prosthesis <b>200</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a plan view of the top <b>500</b> of prosthesis <b>200</b>. In one advantageous embodiment, the length of prosthesis <b>200</b> is approximately five thousand five hundred microns (5500 &#x3bc;m) or, equivalently, approximately five and one half millimeters (5.5 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a front elevational view of the prosthesis <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showing one side <b>600</b> of prosthesis <b>200</b>. In one advantageous embodiment, the maximum height of prosthesis <b>200</b> is approximately nine hundred twenty five microns (925 &#x3bc;m) or, equivalently, approximately nine hundred twenty five thousandths of a millimeter (0.925 mm). A first notch <b>610</b> is located in the base <b>620</b> of prosthesis <b>200</b> at a first end of prosthesis <b>200</b>. A second notch <b>630</b> is located in the base <b>620</b> of prosthesis <b>200</b> at a second end of prosthesis <b>200</b>. When prosthesis <b>200</b> is located within scleral pocket <b>120</b> intraocular pressure from the interior of eye <b>100</b> pushes scleral tissue into notch <b>610</b> and into notch <b>630</b>. The presence of scleral tissue in notch <b>610</b> and in notch <b>630</b> provides an anchoring mechanism that tends to prevent movement of prosthesis <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a plan view of the bottom <b>620</b> of prosthesis <b>200</b>. Notch <b>610</b> and notch <b>630</b> extend across the bottom <b>620</b> of prosthesis <b>200</b>.</p>

In one advantageous embodiment, the width of prosthesis <b>200</b> is approximately one thousand three hundred eighty microns (1380 &#x3bc;m) or, equivalently, approximately one and three hundred eighty thousandths millimeter (1.380 mm).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a perspective top view of prosthesis <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows top <b>500</b>, one side <b>600</b> and one end <b>800</b> of the prosthesis <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a perspective bottom view of prosthesis <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the bottom <b>620</b> (including notches <b>610</b> and <b>630</b>) and one side <b>600</b> of prosthesis <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0095">Other types of scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> may be used including those types of prosthesis disclosed in the &#x201c;Presbyopia and Related Eye Disorder Patent Documents&#x201d; previously incorporated by reference into this patent document.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0096">Scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> is made of a material that is sufficiently rigid to exert a force on the sclera sufficient to produce the radial expansion required by the method of the invention and that is physiologically acceptable for long-term implantation or contact with the ocular tissues. Such materials are well-known in the surgical art and include suitable metals, ceramics, and synthetic resins. Suitable metals include titanium, gold, platinum, stainless steel, nitinol, tantalum and various surgically acceptable alloys, and the like. Suitable ceramics may include crystalline and vitreous materials such as porcelain, alumina, silica, silicon carbide, high-strength glasses and the like. Suitable synthetic materials include physiologically inert materials such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(tetrafluoroethylene), polycarbonate, silicone resins, hydrophilic plastics, hydrophobic plastics, hypoxy-appetite, and the like. The scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> may also be made of composite materials incorporating a synthetic resin or other matrix reinforced with fibers of high strength material such as glass fibers, boron fibers or the like. Thus, scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> may be made of glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy resin, carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy resin, carbon fiber-reinforced carbon (carbon-carbon), or the like. Scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> may be made of a semi-rigid exterior and a liquid or gel filled interior so that the internal and external dimensions can be altered by injecting various amounts of liquid: water, saline, or silicone oil; or various amounts of a gel: silicone, collagen, or gelatin. The semi-rigid exterior may be made of any of the already listed materials. A preferred material for the entire scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> is surgical grade poly(methyl methacrylate). Scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> may also be made of a material that regains its shape when deformed such as a memory metal (e.g., nitinol).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0097">Scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> may be manufactured by any conventional technique appropriate to the material used, such as machining, injection molding, heat molding, compression molding and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0098">Scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> may be foldable to facilitate insertion into a scleral belt loop or made in a plurality of parts so that it can be assembled prior to use or may be installed separately to form a complete prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0099">To implant scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> by hand, the surgeon locates the proper region of the sclera to be expanded by measuring a distance of preferably three and one half millimeters (3.5 mm) posterior of the limbus <b>106</b>. At two millimeters (2.0 mm) clockwise and counterclockwise from each of the forty five degree (45&#xb0;) meridians of the eye, and three and one half millimeters (3.5 mm) posterior to the limbus <b>106</b>, partial scleral thickness parallel incisions, i.e., anterior-posterior incisions, are made which are one and one half millimeters (1.5 mm) long and three hundred fifty microns (350 &#x3bc;m) deep. Using a lamella blade the sclera is dissected until the partial thickness incisions are connected so that four scleral pockets or belt loops are made which have an anterior length of four millimeters (4.0 mm), and a length extending generally axially of the eye of one and one half millimeters (1.5 mm). Thus, each pocket or belt loop is preferably centered over the forty five degree (45&#xb0;) meridian of the eye. A scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> is then inserted in each of the four scleral belt loops. This produces symmetrical scleral expansion which will produce the desired result of increasing the effective working distance of the ciliary muscle.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0100">The location of the scleral prostheses <b>200</b> implanted in eye <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an isometric view of an eye <b>100</b> having a globe with the relevant exterior anatomical parts indicated as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a front elevational view of an eye <b>100</b> showing the scleral pockets <b>120</b> formed at approximately the forty five degree (45&#xb0;) meridians of the eye, i.e., approximately halfway between the vertical and horizontal meridians of the globe. This location is preferred because it avoids interference with structures of the eye that are located generally on the vertical and horizontal meridians. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the use of straight scleral pockets <b>120</b>. Straight scleral pockets <b>120</b> are somewhat simpler to prepare surgically than curved scleral pockets (not shown). For many patients the use of straight scleral prostheses provide adequate treatment of presbyopia. Alternatively, curved scleral prostheses may be used as discussed in the &#x201c;Presbyopia and Related Eye Disorder Patent Documents&#x201d; previously incorporated by reference into this patent document.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a cross-section of eye <b>100</b>, taken along the line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, showing the placement of scleral prosthesis <b>200</b> relative to the significant anatomical structures of the eye. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the general configuration of the scleral pockets <b>120</b> and the prostheses <b>200</b> of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>. The anterior margins <b>122</b> of the scleral pockets <b>120</b> are located approximately in the plane <b>130</b> of the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b>. The presence of prosthesis <b>200</b> causes the portion of the sclera anterior to the scleral pocket <b>120</b> to be expanded somewhat more than the posterior portion. This places the sclera anterior to the scleral pocket <b>120</b> under a radial tension and causes it to expand from its normal diameter at that position. This scleral expansion draws with it the underlying ciliary body <b>116</b> and causes the ciliary body to be drawn away from the equator <b>110</b> of the lens <b>108</b>. Accordingly, the expansion of the ciliary body <b>116</b> operates to increase the working distance of the ciliary muscle and restore, at least in part, the ability of the eye to accommodate for clear focusing on objects at different distances.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an enlarged portion of one of the scleral pockets <b>120</b> with adjacent anatomical structures. It shows the relation of the scleral pocket <b>120</b> to the underlying structures and its location just posterior to the equator of the lens <b>108</b> and overlying the ciliary body <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0104">The surgical procedures described above to make incisions within the sclera <b>102</b> of eye <b>100</b> are done by hand. That is, the surgeon makes the incisions in sclera <b>102</b> that are required to form scleral pocket <b>120</b> using standard surgical tools such as a scalpel. The surgeon must be very skilled in the use of a scalpel to make incisions that have the required precision.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0105">However, the system and method of the present invention provide a much more efficient and precise way to make the required incisions. The system and method of the present invention comprise a surgical tool that is specifically designed to make very precise incisions in the sclera <b>102</b> of an eye <b>100</b> to form a scleral pocket <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a perspective view of an electromechanical surgical tool <b>1100</b> constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention. As will be more fully described, surgical tool <b>1100</b> is capable of making incisions in eye <b>100</b> to create a scleral pocket <b>120</b> to receive a scleral prosthesis <b>200</b>. Surgical tool <b>1100</b> comprises a base housing <b>1110</b> and a drive shaft housing <b>1120</b>. Drive shaft housing <b>1120</b> comprises a blade mount housing <b>1130</b> that mounted on the drive shaft housing <b>1120</b> an angle to a central axis of drive shaft housing <b>1120</b>. The reason for mounting blade mount housing <b>1130</b> at an angle with respect to the central axis of drive shaft housing <b>1120</b> is to facilitate the placement of blade mount housing <b>1130</b> on eye <b>100</b> during the surgical process. Lastly, blade <b>1140</b> is mounted on blade mount housing <b>1130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows surgical tool <b>1100</b> and a surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> for controlling the operation of surgical tool <b>1100</b>. Surgical tool <b>1100</b> is coupled to surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> through control cable <b>1210</b>. Control cable <b>1210</b> provides electrical power to surgical tool <b>1100</b> under the control of surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> to power the operation of blade <b>1140</b>. Control cable <b>1210</b> also provides an &#x201c;earth ground&#x201d; to surgical tool <b>1100</b>. Surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> receives external electrical power through power cord <b>1220</b>. It is also possible to use a battery (not shown) or other power source.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0108">Foot switch <b>1230</b> is coupled to surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> through signal line <b>1240</b>. When the surgeon is ready to rotate blade <b>1140</b> to make an incision in eye <b>100</b> the surgeon steps on foot switch <b>1230</b>. Foot switch <b>1230</b> then sends a control signal to surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> through signal line <b>1240</b>. In response, surgical tool controller <b>1220</b> activates electrical power to surgical tool <b>1100</b> to cause blade <b>1140</b> to rotate in a forward direction and make the desired incision in eye <b>100</b>. In one advantageous embodiment the time required for blade <b>1140</b> to make an incision in eye <b>100</b> is approximately two (2) seconds. Other suitable time durations may be appropriate. The incision is complete after blade <b>1140</b> has reached the end of its rotation in the forward direction. Surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> then automatically causes blade <b>1140</b> to rotate back out of the incision. Surgical tool <b>1100</b> is then ready to make another incision.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0109">If the surgeon releases his or her foot from foot switch <b>1230</b> during the time period during which the incision is being made, foot switch <b>1230</b> immediately sends a control signal to surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> through signal line <b>1240</b>. In response, surgical tool controller <b>1220</b> causes the forward motion of blade <b>1140</b> to cease. If the surgeon steps on foot switch <b>1230</b> again blade <b>1140</b> resumes its rotation in the forward direction. If the surgeon desires to rotate blade <b>1140</b> out of the incision the surgeon manually presses a &#x201c;blade retract&#x201d; control button on surgical tool controller <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0110">Surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> comprises a switch <b>1250</b> (on/off switch <b>1250</b>) for activating the operation of surgical tool controller <b>1200</b>. Surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> also comprises indicator lights <b>1260</b> that indicate the operational status of surgical tool controller <b>1200</b>. It is understood that other control methods may also be used to control the operation of surgical tool <b>1100</b> such as voice activated controls, hand controls, finger controls, and other biometric controls.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an end view of base housing <b>1110</b> of surgical tool <b>1100</b>.

In this advantageous embodiment control cable receptacle <b>1300</b> is capable of receiving four (4) individual power plugs of control cable <b>1210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a cross section of base housing <b>1110</b>.

When control cable <b>1210</b> is placed into control cable receptacle <b>1300</b>, four power plugs of control cable <b>1210</b> make contact with the four power lines <b>1410</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, two of the four power lines (line <b>1</b> and line <b>2</b>) are coupled to a first winding circuit (circuit A) of motor <b>1420</b>.

In this manner motor <b>1420</b> provides both rotational motion to-rotate blade <b>1140</b> forward to make an incision in eye <b>100</b> and provides rotational motion to rotate blade <b>1140</b> backwards to remove blade <b>1140</b> from the incision made in eye <b>100</b>. The two types of rotational motion will be collectively referred to as &#x201c;bidirectional rotational motion.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0114">The rotational motion generated by motor <b>1420</b> is coupled to gearbox <b>1430</b>. In one advantageous embodiment gearbox <b>1430</b> reduces the rotational speed provided by motor <b>1420</b> by a factor of sixty six (66:1). That is, the rotational speed output by gearbox <b>1430</b> is one sixty sixth ( 1/66) of the rotational speed provided to gearbox <b>1430</b> by motor <b>1420</b>. This amount of rotational speed reduction is necessary to increase the torque and because the rotational speed provided by motor <b>1420</b> is too great to be used to rotate blade <b>1140</b> directly. The rotational output from gearbox <b>1430</b> is coupled to drive shaft <b>1440</b> of base housing <b>1110</b>.</p>

End portions, <b>3310</b> and <b>3330</b>, are seated against sclera <b>102</b> of eye <b>100</b> during the surgical process to provide additional peripheral contact between blade guide <b>3300</b> and sclera <b>102</b> to ensure proper scleral pocket length.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0145">Blade guide <b>3300</b> is formed having a circularly shaped surface <b>3350</b> that is concentric with curved cutting blade <b>1820</b>. The length of support arm <b>1810</b> supports curved cutting blade <b>1820</b> at a distance that is approximately four hundred microns (400 &#x3bc;m) away from the circularly shaped surface <b>3350</b> of blade guide <b>3300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0146">At the start of the surgical process the surgeon places circularly shaped surface <b>3350</b> of blade guide <b>3300</b> on the sclera <b>102</b> of eye <b>100</b>. A pressure sensor <b>3390</b> within blade guide <b>3300</b> senses the pressure of the sclera <b>102</b> against the circularly shaped surface <b>3350</b> of blade guide <b>3300</b>. A pressure sensor control line (not shown) connects pressure sensor <b>3390</b> to surgical tool controller <b>1200</b>. Pressure sensor <b>3390</b> senses whether there is sufficient pressure between the surface of sclera <b>102</b> and the circularly shaped surface <b>3350</b> of blade guide <b>3300</b>. If there is not sufficient pressure then any incision made by blade <b>1140</b> would be too shallow. If pressure sensor <b>3390</b> does not detect sufficient pressure then surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> will not allow blade <b>1140</b> of surgical tool <b>1100</b> to rotate. If pressure sensor <b>3390</b> does detect sufficient pressure then surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> will allow blade <b>1140</b> of surgical tool <b>1100</b> to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0147">The surgeon begins the rotation of blade <b>1140</b> by stepping on foot switch <b>1230</b>. As long as the surgeon is stepping on foot switch <b>1230</b> blade <b>1140</b> continues to advance in a forward direction as support arm <b>1810</b> of blade <b>1140</b> rotates curved cutting blade <b>1820</b>. Curved cutting blade <b>1820</b> then passes through sclera <b>102</b> of eye <b>100</b> at a depth of approximately four hundred microns (400 &#x3bc;m) to make the desired incision. The surgeon removes his or her foot from foot switch <b>1230</b> if the surgeon determines that it is desirable to stop the rotation of blade <b>1140</b>. Surgical tool controller <b>1200</b> will immediately cause the forward motion of blade <b>1140</b> to cease. If the surgeon steps on foot switch <b>1230</b> again blade <b>1140</b> resumes its rotation in the forward direction. If the surgeon desires to rotate blade <b>1140</b> out of the incision the surgeon manually presses a &#x201c;blade retract&#x201d; control button on surgical tool controller <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0148">Blade guide <b>3300</b> also comprises portions that form a vacuum chamber <b>3360</b> within the interior of blade guide <b>3300</b>. Blade guide <b>3300</b> also comprises portions that form a plurality of access ports, <b>3365</b>, <b>3370</b>, and <b>3375</b>, that extend from vacuum chamber <b>3360</b> through the circularly shaped surface <b>3350</b> of blade guide <b>3300</b> to apply vacuum to the surface of sclera <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0143" num="0151">Vacuum coupling <b>3380</b> is coupled to a vacuum supply line <b>3500</b>. Vacuum supply line <b>3500</b> provides a vacuum to vacuum chamber <b>3360</b>. The vacuum causes air to pass through access ports <b>3365</b>, <b>3370</b>, and <b>3375</b> into vacuum chamber <b>3360</b> (shown by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>) when access ports <b>3365</b>, <b>3370</b>, and <b>3375</b> are open to the atmosphere. When circularly shaped surface <b>3350</b> of blade guide <b>3300</b> is placed in contact with the surface of sclera <b>102</b> the vacuum in vacuum chamber <b>3360</b> causes sclera <b>102</b> to adhere to the surface of circularly shaped surface <b>3350</b>. The adhesion caused by the vacuum in vacuum chamber <b>3360</b> restrains the movement of sclera <b>102</b> when curved cutting blade <b>1820</b> is rotated into sclera <b>102</b> to make an incision.</p>
