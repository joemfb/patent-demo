<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a touch display apparatus, and more particularly to an optical touch display apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Touch display apparatuses are easily to operate, so that in recent years the touch display apparatuses have been widely used in many electronic products such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDA), digital cameras, music players, computers, satellite navigation devices and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to sensing theory, touch display apparatuses can be divided into many types such as resistive type, capacitive type and optical type. In a conventional optical touch display apparatus, a frame made of reflecting material, light-emitting material or light guide material is added to surround display area to emit background light. Thus, the said conventional optical touch display apparatus can calculate the position of a pointer related to the display area according to the shade position of the pointer related to the background light.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, since the mechanical flatness of the frame is not good or the frame is bended, the conventional optical touch display apparatuses may have a problem of misjudging the position of the pointer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to an optical touch display apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention also relates to an optical operation apparatus.</p>

The light-transmitting display panel has a first surface and a second surface opposite to each other. The first surface has a display area. The backlight module is disposed on the second surface. The visible light source is configured to emit visible light to the backlight module so that the backlight module guides the visible light entering the inner thereof to the second surface. The invisible light source is configured to emit invisible light to the backlight module so that the backlight module guides the invisible light entering the inner thereof to the second surface. The image sensing apparatus is configured to sense an image above the display area. When a pointer is located in the display area and reflects invisible light which passes through the display area so that the image sensing apparatus senses the invisible light reflected by the pointer, the processing circuit calculates the position of the pointer related to the display area according to the image sensed by the image sensing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment of the optical touch display apparatus of the present invention, the backlight module has four side surfaces. The visible light source and the invisible light source are disposed beside the same side surface of the four side surfaces or are respectively disposed beside two side surfaces of the four side surfaces. Among the four side surfaces of the backlight module, the side surface facing the visible light source and the side surface facing the invisible light source are light-transmitting surfaces, and the other side surfaces are non-light-transmitting surfaces or reflecting surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment of the optical touch display apparatus of the present invention, the light-transmitting display panel has a liquid crystal layer therein. The backlight module has a reflecting portion therein. The reflecting portion is extended to the side surfaces of the backlight module which do not face the visible light source and the invisible light source, so as to make the side surfaces be non-light-transmitting surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment of the optical touch display apparatus of the present invention, a portion of the reflecting portion which is opposite to the second surface of the light-transmitting display panel has a pattern. The pattern is used for guiding the received light to the second surface, so that the visible light and the invisible light entering the inner of the backlight module can pass through the light-transmitting display panel, the liquid crystal layer inside the light-transmitting display panel, and the display area.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also provides an optical operation apparatus. The optical operation apparatus includes a light-transmitting panel, a backlight module, a first light source, an image sensing apparatus and a processing circuit. The light-transmitting panel has a first surface and a second surface, and the first surface and the second surface are opposite to each other. The backlight module is disposed on the second surface. The first light source is configured to provide a first light to the backlight module so that the backlight module guides the first light entering the inner thereof to the second surface. The image sensing apparatus is configured to sense an image above the first surface so as to generate sensing information. The processing circuit is configured to generate object information according to the sensing information.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment of the optical operation apparatus of the present invention, the first light provided by the first light source is invisible light, and the first light source includes an infrared light source.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment of the optical operation apparatus of the present invention, the optical operation apparatus further includes a second light source configured to provide a second light to the backlight module so that the backlight module guides the second light entering the inner thereof to the second surface.

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment of the optical operation apparatus of the present invention, the backlight module has four side surfaces. The first light source is disposed beside a side surface of the four side surfaces. Among the four side surfaces of the backlight module, the side surface facing the first light source is a light-transmitting surface, and the other side surfaces are non-light-transmitting surfaces or reflecting surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment of the optical operation apparatus of the present invention, the backlight module has a light guide unit therein, and the light guide unit is configured to guide the first light entering the backlight module to the second surface.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Compared to the conventional light-transmitting display apparatus, the optical touch display apparatus provided by the present invention further includes the invisible light source, the image sensing apparatus and the processing circuit, and the invisible light emitted by the invisible light source is guided to the surface between the light-transmitting display panel and the backlight module by the conventional backlight module, so that the invisible light can pass through the light-transmitting display panel and the display area thereof. Thus, when a pointer is located in the display area and reflects the invisible light which passes through the display area so that the image sensing apparatus can sense the invisible light reflected by the pointer, the processing circuit calculates the position of the pointer related to the display area according to the image sensed by the image sensing apparatus.</p>

The light-transmitting panel has the first surface and the second surface, and the first surface and the second surface are opposite to each other. The backlight module is disposed on the second surface. The light source is configured to provide light to the backlight module, so that the backlight module can guide the light entering the inner thereof to the second surface. The image sensing apparatus is configured to sense an image above the first surface, so as to generate sensing information. The processing circuit generates object information according to the sensing information.</p>
