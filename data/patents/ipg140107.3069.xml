<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a wiring board and its manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A processing element such as a CPU (Central Processing Unit) or an MPU (Micro Processing Unit), and a VRM (Voltage Regulator Module) to supply power for such a processing element are mounted on a wiring board to be used as a computer motherboard, for example. A VRM works as a direct-current power source. Therefore, the output voltage phase and the output current phase of a VRM usually correspond to each other. However, under circumstances such as shortly after a processing element has started operations or at a sudden increase in the load intensity of a processing element, the output current phase is delayed relative to the output voltage phase due to the impedance of a transmission line that connects the processing element and the VRM. In such a case, the power supply for the processing element may be delayed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also, the electric current flowing through a transmission line that connects a VRM and a processing element generates a magnetic field with the transmission line as its center. Therefore, if the volume of the electric current flowing through the transmission line changes, a subsequent change in the magnetic field may cause noise in a signal line formed in the wiring board.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In Japanese Patent Publication No. 2002-204075, a wiring board having a center conductor and a ring conductor that surrounds the center conductor is described. The contents of Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2002-204075 are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety in the present application.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, a wiring board includes a substrate having a first surface and a second surface on the opposite side of the first surface, the substrate having a first penetrating hole penetrating through the substrate between the first surface and the second surface, a first conductive circuit formed on the first surface of the substrate, a second conductive circuit formed on the second surface of the substrate, an interlayer insulation layer formed on the substrate and the first conductive circuit or the second conductive circuit, and a third conductive circuit formed on the interlayer insulation layer. The substrate has a first through-hole conductor connecting the first conductive circuit and the second conductive circuit and formed on the inner wall of the first penetrating hole, a filler filled inside the first through-hole conductor and forming a second penetrating hole, and a second through-hole conductor formed in the second penetrating hole. The second through-hole conductor has a conductive material filled in the second penetrating hole. The interlayer insulation layer has a via conductor formed in the interlayer insulation layer and electrically connecting the third conductive circuit and the second through-hole conductor. The via conductor is positioned such that the via conductor is shifted from the center of the second through-hole conductor in the direction parallel to the first surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for manufacturing a wiring board includes forming a first penetrating hole in a substrate such that the first penetrating hole penetrates through the substrate between a first surface of the substrate and a second surface of the substrate on the opposite side of the first substrate, forming a first through-hole conductor on the inner wall of the first penetrating hole of the substrate, forming a first conductive circuit on the first surface, forming a second conductive circuit on the second surface of the substrate connected to the first conductive circuit by the first through-hole conductor, filling a filler inside the first through-hole conductor, forming a second penetrating hole in the filler, forming a second through-hole conductor by filling a conductive material in the second penetrating hole, forming an interlayer insulation layer on the substrate and the first conductive circuit or the second conductive circuit, forming a third conductive circuit on the interlayer insulation layer, and forming at a position shifted from the center of the second through-hole conductor in the direction parallel to the first surface of the substrate a via conductor in the interlayer insulation layer such that the second through-hole conductor and the third conductive circuit are connected by the via conductor.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding or identical elements throughout the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wiring board <b>10</b> according to the present embodiment has core substrate <b>20</b>, built-up layers (<b>50</b>, <b>60</b>), solder-resist layers (<b>130</b>, <b>140</b>) and external connection terminals (<b>150</b>, <b>160</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, core substrate <b>20</b> has substrate <b>22</b>, wiring layers (<b>24</b><i>a</i>, <b>24</b><i>b</i>) made of copper, for example, outer through-hole conductor <b>38</b>, filler <b>36</b>, and inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b>. In addition, substrate <b>22</b> has a first surface (the surface on the arrow-Z<b>1</b> side) and a second surface opposite the first surface (the surface on the arrow-Z<b>2</b> side). Wiring layer (<b>24</b><i>a</i>) is formed on the first surface of substrate <b>22</b> and wiring layer (<b>24</b><i>b</i>) is formed on the second surface of substrate <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Substrate <b>22</b> is made of epoxy resin, for example. Epoxy resin is preferred to contain reinforcing material such as glass fiber (glass fabric or glass non-woven fabric, for example) or aramid fiber (aramid non-woven fabric, for example) impregnated with resin. The material of substrate <b>22</b> is not limited to any specific type. The reinforcing material has a smaller thermal expansion coefficient than the primary material (epoxy resin in the present embodiment).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In substrate <b>22</b>, first penetrating hole (<b>22</b><i>a</i>) is formed to penetrate from the first surface through the second surface. The opening shape of first penetrating hole (<b>22</b><i>a</i>) is circular.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Other than the above, solder connection layers (<b>132</b>, <b>142</b>) may also be formed as triple-layer plated layers of nickel, palladium and gold. Alternatively, a single-plated layer of gold, silver, tin or the like may be formed, and a resin film of flux or the like may also be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, by printing solder paste on solder connection layers (<b>132</b>, <b>142</b>) and reflowing it, external connection terminals (<b>150</b>, <b>160</b>) are formed. Accordingly, wiring board <b>10</b> is obtained. Wiring board <b>10</b> is connected to electronic components such as an IC chip using external connection terminals (<b>150</b>, <b>160</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In wiring board <b>10</b> formed as above, via conductors (<b>72</b>, <b>82</b>) are formed in a position that is shifted from the center of inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b> in a direction indicated by arrow-X<b>2</b> which is parallel to substrate <b>22</b>. Accordingly, via conductors (<b>72</b>, <b>82</b>) are connected not to inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b>, but to relatively flat areas of conductive portions (<b>32</b>, <b>34</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Here, as described previously, the surfaces of the filler become curved when the filler is cured. Moreover, when inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b> is formed by filling plating in second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>), it is assumed that the greater the aspect ratio of the second penetrating hole, the more likely recessed portions occur on the surfaces of a through-hole conductor (conductive portion). In such a case, if via conductors are formed directly on inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b>, it is difficult to ensure the connection reliability of via conductors to the conductive portions due to the surface features of the filler and through-hole conductor (conductive portion). However, in the present embodiment, since via conductors (<b>72</b>, <b>82</b>) are connected to relatively flat areas of conductive portions (<b>32</b>, <b>34</b>), connection reliability is enhanced between inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b> and via conductors (<b>72</b>, <b>82</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition, in the present embodiment, an outer through-hole conductor and an inner through-hole conductor form a coaxial structure. Thus, by using the outer through-hole conductor and the inner through-hole conductor as power-supply transmission routes, the impedance of the transmission routes is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In such a case, the magnetic field generated by the electric current flowing through the outer through-hole conductor and the magnetic field generated by the electric current flowing through the inner through-hole conductor are offset. As a result, the leakage of magnetic flux to the area surrounding the outer through-hole conductor decreases, and noise that contaminates the signal lines of wiring board <b>10</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Also, in the present embodiment, by forming VRM inductors in a wiring board so as to install a VRM in the wiring board, supplying voltage for a CPU is achieved without loss. Accordingly, the number of chip capacitors required to supply power at a constant voltage is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Moreover, a capacitor required for a VRM may be arranged in a wiring board. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, chip capacitor <b>170</b> may be formed in insulative substrate <b>22</b>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, thin-film capacitor <b>180</b> may also be formed on an insulation layer. Such thin-film capacitor <b>180</b> is made of a pair of electrodes (<b>182</b>, <b>186</b>) facing each other and ceramic dielectric layer <b>184</b> sandwiched between them.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">First conductive circuit <b>26</b> and conductive portion <b>32</b> are positioned on substantially the same plane, and second conductive circuit <b>28</b> and conductive portion <b>34</b> are positioned on substantially the same plane. Therefore, second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>) formed in filler <b>36</b> has the minimal length required to form a coaxial structure. Accordingly, excellent results are ensured when filling plating in second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>). Thus, when inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b> is formed, plating may be filled without voids in second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">A wiring board according to the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and various modifications may be made within a scope that does not deviate from the gist of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">For example, in the above embodiment, the diameter in the central portion of inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b> and third through-hole conductor <b>42</b> is set smaller than the diameter in the upper and lower end portions. However, inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b> and third through-hole conductor <b>42</b> are not limited to such, and they may be formed to be a truncated cone where either diameter in the upper end portion or in the lower end portion is set greater than the other. Alternatively, inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b> and third through-hole conductor <b>42</b> may be formed to be a perfect cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The above embodiment has been described on the basis that via conductors are filled vias. However, via conductors are not limited to such, and they may also be conformal vias.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the above embodiment, the opening shapes of first penetrating hole (<b>22</b><i>a</i>), second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>) and third penetrating hole (<b>22</b><i>b</i>) are circular. However, they are not limited to such, and may be oval or polygonal.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Also, the inner diameter of the central portion of second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>) and third penetrating hole (<b>22</b><i>b</i>) is set smaller than the inner diameter in the upper and lower ends. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>) and third penetrating hole (<b>22</b><i>b</i>) may have a smaller inner diameter in the upper-end opening than in the lower-end opening. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the wall surface of second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>) and third penetrating hole (<b>22</b><i>b</i>) may be set perpendicular to the first and second surfaces of substrate <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Also, in wiring board <b>10</b> of the above embodiment, conductive portions (<b>32</b>, <b>34</b>) are made as lands. However, they may be formed as via conductors (<b>72</b>, <b>82</b>). In such a case, there is no land, and via conductors (<b>72</b>, <b>82</b>) are directly connected to inner through-hole conductor <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Alternatively, the thicknesses of first conductive circuit <b>26</b> and second conductive circuit <b>28</b> may be set substantially the same as the thickness of conductive portions (<b>32</b>, <b>34</b>). Yet alternatively, first conductive circuit <b>26</b> and second conductive circuit <b>28</b> may be set thinner than conductive portions (<b>32</b>, <b>34</b>). In such a case, for example, after plated films <b>208</b> are formed, it is an option for conductive layers which form first conductive circuit <b>26</b> and second conductive circuit <b>28</b> to be made thinner by etching.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the above embodiment, second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>) and third penetrating hole (<b>22</b><i>b</i>) are formed by laser. However, second penetrating hole (<b>36</b><i>a</i>) and third penetrating hole (<b>22</b><i>b</i>) may be formed by a drill or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the above embodiment, the layers are patterned using a tenting method. However, the method is not limited to such, and the layers may also be patterned using other methods, such as a semi-additive method or a subtractive method.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In wiring board <b>10</b> of the above embodiment, built-up layer <b>50</b> formed on a surface of core substrate <b>20</b> has three insulation layers (<b>70</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>100</b>), and built-up layer <b>60</b> has three insulation layers (<b>80</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>120</b>). However, built-up layers (<b>50</b>, <b>60</b>) are not limited to such, and they may have four or more insulation layers. The number of layers in built-up layers (<b>50</b>, <b>60</b>) may be determined properly according to usage requirements or the like for wiring board <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">External connection terminals to be connected to electronic components may only be formed on either main surface of wiring board <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A wiring board according to one aspect of the present invention has the following: a substrate having a first surface and a second surface and a first penetrating hole; a first conductive circuit formed on the first surface of the substrate; a second conductive circuit formed on the second surface of the substrate; a first through-hole conductor connecting the first conductive circuit and the second conductive circuit and formed on the inner wall of the first penetrating hole; a filler filled inside the first through-hole conductor and having a second penetrating hole; a second through-hole conductor formed in the second penetrating hole; an interlayer insulation layer formed on the substrate; a third conductive circuit formed on the interlayer insulation layer; and a via conductor formed in the interlayer insulation layer and electrically connecting the third conductive circuit and the second through-hole conductor. In such a wiring board, the second through-hole conductor is formed with a conductive material filled in the second penetrating hole, and the via conductor is shifted from the center of the second through-hole conductor in a direction parallel to the first surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">A method for manufacturing a wiring board according to another aspect of the present invention includes the following: forming a first penetrating hole in a substrate having a first surface and a second surface; forming a first through-hole conductor on the inner wall of the first penetrating hole; on the first surface and the second surface of the substrate, forming conductive circuits to be connected by the first through-hole conductor; filling a filler inside the first through-hole conductor; forming a second penetrating hole in the filler; forming a second through-hole conductor by filling a conductive material in the second penetrating hole; forming an interlayer insulation layer on the substrate; forming a third conductive circuit on the interlayer insulation layer; and forming a via conductor in the interlayer insulation layer to connect the second through-hole conductor and the third conductive circuit. In such a manufacturing method, the via conductor is formed in a position shifted from the center of the second through-hole conductor in a direction parallel to the first surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.</p>
