<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, a vapor deposition apparatus for coating a number of workpieces, such as plastic lenses, includes a deposition chamber, a coating precursor source for producing vaporized material, and a supporting member for mounting the workpieces to be coated by the vaporized material. The coating precursor source is positioned in the lower portion of the deposition chamber. The supporting member is mounted to a rotating shaft located in the upper portion of the deposition chamber. The support member is typically umbrella-shaped and holds or suspends workpieces over the coating precursor sources. However, this results in different distances between various coating materials in the coating precursor sources in the deposition chamber and the supporting member. This may cause non-uniform coatings on the workpieces.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, a vapor deposition apparatus, which can overcome the above-mentioned problems, is needed.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a vapor deposition apparatus <b>10</b>, according to an exemplary embodiment, includes a deposition chamber <b>11</b>, a supporting member <b>12</b>, a number of coating precursor sources <b>13</b>, and a plasma generating source <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The deposition chamber <b>11</b> is substantially cylindrical and includes a top panel <b>111</b>, a bottom panel <b>112</b> and a side panel <b>113</b> connecting the top panel <b>111</b> and the bottom panel <b>112</b>. The top panel <b>111</b> opposes the bottom panel <b>112</b>. A number of through holes <b>112</b><i>a </i>are defined in the bottom panel <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The supporting member <b>12</b> is substantially umbrella-shaped and is mounted to the top panel <b>111</b>. The supporting member <b>12</b> is configured for supporting a number of workpieces (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, each coating precursor source <b>13</b> is engaged in a corresponding through hole <b>112</b><i>a </i>in an airtight fashion, opposing the supporting member <b>12</b>. The coating precursor source <b>13</b> includes a mounting member <b>131</b>, a stationary sleeve <b>132</b>, a moveable member <b>133</b> and an emanating head <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The mounting member <b>131</b> includes a first connecting, portion <b>1311</b> and a second connecting portion <b>1312</b> at opposite ends of the mounting member <b>131</b>. The first connection portion <b>1311</b> is substantially plate-shaped and is received in the through hole <b>112</b>a in an airtight fashion. The second connecting portion <b>1312</b> is substantially cuboid and is located outside the deposition chamber <b>11</b>. The mounting member <b>131</b> defines a central stepped through hole <b>131</b>a through the first connecting portion <b>1311</b> and the second connecting portion <b>1312</b>. The central stepped through hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>forms a first opening <b>1311</b><i>a </i>at the first connecting portion <b>1311</b> and a second opening <b>1312</b><i>a </i>at the second connecting portion <b>1312</b>. Beneficially, the first connecting portion <b>1311</b> and the second connecting portion <b>1312</b> cooperatively constitute a unitary piece to avoid air leakage. The first opening <b>1311</b><i>a </i>communicates the mounting member <b>131</b> with the emanating head <b>134</b>. The mounting member <b>131</b> includes an upper surface <b>13</b>l<i>b </i>and a lower surface <b>131</b><i>c</i>. The upper surface <b>131</b><i>b </i>and the lower surface <b>131</b><i>c </i>are positioned at opposite sides of the mounting member <b>131</b>. The central stepped through hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>extends from the upper surface <b>113</b><i>b </i>to the lower surface <b>131</b><i>c </i>and includes a first through hole portion <b>1314</b> and a second through hole portion <b>1316</b> communicating, with the first through hole portion <b>1314</b>. The first through hole portion <b>1314</b> and the second through hole portion <b>1316</b> are arranged in that order from the upper surface <b>131</b><i>b </i>to the lower surface <b>131</b><i>c </i>The first through hole portion <b>1314</b> is substantially cuboid, and the second through hole portion <b>1316</b> is substantially cylindrical. The width of the first through hole portion <b>1314</b> is lager than the diameter of the second through hole portion <b>1316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The stationary sleeve <b>132</b> is internally threaded and fixedly received in the second through hole portion <b>1316</b> in an airtight fashion. The stationary sleeve <b>132</b> defines a threaded hole <b>1320</b> in a central portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The moveable member <b>133</b> is post-shaped and has external threads <b>1332</b>. The external threads <b>1332</b> engages in the threaded hole <b>1320</b> so that the moveable member <b>133</b> is screwed into the stationary sleeve <b>132</b>. The moveable member <b>133</b> penetrates through the stationary sleeve <b>132</b> and is inserted into the first through hole portion <b>1314</b>. The moveable member <b>133</b> can move up and down along a direction from the coating precursor source <b>13</b> to the supporting member <b>12</b> in the first through hole portion <b>1314</b>. A recess <b>133</b><i>a </i>is defined in a top end of the moveable member <b>133</b>. The top end of the moveable member <b>133</b> opposes the supporting member <b>12</b>. A coating material (not shown) may be placed in the recess <b>133</b><i>a </i>and can move together with the moveable member <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An axial length of the central stepped through hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>is greater than that of the moveable member <b>133</b> to provide enough room for the movement of the moveable member <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The emanating head <b>134</b> defines a truncated conical cavity <b>13</b><i>a </i>and a passing hole <b>13</b><i>b</i>therein. The emanating head <b>134</b> includes a first open end <b>1341</b> and a second open end <b>1342</b> at opposite ends of the emanating head <b>134</b>. The emanating head <b>134</b> tapers from the second open end <b>1342</b> to the first open end <b>1341</b>. The first open end <b>1341</b> opposes the supporting member <b>12</b> and serves as a nozzle for emanating vaporized coating material from the coating precursor source <b>13</b>. The second open end <b>1342</b> has a bottom surface <b>1344</b> which is attached to the upper surface <b>131</b><i>b</i>. The truncated conical cavity <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the passing hole <b>13</b><i>b </i>are arranged in that order from the first open end <b>1341</b> to the second open end <b>1342</b>. The passing hole <b>13</b><i>b </i>communicates with the truncated conical cavity <b>13</b><i>a </i>and passes through the bottom surface <b>1344</b>. The truncated conical cavity <b>13</b><i>a </i>is in communication with the central stepped through hole <b>131</b><i>a </i>through the passing hole <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Initially, the vaporized coating material stays in the coating precursor source <b>13</b>. When a concentration of the vaporized coating material reaches a predetermined value, the vaporized coating material is emanated from the coating precursor source <b>13</b> through the first open end <b>1341</b>. This enhances mobility of the vaporized coating material.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The plasma generating source <b>14</b> is connected to the deposition chamber <b>11</b> by a pipe <b>15</b> at the side panel <b>113</b>. The plasma generated in the plasma generating source <b>14</b> is introduced into the deposition chamber <b>11</b> through the pipe <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When in use, although the supporting member <b>12</b> is substantially umbrella-shaped, a distance between the coating material received in the recess <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the supporting member <b>12</b> can be adjusted depending upon locations of the workpieces on the supporting member <b>12</b>. For example, the moveable members <b>133</b>, having the coating material received in the recess <b>133</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the workpieces away from the center of the supporting member <b>12</b>, can be partially unscrewed to close the distance between the coating material and the workpieces attached to the supporting member <b>12</b>. The moveable members <b>133</b>, having the coating material received in the recess <b>133</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the workpieces adjacent to the center of the supporting member <b>12</b>, are screwed further in. In this way, distances between the coating materials and the workpieces can be substantially the same, and thus the workpieces can be coated uniformly.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, since the distance between the coating material and the workpiece is adjustable, vaporization speed can be controlled to adjust a thickness of the coating on the workpiece. Contamination of the coating material by the plasma can be avoided or at least alleviated because the coating material is received in the recess <b>133</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present embodiments have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structures and functions of the embodiments, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
