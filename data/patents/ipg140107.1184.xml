<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A pinch valve includes a spring disposed between a movable iron core of a solenoid and an end cover thereof, and which urges the movable iron core toward the side of a tube provided in a body. An elastic force of the spring is set to be smaller than a reactive force of the tube that is applied to a valve plug. In a non-excited state of the solenoid, the valve plug is pressed toward the solenoid by the reactive force of the tube, so as to enable a fluid to flow through a flow passage of the tube. Conversely, in an excited state of the solenoid, since an attractive force of the movable iron core toward the tube is added to the elastic force of the spring, the valve plug is pressed in opposition to the reactive force of the tube for thereby blocking the flow passage.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-246411 filed on Nov. 10, 2011, of which the contents are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a pinch valve, which is capable of switching the flow state of a fluid that flows through a passage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Heretofore, a pinch valve has been used for switching the flow state of a fluid that flows inside a conduit made up of a tube or the like. As disclosed, for example, in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-174352, such a pinch valve is equipped with a body, a conduit provided in the body through which a fluid flows, a clamping piece for deforming the conduit by clamping the same and thereby switching the flow state of the fluid, and a piston for urging the clamping piece in directions to approach and separate away from the conduit. In addition, for example, by pressing and moving the piston toward the conduit under a supply action of a pressure fluid, the piston is moved together with the clamping piece, whereby the conduit is clamped and crushed between the body and the clamping piece, and as a result, flow of the fluid through the interior of the conduit is blocked.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, with the aforementioned pinch valve, there is a demand for further miniaturization thereof, as well as for enabling switching of the flow state of the fluid to be accomplished more rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A general object of the present invention is to provide a pinch valve which can be made lighter in weight and smaller in scale, while also being capable of more rapidly switching the flow state of a fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is characterized by a pinch valve comprising a body, an elastic conduit supported in the body and through which a fluid flows, a solenoid connected to the body and having a coil, the solenoid being excited by energizing the coil for attracting a movable iron core toward a fixed iron core, a valve mechanism having a valve plug disposed to face toward the conduit and which is displaceable along an axial direction of the body, wherein the valve mechanism presses the valve plug toward the conduit by excitation of the solenoid, and an elastic means that urges the movable iron core toward the fixed iron core. By displacement of the valve plug toward the conduit, the conduit is clamped between the valve plug and the body, to thereby interrupt flow of the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, in the solenoid, the coil is energized by supplying electrical power thereto, so that the movable iron core is attracted to the side of the fixed iron core, and the elastic means is disposed in the solenoid, which biases the movable iron core toward the fixed iron core. In addition, when the movable iron core is attracted to the side of the fixed iron core upon excitation of the solenoid, and the valve plug is displaced toward the conduit through the movable iron core for pressing the conduit, in the movable iron core, because the elastic force of the elastic means is added together with the attractive force of the solenoid, a reactive force of the elastic conduit is overcome, so that the conduit can be deformed and flow of the fluid can be interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Consequently, with a simple structure including the elastic means, because a large pressing force can be secured for pressing the conduit by the valve plug, for example, compared to a case of a pressing force of the same degree but without providing a spring therein, the solenoid can be made lightweight and smaller in size. Further, when the valve plug is operated through the movable iron core, by adding thereto the elastic force of the elastic means, the valve plug can be moved more rapidly toward the conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The above and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments of the present invention are shown by way of illustrative example.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral <b>10</b> indicates a pinch valve according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the pinch valve <b>10</b> includes a body <b>14</b> having a tube (conduit) <b>12</b> inserted therein through which a fluid, for example, water or blood, flows, a solenoid <b>16</b> connected to an upper part of the body <b>14</b>, and a valve mechanism <b>18</b> provided in the interior of the solenoid <b>16</b> and the body <b>14</b>, which is displaceable along an axial direction (the direction of arrows A and B) upon excitation of the solenoid <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The body <b>14</b> is formed, for example, from a resin material having a through hole <b>20</b> that penetrates linearly therethrough, with a clamping member <b>22</b> that projects upwardly (in the direction of the arrow A) being formed substantially in the center thereof. The clamping member <b>22</b> is arranged perpendicularly with respect to the direction of extension of the through hole <b>20</b>, and is formed to project at a given height with respect to the inner circumferential surface of the through hole <b>20</b>. An end of the clamping member <b>22</b> is formed in a hemispherical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The tube <b>12</b> is formed in a tubular shape from a material having a certain elasticity such as rubber, a resin material, or the like, and is inserted into the through hole <b>20</b> of the body <b>14</b>. In addition, the outer circumferential surface of the tube <b>12</b> is held in intimate contact with the inner circumferential surface of the through hole <b>20</b>, whereby the tube <b>12</b> is supported in the body <b>14</b> and forms therein a flow passage <b>24</b> through which a fluid flows.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, substantially in the center of the body <b>14</b>, a valve hole <b>26</b> is formed that communicates with the through hole <b>20</b>. The valve hole <b>26</b> extends perpendicularly to the through hole <b>20</b> and opens in an upward direction (in the direction of the arrow A). A valve plug <b>54</b> of a later-described valve mechanism <b>18</b> is disposed for displacement in the valve hole <b>26</b>, the valve hole <b>26</b> being sealed by a cover plate <b>28</b> in a condition with the valve plug <b>54</b> being disposed therein. The tube <b>12</b> extends perpendicularly in the body <b>14</b> with respect to the valve hole <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The solenoid <b>16</b> includes a cylindrical housing <b>30</b> connected to an upper part of the body <b>14</b>, a bobbin <b>34</b> having a coil <b>32</b> wound thereon and disposed inside the housing <b>30</b>, a fixed iron core <b>36</b> provided in the interior of the bobbin <b>34</b>, and a movable iron core <b>38</b> disposed for displacement on the same axis with the fixed iron core <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The bobbin <b>34</b> comprises a pair of flanges <b>40</b> that project radially outward on both ends in the axial direction (the direction of arrows A and B) thereof, the flanges <b>40</b> engaging with the inner circumferential wall of the housing <b>30</b>, with the coil <b>32</b> being wound on the bobbin <b>34</b> between one and the other of the respective flanges <b>40</b>. The coil <b>32</b> is connected electrically with respect to a non-illustrated power source.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The fixed iron core <b>36</b> is made from a magnetic material, for example, magnetic stainless steel or the like, the lower end thereof being fixed with respect to the cover plate <b>28</b>, and the upper end thereof being inserted and fixed inside the bobbin <b>34</b>. A shaft hole <b>42</b> that penetrates in the axial direction (the direction of arrows A and B) is formed in the center of the fixed iron core <b>36</b>. A shaft <b>56</b> of a later-described valve mechanism <b>18</b> is inserted and supported for displacement in the shaft hole <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The movable iron core <b>38</b>, similar to the fixed iron core <b>36</b>, is made from a magnetic material, for example, magnetic stainless steel or the like, and is disposed for displacement along the interior of the bobbin <b>34</b>. One end of the movable iron core <b>38</b> is arranged to face toward the fixed iron core <b>36</b>, and has a tapered surface, which is tapered toward the side of the fixed iron core <b>36</b> (in the direction of the arrow B). Further, an abutment surface <b>44</b>, which is a planar surface perpendicular to the axis of the movable iron core <b>38</b>, and which abuts against the shaft <b>56</b>, is formed on the one end of the movable iron core <b>38</b>. The other end of the movable iron core <b>38</b> is arranged to face toward an end cover (cover member) <b>46</b>, which is connected to an upper part of the housing <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, a spring (elastic means) <b>48</b>, which urges the movable iron core <b>38</b> toward the side of the fixed iron core <b>36</b> (in the direction of the arrow B), is disposed between the movable iron core <b>38</b> and the end cover <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The spring <b>48</b>, for example, is made up from a coil spring, which is interposed between a first recess <b>50</b> provided on an end surface (the other end) of the movable iron core <b>38</b> and a second recess <b>52</b> formed on an end surface of the end cover <b>46</b>. The first and second recesses <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are arranged to confront one another mutually, and function together as a positioning means for positioning the spring <b>48</b>, and for regulating movement of the spring <b>48</b> in both axial (the direction of arrows A and B) and perpendicular directions.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, by electrically energizing the coil <b>32</b>, which is connected to a non-illustrated power source, the coil <b>32</b> is excited, whereby the movable iron core <b>38</b> is attracted and moved a predetermined distance toward the side of the fixed iron core <b>36</b> (in the direction of the arrow B).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The valve mechanism <b>18</b> includes a valve plug <b>54</b> disposed in the valve hole <b>26</b> of the body <b>14</b>, a shaft <b>56</b> that abuts against an upper end surface of the valve plug <b>54</b> and is supported for displacement with respect to the fixed iron core <b>36</b>, and the clamping member <b>22</b> that is disposed in the body <b>14</b>. The valve plug <b>54</b> is formed, for example, from a resin material with a rectangular shape in cross section, and comprises a projection <b>58</b> on a lower end surface thereof facing the tube <b>12</b>, which projects toward the side of the tube <b>12</b> (in the direction of the arrow B). The projection <b>58</b> is arranged to confront the clamping member <b>22</b> while sandwiching (clamping) the tube <b>12</b> therebetween. The end of the projection <b>58</b> has a hemispherical shape, similar to that of the clamping member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, a cavity is recessed therein substantially in the center on the upper part of the valve plug <b>54</b>, with a pressure receiving member <b>60</b> being installed in the cavity. The pressure receiving member <b>60</b> is formed, for example, from a metal material and is accommodated in the cavity so as to be substantially flush with the upper surface of the valve plug <b>54</b>. The end of the shaft <b>56</b> is always in abutment with the pressure receiving member <b>60</b>, such that the pressure receiving member <b>60</b> receives a pressing force that is imposed thereon from the shaft <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The shaft <b>56</b> has a fixed diameter and extends along the axial direction (the direction of arrows A and B), and is inserted displaceably through the shaft hole <b>42</b> in the fixed iron core <b>36</b>. One end of the shaft <b>56</b> abuts against the pressure receiving member <b>60</b> mounted in the valve plug <b>54</b>, whereas the other end thereof abuts against the abutment surface <b>44</b> of the movable iron core <b>38</b>. In addition, the shaft <b>56</b> is pressed by displacement of the movable iron core <b>38</b> toward the side of the body <b>14</b> (in the direction of the arrow B), and as a result of the valve plug <b>54</b> being pressed downward (in the direction of the arrow B) through the shaft <b>56</b>, the valve plug <b>54</b> moves along the valve hole <b>26</b> toward the side of the tube <b>12</b> (in the direction of the arrow B), whereby the tube <b>12</b> is deformed so as to be crushed or flattened by the projection <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">At this time, when the tube <b>12</b> is pressed and deformed by the valve plug <b>54</b>, a reactive force (opposing force) Fa of the tube <b>12</b>, which is applied to the valve plug <b>54</b> from the tube <b>12</b>, is set to be greater than the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> that is applied with respect to the movable iron core <b>38</b> to bias the movable iron core <b>38</b> (Fa&#x3e;Fb). Stated otherwise, the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> is set to be smaller than the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> is applied in a vertical upward direction (the direction of the arrow A) to bias the valve plug <b>54</b>, which is disposed above the tube <b>12</b>, whereas the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b>, as well as the attractive force Fc of the movable iron core <b>38</b>, are applied coaxially with the reactive force Fa, and in a vertical downward direction (the direction of the arrow B) toward the side of the tube <b>12</b>, i.e., in an opposite direction to the reactive force Fa.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Moreover, the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> is set to a size that is capable of assuring a flow passage cross-sectional area to enable the fluid to flow at a predetermined flow rate in the flow passage <b>24</b> of the tube <b>12</b> when the tube <b>12</b> is pressed by the valve plug <b>54</b>, which is pressed by the elastic force Fb.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The pinch valve <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention is basically constructed as described above. Next, operations and advantages of the pinch valve <b>10</b> will be described. In the following description, the non-excited state of the solenoid <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shall be described as an initial condition, in which a thrust force is not applied by the solenoid <b>16</b> in a downward direction (the direction of the arrow B) to the movable iron core <b>38</b>, the shaft <b>56</b>, and the valve plug <b>54</b>, and the interior of the tube <b>12</b> is kept in a state of communication, i.e., is open, so that fluid continues to flow through the tube <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">First, in such an initial condition, by supplying electrical power from a non-illustrated power source with respect to the coil <b>32</b> of the solenoid <b>16</b>, the coil <b>32</b> becomes excited, and upon excitation thereof, the movable iron core <b>38</b> is attracted (in the direction of the arrow B) to the side of the fixed iron core <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). At this time, the movable iron core <b>38</b> moves under a condition in which the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> is added with respect to the attractive force Fc produced by the solenoid <b>16</b>, whereby the movable iron core <b>38</b> moves toward the side of the fixed iron core <b>36</b> (in the direction of the arrow B).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, simultaneously with the shaft <b>56</b> being pressed by the movable iron core <b>38</b> toward the side of the body <b>14</b> (in the direction of the arrow B), the valve plug <b>54</b> is pressed by the shaft <b>56</b> and moves toward the side of the tube <b>12</b> (in the direction of the arrow B). In addition, the projection <b>58</b> of the valve plug <b>54</b> presses the tube <b>12</b> toward the side of the clamping member <b>22</b> (in the direction of the arrow B), and as a result of the tube <b>12</b> being crushed or flattened between the projection <b>58</b> and the clamping member <b>22</b>, the flow passage <b>24</b> of the tube <b>12</b> is blocked. Consequently, flow of the fluid through the flow passage <b>24</b> of the tube <b>12</b> is interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">More specifically, the pressing force that is applied to bias the valve plug <b>54</b> is composed of the sum total of the attractive force Fc imposed on the movable iron core <b>38</b> together with the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b>, and because the combined forces exceed the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> (Fa&#x3c;Fb+Fc), the valve plug <b>54</b> overcomes the reactive force Fa and is made capable of deforming the tube <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">On the other hand, by stopping supply of power to the solenoid <b>16</b>, the energized state of the coil <b>32</b> is released, and the attractive force Fc with respect to the movable iron core <b>38</b> toward the side of the fixed iron core <b>36</b> (in the direction of the arrow B) is canceled. Owing thereto, because the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> applied toward the side of the valve plug <b>54</b> (in the direction of the arrow A) becomes greater than the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> that biases the valve plug <b>54</b> (in the direction of the arrow B) toward the side of the tube <b>12</b> (Fa&#x3e;Fb), the valve plug <b>54</b> is pressed and returned by the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> toward the side of the solenoid <b>16</b> (in the direction of the arrow A). Along therewith, the shaft <b>56</b> and the movable iron core <b>38</b> are displaced toward the side of the end cover <b>46</b> (in the direction of the arrow A) in opposition to the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As a result, the pressed condition of the tube <b>12</b> by the valve plug <b>54</b> and the clamping member <b>22</b> is released, and the initial condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is restored under the elasticity of the tube <b>12</b>, to thereby restore the state of communication (initial condition) enabling flow of fluid through the flow passage <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the foregoing manner, according to the first embodiment, the solenoid <b>16</b> is included in the pinch valve <b>10</b> for urging the valve plug <b>54</b>, upon energization of the coil <b>32</b>, toward the side of the tube <b>12</b> (in the direction of the arrow B), and the spring <b>48</b> also is provided for biasing the movable iron core <b>38</b> of the solenoid <b>16</b> toward the side of the valve plug <b>54</b> (in the direction of the arrow B). In addition, by adding the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> together with the attractive force Fc of the movable iron core <b>38</b>, at first, the combined force thereof is set to be greater than the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> (Fa&#x3c;Fb+Fc). By providing such a structure, when the valve plug <b>54</b> is displaced toward the side of the tube <b>12</b> (in the direction of the arrow B) to crush or flatten the tube <b>12</b> and block flow of the fluid, because the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> is applied to the valve plug <b>54</b> in addition to the attractive force Fc of the movable iron core <b>38</b>, the flowing state of the fluid can be blocked more rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Stated otherwise, when the movable iron core <b>38</b> is attracted by the attractive force Fc to press the valve plug <b>54</b>, the spring <b>48</b> functions to assist in pressing the valve plug <b>54</b> by applying the elastic force Fb in the same direction.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, with a simple structure constituted by the spring <b>48</b>, since a large pressing force on the tube <b>12</b> by the valve plug <b>54</b> is assured, for example, compared to a case in which a pressing force of the same degree is attempted to be secured without providing the spring <b>48</b>, the solenoid <b>16</b> can be made more lightweight and smaller in size.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, by replacing the spring <b>48</b> with a different one having a different elastic force Fb responsive to the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b>, it is possible to accommodate different tubes <b>12</b> of various types and characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, a pinch valve <b>100</b> according to a second embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. Constituent elements thereof which are the same as those of the pinch valve <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment are denoted with the same reference characters, and detailed descriptions of such features are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The pinch valve <b>100</b> according to the second embodiment differs from the pinch valve <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment, in that an adjustment mechanism <b>102</b> is provided, which is capable of suitably adjusting the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> applied to the movable iron core <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a bolt hole <b>106</b>, which communicates with the second recess <b>52</b>, is formed substantially in the center of an end cover <b>104</b>, and an adjustment bolt <b>108</b>, which constitutes part of the adjustment mechanism <b>102</b>, is threaded into the bolt hole <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The adjustment bolt <b>108</b>, for example, comprises a stud bolt, the lower end part of which abuts against an end of the spring <b>48</b>, and the upper end part of which projects upwardly with respect to the end cover <b>104</b>. In addition, the adjustment bolt <b>108</b> is capable of advancing and retracting along the bolt hole <b>106</b> by screw-rotating the adjustment bolt <b>108</b>. Further, a lock nut <b>110</b> is threaded onto an upper part of the adjustment bolt <b>108</b> in proximity to the end cover <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, in a state in which the lock nut <b>110</b> is rotated and moved in a direction away from the end cover <b>104</b>, the adjustment bolt <b>108</b> is screw-rotated with respect to the end cover <b>104</b>. In this manner, the adjustment bolt <b>108</b> is advanced and retracted in the second recess <b>52</b> in directions to approach and separate with respect to the spring <b>48</b>, whereby the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b>, which is pressed by the end of the adjustment bolt <b>108</b>, is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">More specifically, by moving the adjustment bolt <b>108</b> toward the spring <b>48</b> (in the direction of the arrow B), since the spring <b>48</b> is compressed between the adjustment bolt <b>108</b> and the movable iron core <b>38</b>, the pressing force that biases the movable iron core <b>38</b>, the shaft <b>56</b>, and the valve plug <b>54</b> toward the side of the tube <b>12</b> (in the direction of the arrow B) is increased. Conversely, by moving the adjustment bolt <b>108</b> in a direction away from the spring <b>48</b> (in the direction of the arrow A), since the compressed state with respect to the spring <b>48</b> is relaxed, the pressing force that biases the movable iron core <b>38</b>, the shaft <b>56</b>, and the valve plug <b>54</b> toward the side of the tube <b>12</b> (in the direction of the arrow B) is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the foregoing manner, according to the second embodiment, for example, even in the case that the tube <b>12</b> is replaced by another tube formed from a material having a different elasticity, and the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> changes, since the elastic force imposed on the movable iron core <b>38</b> from the spring <b>48</b> can be adjusted by the adjustment mechanism <b>102</b> responsive to the reactive force Fa, an advantage exists in that it is unnecessary to exchange the spring <b>48</b> with another one having a different elastic force, each time that the tube <b>12</b> is replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">More specifically, in the case that the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> becomes greater as a result of replacing or exchanging the tube <b>12</b>, by moving the adjustment bolt <b>108</b> toward the side of the tube <b>12</b> (in the direction of the arrow B), the spring <b>48</b> is compressed, and the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> increases. Conversely, in the event that the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> is decreased, by moving the adjustment bolt <b>108</b> in a direction away from the tube <b>12</b> (in the direction of the arrow A), compression of the spring <b>48</b> is relaxed, and the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, adjustment of the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> by the adjustment mechanism <b>102</b> should be performed such that, in a non-excited state of the solenoid <b>16</b>, the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> is greater than the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> (Fa&#x3e;Fb), whereas in an excited state of the solenoid <b>16</b>, the reactive force Fa of the tube <b>12</b> is smaller than the combined pressing force (Fb+Fc) of the sum total of the elastic force Fb of the spring <b>48</b> and the attractive force Fc of the movable iron core <b>38</b> (Fa&#x3c;Fb+Fc).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The pinch valve according to the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, and it is a matter of course that various alternative or additional features and structures could be adopted therein without deviating from the essence and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.</p>
