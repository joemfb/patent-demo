<heading id="h-0001" level="1">STATEMENT OF RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application may be considered to be related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/893,679 filed on Aug. 16, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,411,764, in the name of inventors Christopher J. Nelson and Kirk B. Bierach, entitled &#x201c;System And Method For Multi-Protocol Radio-Frequency Identification&#x201d;, commonly owned herewith.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology and more specifically to an RFID interrogator.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The development of RFID systems has been fueled by advances in integrated circuit (IC) technology, which enables significant miniaturization of electronic devices, and recent growth in the popularity of wireless communications, which provides a secure and reliable way for transferring information using RF signals. Typically, an RFID system includes an RFID interrogator (or reader) and one or more RFID tags (or contactless IC cards). In operation, the RFID interrogator generates an alternating magnetic field, which induces electric current in a proximate RFID tag. The induced electric current provides enough power to the RFID tag to transmit a response signal to the RFID interrogator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to relative simplicity and low cost of manufacturing, RFID systems have gained a widespread application. For example, RFID technology is commonly used for personal authentication in passports and other forms of ID. In the transportation sector, RFID cards are used to pay for the use of public transportation and highways. In the retail environment, RFID tags are used for product tracking. In the banking industry, RFID technology is embedded in debit and credit cards. In security applications, RFID cards are used to access secure areas or services. In medicine, RFID technology is used in human implants to monitor various health conditions, monitor prescribed drugs and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The growing demand for RFID products has resulted in development of numerous proprietary and non-proprietary RFID technologies. The proprietary nature of some of these technologies often makes them incompatible with each other. For example, RFID systems manufactured by different vendors may use custom communication protocols and data formats and have different power requirements. Despite industry-wide efforts to standardize RFID technologies, there remain numerous incompatible RFID systems. Accordingly, there is a need for an RFID interrogator interoperable with various RFID tags, which may have different protocols, data formats and power requirements.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed are a radio-frequency identification method and system interoperable with disparate RFID communication protocols, data formats and power requirements. In one example embodiment, an IC card reader, such as RFID interrogator, includes a transmitter configured to generate an alternating magnetic field for energizing one or more proximate IC cards and transmit an IC card polling signal. The first alternating magnetic field may correspond to a first output power level. The IC card reader further includes a receiver configured to receive a data transmission from a proximate IC card. The IC card reader further includes a processor configured to attempt to decode in real-time the detected data transmission and generate a control signal when failing to decode the data transmission. In response to the control signal, the transmitter configured to generate a second alternating magnetic field having a different magnetic field strength than the first alternating magnetic field, wherein the second alternating magnetic field corresponds to a second output power level. In one embodiment, the first alternating magnetic field is stronger than the second alternating magnetic field. In another embodiment, the first alternating magnetic field is weaker than the second alternating magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one example embodiment, the processor may be further configured to repeatedly alternate generation of a control signal thereby alternating generation of the first alternating magnetic field and the second alternating magnetic field and attempt to decode data transmissions received from one or more IC cards following generation of each alternating magnetic field. The processor may be further configured to compute the number of decoded data transmissions following the first alternating magnetic fields, and compute the number of data transmission decoded following the second alternating magnetic fields. The processor may be further configured to adjust a duration of the first output power level and a duration of the second output power level as a function of one of (i) the number of decoded data transmissions following the first alternating magnetic fields and (ii) the number of decoded data transmission following the second alternating magnetic fields.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another example embodiment relates to a method for communicating with contactless IC cards. The method includes generating a first alternating magnetic field for energizing a proximate IC card and receiving a data transmission from a proximate IC card. The method further includes attempting to decode the data transmission being received from the IC card. When failing to decode the data transmission being received from the IC card, generating a second alternating magnetic field having a different magnetic field strength than the first alternating magnetic field and again attempting to decode a data transmission being received from the IC card. In one embodiment, the first alternating magnetic field is stronger than the second alternating magnetic field. In another embodiment, the first alternating magnetic field is weaker than the second alternating magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method may further include repeatedly alternating generation of the first alternating magnetic field and the second alternating magnetic field and attempting to decode data transmissions received from one or more IC cards following generation of each alternating magnetic field. The method may further include computing the number of decoded data transmissions following the first alternating magnetic fields, and computing the number of data transmission decoded following the second alternating magnetic fields. The method may further include adjusting a duration of the first output power level and a duration of the second output power level as a function of one of (i) the number of decoded data transmissions following the first alternating magnetic fields and (ii) the number of decoded data transmission following the second alternating magnetic fields.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another example embodiment relates to a method for communicating with contactless IC cards. The method includes generating a first alternating magnetic field for energizing a proximate IC card and transmitting an IC card polling signal. The method further receiving a data transmission from a proximate IC card and determining whether or not the data transmission is being received in response to the polling signal. When the data transmission is being received in response to the polling signal, attempting to decode the data transmission being received. When failing to decode the data transmission being received, generating a second alternating magnetic field having a different magnetic field strength than the first alternating magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method may further include attempting to decode a data transmission being received from the proximate IC card following generation of the second alternating magnetic field. The method may further include determining whether the data transmission being received before or after expiration of a predetermined time period following transmission of the polling signal. The method may further include storing the received data transmission in a memory and decoding the stored data transmission when the data transmission is not being received in response to the polling signal. The format of the data transmission may be determined by determining whether the data transmission includes one or more start bits, determining whether the data transmission includes one or more parity bits, and/or determining whether the data transmission includes one or more cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another embodiment a computer-readable medium comprising computer-executable instructions for configuring operation of a contactless IC card interrogator includes instructions for selecting a first output power level of the IC card interrogator and selecting a second output power level of the IC card interrogator when the IC card interrogator fails to decode one or more data transmissions from a proximate IC card. The computer-executable instructions may further include instructions for selecting a duration of the first output power level and a duration of the second output power level.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Example embodiments are described herein in the context of an RFID communication system. Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the following description is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other embodiments will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure. Reference will now be made in detail to implementations of the example embodiments as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The same reference indicators will be used to the extent possible throughout the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or like items.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the interest of clarity, not all of the routine features of the implementations described herein are shown and described. It will, of course, be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made in order to achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with application- and business-related constraints, and that these specific goals will vary from one implementation to another and from one developer to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of engineering for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with this disclosure, the components, process steps, and/or data structures described herein may be implemented using various types of operating systems, computing platforms, computer programs, and/or general purpose machines. In addition, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that devices of a less general purpose nature, such as hardwired devices, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), or the like, may also be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts disclosed herein. Where a method comprising a series of process steps is implemented by a computer or a machine and those process steps can be stored as a series of instructions readable by the machine, they may be stored on a tangible medium such as a computer memory device (e.g., ROM (Read Only Memory), PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory), EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory), FLASH Memory, Jump Drive, and the like), magnetic storage medium (e.g., tape, magnetic disk drive, and the like), optical storage medium (e.g., CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, paper card, paper tape and the like) and other types of program memory.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram illustrating one example embodiment of an RFID system <b>100</b> is shown. The RFID system <b>100</b> includes RFID interrogator <b>110</b> and a plurality of RFID tags <b>160</b> (<b>160</b>A, <b>160</b>B, <b>160</b>C). The RFID interrogators <b>110</b> includes an RFID controller <b>120</b>, which includes a processor <b>122</b> and memory <b>124</b>. The interrogator <b>110</b> further includes RF transmitter <b>130</b>, which includes a modulator <b>132</b> and power amplifier <b>134</b>. The interrogator <b>110</b> further includes an RF receiver <b>140</b>, which includes a demodulator <b>142</b> and power amplifier <b>144</b>. The interrogator further includes one or more RF antennas <b>150</b>. The diagram has been simplified to include primarily elements of the system <b>100</b> that will be relevant to the discussion that follows. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily identify other elements that might also be included as desired or required. The various elements may be also separated, combined or reordered as desired or required. Other means of implementing the interrogator are also known to those of skill in the art and are not intended to be excluded.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one example embodiment, an interrogator <b>110</b> includes an RFID controller <b>120</b>, which controls operation of various components of interrogator <b>110</b>, such as transmitter <b>130</b> and receiver <b>140</b>. Controller <b>120</b> may be configured to select an operating mode of the interrogator <b>110</b>, determine an output power level of transmitted RF signals, decode data transmissions received from the RFID tags <b>160</b>, and perform other functions known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In one example embodiment, controller <b>120</b> may be implemented as a 8-bit PIC&#xae; programmable microcontroller (available from Microchip Technology, Inc. of Chandler, Ariz.). In alternative embodiments, controller <b>120</b> may be implemented at least in part with a general purpose microprocessor, a field programmable gate array, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example embodiment, controller <b>120</b> includes a processor <b>122</b> and a memory <b>124</b>. Processor <b>122</b> may store and execute program logic for operating various components of the interrogator <b>110</b>, decoding data transmissions received from various RFID tags <b>160</b>, performing arithmetic and logic operations and other functions. The processor <b>122</b> is coupled to memory <b>124</b> (which may be implemented as on-board memory), which may be used to store executable program instructions and other data for use by processor <b>122</b> during decoding of RFID information. Memory <b>124</b> may include volatile or non-volatile program memory, such as ROM (Read Only Memory), PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory), EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory), FLASH memory, and other types of magnetic and optical storage media for storing RFID information and other data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one example embodiment, interrogator <b>110</b> includes a RF transmitter <b>130</b>, which is operable to receive digital data from processor <b>122</b>, modulate the receive data using modulator <b>132</b>, amplify the modulated signal using power amplifier <b>134</b> and route the amplified RF signal to antenna <b>150</b>. In addition, transmitter <b>130</b> is configured to generate alternating magnetic field for energizing IC cards proximate to the interrogator <b>110</b>. Modulator <b>132</b> may be configured to receive a data bit sequence from processor <b>122</b> and modulate a receive bit sequence on a carrier signal. The carrier signal may be generated by an oscillator (not shown) and have 13.56 MHz frequence in compliance with ISO/IEC 14443 standard for contactless IC cards. Other frequencies may be used, if desired. Modulator <b>132</b> may be configured to use one or more of the various known signal modulation techniques, including amplitude modulation (such as Manchester or QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) modulation), frequency modulation (such as FSK (Frequency-Shift Keying) modulation), or phase modulation (such as PSK (Phase-Shift Keying) modulation) and variants thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">RF transmitter <b>130</b> may further include a power amplifier <b>134</b> for amplifying a modulated data signal and routing it to the antenna <b>150</b>, which radiates the amplified signal to proximate RFID tags. In one example embodiment, controller <b>120</b> may control an output power level of amplifier <b>134</b>. To that end, power amplifier <b>134</b> may be implemented as a multi-stage variable power amplifier, which may (in response to a control signal from RFID controller <b>120</b>) increase/decrease its output power level by turning on/off one or more of its amplification stages. In alternative embodiments, the transmitter <b>130</b> may use other variable-power amplification techniques known to those skilled in the art. In one example embodiment, amplifier <b>134</b> may vary its output power level from 3.5 A/m to 12.5 A/m in 0.5 A/m increments. The desired output power range may be selected based on specific power requirements of one or more RFID tags.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one example embodiment, interrogator <b>110</b> includes an RF receiver <b>140</b>, which is configured to receive data transmissions from antenna <b>150</b>, demodulate the received data using demodulator <b>142</b>, amplify the demodulated digital data signal using power amplifier <b>144</b> and route the amplified signal to processor <b>122</b> for decoding. To demodulate a signal, demodulator <b>132</b> may use a PLL (Phase Lock Loop) (not shown) and a reference signal generated by an oscillator (not shown) to synchronise itself with the incoming data transmission and extract a digital data signal from the carrier signal. Furthermore, demodulator <b>132</b> needs to know the modulation type of the incoming data transmission, which, in most cases, will be identical to the modulation type used by the transmitter <b>132</b>. The demodulated data signal is amplified and routed to processor <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one example embodiment, interrogator <b>110</b> includes one or more RF antennas <b>150</b> for transmitting and receiving RF signals. In one example embodiment, antenna <b>150</b> may be implemented as a single mono-static RF antenna, which may transmit a signal coming from transmitter <b>130</b> as well as receive a signal coming from a RFID tag <b>160</b>. Switching between transmitting and receiving modes may require use of a circulator (not shown) that multiplexes the received and transmitted signals through a single port. In another example embodiment, antenna <b>150</b> may be implemented as a bi-static antenna, including two antennas, where one antenna is dedicated to transmitting, and the other antenna is dedicated to receiving. Use of a bi-static antenna can improve the sensitivity of antenna <b>150</b>, thereby improving the performance of interrogator <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one example embodiment, RFID interrogator <b>110</b> has two operating modes: reader talk first (RTF) mode and tag talk first (TTF) mode. In the RTF mode, the interrogator <b>110</b> initiates a communication session with an RFID tag by transmitting a polling signal, which may be detected by RTF tags <b>160</b> located in the proximity of interrogator <b>110</b>. RFID tag <b>160</b> may process the received polling signal and respond to the interrogator <b>110</b> with a response data transmission. In the TTF mode, an RFID tag <b>160</b> initiates a communication session when placed in proximity of interrogator <b>110</b> by either sending a beacon signal or starting the actual data transmission. In this mode, interrogator <b>110</b> listens for any signals detected at the receiver <b>140</b>. When a data transmission is detected from a TTF tag <b>160</b>, interrogator <b>110</b> attempts to decode it using methods described hereinbelow. The interrogator <b>110</b> may periodically alternate between the two operating modes, thereby managing to read different types of RFID tags.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one example embodiment, interrogator <b>110</b> may use different methods for decoding RTF and TTF data transmissions. RTF transmissions may be decoded in real-time, because interrogator <b>110</b> may know the format of the data transmission in advance. In particular, an RTF data transmission is send by the RTF tag <b>160</b> in response to a polling signal transmitted by the interrogator <b>110</b>. The polling signal may contain information about communication protocol utilized by the interrogator <b>110</b>, such as a version number of the communication protocol, vendor information, data format information and the like. In this way, the RTF tag knows how to format its response data transmission, so it can be decoded by interrogator <b>110</b> on the fly. In contrast, TTF transmissions are initiated by RFID tags <b>160</b> and thus cannot be decoded in real-time because the format of the data transmission is not known to interrogator <b>110</b> in advance. To that end, the interrogator <b>110</b> stores the entire TTF data transmission in memory <b>124</b> and only then begins decoding of the stored data transmission, as discussed herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an example embodiment of an RFID interrogation process <b>200</b> is illustrated in a flow diagram. At step <b>205</b>, RFID interrogator enters RTF mode and sends a polling command. At step <b>210</b>, the interrogator listens to a channel for a first predetermined period of time, which is sufficiently long to receive a response from a RTF tag located in the proximity of the RFID interrogator. In one example embodiment, the period of time may correspond to a frame delay time, which may vary between different communication standards. The International Standards Organization (ISO) has adopted standard ISO/IEC 14443-1:2000 entitled &#x201c;Identification cards&#x2014;Contactless integrated circuit(s) cards&#x2014;Proximity cards&#x201d; as amended by ISO/EEC 1443-2:2001, ISO/IEC 14443-3:2001 and ISO/IEC 14443-4:2001. In accordance with that standard, which applies to many IC cards in use today, the ISO/IEC 14443 standard frame delay time is set to 91.1 microseconds. If a data transmission is received within the predetermined period of time, the RFID interrogator concludes that it comes in response to the polling command from a proximate RTF RFID tag, step <b>215</b>. The interrogator then demodulates, amplifies and decodes in real time the data transmission being received, step <b>220</b>. The processor then extracts identification information from the decoded bit sequence for further processing, step <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If no data transmission was received in the first predetermined time period, step <b>210</b>, the RFID interrogator enters TTF mode, step <b>230</b>. In the TTF mode, the interrogator listens to a channel for a second predetermined period of time, which may be arbitrarily selected by a system administrator. In one example embodiment, the TTF mode may last for 300 milliseconds, step <b>235</b>. If no data transmission was received during the second predetermined time period, the RFID interrogator may switch back to the RTF mode, described above. If data transmission is detected during the second time period, the interrogator concludes that the data transmission is coming from TTF RFID tag, step <b>245</b>. The interrogator then demodulates the received data transmission and stores it in memory for further processing using algorithms described hereinbelow, step <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another example embodiment, interrogator <b>110</b> may be interoperable with different power types of RFID tags, such as RFID tags that require lower power and RFID tags that require higher power energizing alternating magnetic fields from the interrogator <b>110</b>. For example, ISO/IEC 14443 standard limits the unmodulated field strength to between 1.5 A/m minimum and 7.5 A/m maximum. Some tags that use variants of the ISO/IEC 14443 standard may require alternating magnetic field of 12.5 A/m to function properly, while other tags may require magnetic field of 3.5 A/m only. Therefore, low-power RFID tags may be internally overdriven by interrogators having strong magnetic field and thus may be unreadable. In contrast, high-power RFID tags may not turn on properly, have insufficient read range, or have bit errors if not supplied with adequate power by the interrogator.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">To accommodate different power type RFID tags, interrogator <b>110</b> may be configured to switch between different power levels by continuously adjusting its magnetic field strength until successful reading of a proximate RFID tag. In one example embodiment, interrogator may be set at low power level to generate alternating magnetic field of 3.5 A/m. If a tag <b>160</b> is read but errors are detected, the magnetic field strength may be increased in, for example, 0.5 A/m increments, by increasing transmitter's output power, until the read is successful. In another embodiment, interrogator <b>110</b> may be set to high power level to generate alternating magnetic field of 12.5 A/m. If a tag <b>160</b> is read but errors are detected, the magnetic field strength may be decreased by decreasing transmitter's output power until the read is successful. Yet in another embodiment, interrogator <b>110</b> may be configured to continuously sweep the output power from low to high to low in a periodic manner, thereby managing to communicate both with low and high power RFID tags.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In example embodiment, interrogator <b>110</b> may be configured to learn the power types of RFID tags that come in contact with the interrogator <b>110</b> and then adjust the duration of each output power level accordingly. For example, interrogator <b>110</b> may keep a running count of the number of RFID tags of each power type read during a predetermined time period and then dwell at a specific output power level more often than other power levels. Depending on the interrogator's magnetic field strength when the RFID tag read occurs, interrogator <b>110</b> may classify the tag as high or low power. For example, if the last 100 reads show 80 high power tags and 20 low power tags, the interrogator <b>110</b> may set the output power level bias towards high power tags, e.g. set dwell times to an 80% high power and 20% low power duty cycle. In another example, interrogator <b>110</b> may operate at high output power level and only decrease the output power when a data communication from a detected RFID tag has errors due to requirement for lower power from the interrogator <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an example embodiment of a variable output power RFID interrogation process is illustrated in a flow diagram. At step <b>305</b>, interrogator <b>110</b> generates an alternating magnetic field having a predetermined magnetic field strength, e.g., 12.5 A/m. The interrogator listens for a predetermine time period, such as 91.1 microseconds, for data transmissions from proximate RFID tags, step <b>310</b>. When a data transmission is detected, processor <b>122</b> attempts to decode the data transmission. If interrogator <b>110</b> fails to decode the data transmission due to one or more errors therein, step <b>315</b>, the processor <b>122</b> may select another output power level, which may be higher or lower than the previous output power level, and send a control signal to RF transmitter <b>130</b> to adjust magnetic field strength accordingly, step <b>320</b>. In response, transmitter <b>130</b> generates an alternating magnetic field having a different field strength, such as 7.5 m/A. Steps <b>305</b> through <b>320</b> may be repeated for a predetermined time period, a predetermine number of output power levels, or until a data transmission from a proximate RFID tag <b>160</b> is decoded and output for further processing, step <b>325</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once a data transmission from an RFID tag is decoded and output for further processing, step <b>325</b>, the interrogator may be configured to repeat the interrogation cycle in steps <b>305</b> through <b>325</b> for a predetermined period of time, step <b>330</b>, predetermined number of interrogation cycles, or predetermined number of successful tag reads. During interrogation, the processor <b>122</b> may keep a running count of the number of RFID tags read at each power level, step <b>335</b>. Once the total number of RFID tag read for each power level is computers, the processor may adjust duration of each output power level to correspond to the number of tags read at the given output power level. For example, if during 24 hour time interval, the interrogator read 80 high power tags and 20 low power tags, the interrogator <b>110</b> will set the output power level bias towards high power tags, e.g. set dwell times to an 80% high power and 20% low power duty cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another example embodiment, interrogator <b>110</b> may be configured to operate at multiple power levels while supporting both TTF and RTF tags. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram of example embodiment of RFID interrogation process having combined multiple power levels and TTF/RTF capabilities. At step <b>405</b>, interrogator <b>110</b> generates an alternating magnetic field having a predetermined magnetic field strength for energizing proximate RFID tags. The interrogator then enters RTF mode and sends a polling command, step <b>410</b>. The interrogator then listens for a predetermined time period, such as 91.1 microseconds, for data transmissions from proximate RFID tags, step <b>415</b>. If data transmission is detected during this time period, the interrogator may enter a TTF mode, step <b>420</b>, and listen for a predetermined time period for data transmissions from TTF tags, as will be described in greater detail herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If a data transmission from a RTF tag is detected, step <b>415</b>, the interrogator attempts to decode it, step <b>425</b>. If interrogator <b>110</b> fails to decode the data transmission due to one or more errors therein, the processor <b>122</b> selects another output power level, which may be higher or lower than the previous output power level, and send a control signal to RF transmitter <b>130</b> to adjust magnetic field strength accordingly, step <b>435</b>. In response, transmitter <b>130</b> generates an alternating magnetic field having a different field strength, step <b>440</b>. Steps <b>415</b> through <b>440</b> may be repeated for a predetermined time period, a predetermine number of output power levels, or until a data transmission from a proximate RFID tag <b>160</b> is detected, decoded and output for further processing, step <b>445</b>. Once a data transmission from TTF tag or RTF tag has been processed, interrogator <b>110</b> may be configured to repeat the interrogation cycle in steps <b>405</b> through <b>445</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As indicated above, in the TTF mode, RFID interrogator <b>110</b> is configured to interrogate RFID tags <b>160</b> that use one or more variations of the ISO/IEC 14443 standard for contactless IC cards. Depending on the variation used by RFID tag <b>160</b>, the data transmitted by the tag <b>160</b> may be formatted to contain one or more start bits (S), one or more data bits (D), odd (O) or event (E) parity bits and cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits (C). Below are several examples of bit sequences that interrogator <b>110</b> may be able to decode:</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">S DDDDDDDDO DDDDDDDDO CCCCCCCCO CCCCCCCCO (standard ISO/IEC 14443-A bit steam)</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">DDDDDDDD DDDDDDDD (no start bit, no parity bits, no CRC)</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">DDDDDDDD DDDDDDDD CCCCCCCC CCCCCCCC (no start bit, no parity bits, CRC)</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">S DDDDDDDDO DDDDDDDDO (start bit, odd parity bits, no CRC)</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">S DDDDDDDDE DDDDDDDDE CCCCCCCCE CCCCCCCCE (start bit, even parity bits, and CRC)</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In order to decode these and other bit sequences, the RFID interrogator may use the following decoding algorithm: First, RFID interrogator counts the number of bits in the received bit sequence to see if there is a start bit or not. Second, the interrogator checks each byte to see if there is even, odd or no parity bits. Third, the interrogator checks for the presence of a 16 bit CRC sequence. Once all of these parameters are determined the data is output in the corresponding format. This allows the interrogator to read tags that are fully ISO/EEC 14443 compliant as well as RFID tags that use a TTF variant of the ISO/IEC 14443 communication standard. Each of the above data processing steps will be described in a greater detail hereinbelow with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an example embodiment of a process <b>500</b> for determining the presence of one or more start bits in the RFID data transmission is illustrated in flow diagram form. At step <b>505</b>, a processor in the RFID interrogator calculates the total number of bits in the received data transmission. The processor then determines if the total number of bits in the data transmission is divisible by 8 without remainder, step <b>510</b>. If the total number of bits is divisible by eight without remainder, the processor concludes that there is no start bit in the data transmission, step <b>515</b>. If the total number of bits is divisible by eight with remainder of 1, step <b>520</b>, the processor concludes that there is a start bit, step <b>525</b>, and it is removed from the bit sequence, step <b>330</b>. If the total number of bits is not evenly divisible by eight, step <b>502</b>, the processor then checks if the total number of bits is evenly divisible by 9, step <b>535</b>. If the total number of bits is divisible by nine without remainder, the processor concludes that there is no start bit in the data transmission, step <b>540</b>.

<claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001">
<claim-text>1. A method for communicating with contactless IC cards, the method comprising:
<claim-text>generating a first alternating magnetic field for energizing a proximate IC card;</claim-text>
<claim-text>transmitting an IC card polling signal;</claim-text>
<claim-text>receiving a data transmission from the proximate IC card;</claim-text>
<claim-text>storing the received data transmission in a memory and decoding the stored data transmission when the data transmission is not being received in response to the polling signal, wherein the decoding includes determining the format of the stored data transmission, which, in turn, includes:</claim-text>
<claim-text>determining whether the data transmission includes one or more start bits;</claim-text>
<claim-text>determining whether the data transmission includes one or more parity bits; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>determining whether the data transmission includes one or more cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits;</claim-text>
<claim-text>determining whether or not the data transmission is being received in response to the polling signal, which includes determining whether the data transmission was received before or after expiration of a predetermined time period following transmission of the polling signal;</claim-text>
<claim-text>attempting to decode the data transmission being received when the data transmission is being received in response to the polling signal;</claim-text>
<claim-text>generating a second alternating magnetic field when failing to decode the data transmission being received, the second alternating magnetic field having different magnetic field strength than the first alternating magnetic field;</claim-text>
<claim-text>keeping a count corresponding to the attempt to decode data transmissions following the first alternating magnetic field;</claim-text>
<claim-text>alternating between generating the first alternating magnetic field and generating the second alternating magnetic field as a function of the count corresponding to the attempt to decode data transmissions; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>attempting to decode a data transmission being received from the proximate IC card following generation of the second alternating magnetic field.</claim-text>
