</abstract>
<description id="description">
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">There are various methods that can be employed to adjust or control the melt flow properties (such as melt index) and the molecular weight parameters (such as weight-average molecular weight) of an olefin polymer produced using a metallocene-based catalyst system. For instance, the metallocene compound and/or the polymerization reaction conditions can be changed to vary the melt flow properties and the molecular weight characteristics of the polymer that is produced. However, additional methods of adjusting or controlling the polymer properties are needed which do not require changes in the metallocene compound or the polymerization conditions. Accordingly, it is to this end that the present disclosure is directed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify required or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Nor is this summary intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to olefin polymerizations and to processes and methods directed to controlling these olefin polymerization and the resultant properties of the olefin polymer. For example, aspects of the present invention are directed to an olefin polymerization process which can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and an optional olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer, wherein the catalyst composition can comprise a metallocene compound and a transition metal-modified activator-support. The transition metal-modified activator-support can comprise a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion and impregnated with a Group VIII transition metal. Optionally, the catalyst composition can further comprise a co-catalyst, such as an organoaluminum compound. Unexpectedly, in these olefin polymerization processes, the melt index (MI) of the olefin polymer produced by the process can be at least 10% less than a MI of an olefin polymer obtained under the same polymerization conditions using an activator-support without the Group VIII transition metal.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods of controlling or adjusting melt flow properties and/or molecular weight parameters of an olefin polymer&#x2014;for example, an ethylene-based homopolymer or copolymer&#x2014;also are disclosed and described herein. In one aspect, a method for reducing a melt flow property (e.g., MI, HLMI, etc.) of an olefin polymer is provided, and in this aspect, the method can comprise (a) contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and an optional olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce the olefin polymer, wherein the catalyst composition can comprise a metallocene compound, an activator-support (without a Group VIII transition metal), and an optional co-catalyst; and (b) introducing an amount of a transition metal-modified activator-support into the polymerization reactor system to reduce the melt flow property of the olefin polymer. The transition metal-modified activator-support can comprise a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion and impregnated with a Group VIII transition metal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect, a method for increasing a molecular weight parameter (e.g., Mw, Mz, etc.) of an olefin polymer is provided, and in this aspect, the method can comprise (a) contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and an optional olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce the olefin polymer, wherein the catalyst composition can comprise a metallocene compound, an activator-support (without a Group VIII transition metal), and an optional co-catalyst; and (b) introducing an amount of a transition metal-modified activator-support into the polymerization reactor system to increase the molecular weight parameter of the olefin polymer. The transition metal-modified activator-support can comprise a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion and impregnated with a Group VIII transition metal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Both the foregoing summary and the following detailed description provide examples and are explanatory only. Accordingly, the foregoing summary and the following detailed description should not be considered to be restrictive. Further, features or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein. For example, certain aspects and embodiments may be directed to various feature combinations and sub-combinations described in the detailed description.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To define more clearly the terms used herein, the following definitions are provided. Unless otherwise indicated, the following definitions are applicable to this disclosure. If a term is used in this disclosure but is not specifically defined herein, the definition from the IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd Ed (1997), can be applied, as long as that definition does not conflict with any other disclosure or definition applied herein, or render indefinite or non-enabled any claim to which that definition is applied. To the extent that any definition or usage provided by any document incorporated herein by reference conflicts with the definition or usage provided herein, the definition or usage provided herein controls.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Regarding claim transitional terms or phrases, the transitional term &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; which is synonymous with &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;containing,&#x201d; or &#x201c;characterized by,&#x201d; is open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. The transitional phrase &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim. The transitional phrase &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; limits the scope of a claim to the specified components or steps and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. A &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; claim occupies a middle ground between closed claims that are written in a &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; format and fully open claims that are drafted in a &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; format. For example, a composition consisting essentially of component A can include impurities typically present in a commercially produced or commercially available sample of component A. When a claim includes different features and/or feature classes (for example, a method step, composition features, among other possibilities), the transitional terms comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of, apply only to the feature class to which it is utilized, and it is possible to have different transitional terms or phrases utilized with different features within a claim. For example, a method can consist of certain steps, but utilize a catalyst system comprising recited components and other non-recited components. While compositions and methods are described herein in terms of &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; various components or steps, the compositions and methods can also &#x201c;consist essentially of&#x201d; or &#x201c;consist of&#x201d; the various components or steps, unless stated otherwise. For example, a catalyst composition consistent with certain aspects of the present invention can comprise; alternatively, can consist essentially of; or alternatively, can consist of; (i) a metallocene compound, (ii) a transition metal-modified activator-support, and (iii) optionally, a co-catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The terms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; etc., are intended to include plural alternatives, e.g., at least one, unless otherwise specified. For instance, the disclosure of &#x201c;a co-catalyst&#x201d; or &#x201c;a metallocene compound&#x201d; is meant to encompass one, or mixtures or combinations of more than one, co-catalyst or metallocene compound, respectively, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For any particular compound disclosed herein, the general structure or name presented is also intended to encompass all structural isomers, conformational isomers, and stereoisomers that can arise from a particular set of substituents, unless indicated otherwise. Thus, a general reference to a compound includes all structural isomers unless explicitly indicated otherwise; e.g., a general reference to pentane includes n-pentane, 2-methyl-butane, and 2,2-dimethylpropane, while a general reference to a butyl group includes an n-butyl group, a sec-butyl group, an iso-butyl group, and a tert-butyl group. Additionally, the reference to a general structure or name encompasses all enantiomers, diastereomers, and other optical isomers whether in enantiomeric or racemic forms, as well as mixtures of stereoisomers, as the context permits or requires. For any particular formula or name that is presented, any general formula or name presented also encompasses all conformational isomers, regioisomers, and stereoisomers that can arise from a particular set of substituents.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;substituted&#x201d; when used to describe a group, for example, when referring to a substituted analog of a particular group, is intended to describe any non-hydrogen moiety that formally replaces a hydrogen in that group, and is intended to be non-limiting. A group or groups can also be referred to herein as &#x201c;unsubstituted&#x201d; or by equivalent terms such as &#x201c;non-substituted,&#x201d; which refers to the original group in which a non-hydrogen moiety does not replace a hydrogen within that group. Unless otherwise specified, &#x201c;substituted&#x201d; is intended to be non-limiting and include inorganic substituents or organic substituents as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The term &#x201c;hydrocarbon&#x201d; whenever used in this specification and claims refers to a compound containing only carbon and hydrogen. Other identifiers can be utilized to indicate the presence of particular groups in the hydrocarbon (e.g., halogenated hydrocarbon indicates that the presence of one or more halogen atoms replacing an equivalent number of hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbon). The term &#x201c;hydrocarbyl group&#x201d; is used herein in accordance with the definition specified by IUPAC: a univalent group formed by removing a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon (that is, a group containing only carbon and hydrogen). Non-limiting examples of hydrocarbyl groups include ethyl, phenyl, tolyl, propenyl, and the like. Similarly, a &#x201c;hydrocarbylene group&#x201d; refers to a group formed by removing two hydrogen atoms from a hydrocarbon, either two hydrogen atoms from one carbon atom or one hydrogen atom from each of two different carbon atoms. Therefore, in accordance with the terminology used herein, a &#x201c;hydrocarbon group&#x201d; refers to a generalized group formed by removing one or more hydrogen atoms (as necessary for the particular group) from a hydrocarbon. A &#x201c;hydrocarbyl group,&#x201d; &#x201c;hydrocarbylene group,&#x201d; and &#x201c;hydrocarbon group&#x201d; can be aliphatic or aromatic, acyclic or cyclic, and/or linear or branched. A &#x201c;hydrocarbyl group,&#x201d; &#x201c;hydrocarbylene group,&#x201d; and &#x201c;hydrocarbon group&#x201d; can include rings, ring systems, aromatic rings, and aromatic ring systems, which contain only carbon and hydrogen. &#x201c;Hydrocarbyl groups,&#x201d; &#x201c;hydrocarbylene groups,&#x201d; and &#x201c;hydrocarbon groups&#x201d; include, by way of example, aryl, arylene, arene groups, alkyl, alkylene, alkane groups, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylene, cycloalkane groups, aralkyl, aralkylene, and aralkane groups, respectively, among other groups as members.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The term &#x201c;alkane&#x201d; whenever used in this specification and claims refers to a saturated hydrocarbon compound. Other identifiers can be utilized to indicate the presence of particular groups in the alkane (e.g., halogenated alkane indicates that the presence of one or more halogen atoms replacing an equivalent number of hydrogen atoms in the alkane). The term &#x201c;alkyl group&#x201d; is used herein in accordance with the definition specified by IUPAC: a univalent group formed by removing a hydrogen atom from an alkane. Similarly, an &#x201c;alkylene group&#x201d; refers to a group formed by removing two hydrogen atoms from an alkane (either two hydrogen atoms from one carbon atom or one hydrogen atom from two different carbon atoms). An &#x201c;alkane group&#x201d; is a general term that refers to a group formed by removing one or more hydrogen atoms (as necessary for the particular group) from an alkane. An &#x201c;alkyl group,&#x201d; &#x201c;alkylene group,&#x201d; and &#x201c;alkane group&#x201d; can be acyclic or cyclic and/or linear or branched unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The term &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; is used herein generically to include olefin homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, and so forth. A copolymer is derived from an olefin monomer and one olefin comonomer, while a terpolymer is derived from an olefin monomer and two olefin comonomers. Accordingly, &#x201c;polymer&#x201d; encompasses copolymers, terpolymers, etc., derived from any olefin monomer and comonomer(s) disclosed herein. Similarly, an ethylene polymer would include ethylene homopolymers, ethylene copolymers, ethylene terpolymers, and the like. As an example, an olefin copolymer, such as an ethylene copolymer, can be derived from ethylene and a comonomer, such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene. If the monomer and comonomer were ethylene and 1-hexene, respectively, the resulting polymer could be categorized an as ethylene/1-hexene copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In like manner, the scope of the term &#x201c;polymerization&#x201d; includes homopolymerization, copolymerization, terpolymerization, etc. Therefore, a copolymerization process could involve contacting one olefin monomer (e.g., ethylene) and one olefin comonomer (e.g., 1-hexene) to produce a copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;co-catalyst&#x201d; is used generally herein to refer to compounds such as aluminoxane compounds, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organoaluminum compounds, organozinc compounds, organomagnesium compounds, organolithium compounds, and the like, that can constitute one component of a catalyst composition, when used, for example, in addition to an activator-support. The term &#x201c;co-catalyst&#x201d; is used regardless of the actual function of the compound or any chemical mechanism by which the compound may operate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The terms &#x201c;activator-support,&#x201d; &#x201c;chemically-treated solid oxide,&#x201d; &#x201c;treated solid oxide compound,&#x201d; and the like, are used herein to indicate a solid, inorganic oxide of relatively high porosity, which can exhibit Lewis acidic or Br&#xf8;nsted acidic behavior, and which has been treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an anion, and which is calcined. The electron-withdrawing component is typically an electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Thus, the chemically-treated solid oxide can comprise a calcined contact product of at least one solid oxide with at least one electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Typically, the chemically-treated solid oxide comprises at least one acidic solid oxide compound. The term &#x201c;activator-support&#x201d; is not used to imply these activator-support components are inert, and such components should not be construed as an inert component of a catalyst composition. The term &#x201c;activator,&#x201d; as used herein, refers generally to a substance that is capable of converting a metallocene component into a catalyst that can polymerize olefins, or converting a contact product of a metallocene component and a component that provides an activatable ligand (e.g., an alkyl, a hydride) to the metallocene, when the metallocene compound does not already comprise such a ligand, into a catalyst that can polymerize olefins. This term is used regardless of the actual activating mechanism. Illustrative activators include activator-supports or chemically-treated solid oxides.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;fluoroorgano boron compound&#x201d; is used herein with its ordinary meaning to refer to neutral compounds of the form BY<sub>3</sub>. The term &#x201c;fluoroorgano borate compound&#x201d; also has its usual meaning to refer to the monoanionic salts of a fluoroorgano boron compound of the form [cation]<sup>+</sup>[BY<sub>4</sub>]<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, where Y represents a fluorinated organic group. Materials of these types are generally and collectively referred to as &#x201c;organoboron or organoborate compounds.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;metallocene&#x201d; as used herein, describe compounds comprising at least one &#x3b7;<sub>1</sub><sup>3 </sup>to &#x3b7;<sub>1</sub><sup>5</sup>-cycloalkadienyl-type moiety, wherein &#x3b7;<sub>1</sub><sup>3 </sup>to &#x3b7;<sup>5</sup>-cycloalkadienyl moieties include cyclopentadienyl ligands, indenyl ligands, fluorenyl ligands, and the like, including partially saturated or substituted derivatives or analogs of any of these. Possible substituents on these ligands may include H, therefore this invention comprises ligands such as tetrahydroindenyl, tetrahydrofluorenyl, octahydrofluorenyl, partially saturated indenyl, partially saturated fluorenyl, substituted partially saturated indenyl, substituted partially saturated fluorenyl, and the like. In some contexts, the metallocene can be referred to simply as the &#x201c;catalyst,&#x201d; in much the same way the term &#x201c;co-catalyst&#x201d; can be used herein to refer to, for example, an organoaluminum compound.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The terms &#x201c;catalyst composition,&#x201d; &#x201c;catalyst mixture,&#x201d; &#x201c;catalyst system,&#x201d; and the like, do not depend upon the actual product or composition resulting from the contact or reaction of the initial components of the claimed catalyst composition/mixture/system, the nature of the active catalytic site, or the fate of the co-catalyst, the metallocene compound, any olefin monomer used to prepare a precontacted mixture, or the activator-support(s), after combining these components. Therefore, the terms &#x201c;catalyst composition,&#x201d; &#x201c;catalyst mixture,&#x201d; &#x201c;catalyst system,&#x201d; and the like, encompass the initial starting components of the composition, as well as whatever product(s) may result from contacting these initial starting components, and this is inclusive of both heterogeneous and homogenous catalyst systems or compositions. The terms &#x201c;catalyst composition,&#x201d; &#x201c;catalyst mixture,&#x201d; &#x201c;catalyst system,&#x201d; and the like, can be used interchangeably throughout this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;contact product&#x201d; is used herein to describe compositions wherein the components are contacted together in any order, in any manner, and for any length of time. For example, the components can be contacted by blending or mixing. Further, contacting of any component can occur in the presence or absence of any other component of the compositions described herein. Combining additional materials or components can be done by any suitable method. Further, the term &#x201c;contact product&#x201d; includes mixtures, blends, solutions, slurries, reaction products, and the like, or combinations thereof. Although &#x201c;contact product&#x201d; can include reaction products, it is not required for the respective components to react with one another.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Applicants disclose several types of ranges in the present invention. When Applicants disclose or claim a range of any type, Applicants' intent is to disclose or claim individually each possible number that such a range could reasonably encompass, including end points of the range as well as any sub-ranges and combinations of sub-ranges encompassed therein. For example, when the Applicants disclose or claim a chemical moiety having a certain number of carbon atoms, Applicants' intent is to disclose or claim individually every possible number that such a range could encompass, consistent with the disclosure herein. For example, the disclosure that a moiety is a C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>18 </sub>hydrocarbyl group, or in alternative language, a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, as used herein, refers to a moiety that can be selected independently from a hydrocarbyl group having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 carbon atoms, as well as any range between these two numbers (for example, a C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>8 </sub>hydrocarbyl group), and also including any combination of ranges between these two numbers (for example, a C<sub>2 </sub>to C<sub>4 </sub>and a C<sub>12 </sub>to C<sub>16 </sub>hydrocarbyl group).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Disclosed herein are polymerization processes and methods directed to the use of a transition metal-modified activator-support to reduce a melt flow property (such as melt index, MI) and/or to increase a molecular weight parameter (such as weight-average molecular weight, Mw) of an olefin polymer. The transition metal-modified activator-support can comprise a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion and impregnated with a Group VIII transition metal (such as cobalt, nickel, palladium, platinum, and the like).</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Metallocene Compounds</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Generally, the processes and methods disclosed herein are intended for catalyst systems containing a metallocene compound (one or more than one). The metallocene compound can comprise, for example, a transition metal from Groups III, IV, V, or VI of the Periodic Table of the Elements, or a combination of two or more transition metals. The metallocene compound can comprise chromium, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, or a combination thereof, or can comprise titanium, zirconium, hafnium, or a combination thereof, in certain aspects. Accordingly, the metallocene compound can comprise titanium, or zirconium, or hafnium, either singly or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While not being limited thereto, the metallocene compound can comprise an unbridged metallocene compound in an aspect of this invention. For instance, the metallocene compound can comprise an unbridged zirconium or hafnium based metallocene compound and/or an unbridged zirconium and/or hafnium based dinuclear metallocene compound. In one aspect, the metallocene compound can comprise an unbridged zirconium or hafnium based metallocene compound containing two cyclopentadienyl groups, two indenyl groups, or a cyclopentadienyl and an indenyl group. In another aspect, the metallocene compound can comprise an unbridged zirconium based metallocene compound containing two cyclopentadienyl groups, two indenyl groups, or a cyclopentadienyl and an indenyl group. Illustrative and non-limiting examples of unbridged metallocene compounds (e.g., with zirconium or hafnium) that can be employed in catalyst systems consistent with aspects of the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,226,886 and 7,619,047, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other aspects, the metallocene compound can comprise an unbridged zirconium and/or hafnium based dinuclear metallocene compound. For example, the metallocene compound can comprise an unbridged zirconium based homodinuclear metallocene compound, or an unbridged hafnium based homodinuclear metallocene compound, or an unbridged zirconium and/or hafnium based heterodinuclear metallocene compound (i.e., a dinuclear compound with two hafniums, or two zirconiums, or one zirconium and one hafnium). These and other suitable dinuclear compounds (bridged and unbridged) are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,863,210, 7,919,639, 8,012,900, and 8,080,681, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The metallocene compound can comprise a bridged metallocene compound, e.g., with titanium, zirconium, or hafnium. Accordingly, the metallocene compound can comprise a bridged zirconium based metallocene compound with a fluorenyl group, and with no aryl groups on the bridging group, or a bridged zirconium based metallocene compound with a cyclopentadienyl group and a fluorenyl group, and with no aryl groups on the bridging group. Such bridged metallocenes, in some aspects, can contain an alkenyl substituent (e.g., a terminal alkenyl) on the bridging group and/or on a cyclopentadienyl-type group (e.g., a cyclopentadienyl group, a fluorenyl group, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another aspect, the metallocene compound can comprise a bridged zirconium or hafnium based metallocene compound with a fluorenyl group, and an aryl group on the bridging group. Thus, the metallocene compound can comprise a bridged zirconium or hafnium based metallocene compound with a cyclopentadienyl group and fluorenyl group, and an aryl group on the bridging group; alternatively, a bridged zirconium based metallocene compound with a fluorenyl group, and an aryl group on the bridging group; or alternatively, a bridged hafnium based metallocene compound with a fluorenyl group, and an aryl group on the bridging group. In these and other aspects, the aryl group on the bridging group can be a phenyl group. Optionally, these bridged metallocenes can contain an alkenyl substituent (e.g., a terminal alkenyl) on the bridging group and/or on a cyclopentadienyl-type group.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Illustrative and non-limiting examples of bridged metallocene compounds (e.g., with zirconium or hafnium) that can be employed in catalyst systems consistent with aspects of the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,041,617, 7,226,886, 7,517,939, and 7,619,047, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one aspect, the catalyst composition contains only one metallocene compound, while in another aspect, the catalyst composition contains two or more metallocene compounds. If two or more metallocene compounds are used, the relative amounts of each respective metallocene compound are not restricted to any particular range. For instance, if the catalyst composition contains two metallocene compounds, the weight ratio of the first metallocene catalyst component to the second metallocene catalyst component can be in a range of from about 1:100 to about 100:1, from about 1:50 to about 50:1, from about 1:20 to about 20:1, from about 1:10 to about 10:1, or from about 1:5 to about 5:1. Accordingly, suitable ranges for the weight ratio of the first metallocene catalyst component to the second metallocene catalyst component can include, but are not limited to, from about 1:4 to about 4:1, from about 1:3 to about 3:1, from about 1:2 to about 2:1, from about 1:1.5 to about 1.5:1, from about 1:1.25 to about 1.25:1, or from about 1:1.1 to about 1.1:1, and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present invention contemplates a method of precontacting a metallocene compound (or compounds) with an organoaluminum compound and an olefin monomer to form a precontacted mixture, prior to contacting this precontacted mixture with the activator-support (or transition metal-modified activator-support) to form a catalyst composition. When the catalyst composition is prepared in this manner, typically, though not necessarily, a portion of the organoaluminum compound can be added to the precontacted mixture and another portion of the organoaluminum compound can be added to the postcontacted mixture prepared when the precontacted mixture is contacted with the solid oxide activator-support(s). However, the entire organoaluminum compound can be used to prepare the catalyst composition in either the precontacting or postcontacting step. Alternatively, all the catalyst components can be contacted in a single step.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, more than one organoaluminum compound can be used in either the precontacting or the postcontacting step. When an organoaluminum compound is added in multiple steps, the amounts of organoaluminum compound disclosed herein include the total amount of organoaluminum compound used in both the precontacted and postcontacted mixtures, and any additional organoaluminum compound added to the polymerization reactor. Therefore, total amounts of organoaluminum compounds are disclosed regardless of whether a single organoaluminum compound or more than one organoaluminum compound is used.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Certain aspects of the present invention employ a catalyst composition which can comprise an aluminoxane compound. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;aluminoxane&#x201d; and &#x201c;aluminoxane compound&#x201d; refer to aluminoxane compounds, compositions, mixtures, or discrete species, regardless of how such aluminoxanes are prepared, formed or otherwise provided. For example, a catalyst composition comprising an aluminoxane compound can be prepared in which aluminoxane is provided as the poly(hydrocarbyl aluminum oxide), or in which aluminoxane is provided as the combination of an aluminum alkyl compound and a source of active protons such as water. Aluminoxanes also can be referred to as poly(hydrocarbyl aluminum oxides) or organoaluminoxanes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The other catalyst components typically can be contacted with the aluminoxane in a saturated hydrocarbon compound solvent, though any solvent that is substantially inert to the reactants, intermediates, and products of the activation step can be used. The catalyst composition formed in this manner can be collected by any suitable method, for example, by filtration. Alternatively, the catalyst composition can be introduced into the polymerization reactor without being isolated.</p>

However, depending upon how the organoaluminoxane is prepared, stored, and used, the value of p and q can vary within a single sample of aluminoxane, and such combinations of organoaluminoxanes are contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In preparing a catalyst composition containing an aluminoxane, the molar ratio of the total moles of aluminum in the aluminoxane (or aluminoxanes) to the total moles of metallocene complex(es) in the composition generally can be between about 1:10 and about 100,000:1. In another aspect, the molar ratio can be in a range from about 5:1 to about 15,000:1. Optionally, aluminoxane can be added to a polymerization reactor system in ranges from about 0.01 mg/L to about 1000 mg/L, from about 0.1 mg/L to about 100 mg/L, or from about 1 mg/L to about 50 mg/L.</p>

For example, water in an inert organic solvent can be reacted with an aluminum alkyl compound, such as (Rz)<sub>3</sub>Al, to form the desired organoaluminoxane compound. While not intending to be bound by this statement, it is believed that this synthetic method can afford a mixture of both linear and cyclic R&#x2014;Al&#x2014;O aluminoxane species, both of which are encompassed by this invention. Alternatively, organoaluminoxanes can be prepared by reacting an aluminum alkyl compound, such as (Rz)<sub>3</sub>Al, with a hydrated salt, such as hydrated copper sulfate, in an inert organic solvent.</p>

Such compounds can include neutral boron compounds, borate salts, and the like, or combinations thereof. For example, fluoroorgano boron compounds and fluoroorgano borate compounds are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Any fluoroorgano boron or fluoroorgano borate compound can be utilized with the present invention. Examples of fluoroorgano borate compounds that can be used in the present invention can include, but are not limited to, fluorinated aryl borates such as N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, triphenylcarbenium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis [3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate, triphenylcarbenium tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate, and the like, or mixtures thereof. Examples of fluoroorgano boron compounds that can be used as co-catalysts in the present invention can include, but are not limited to, tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron, tris[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]boron, and the like, or mixtures thereof. Although not intending to be bound by the following theory, these examples of fluoroorgano borate and fluoroorgano boron compounds, and related compounds, can form &#x201c;weakly-coordinating&#x201d; anions when combined with a transition metal complex (see e.g., U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In another aspect, processes and methods disclosed herein can utilize a catalyst composition comprising an ionizing ionic compound. An ionizing ionic compound is an ionic compound that can function as a co-catalyst to enhance the activity of the catalyst composition. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound can be capable of reacting with a metallocene complex and converting the metallocene complex into one or more cationic metallocene complexes, or incipient cationic metallocene complexes. Again, while not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the ionizing ionic compound can function as an ionizing compound by completely or partially extracting an anionic ligand, such as a monoanionic ligand (e.g. chlorine, etc.), from the metallocene complex. However, the ionizing ionic compound can be a co-catalyst regardless of whether it is ionizes the metallocene compound, abstracts a ligand in a fashion as to form an ion pair, weakens the metal-ligand bond in the metallocene, simply coordinates to a ligand, or activates the metallocene by some other mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, it is not necessary that the ionizing ionic compound activate the metallocene compound only.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">While not intending to be bound by this theory, where branched, substituted, or functionalized olefins are used as reactants, it is believed that a steric hindrance can impede and/or slow the polymerization reaction. Thus, branched and/or cyclic portion(s) of the olefin removed somewhat from the carbon-carbon double bond would not be expected to hinder the reaction in the way that the same olefin substituents situated more proximate to the carbon-carbon double bond might.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">According to one aspect of the present invention, at least one monomer/reactant can be ethylene, so the polymerization reaction can be a homopolymerization involving only ethylene, or a copolymerization with a different acyclic, cyclic, terminal, internal, linear, branched, substituted, or unsubstituted olefin.

The transition metal-modified activator-support can be introduced into the polymerization reactor system at any suitable location within the reactor system. In one aspect, the transition metal-modified activator-support can be added directly into a polymerization reactor within the polymerization reactor system, while in another aspect, the transition metal-modified activator-support can be introduced into the polymerization reaction system at a feed or inlet location other than directly into a polymerization reactor, for example, in a recycle stream. In some aspects, the transition metal-modified activator-support can be added to the reactor with a carrier or solvent, non-limiting examples of which can include, but are not limited to isobutane, n-butane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, n-hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, and the like, or combinations thereof.

Nonetheless, while not being limited thereto, the transition metal-modified activator-support often can be added at a weight ratio of the Group VIII transition metal (in the transition metal-modified activator-support) to the metallocene compound in a range from about 10:1 to about 1:1000. This weight ratio is based on the respective amounts of the transition metal-modified activator-support and the metallocene compound (or compounds) fed into the reactor system (e.g., into a polymerization reactor). As a non-limiting example of a 1:10 weight ratio, in a continuous polymerization reactor system, the total amount of the metallocene catalyst components fed into the reactor(s) per time interval can be &#x201c;Y&#x201d; lb/hr; thus, the amount of the Group VIII transition metal fed into the reactor(s) would be equal to &#x201c;0.1Y&#x201d; lb/hr for a 1:10 weight ratio. Suitable ranges for the weight ratio of the Group VIII transition metal (in the transition metal-modified activator-support) to the metallocene compound can include, but are not limited to, from about 5:1 to about 1:500, from about 1:1 to about 1:100, from about 1:2 to about 1:100, from about 1:10 to about 1:100, from about 10:1 to about 1:10, or from about 5:1 to about 1:5, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In an aspect, the transition metal-modified activator-support can be added into the polymerization reactor system continuously. For instance, the transition metal-modified activator-support can be added to the reactor whenever the olefin monomer or the metallocene catalyst component, or both, are added to the reactor. Alternatively, the transition metal-modified activator-support can be added periodically, on an as-needed basis, or pulsed to the reactor. Intermittent addition to a polymerization reactor is disclosed, for instance, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,220 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0059070, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some aspects, the addition of the transition metal-modified activator-support can be used to control, adjust, fine-tune, etc., the production and properties of a particular polymer grade, without having to change other aspects of the catalyst composition (e.g., the metallocene compound), by reducing one or more melt flow properties of the polymer and/or by increasing one or more molecular weight parameters of the polymer. Moreover, the polymerization conditions can be held substantially constant (e.g., within +/&#x2212;5%), for example, for the production of a particular polymer grade. Representative polymerization conditions include temperature, pressure, residence time, production rate, co-catalyst concentration, and the like. As above, in such circumstances, the addition of the transition metal-modified activator-support can be used to control, adjust, fine-tune, etc., the melt flow and molecular weight properties of that particular polymer grade.</p>

In this aspect, there is no &#x201c;added hydrogen&#x201d; to the reactor system.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Although not required, however, hydrogen can be added to the polymerization reactor system in certain aspects. Optionally, for instance, the methods and processes provided herein can further comprise a step of adding hydrogen to the polymerization reactor system to adjust a molecular weight parameter (e.g., Mw, Mn, Mz) of the olefin polymer, and/or to adjust a melt flow property (e.g., MI, HLMI) of the olefin polymer, if desired. Generally, the step of adding hydrogen can decrease the Mw (and/or Mn and/or Mz), and/or increase the MI (and/or HLMI) of the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In aspects where hydrogen is added to the polymerization reactor system, the hydrogen addition can be held substantially constant (e.g., within +/&#x2212;20%), for example, for the production of a particular polymer grade. For instance, the ratio of hydrogen to the olefin monomer in the polymerization process can be controlled, often by the feed ratio of hydrogen to the olefin monomer entering the reactor. Further, the addition of comonomer (or comonomers) can be, and generally is, substantially constant throughout the polymerization run for a particular copolymer grade. However, in other embodiments, it is contemplated that monomer, comonomer (or comonomers), and/or hydrogen can be periodically pulsed to the reactor, for instance, in a manner similar to that employed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,220 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0059070, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>

Accordingly, in some aspects, the processes and methods provided herein optionally can further comprise the steps of determining (or measuring) the MI (and/or HLMI) of the olefin polymer, and then adjusting the amount of the transition metal-modified activator-support introduced into the polymerization reactor system based on the difference between the measured MI (and/or HLMI) and the target MI (and/or HLMI). As a representative example, if the measured MI is higher than that of the target MI for the production of a particular grade of olefin polymer, then the transition metal-modified activator-support can be added at an amount appropriate to make the measured MI equivalent to that of the target MI. For instance, the feed rate of the transition metal-modified activator-support (e.g., at the expense of the activator-support without the Group VIII transition metal) can be increased to reduce the MI of the olefin polymer.</p>

As a representative example, if the measured Mw is lower than that of the target Mw for the production of a particular grade of olefin polymer, then the transition metal-modified activator-support can be added at an amount appropriate to make the measured Mw equivalent to that of the target Mw. For instance, the feed rate of the transition metal-modified activator-support (e.g., at the expense of the activator-support without the Group VIII transition metal) can be increased to increase the Mw of the olefin polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In accordance with the present invention, optionally and as-needed, various polymerization conditions or process variables can be adjusted and/or controlled during the operation of a polymerization reactor system, and such conditions or variables can include, but are not limited to, reaction temperature, reactor pressure, residence time, catalyst system flow rate into the reactor, monomer flow rate (and comonomer, if employed) into the reactor, olefin polymer output rate, recycle rate, hydrogen flow rate (if employed), reactor cooling status, slurry density, circulation pump power, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The disclosed processes and methods are intended for any olefin polymerization process using various types of polymerization reactors, polymerization reactor systems, and polymerization reaction conditions. As used herein, &#x201c;polymerization reactor&#x201d; includes any polymerization reactor capable of polymerizing (inclusive of oligomerizing) olefin monomers and comonomers (one or more than one comonomer) to produce homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, and the like. The various types of reactors include those that can be referred to as a batch reactor, slurry reactor, gas-phase reactor, solution reactor, high pressure reactor, tubular reactor, autoclave reactor, and the like, or combinations thereof. Suitable polymerization conditions are used for the various reactor types. Gas phase reactors can comprise fluidized bed reactors or staged horizontal reactors. Slurry reactors can comprise vertical or horizontal loops. High pressure reactors can comprise autoclave or tubular reactors. Reactor types can include batch or continuous processes. Continuous processes can use intermittent or continuous product discharge. Processes can also include partial or full direct recycle of unreacted monomer, unreacted comonomer, and/or diluent.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Polymerization reactor systems of the present invention can comprise one type of reactor in a system or multiple reactors of the same or different type (e.g., a single reactor, dual reactor, more than two reactors). Production of polymers in multiple reactors can include several stages in at least two separate polymerization reactors interconnected by a transfer device making it possible to transfer the polymers resulting from the first polymerization reactor into the second reactor. The desired polymerization conditions in one of the reactors can be different from the operating conditions of the other reactor(s). Alternatively, polymerization in multiple reactors can include the manual transfer of polymer from one reactor to subsequent reactors for continued polymerization. Multiple reactor systems can include any combination including, but not limited to, multiple loop reactors, multiple gas phase reactors, a combination of loop and gas phase reactors, multiple high pressure reactors, or a combination of high pressure with loop and/or gas phase reactors. The multiple reactors can be operated in series, in parallel, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to one aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise at least one loop slurry reactor comprising vertical or horizontal loops. Monomer, diluent, catalyst, and comonomer can be continuously fed to a loop reactor where polymerization occurs. Generally, continuous processes can comprise the continuous introduction of monomer/comonomer, a catalyst system, and a diluent into a polymerization reactor and the continuous removal from this reactor of a suspension comprising polymer particles and the diluent. Reactor effluent can be flashed to remove the solid polymer from the liquids that comprise the diluent, monomer and/or comonomer. Various technologies can be used for this separation step including but not limited to, flashing that can include any combination of heat addition and pressure reduction, separation by cyclonic action in either a cyclone or hydrocyclone, or separation by centrifugation.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">A typical slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process) is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,248,179, 4,501,885, 5,565,175, 5,575,979, 6,239,235, 6,262,191, and 6,833,415, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization include, but are not limited to, the monomer being polymerized and hydrocarbons that are liquids under reaction conditions. Examples of suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbons such as propane, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Some loop polymerization reactions can occur under bulk conditions where no diluent is used. An example is polymerization of propylene monomer as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,314, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">According to yet another aspect of this invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise at least one gas phase reactor. Such systems can employ a continuous recycle stream containing one or more monomers continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of the catalyst under polymerization conditions. A recycle stream can be withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product can be withdrawn from the reactor and new or fresh monomer can be added to replace the polymerized monomer. Such gas phase reactors can comprise a process for multi-step gas-phase polymerization of olefins, in which olefins are polymerized in the gaseous phase in at least two independent gas-phase polymerization zones while feeding a catalyst-containing polymer formed in a first polymerization zone to a second polymerization zone. One type of gas phase reactor is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,352,749, 4,588,790, and 5,436,304, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">According to still another aspect of the invention, a high pressure polymerization reactor system can comprise a tubular reactor or an autoclave reactor. Tubular reactors can have several zones where fresh monomer, initiators, or catalysts are added. Monomer can be entrained in an inert gaseous stream and introduced at one zone of the reactor. Initiators, catalysts, and/or catalyst components can be entrained in a gaseous stream and introduced at another zone of the reactor. The gas streams can be intermixed for polymerization. Heat and pressure can be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">According to yet another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise a solution polymerization reactor wherein the monomer (and comonomer, if used) are contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means. A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer can be employed. If desired, the monomer/comonomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result in the formation of a solution of the polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation can be employed to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Polymerization reactor systems suitable for the present invention can further comprise any combination of at least one raw material feed system, at least one feed system for catalyst or catalyst components, and/or at least one polymer recovery system. Suitable reactor systems for the present invention can further comprise systems for feedstock purification, catalyst storage and preparation, extrusion, reactor cooling, polymer recovery, fractionation, recycle, storage, loadout, laboratory analysis, and process control.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Polymerization conditions that are controlled for efficiency and to provide desired polymer properties can include temperature, pressure, and the concentrations of various reactants. Polymerization temperature can affect catalyst productivity, polymer molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution. A suitable polymerization temperature can be any temperature below the de-polymerization temperature according to the Gibbs Free energy equation. Typically, this includes from about 60&#xb0; C. to about 280&#xb0; C., for example, or from about 60&#xb0; C. to about 120&#xb0; C., depending upon the type of polymerization reactor(s). In some reactor systems, the polymerization temperature generally can fall within a range from about 70&#xb0; C. to about 100&#xb0; C., or from about 75&#xb0; C. to about 95&#xb0; C. Various polymerization conditions can be held substantially constant, for example, for the production of a particular grade of olefin polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Suitable pressures will also vary according to the reactor and polymerization type. The pressure for liquid phase polymerizations in a loop reactor is typically less than 1000 psig (6.9 MPa). Pressure for gas phase polymerization is usually at about 200 to 500 psig (1.4 MPa to 3.4 MPa). High pressure polymerization in tubular or autoclave reactors is generally run at about 20,000 to 75,000 psig (138 to 517 MPa). Polymerization reactors can also be operated in a supercritical region occurring at generally higher temperatures and pressures. Operation above the critical point of a pressure/temperature diagram (supercritical phase) may offer advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Aspects of this invention are directed to olefin polymerization processes comprising contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and an optional olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer.

<p id="p-0150" num="0155">Fluorided silica-coated alumina (an activator-support without the Group VIII transition metal) was produced as follows. An alumina was obtained from W. R. Grace under the designation &#x201c;Alumina A&#x201d; having a surface area of about 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g and a pore volume of about 1.2 mL/g. This material was obtained as a powder having an average particle size of about 90 microns. The alumina was first calcined at about 600&#xb0; C. for approximately 6 hours, and then contacted with tetraethylorthosilicate in isopropanol to equal 25% SiO<sub>2</sub>. After drying, the solid oxide was impregnated to incipient wetness with 10% ammonium bifluoride (based on the weight of the solid oxide) in solution in methanol. This mixture was then placed in a flat pan and allowed to dry under vacuum at approximately 110&#xb0; C. for about 16 hours. To calcine the support, about 10 grams of this powdered mixture were placed in a 1.75-inch quartz tube fitted with a sintered quartz disk at the bottom. While the powder was supported on the disk, air (nitrogen can be substituted) dried by passing through a 13&#xd7; molecular sieve column, was blown upward through the disk at the linear rate of about 1.6 to 1.8 standard cubic feet per hour. An electric furnace around the quartz tube was then turned on and the temperature was raised at the rate of about 400&#xb0; C. per hour to the desired calcining temperature of about 600&#xb0; C. At this temperature, the powder was allowed to fluidize for about three hours in the dry air. Afterward, the fluorided silica-coated alumina was collected and stored under dry nitrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0156">The transition metal-modified activator-supports (i.e., with the Group VIII transition metal) were produced in substantially the same manner as the fluorided silica-coated alumina, except that the Group VIII metal was impregnated by mixing nickel nitrate (or cobalt nitrate) at 1.5 mmol per gram of solid oxide with the 10% ammonium bifluoride solution in methanol and the silica-coated alumina, followed by drying and calcining.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Examples 1-11</heading>
<p id="p-0152" num="0157">Examples 1-11 were produced using the following polymerization procedure. All polymerization runs were conducted in a one-gallon stainless steel reactor with 1.8 L of isobutane. A solution of the metallocene compound was prepared at about 3 mg/mL in toluene. Approximately 100 mg of the activator-support, 3 mg of the metallocene compound, and 0.4 mL of 1 M TIBA (in heptane) were added in that order through a charge port while slowly venting isobutane vapor. The charge port was closed and isobutane was added. The contents of the reactor were stirred and heated to the desired run temperature of about 90&#xb0; C., and ethylene was then introduced into the reactor with hydrogen (if used). Ethylene (and hydrogen, if used) were fed on demand at the specified weight ratio to maintain the target pressure of 400 psig and the specified hydrogen pressure for the length of the polymerization run, which was varied to maintain comparable catalyst productivity or polymer production to within +/&#x2212;10% of 250 grams for Examples 1-11. The reactor was maintained at the desired temperature throughout the run by an automated heating-cooling system.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0158">Table I summarizes certain process conditions and properties of the polymers of Examples 1-11. In Table I, &#x201c;transition metal&#x201d; is the transition metal in the activator-support, CY-a is the Carreau-Yasuda CY-a parameter, and &#x3b7; is the melt viscosity at the respective shear rate. As shown in Table I, and unexpectedly, the use of a transition metal-modified silica-coated alumina, as compared to silica-coated alumina (without the Group VIII transition metal), resulted in significant reductions in the MI and the HLMI, as well as significant increases in the Mw and Mz of the polymer. The increase in polymer molecular weight via the use of the transition metal-modified silica-coated alumina was also demonstrated by the increase in melt viscosity at 0.1 sec<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and 100 sec<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(Example 2 versus Example 1, and Example 4 versus Example 3). The CY-a parameter also increased via the use of a transition metal-modified silica-coated alumina, indicating a narrowing of the relaxation time distribution, a property which can be useful in film applications.</p>
