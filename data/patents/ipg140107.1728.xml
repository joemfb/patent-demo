<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure generally relates to transcranial Doppler probes.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The blood that flows through the brain distributes nutrients to the brain and removes wastes. This flow maintains the high rate of metabolism necessary for the brain to function. Restrictions in blood flow may occur from vessel narrowing (stenosis), clot formation (thrombosis), blockage (embolism), or blood vessel rupture (hemorrhage). Lack of sufficient blood flow (ischemia) threatens brain tissue and may cause a stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The flow of blood through the arteries in the brain can be analyzed using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). Blood flow velocity is recorded by emitting an acoustic wave from the ultrasound probe, which then is reflected by various materials. The TCD probe measures the reflected acoustic wave. The direction and the speed of blood flow relative to the TCD probe can be measured by determining the phase shift of acoustic wave reflected from objects in the blood, such as red blood cells. For example, red blood cells moving away from the probe cause the frequency to decrease and faster moving red blood cells cause a greater change in the frequency. Combined with other tests, this information can be used to locate restrictions in the blood vessels in the brain, and to track changes in blood flow over time. In this way, TCD gives valuable information about the site of a stroke and the patient's progress after a stroke. TCD is also used to evaluate the contraction of blood vessels that can occur if a blood vessel ruptures.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a particular embodiment, a transcranial Doppler probe includes a piezoelectric transducer coupled to a spherical bearing to rotate about at least two axes. The rotation may be driven by rods, each coupled to a motor. In an example, the motors are arranged in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a transcranial Doppler (TCD) probe <b>100</b>. The TCD probe <b>100</b> can include a mounting platform <b>102</b>. A mounting rod <b>104</b> having a proximal end <b>106</b> and a distal end <b>108</b> can be attached to the mounting platform <b>102</b> at the distal end <b>108</b>. The proximal end <b>106</b> of the mounting rod <b>104</b> can be attached to a spherical bearing <b>110</b> through a central hole <b>112</b>. The spherical bearing <b>110</b> may have a spherical or frusto-spherical shape characterized by a convex outer surface that permits rotation about at least two axes. An outer ring <b>114</b> of the spherical bearing <b>110</b> can pivot around a central portion <b>116</b>. The outer ring <b>114</b> can be attached to a mounting cup <b>118</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A piezoelectric transducer <b>120</b> can be mounted on the mounting cup <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a particular example, the probe may have length in the range of 40 mm to 100 mm, such as a range of 50 mm to 80 mm, or even a range of 60 mm to 75 mm. The probe may have a width in a range of 20 mm to 50 mm, such as a range of 25 mm to 45 mm, or even a range of 30 mm to 40 mm. The probe may have a height in a range of 10 mm to 30 mm, such as a range of 10 mm to 25 mm, or even a range of 15 mm to 20 mm. The length, width and height are orthogonal dimensions, wherein the height is parallel to the general direction of transmissions from the piezoelectric transducer <b>120</b> and the length and width are perpendicular to the general direction of transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, control arms <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> can extend radially from the mounting cup <b>118</b> at about 90&#xb0; angles. The axes <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> of the control arms <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> extend through a central pivot point <b>130</b> of the spherical bearing <b>110</b>. Additionally, a guide pin <b>132</b> can be coupled to the mounting cup <b>118</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and may be coaxial with control arm <b>124</b>. The guide pin <b>132</b> can fit in a guide pin slide <b>134</b> and substantially limit the rotation of the mounting cup <b>118</b> within at least one plane while permitting rotation about at least two axes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The control arms <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> can be coupled to drive levers <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> respectively. The drive levers <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> can be connected to motors <b>140</b> and <b>142</b>. Motors <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> can be mounted in parallel on the mounting platform <b>102</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, feedback sensors <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> can be mounted on the mounting platform <b>102</b> to monitor the position of the piezoelectric transducer <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The motors <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> can cause the rotation of drive levers <b>136</b> and <b>138</b>, respectively. The drive levers <b>136</b> and <b>138</b> can torque the control arms <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> and cause the mounting cup <b>118</b> to pivot about the central pivot <b>130</b> of the spherical bearing <b>110</b>. The mounting cup <b>118</b> can simultaneously pivot around the axis <b>126</b> of control arm <b>122</b> and the axis <b>128</b> of control arm <b>124</b>. The mounting cup <b>118</b> may have an angular movement (pivot range) of at least about 15&#xb0; around the axis <b>126</b> of the control arm <b>122</b> or relative to a plane parallel to a horizontal plane of a housing of the transcranial Doppler probe, such as at least about 20&#xb0;, preferably at least about 30&#xb0;. Additionally, the mounting cup <b>118</b> may have an angular movement of at least about 15&#xb0; around the axis <b>128</b> of the control arm <b>124</b> or relative to a plane parallel to a horizontal plane of a housing of the transcranial Doppler probe, such as at least about 20&#xb0;, preferably at least about 30&#xb0;. As such, the mounting cup <b>118</b> can pivot around the central pivot point <b>130</b> of the spherical bearing <b>110</b> in all directions. The mounting cup <b>118</b> may contact the mounting platform <b>102</b> at the extremes of the range of motion. Movement of the mounting cup <b>118</b> can allow an ultrasound beam produced by the piezoelectric transducer <b>120</b> to smoothly and continuously scan the interior volume of a cylindrical cone. Feedback sensors <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> can monitor the angular position of the ultrasound beam within the cylindrical cone and provide feedback for precise control of the motion of the piezoelectric transducer <b>120</b>. In an embodiment, feedback sensors <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> can be IR sensors positioned to detect the rotational position of the drive levers <b>136</b> and <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a cover <b>148</b> can be attached to the mounting platform <b>102</b> and may substantially cover the components of the TCD probe <b>100</b>. The cover <b>148</b> may have an opening <b>150</b> providing access between the piezoelectric transducer <b>120</b> and the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an exemplary spherical bearing <b>700</b>, such as spherical bearing <b>110</b>. The spherical bearing <b>700</b> can have a central portion <b>702</b> and a central hole <b>704</b> formed through the central portion <b>702</b>. The central hole <b>704</b> can be configured for coupling to a mounting rod, such as mounting rod <b>104</b>. Additionally, the spherical bearing <b>700</b> can have an outer ring <b>706</b> positioned around the central portion <b>702</b>. The outer ring <b>706</b> can pivot around the central portion <b>702</b>. In an embodiment, the spherical bearing <b>700</b> may be lubricated between the central portion <b>702</b> and the outer ring <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> illustrate an exemplary drive lever or gear <b>800</b>, such as drive levers <b>136</b> and <b>138</b>, that torques a drive arm to pivot the piezoelectric transducer around an axis. In a particular example, the drive lever <b>800</b> has an axis of rotation that forms an angle in a range of 35&#xb0; to 55&#xb0; with the axis around with the transducer pivots, such as approximately 45&#xb0;. The drive lever <b>800</b> can include a main portion <b>802</b> with a central hole <b>804</b> and a drive arm <b>806</b>. The central hole <b>804</b> can be configured for attaching to a motor, such as motors <b>140</b> and <b>142</b>. The drive arm <b>806</b> can include a curved drive surface <b>808</b>, such as a convex drive surface to contract a control arm, such as control arms <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. The control arm may slide along the curved drive surface <b>808</b> as the drive lever <b>800</b> rotates. The drive lever <b>800</b> can further include a leaf spring <b>810</b> for holding the control arm in contact with the curved drive surface <b>808</b>, such that the drive lever <b>800</b> maintains contact with the control arm when rotated in both a clockwise and counter clockwise direction. In an exemplary embodiment, the main portion <b>802</b> can include a cammed surface <b>812</b>. The cammed surface <b>812</b> may provide feedback for a feedback sensor, such as feedback sensor <b>144</b> and <b>146</b>. For example, the feedback sensor may measure the distance between the feedback sensor and the cammed surface <b>812</b>. As the drive lever <b>800</b> is rotated, the distance between the motion sensor and the cammed surface <b>812</b> may vary, such that the rotational position of the drive lever <b>800</b> can be determined by measuring the distance between the motion sensor and the cammed surface <b>812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an exemplary transcranial Doppler system <b>1000</b>. The system can include a transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> and a control unit <b>1004</b>. The control unit <b>1004</b> can include one or more processors <b>1006</b>, storage <b>1008</b>, and an interface <b>1010</b>. The processor <b>1006</b>, storage <b>1008</b>, and interface <b>1010</b> may be connected through a bus <b>1012</b>. Alternatively, the storage <b>1008</b> may be connected to the processor <b>1006</b> separately from the interface <b>1010</b>. The transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> can communicate with the control unit <b>1004</b> through the interface <b>1010</b>. In an embodiment, a cable <b>1014</b> can connect the transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> with the interface <b>1010</b> of the control unit <b>1004</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the communication between the transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> and the control unit <b>1004</b> can be wireless. For example, the probe <b>1002</b> and the control unit <b>1004</b> may communicate using a wireless protocol, such as Bluetooth&#xae;. The processor <b>1006</b> can send instructions to and receive signals from the transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> through the interface <b>1010</b>. The instructions may include aiming instructions, such as for altering the tip/tilt angle of a piezoelectric transducer, or may include pulsing instructions to start, stop, or change the acoustic pulses produced by the piezoelectric transducer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an exemplary embodiment, the control unit <b>1004</b> may control the transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> to emit a pulse transmission in the sonic range of 0.3 MHz to 100 MHz, such as a range of 0.5 MHz to 50 MHz, a range of 1 MHz to 25 MHz, a range of 1.5 MHz to 20 MHz, or even a range of 1.4 MHz to 5 MHz. In addition, the transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> may be configured to receive echo signals at frequencies within the same range as the transmission. In an example, the control unit <b>1004</b> may perform Doppler or power Doppler quadrature demodulations of RF data at ranges of at least 3 times the transmission frequency, such as at least 4 times the transmission frequency. For example, when the transmission frequency is 2 MHz ultrasonic, data may be electronically collected at 8 MHz, and the data may be demodulated.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The processor <b>1004</b> may process the signals received from the transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> and store the results in the storage <b>1008</b>. Alternatively, the unprocessed signals from the transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> can be stored in the storage <b>1008</b> for later retrieval and processing. In an example, the processor <b>1004</b> includes a digital signal processor, such as a processor having a clock speed of at least 500 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a particular embodiment, the control unit <b>1004</b> may include a manual interface (not shown), such as a touch screen interface, keyboard, mouse, ball controller, or stick controller to permit manipulation of the direction the transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> is projecting. Alternatively or in combination, the processor <b>1006</b> of the control unit <b>1004</b> may automatically manipulate the probe <b>1002</b>. For example, a user may utilize the manual interface to provide a general direction to be explored and the processor <b>1006</b> may adjust the direction to improve a signal based on feedback from the probe <b>1002</b>. Such automated control of the probe direction may be used for automatic emboli detection.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another embodiment, the system <b>1000</b> may implement transtemporal window location. According to an exemplary method, the transtemporal area is scanned while transmitting and using a very short receive gate. Analyzing backscatter results in evaluation of bone thickness and density. Comparing the ultrasound wave scattered off of the bone from various locations permits determining which location experiences the least scattering. Such a technique can be combined with variable frequency ultrasound transmission. A signal may be provided through the control unit <b>1004</b> to indicate when the transcranial Doppler probe <b>1002</b> is located in a desirable position.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The control unit <b>1004</b> may also include additional interfaces (not illustrated) to permit input from other devices, such as pulse monitors, blood pressure measuring devices, respiratory measuring devices, and other medical devices. Data from such devices may be displayed in conjunction with the measured flow in cerebral vessels. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> includes an illustration of an exemplary display. In addition, data may be transmitted to another computation system for further analysis or storage. For example, a USB interface may provided to a personal computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a particular embodiment, the control unit <b>1004</b> may be implemented as a handheld device having a touch screen interface. In an example, the probe <b>1002</b> may communicate with the control unit <b>1004</b> through a USB interface. In another example, the interface <b>1010</b> includes a wireless interface to access the probe <b>1002</b>, such as a Bluetooth&#xae; interface. The touch screen interface may provide control elements for manipulation of the direction the probe <b>1002</b> is projecting and measuring.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an exemplary method of using a transcranial Doppler system, such as transcranial Doppler system <b>500</b>. As illustrated at <b>1102</b>, the transcranial Doppler probe can be positioned on the head of the patient. For example, the transcranial Doppler probe may be placed near the temple of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated at <b>1104</b>, the piezoelectric transducer can be aimed. The piezoelectric transducer may be aimed by adjusting the tip/tilt of the piezoelectric transducer to aim the acoustic pulses towards an area of interest, such as towards the blood vessels in the cranial cavity of the patient. In particular, a device connected to the probe can be used to adjust the orientation of the piezoelectric transducer. Once an orientation is configured, the transcranial Doppler probe can generate acoustic signals directed into the cranial cavity of the patient, as illustrated at <b>1106</b>. The acoustic pulses travel into the tissues of the cranial cavity. Structures within the cavity cause reflections of the acoustic pulses. Specifically, objects traveling within blood vessels can reflect the acoustic pulses. The frequency of the reflected acoustic pulses is altered based on the velocity of the flow through the blood vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As illustrated at <b>1108</b>, the transcranial Doppler probe can receive the reflections. In particular, after the pulse is emitted, the transducer may be used to measure the reflected acoustic pulses. Signals representative of the reflected acoustic pulses may be provided to a computational device for analysis. In particular, the reflections may be processed to calculate the blood flow velocities, as illustrated at <b>1110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example, the blood flow through the blood vessel may be monitored based on the calculated velocities, as illustrated at <b>1112</b>. In another example, a circulatory anomaly may be detected, as illustrated at <b>1114</b>. For example, the circulatory anomaly may include restriction of the blood flow, such as by an embolism, a stenosis, or a vasospasm. Monitoring the blood flow through the blood vessel may include monitoring by comparing the blood flow velocity over time.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an automated embodiment, the orientation of the piezoelectric transducer may be moved repeatedly to scan the interior volume of a patient's cranial cavity. For example, the transcranial probe may be adjusted using feedback from the analysis of the signals to orient the piezoelectric transducer so as to improve measurement of the velocity measurement for a particular vessel. In another example, the orientation of the piezoelectric transducer may be adjusted through broad ranges to locate blood vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a particular example, a control unit may include software to control transcranial Doppler signal transmission, positioning, and initial signal collection and processing. For example, the control unit may control characteristics of the probe, such as transmission depth, power levels, receiver gain, transmit burst length, receiver gate widths, and any combination thereof. The controller may perform signal demodulation and generate outputs, such as auditory or visual signals. In addition, the controller may provide data output to a computational device, such as a personal computer. The personal computer may permit manipulation of settings on the controller, display and manipulation of data, and storage of data.</p>
