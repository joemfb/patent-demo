<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a medical image display apparatus, method, and program, and more particularly to a medical image display apparatus, method, and program for displaying, when a lesion character in an image reading report is specified, an image of the lesion area.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, medical image display technologies for reconstructing and displaying medical images have been evolving and serving as assistance in image diagnosis performed in the medical field as described, for example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 5 (1993)-189541 and 7 (1995)-021405.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In image diagnoses using medical images, in general, diagnosticians make diagnoses with reference to image reading reports generated by radiologists. Some image reading reports allow a reference image to be linked to a character string in the reports as described, for example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-301453. Use of such image reading reports allows the radiological image reader to display a corresponding image by simply specifying a character described in the report.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-301453 allows reference to the medical image corresponding to the character string in the image reading report, the position where the lesion area described in the image reading report is present or the character string representing the corresponding lesion cannot be known from the medical image itself.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, it has been difficult to accurately recognized as to which position in the medical image the lesion described in the image reading report corresponds to, as one medical image is linked to one character string in the image reading report.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the circumstances described above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a medical image display apparatus, method, and program that allows more accurate image interpretation by displaying lesion information described in an image reading report in a medical image.</p>

Note that the plurality of thumbnails displayed in reference image area <b>117</b> may be those of medical images representing lesions included in one series of medical images V or those of medical images representing lesions included in a plurality of series of medical images V.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Detailed image display area <b>113</b> include, as appropriate, editing buttons <b>113</b>A, <b>113</b>B for processing and editing the medical image displayed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, a method of generating an image reading report having lesion character <b>105</b>A will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart representing a method of generating an image reading report of the present embodiment. First, link input button <b>111</b> is selected by input section <b>303</b> to set the link input mode to ON (ST<b>101</b>). In order to input the position of a link input lesion, crosshair pointer <b>113</b>C is selected from editing buttons <b>113</b>A using input section <b>303</b>. Then, a crosshair pointer is displayed and when the crosshair pointer is placed on the position of a lesion and clicked with the mouse, lesion position <b>115</b>A is inputted (ST<b>102</b> is YES).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">When lesion position <b>115</b>A is inputted, information including information indicating the storage location of medical image <b>115</b> that includes lesion position <b>115</b>A and position information indicating the position of the lesion area in medical image <b>115</b>, such as coordinates of the lesion area, is obtained. The position information may further include information obtained, for example, from header information of DICOM, such as image ID or the like. For example, in the case where the position of the lesion area is a point, the position information may be obtained as coordinate values in medical image <b>115</b>, while if it is a circle, the position information may be obtained as coordinate values of the center of the circle and a length of the radius in medical image <b>115</b>. If the position of the lesion is a diagram encircled by a straight line or curved line, information representing the diagram, such as an end point of the straight line in medical image <b>115</b> or a function representing the curved line, may be obtained, as appropriate, as the position information.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Then, a character string not yet used in finding field <b>105</b> is selected from predetermined character strings, and a character string to be inserted as lesion character <b>105</b>A is determined (ST<b>103</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The predetermined character string may be a character string, symbol, or numeric character, and (1) a fixed character string (2) if medical image <b>115</b> is a medical image constituting one series formed of a series of tomographic images, a combination of the medical image series number with a slice number or the like as information to identify a medical image that includes a lesion position (3) a pixel value of a lesion position (4) an anatomical region name of a lesion position such as left upper lung lobe, left lingular segment, or the like (5) coordinate values of a lesion position and (6) a combination thereof may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In the case where a region name representing an anatomical region as shown in (4) above is to be inserted in finding field <b>105</b>, as the character string, the character string may be extracted and inserted in the following manner. First, the organ to which the inputted lesion position belongs is extracted by computer aided diagnosis (CAD). The following specific techniques may be used for extracting the following: the techniques described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 2001-137230 and 2008-253293 for lung fields; the techniques described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 2001-283191 and 2002-345807 for livers; the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2008-43564 for bones; and the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-141612 for hearts. In addition, any other organ recognition technique may be used as long as it is capable of automatically extracting the organ to which the specified lesion position belongs. For example, the organ extraction described may be performed on a medical image that includes a lesion position and if the extracted organ includes the lesion position, the organ may be determined as the organ to which the lesion position belongs. The anatomical region name representing the organ may be inserted as the lesion character. In this case, the symptom or position of the lesion area may be assumed from the lesion character, as well as a linking operation may be implemented without inputting a lesion character from input section <b>303</b>, so that the image reading report may be generated efficiently. Further, each organ or a region name representing a region of each organ may be used as the region name. For example, in the case of lungs, left lung or right lung may be used as the region name or otherwise further classified names of right upper lung lobe, right middle lung lobe, right lower lung lobe, left upper lung lobe, or left lower lung lobe may be used as the region name. Further, a region name classified by the lung segment, such as the superior lingular segment (S<b>4</b>) of left upper lung lobe or abbreviated names thereof may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the case where information, such as luminance value <b>203</b> of the image at the position of the lesion area, is further obtained, as the position information, the character string to be inserted may be determined in the following manner. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an association table of position of lesion area and lesion character candidate associating organ names, characteristic information <b>203</b> of positions of lesion areas, and lesion character candidates with each other is provided. In the table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, luminance values <b>203</b> of CT images are associated as the characteristic information <b>203</b> of the positions of lesion areas.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">When a position of lesion area is inputted, the organ to which the inputted position of lesion area belongs is extracted using the specific extraction method described above, such as the computer aided diagnosis or the like. Then, the luminance value of the image at the inputted position of lesion area is obtained as the position information. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, if the inputted position of lesion area belongs to the lung in the column of organ name <b>201</b>, and the luminance value at the position of lesion area inputted as characteristic information <b>203</b> of the position of lesion area is &#x2212;50 which falls with in the range from &#x2212;2000 to 0, four character strings of bracket, pneumothorax, lung emphysema, and bronchodilation are determined from among lesion character candidates <b>205</b> as the corresponding lesion character candidates <b>205</b>A. In the case where the luminance value is 100 which falls in the range from 50 to 150 and also in the range from 100 to 1000, so that nodule, GGO, infiltrative shadow, and calcification are determined as the lesion character candidates. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, lesion character candidates <b>205</b>A are displayed on image reading report generation screen <b>100</b> as lesion character candidate list <b>210</b> when the position of lesion area is specified by the user. When a lesion character candidate <b>210</b>A is selected from the lesion character candidate list <b>210</b> by the user, the selected lesion character candidate <b>210</b>A is inserted in the image reading report as the lesion character. In the case where a character string not included in the lesion character candidates is to be inputted, &#x201c;other&#x201d; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> may be selected, and the character string may be inputted from the input section. The display of the lesion character candidate list may be in the form of a pull-down menu or any other method which allows selection of a region name.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Further, an average, dispersion, or pattern of luminance values adjacent to the position of lesion area may be obtained as information to be obtained from the lesion position, and characteristic information <b>203</b> may be provided according to the average, dispersion, or pattern of luminance values adjacent to the position of lesion area, thereby allowing the corresponding lesion character candidate to be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Next, lesion storage means <b>20</b> stores lesion information at lesion position <b>115</b>A (ST<b>104</b>). The lesion information may be, for example, (1) lesion ID (2) position information of lesion area constituted by series name, slice name, and coordinates on the slice and (3) lesion character. The lesion ID and position information of lesion area constituted by series name, slice name, and coordinates on the slice may be obtained from the position information inputted from input section <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A medical image that includes the position <b>115</b>A of lesion area obtained from input section <b>303</b> and the lesion character <b>105</b>A linked by a hyperlink are inserted in finding field <b>105</b> (ST<b>105</b>). Here, the lesion character <b>105</b>A is inserted in a manner so as to be distinguishable from the other characters, such as coloring of the lesion character, coloring of the background, or use of underline, blinking, boldface, different font type or size, or frame for the lesion character, thereby indicating that the lesion character is linked by a hyperlink.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Then, if a position of lesion area is inputted in the same manner as in step ST<b>102</b> (ST<b>106</b> is YES), the steps from ST<b>103</b> to ST<b>105</b> are repeated. That is, if a plurality of lesion positions is specified in the medical image V, the corresponding number of lesion characters is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">If a further lesion position is not inputted (ST<b>106</b> is NO), lesion character insertion is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In the case where the lesion character inserted in image reading report generation area <b>105</b> is selected by input section <b>303</b>, that is, if the lesion character <b>105</b>A is selected, for example, by selection tool <b>123</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> or the like, medical image display means <b>60</b> obtains position information of a medical image <b>115</b> corresponding to the lesion character <b>105</b>A from lesion storage means <b>20</b> and displays the medical image <b>115</b> in detailed image display area <b>113</b>. Further, link information display means <b>40</b> obtains a position <b>115</b>A of lesion area from lesion storage means <b>20</b> and displays the position <b>115</b>A of lesion area corresponding to the lesion character <b>105</b>A in the medical image in the detailed image display area. In the case where the position of the lesion area is displayed as an area, the indicator may be displayed as the representative point in the area. The display form of the indicator may be made selectable from arrow, area, pointer for pointing a representative point in the lesion area, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">A process for changing a lesion character inserted in the image reading report according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a process flow for changing a link character according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a conceptual diagram of a radiological report generated by changing a portion of the link character according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows, by way of example, finding field <b>105</b> of image reading report generation screen <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows that three lesion characters of &#x201c;lesion <b>1</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;lesion <b>2</b>&#x201d; (<b>105</b>B), and &#x201c;lesion <b>3</b>&#x201d; (<b>105</b>C) are inserted in the finding field, in which lesion <b>1</b> has been edited and changed to a new lesion character of &#x201c;irregular nodule&#x201d; (<b>105</b>A).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In finding field <b>105</b> in which lesion characters are inserted, one of the lesion characters is selected by input section <b>303</b> (ST<b>201</b>). Then, the selected lesion character is changed to a desired character string, symbol, or numeric character by operating the mouse or keyboard. More specifically, if a selection tool such as arrow <b>123</b> is pointed on the lesion character and the right mouse button is clicked, lesion character change options are displayed in a pull-down menu format. Thus, the lesion character is changed by selecting one of the lesion character change options (ST<b>202</b>). The lesion character may be changed using a different method, as appropriate, as long as it allows only the character string of the lesion character to be changed with the hyperlinked state being maintained. Then, the position of the lesion area corresponding to the original lesion character is linked to the new lesion character by a hyperlink and corresponding lesion information is updated (ST<b>203</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In this way, the image reading report used in the first embodiment is generated. Further, the medical image that includes the position of lesion area associated with the lesion character is a first medical image used in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Next, in the medical image display method of the present embodiment, a method of displaying link information in a medical image will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> a flow diagram illustrating a process flow for generating link information in the medical image display method of the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">First, link position storage means <b>30</b> obtains a lesion position in a slice image <b>115</b> and a corresponding lesion character from lesion storage means <b>20</b> (ST<b>301</b>). Then coordinates in a medical image <b>133</b> reconstructed by stacking a plurality of slice images, including the slice image <b>115</b> (ST<b>302</b>). Typical reconstructed images include those represented by volume rendering, ray summation, maximum intensity projection (MIP), and multi planar reformat (MPR).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As a three-dimensional image is reconstructed from multiple slice images, i.e., multiple two-dimensional images sliced at a predetermined thickness, coordinates of the position of a point specified in any of the two-dimensional images in the three-dimensional image may be calculated from the slice position and coordinates of the point, and the coordinate position in the three-dimensional image corresponding to the coordinates of the lesion position in the slice image is identified. Thus, the lesion position specified in the slice image can be represented in the three-dimensional image.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Then, link position storage means <b>30</b> stores the coordinate values and corresponding lesion character in association with each other as link information (ST<b>303</b>). The link information may be constituted by, for example, (1) link ID (2) link position which is the position in the reconstructed image <b>133</b> corresponding to the lesion position in the slice image (3) link character and (4) corresponding lesion ID. The lesion ID may be obtained from the lesion information inputted from lesion storage means <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, an indicator is displayed at the lesion position in the reconstructed image using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a conceptual diagram of a medical image display screen displayed according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The layout of medical image display screen <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> will be described. In medical image display screen <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, reference image selection button <b>119</b>B is selected and a thumbnail <b>117</b>B of a reference image is displayed in reference image area <b>117</b>. The thumbnail <b>117</b>B of a reference image in reference image area is selected and an image <b>133</b>, which is a reconstructed second medical image corresponding to the selected thumbnail image <b>117</b>B, is displayed in detailed image display area <b>113</b>. Selection tool <b>113</b>D is provided in detailed image display area <b>113</b> in which the reconstructed second medical image <b>133</b> is displayed to allow the reconstructed image <b>133</b> to be observed by changing the size and angle thereof. The medical image display screen includes link display button <b>131</b> for displaying link information. Here, the link display button <b>131</b> is selected, and link information, i.e., link characters <b>135</b>A, <b>137</b>A, link positions <b>135</b>C, <b>137</b>C, and association indicators <b>135</b>B, <b>137</b>C are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The link position <b>135</b>C obtained from link position storage means <b>30</b> and the link character <b>135</b>A constituted by lesion character <b>105</b>D corresponding to the link position <b>135</b>C is inserted in the reconstructed medical image <b>133</b> (ST<b>307</b>). In the case where positions of a plurality of lesion areas in a medical image V are stored in link position storage means <b>30</b>, link characters and link positions corresponding to all of the positions of the plurality of lesion areas are displayed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, positions of two lesion areas are stored in link position storage means <b>30</b> so that link characters <b>135</b>A, <b>137</b>A and link positions <b>135</b>C, <b>137</b>C are displayed. Here, the link character and the corresponding link position are displayed in association with each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the link character <b>135</b>A and the corresponding link position <b>135</b>C are associated by the association indicator <b>135</b>B while the link character <b>137</b>A and the corresponding link position <b>137</b>C are associated by the association indicator <b>137</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The association between the link character and corresponding link position is not necessarily implemented by the association indicator, and they may be displayed in any manner as long as it allows identification of which link character corresponds to which position indicator. For example, the link character <b>135</b>A may be displayed adjacent to the corresponding position indicator <b>135</b>C. In the case where the link character and the corresponding position indicator are distinguishable, such as the case where only one link character and only one position indicator are displayed, the association indicator is not required or the link character is not required to be displayed adjacent to the position indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In this way, the display of link positions <b>135</b>C, <b>137</b>C, and link characters <b>135</b>A, <b>137</b>A in the medical image allows the position of the lesion area and character string representing the lesion area described in the image reading report to be referenced simply by observing the medical image. Then, from the link positions <b>135</b>C, <b>137</b>C, the positions of the lesion areas may be accurately recognized, and from the link characters <b>135</b>A, <b>137</b>A, the lesions may be assessed easily.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the conventional technologies, it has been difficult to accurately understand as to which position in the medical image the lesion described in the image reading report corresponds to, as one medical image is linked to one character string in the image reading report. In contrast, the present embodiment displays a link position using a position indicator so that the position of the lesion area may be accurately recognized.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Further, the link positions <b>135</b>C, <b>137</b>C and link characters <b>135</b>A, <b>137</b>A are respectively associated with each other in a medical image, so that even when a plurality of link characters and a plurality of link positions are displayed at the same time, the correspondence relationship between each link position and each link character may be recognized easily. As a result, the positions of a plurality of lesion areas and character strings representing a plurality of corresponding lesions may be recognized at a time by simply observing the medical image, whereby the diagnosis may be made more easily. Further, the relative position between link positions <b>135</b>C and <b>137</b>C may be recognized easily.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, the display of the link position in the reconstructed medical image allows the position of lesion area in a slice image to be recognized by a different medical image, so that the position of the lesion area may be recognized more accurately. In the case where a link position is displayed in a reconstructed three-dimensional image, the position of the lesion area may be recognized stereoscopically, and accurate radiological image reading may be performed base on the lesion area. Further, the reconstructed three-dimensional image may be made rotatable and scalable, and the link position and link character may be displayed in an interlocking manner with the rotation and scaling. In this case, the position of the lesion area may be viewed from a different angle with a different size, thereby allowing more accurate radiological image reading.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, only the link character <b>135</b>A is displayed, but lesion storage means <b>20</b> may be a means that further stores a word or phrase before and after the lesion character in the image reading report as the lesion information, link position storage means <b>30</b> may be a means that further obtains the word or phrase before and after the lesion character in the image reading report from lesion storage means <b>20</b>, and link information display means <b>40</b> may be a means that displays the word or phrase before and after the link character in addition to the link character <b>135</b>A as shown, by way of example, in <b>135</b>D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. For example, ten characters before the link character and ten characters after the link character may be extracted and displayed or one sentence, including the link character, may be extracted and displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In this way, where a word or phrase before and after the link character is displayed in a medical image together with the link character, more detailed information may be obtained directly from the medical image and the diagnosis may be made easily. It is highly likely that before or after a link character representing a lesion in an image reading report includes a description of the lesion, so that it is highly likely that information useful in understanding the lesion is displayed by displaying the word or phrase before and after the link character, whereby the diagnosis may be assisted greatly.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Further, in the case where a plurality of link characters and a plurality of lesion areas are present, it is necessary that the correspondence relationship between each link character and each lesion area corresponding to each other is made clear. Therefore, it is desirable to use an indicator for indicating the correspondence relationship, such as drawing a leading line between a corresponding pair or coloring the correspond pair with the same color which is different from that used for a different corresponding pair. Such a distinguishable display as in the manner described above allows the correspondence between the link character and link position to be made clear, resulting in easy understanding of the image reading report.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">A configuration of a second embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a functional block diagram of a medical image display function of the second embodiment.

<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, as specified lesion character <b>141</b> is linked by a hyperlink to the slice image <b>121</b>A, which is the first medical image, including the position of the corresponding lesion area, medical image display means <b>60</b> displays a thumbnail of the slice image <b>121</b>A in attached image display area <b>121</b> in response to the specification of the lesion character <b>141</b> with selection tool <b>123</b> of link character specifying means <b>80</b>. Further, in response to the specification of the lesion character <b>141</b>, indicator <b>147</b> (not shown) is displayed in the slice image <b>121</b>A by link information display means <b>40</b>. Note that, however, the display method of the medical image that includes the position of lesion area is not limited to this, and the slice image <b>121</b>A may be displayed in a separate window or as a detailed medical image instead of the thumbnail in response to the specification of the lesion character <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As described above, the lesion character <b>141</b> and slice image <b>121</b>A are linked by a hyperlink, so that by simply specifying the lesion character <b>141</b> in the image reading report, the corresponding slice image <b>121</b>A may be referenced easily, thereby allowing an efficient diagnosis. According to the second embodiment, from the link character <b>137</b>A in the reconstructed medical image <b>133</b>, the corresponding lesion character <b>141</b> in the image reading report may be referenced, and from the lesion character <b>141</b>, the corresponding slice image <b>121</b>A may be referenced, the corresponding detailed information may be obtained easily, thereby allowing an efficient radiological image reading.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Preferably, in response to the specification of the link character <b>137</b>A, the specified link character <b>137</b>A and the position <b>137</b>C of lesion area are displayed in a distinguishable manner from the other link character <b>135</b>A and link position <b>135</b>C. This allows clear understanding as to which link character <b>137</b>A is specified, whereby it is easy to understand that the image reading report corresponding to the link character <b>137</b>A is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Further, the link character and the position of the corresponding lesion area may be highlighted by various methods for displaying in a distinguishable manner, such as blinking of the mark, character, or both, coloring of the link character or background, or use of underline, blinking, boldface, different font type or size, or frame for the link character. As a result, it is clear that the displayed position of lesion area corresponds to which link character, whereby the image reading report may be understood more easily.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Next, a third embodiment will be described. Image reading report storage means <b>10</b> stores a plurality of image reading reports, including past image reading reports with respect to past medical images of the same patient. Lesion storage means <b>20</b> converts a lesion position in a past medical image to the corresponding lesion position in a current image representing the same region and same position and stores as lesion information. More specifically, with respect to a slice image <b>143</b> representing a lesion position in a past medical image, a medical image constituted by a group of tomographic images, including the past slice image <b>143</b>, is aligned with a medical image constituted by a group of current tomographic images using the technique described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2009-72432 of the present inventor and coordinates representing the lesion position in the slice image <b>143</b> are obtained as the coordinates of attention point in the corresponding current medical image <b>145</b>. Then, the coordinates of the lesion position in the current medical image <b>145</b>, which is the first medical image, are stored as lesion information.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Further, lesion storage means <b>20</b> further associates image reading report identification information for identifying the image reading report that includes the lesion character with the lesion information and stores the resultant information. The image reading report identification information is constituted by information capable of identifying the image reading report, such as the file name of the report, data of the report, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In this case, link position storage means <b>30</b> obtains the lesion information from lesion storage means <b>20</b>, associates the image reading report identification information with the link information, and stores the resultant information. Link information display means <b>40</b> displays the past lesion character and current lesion character in a distinguishable manner based on the image reading report identification information. For example, the date of image reading report may be displayed in the reconstructed medical image as the image reading report identification information, in addition to the link character. Further, when displaying the corresponding image reading report in response to the specification of the link character <b>137</b>A, the image reading report identification information, such as the date of image reading report or the like may be displayed in addition to the image reading report by applying the second embodiment to the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">This allows link information display means <b>40</b> to display a past lesion character representing a lesion described in a past image reading report in a reconstructed second medical image, whereby a lesion position corresponding to the past lesion position may be referenced easily in the current medical image. As a result, a diagnosis with reference to the progress of the past lesion may be made easily and image reading may be performed efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the case where image reading report identification information is displayed in a reconstructed medical image, it is easy to identify in which image reading report the information is described, whereby the diagnosis of the progress of the lesion may be made easily. For example, in the case where the date of the report is displayed in the medical image, a diagnosis may be made in consideration of the passage of time from the date of the report, resulting in an accurate image reading.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In the case where a past image reading report is displayed together with the image reading report identification information by applying the second embodiment to the third embodiment, it is easy to identify in which image reading report the information is described, whereby the diagnosis of the progress of the lesion may be made easily. For example, in the case where the date of the report is displayed in the medical image, a diagnosis may be made in consideration of the passage of time from the date of the report, resulting in an accurate image reading.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The second medical image reconstructed from a plurality of medical images, including the first medical image, may be more than one. Hereinafter, a fourth embodiment in which a plurality of second medical image is provided will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the case where a plurality of second medical images is provided, each second medical image is a medical image reconstructed by a different reconstruction method or a medical image different in display position and size from each other. Images reconstructed by various methods, such as volume rendering, surface rendering, ray summation, maximum intensity projection (MIP), multi planar reformat (MPR), minimum intensity projection (MNIP), curved planar reformation (CPR), and the like, may be applied to the second medical image.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">A specific description will be made with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a medical image display screen displayed according to a modification of the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows only detailed image display area <b>113</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the thumbnail <b>117</b>B of a reference image in reference image area <b>117</b> is selected, and an image represented by volume rendering (VR), which is a reconstructed second medical image <b>133</b> corresponding to the selected thumbnail <b>117</b>B, and an image represented by MPR, which is a second medical image <b>151</b> corresponding to the selected thumbnail image, are displayed in the detailed image display area <b>113</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Note that the second medical images <b>133</b> and <b>151</b> are generated from the same image data. Then, link information of link character <b>135</b>A, link position <b>135</b>C, and association indicator <b>135</b>B is displayed in both images, one of which is represented by VR and the other of which is represented by MPR. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in addition to the link character <b>135</b>A, a phrase before and after the lesion character <b>141</b> described in the image reading report is further displayed in comment <b>135</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the same link information is displayed in each of a plurality of second medical images, but the display method is not limited to this, and the link information may be selectively displayed according to the type of each of the second medical images, such as VR, MIP, or the like. For example, a selective display option may be provided with respect to each link character and if VR is set to the selective display option, the link information may be displayed only in an image represented by VR method, while if MIP is set to the selective display option, the link information may be displayed only in an image represented by MIP method. In the case where the link information is associated with lesion characters of a plurality of image reading reports, the selective display option may be set with respect to each image reading report. More specifically, image reading report identification information for identifying each image reading report, such as the date and time of each image reading report or the like, may be set as the link information, and the same selective display option is set to the same link information.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">As described above, according to the fourth embodiment, by displaying link information in each of a plurality of second medical images constructed from a plurality of medical images, including the first medical image, an image diagnosis may be made using a plurality of reconstructed medical images with respect to the same lesion, whereby the image reading may be made more efficiently and accurately. In the case where the link information is selectively displayed with respect to the type of second medical image, only necessary information may be displayed on the second medical image according to the type of second medical image, resulting in a more efficient and accurate image reading.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">As a modification of the fourth embodiment, a configuration may be adopted in which, in one of the second medical images, display of another second medical image is selectable from GUI, and the another second image is displayed instead of or in addition to the one of the second medical image on medical image display means <b>60</b> in response to the selection to display the another second image. For example, a configuration may be adopted in which when the right button of the mouse is clicked on a second medical image represented by VR method, display methods, including MIP, MPR, and the like, are selectably displayed in a pull-down menu, and if MIP is selected by the user from the pull-down menu using the mouse or the like, another second medical image represented by MIP method is displayed instead of the second medical image represented by VR method.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Further, as another modification of the first embodiment described in the present specification, in the case where the second medical image has time series image data, the second medical image may be displayed four-dimensionally with the link information being displayed at the link position of the second medical image.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Next, a fifth embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a functional block diagram of the fifth embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the fifth embodiment further includes display condition determination means <b>90</b> for obtaining a lesion character described in an image reading report from lesion storage means <b>20</b>, extracting a keyword corresponding to the lesion character, and determining the display condition from the extracted keyword, and second medical image generation means <b>91</b> for generating a second medical image based on the determined display condition and storing the generated second medical image in medical image storage means <b>50</b>. Further, medical image display means <b>60</b> according to the fifth embodiment displays the second medical image based on the determined display condition.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates display condition determination means <b>90</b> broken into functional blocks. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, display condition determination means <b>90</b> includes keyword table <b>93</b>, keyword extraction section <b>92</b>, display condition table <b>94</b>, and display condition determination section <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Keyword extraction section <b>92</b> obtains a lesion character described in an image reading report from lesion storage means <b>20</b> and extracts keywords K<b>1</b>, K<b>2</b> serving as a display condition determinant factor using keyword table <b>93</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows, by way of example, keyword table <b>93</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, keyword table <b>93</b> is a table in which keywords and lesion characters are associated and information of anatomical structures and lesions are registered as lesion characters and extraction target words. Keyword extraction section <b>92</b> obtains a lesion character registered in the lesion information from lesion storage means <b>20</b>. In this example, it is assumed that &#x201c;left lung&#x201d; and &#x201c;nodule&#x201d; are obtained as the lesion characters in the lesion information. Next, keyword extraction section <b>92</b> converts a lesion character hit by searching to a keyword. That is, &#x201c;left lung&#x201d; is converted to &#x201c;lung&#x201d; (keyword K<b>1</b>) which is associated with various words, while the &#x201c;nodule&#x201d; becomes a keyword &#x201c;nodule&#x201d; (keyword K<b>2</b>) as-is.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The keyword extraction method is not limited to that described above, and it is possible to employ any known natural language processing techniques such as those used in search engines. But, the searching using the keyword table described above is sufficiently effective if the names of anatomical structures and lesions are standardized by providing a user interface for selectively inputting anatomical structures and lesions when generating an image reading report. In the fifth embodiment, keyword extraction section <b>92</b> may directly use a lesion character as a keyword without providing the keyword table. Provision of the keyword table, however, allows one keyword to be associated with a plurality of lesion characters, so that the display condition for various lesion characters may be set efficiently without unnecessarily increasing the number of keywords registered in the display condition table.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Then, using the keywords K<b>1</b>, K<b>2</b> extracted by keyword extraction section <b>92</b>, display condition determination section <b>95</b> identifies the display condition associated with these keywords K<b>1</b>, k<b>2</b> by reference to display condition table <b>94</b> for determining image processing method for generating and displaying a second medical image from a plurality of medical images, including a first medical image, and/or determining the display mode of the second medical image.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Such display conditions can be maintained by the users of doctors of the diagnosis and treatment department, or the like by performing registration, modification, and deletion. The maintenance may be directly performed on display condition table <b>94</b>, but it is preferable that the maintenance may be implemented through a GUI for interactively performing input or selection operations for the contents of the display condition table. Further, it is also desirable that the display condition for the currently displayed image may be confirmed from the GUI. The reason is that this will facilitate understanding of the users at the time of image diagnosis and operability for editing display condition table may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Preferably, display condition table <b>94</b> includes display conditions associated with each keyword, such as VR color template, parameters of gradation and emphasis processing, window width of medical image, window level, image recognition processing using CAD and the like. Here, VR color template is a template for determining the VR color display mode in which RGB or opacity is set in association with the density value of the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows, by way of example, display condition table <b>94</b><i>a</i>. For example, if the lesion character is a character indicating blood vessel abnormality, display condition determination means <b>90</b> extracts &#x201c;blood vessel&#x201d; as the keyword from the keyword table, and determines the display condition &#x201c;<b>101</b>&#x201d; corresponding to the keyword &#x201c;blood vessel&#x201d; from display condition table <b>94</b><i>a</i>. Then, display condition determination means <b>90</b> outputs the determined display condition &#x201c;<b>101</b>&#x201d; and lesion character &#x201c;blood vessel&#x201d; to second medical image generation means <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Second medical image generation means <b>91</b> obtains the display condition &#x201c;<b>101</b>&#x201d; and lesion character &#x201c;blood vessel&#x201d; from display condition determination means <b>90</b> and obtains image data that include a first medical image associated with the lesion character &#x201c;blood vessel&#x201d; by reference to lesion storage means <b>20</b>. Then, based on the image type &#x201c;VR&#x201d; associated with the display condition &#x201c;<b>101</b>&#x201d;, second medical image generation means <b>91</b> generates a second medical image by the VR method from the obtained image data and stores the generated second medical image in medical image storage means <b>50</b>. The second medical image is stored in medical image storage means <b>50</b> with information identifying the display condition of the second medical image, for example, display condition ID &#x201c;<b>101</b>&#x201d;, being associated by tag information or the like. In the case where the type of second medical image is determined in association with the keyword in the manner as described above, the second medical image may be generated by the reconstruction method appropriate for the lesion or organ and displayed, resulting in more efficient and accurate image reading.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Then, when an instruction to display the second medical image is received by way of user input or the like, medical image display means <b>60</b> obtains the second medical image and information identifying the display condition of the second medical image, such as display condition ID &#x201c;<b>101</b>&#x201d;, from medical image storage means <b>50</b>, obtains display condition &#x201c;<b>101</b>&#x201d; from display condition determination means <b>90</b>, and displays the second medical image based on the display condition &#x201c;<b>101</b>&#x201d;. Determined display condition &#x201c;<b>101</b>&#x201d; associated with the keyword &#x201c;blood vessel&#x201d; sets &#x201c;VR&#x201d; as the type of second medical image, coordinates of starting point and widow size &#x201c;(0, 0), W=512, H=512&#x201d; as the display position information of display window of the second medical image, and VR color template &#x201c;Cr<b>1</b>&#x201d; as the color template. Therefore, medical image display means <b>60</b> obtains the second medical image reconstructed by the VR method from medical image storage means <b>50</b> and displays the image in a window of W=512 and H=512 from coordinates (0, 0) by applying the VR color template Cr<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Further, for example, with respect to each organ, a color template that best displays each organ may be provided. For example, if the link character is &#x201c;liver&#x201d;, color template Cr<b>2</b> provided for livers is selected and the liver is displayed by the VR method based on the selected color template Cr<b>2</b>. As the second medical image is displayed according to the lesion character, more efficient and accurate image reading may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Further, medical image display means <b>60</b> may be a means that displays the second medical image centered on the link position in the image. For example, medical image display means <b>60</b> may be a means that obtains the link position from link position storage means <b>30</b> and, based on the display condition obtained from display condition determination means <b>90</b>, displays the second medical image in a display window of a specific size disposed at a specific position such that the link position comes to the center of the display window.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">By displaying the second medical image such that the link position comes to the center of the display window, the second medical image may be displayed such that the position of lesion area is visually recognized easily, so that more efficient and accurate image reading may be performed. Note that the second medical image is not necessarily displayed such that the position of lesion area comes to the center of the display window as long as the position of lesion area is visually recognized easily.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">As a modification of the fifth embodiment, in the case where the second medical image has already been generated and stored in medical image storage means <b>50</b>, and the display condition table is not a table in which an image type is associated with a keyword, second medical image generation means <b>91</b> is not required since it is not necessary to generate the second medical image. More specifically, display condition determination means <b>90</b> obtains a lesion character described in an image reading report from lesion storage means <b>20</b>, then extracts the keyword corresponding to the lesion character, and determines the display condition for the second medical image from the extracted keyword. Then, medical image display means <b>60</b> may display the second medical image already generated and stored in medical image storage means <b>50</b> based on the determined display condition.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">A further modification of the fifth embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows, by way of example, a display condition table <b>94</b><i>b </i>of the further modification of the fifth embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, in the further modification of the fifth embodiment, the medical image display apparatus further includes a plurality of CADs of different types and the display condition table <b>94</b><i>b </i>is a table in which image processing using automatic recognition processing by CAD is set in association with each keyword. For the extraction of an organ or lesion using CAD, various known automatic recognition techniques, including the examples described above, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In the further modification of the fifth embodiment, if the lesion character is, for example, a character representing a cardiac lesion, display condition determination means <b>90</b> extracts a keyword &#x201c;heart&#x201d;, and determines a display condition &#x201c;<b>201</b>&#x201d; corresponding to the keyword &#x201c;heart&#x201d; from the display condition table <b>94</b><i>b</i>. The display condition &#x201c;<b>201</b>&#x201d; includes cardiac extraction and coronary artery extraction, and distinguishable display of the extracted heart and coronary artery in association with the keyword &#x201c;heart&#x201d;. Medical image display means <b>60</b> performs cardiac extraction and coronary artery extraction on a second medical image obtained from medical image storage means <b>50</b> based on the display condition &#x201c;<b>201</b>&#x201d; and displays the second medical image with the extracted heart being displayed in a distinguishable manner and the extracted coronary artery of the heart being displayed in a further distinguishable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Here, an option for hiding an anatomical structure, such as the extracted organ or the like, by masking the structure may be set in association with the keyword.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">For example, as shown in &#x201c;<b>202</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>203</b>&#x201d; of display condition table <b>94</b><i>b</i>, liver extraction and &#x201c;non-display other than the extracted anatomical structure&#x201d; may be set in association with the keyword &#x201c;liver&#x201d;, or spleen extraction and &#x201c;non-display other than the extracted anatomical structure&#x201d; may be set in association with the keyword &#x201c;spleen&#x201d;. In this case, for example, with respect to a lesion character representing &#x201c;lesion of liver and spleen&#x201d;, display condition determination means <b>90</b> extracts keywords &#x201c;liver&#x201d; and &#x201c;spleen&#x201d; from keyword table <b>93</b>, and determines display conditions &#x201c;<b>202</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>203</b>&#x201d; from the display condition table <b>94</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Medical image display means <b>60</b> obtains the determined display conditions &#x201c;<b>202</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>203</b>&#x201d; from display condition determination means <b>90</b>, obtains a plurality of medical images, including a first medical image or a second medical image from medical image storage means <b>50</b>, and extracts the liver and spleen from the obtained medical image by CAD. Then, medical image display means <b>60</b> hides an organ other than the extracted liver and spleen by masking.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Further, as shown in the display condition &#x201c;<b>204</b>&#x201d; in display condition table <b>94</b><i>b</i>, an option for extracting a bone by CAD and hiding the extracted anatomical structure may be set in association with the keyword &#x201c;blood vessel&#x201d;. In this case, medical image display means <b>60</b> obtains the display condition &#x201c;<b>204</b>&#x201d;, extracts a bone by CAD from the second medical image obtained from medical image storage means <b>50</b>, and hides the extracted bone by masking when displaying the second medical image.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">As described above, in the case where image recognition processing by CAD is set in the display condition in association with the keyword, the second image may be displayed with the lesion or organ being displayed in an easily distinguishable manner according to the keyword extracted in association with the lesion character of a lesion, organ, or the like, whereby more efficient and accurate image reading may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Embodiments described above may be applicable to other embodiments without the nature thereof being changed.</p>
