<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/090,624 filed 21 Aug. 2008.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently, sub-sea equipment (e.g., submersible pumps, manifolds, and trees) may be deployed and/or retrieved using a semi-submersible drilling rig. Typically, the drilling rigs are configured to hoist the sub-sea equipment from the ocean floor to the surface through the use of cables and lines. Once the sub-sea equipment has reached the surface, it may be lifted through an opening in the center of the rig (e.g., moon pool) and onto the deck of the drilling rig. As such, the piece of sub-sea equipment being retrieved or deployed may be susceptible to being damaged during transportation. Further, drilling rigs are extremely expensive to operate, costing around $600,000-$800,000/day to lease. Furthermore, drilling rigs are transported at a slow rate when compared to other floating vessels (e.g., ships, tug boats), which may increase the amount of time it takes to retrieve and/or deploy sub-sea equipment. Accordingly, there exists a need for an efficient and cost effective system to retrieve and/or deploy sub-sea equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2003/0221602 discloses an alternative for deploying and installing subsea equipment using a workboat or other vessel of opportunity. The equipment is not supported directly by the vessel, but is instead supported by one or more buoys below the wave zone. The buoys are controlled by a combination of chain, wire rope, and synthetic line linking it to the workboat. As such, the buoy system described therein decouples vessel motion from the payload by supporting the payload from the buoys below the wave zone. Because the buoys are below the wave action and its associated turbulence, there is little energy and hence little tendency for motion. The result is a stable, inexpensive, maneuverable system capable of servicing large subsea payloads in a wide range of water depths. U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2003/0221602 is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 7,314,084 discloses a system comprising a pumping module coupled to an intermediate flow inlet (IFI) wherein said IFI is coupled to a base structure disposed on the flow line that routes production from one or more oil wells, allowing for the quick and easy installation or recovery of a subsea pumping module by cable from an inexpensive vessel. The disclosure also provides for the hydraulic isolation of the subsea pumping module by means of on-off valves on the IFI whereby the pumping module can be easily installed or removed without causing underwater oil spills. Sealing of the connection is of the metal-metal type. It is also possible to pass a pig through the system for clearing the flow lines. U.S. Pat. No. 7,314,084 is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 7,150,325 discloses a subsea pumping assembly located on a seafloor for pumping well fluid from subsea wells to the level. The pumping assembly has a tubular outer housing that is at least partially embedded in the seafloor. A tubular primary housing located in the outer housing and has a lower end with a receptacle. An annular space surrounds the primary housing within the outer housing for delivering fluid to a receptacle at the lower end of the primary housing. A capsule is lowered in and retrieved from the primary housing. The capsule sealingly engages the receptacle for receiving well fluid from the annular space. A submersible pump is located inside the capsule. The pump has an intake that receives well fluid and a discharge that discharges the well fluid exterior of this capsule. The capsule has a valve in its inlet that when closed prevents leakage of well fluid from the capsule. The capsule may be retrieved through open sea without a riser. U.S. Pat. No. 7,150,325 is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2005/0220645 discloses a booster pumping system for producing hydrocarbons from a subsea production well. The booster pumping system includes: (1) a submersible pump hydraulically connected to the production well to provide energy to the hydrocarbon flow and boost production to another destination such as a subsea production facility or the surface via a riser; (2) an inlet conduit to receive the flow from the production well and isolate the flow from the dummy wellbore and direct the flow to the intake of the pump; and (3) a motor exposed to the dummy wellbore to drive the pump. The dummy wellbore may be flooded or circulated with seawater to cool the motor. U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2005/0220645 is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2006/0118310 discloses a subsea production system for producing petroleum by artificial elevation, assisted by submersible centrifugal pumps (SCPs) upstream of the WCT and installed on the seabed, including a pumping module having one of more SCPs, installed in series or in parallel, with an inclination of up to 85 degrees in relation to the vertical, the module being connectable to a flow base to permit the &#x201c;bypass&#x201d; of production and wherein the pumping module and the flow base may be linked to installation and recovery by cable. A production line is connected upstream to the pumping module upstream and another production line is connected downstream to the pumping module. A method of installing the system in a new wellhead is described, as well as a method for installing the system in an existing wellhead. The uses of the subsea production system for boosting multiphase flow, injection of water in an injector well and the transfer of oil between two points of collection are also described.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one aspect, embodiments disclosed herein relate generally to apparatuses and methods for deploying and retrieving sub-sea equipment. Specifically, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a carrier configured to receive, support, and transport sub-sea equipment.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">General Overview of Operations</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, a retrieval and deployment system <b>100</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure is shown. During a retrieval operation, a transport vessel <b>110</b> deploys buoys <b>120</b> that are attached to the transport vessel <b>110</b> through a first deployment line <b>130</b> and support chain <b>140</b>. The deployment line <b>130</b> may be connected to the support chain <b>140</b> by a connector <b>135</b>. The connector <b>135</b> may be a threaded connector, an interference fit connector, a swivel, a hook, or any other connection device known in the art. Further, the support chain <b>140</b> may have a &#x201c;belly&#x201d; that allows the transport vessel <b>110</b> to heave independently of the buoys <b>120</b>. As such, this may effectively decouple the movement of the buoys <b>120</b> from the movement of the transport vessel <b>110</b>. Further, a system that uses a chain to decouple the movement of a buoy from the movement of a vessel may be referred to as a Heave Compensated and Landing System (HCLS) and is discussed in U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0221602, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Furthermore, the weight of the support chain <b>140</b> (which may be located under the buoys <b>120</b>, as shown) may be used to control the depth of the buoys <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once the buoys <b>120</b> have been deployed, the buoys <b>120</b> are lowered towards the ocean floor <b>40</b> to retrieve sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. Sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> may include, for example, electrical submersible pumps, trees, manifolds, or any other equipment known in the art. The buoys <b>120</b> may be raised and lowered using a hoist, crane, winch, or other lifting device known in the art. For example, the buoys <b>120</b> may be raised and lowered using a lifting device <b>112</b> that is disposed on the transport vessel <b>110</b>, such as by increasing and decreasing the length of the deployment line <b>130</b> and support chain <b>140</b> which are connected to the buoys <b>120</b>. As the buoys <b>120</b> reach a depth near the ocean floor <b>40</b>, a support cable <b>160</b>, which is coupled to the buoys <b>120</b>, may be connected to the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. Similar to the connector <b>135</b>, the support cable <b>160</b> may be connected to the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> through the use of a threaded connector, an interference fit connector, a swivel, a hook, or any other connection device known in the art. The connection is typically accomplished using the assistance of a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) <b>115</b>. After the support cable <b>160</b> is attached to the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>, the buoys <b>120</b> may raise the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to a specific depth below the surface of the ocean <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> is being raised to a specific depth, a carrier <b>300</b>, such as a rathole, is deployed from the transport vessel <b>110</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), or from a secondary transport vessel (not shown). While at an equilibrium state (e.g., before any exterior force is applied) the carrier <b>300</b> is configured to float in a horizontal position on the surface of the ocean <b>30</b>. During operation, a support chain <b>240</b> is attached to one end of the carrier <b>300</b>. The support chain <b>240</b> may be coupled to the transport vessel <b>110</b> via a deployment line <b>230</b>. The support chain <b>240</b> is positioned and lengthened such that the support chain <b>240</b> pulls down on one end of the carrier <b>300</b>, thereby causing the carrier <b>300</b> to rotate to a vertical position. The support chain <b>240</b> may be similar to support chain <b>140</b>, thereby decoupling the movement of the carrier <b>300</b> from the movement of the transport vessel <b>110</b>. Once the carrier <b>300</b> is rotated to a vertical position, the carrier <b>300</b> is lowered to a depth below the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>, which is attached to support cable <b>160</b>. Following the lowering of the carrier <b>300</b> to a depth below the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>, the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> is positioned and placed within the carrier <b>300</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). For example, using the buoys <b>120</b>, the first deployment line <b>130</b>, and the support chain <b>140</b>, the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> may be lowered into an opening (not shown) within the carrier <b>300</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In such an embodiment, the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> is lowered into the opening to a position that allows the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to be secured within the carrier <b>300</b>. After being placed within the carrier <b>300</b>, the ROV <b>115</b> may then be used to engage at least one locking mechanism (not shown), which will secure the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> within the carrier <b>300</b>. The locking mechanism may include, for example, locking pins, levers, or other locking components known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Upon securing the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to the carrier <b>300</b>, the support cable <b>160</b> may be detached from the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> using the ROV <b>115</b>. After the support cable <b>160</b> has been disconnected, the carrier <b>300</b> is raised toward the surface of the ocean <b>30</b> by drawing in deployment line <b>230</b> though the use of the lifting device <b>112</b>, such as a crane, winch, hoist or other lifting device known in the art (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As the carrier <b>300</b> nears the surface of the ocean <b>30</b>, the support chain <b>240</b> and deployment line <b>230</b> may remain connected to the carrier <b>300</b>. After, the carrier <b>300</b> and the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> begin to float near the surface <b>30</b>, the carrier <b>300</b> may return to a nearly horizontal position of equilibrium on the surface of the ocean <b>30</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The transport vessel <b>110</b> may then be used to transport the carrier <b>300</b> and sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to another location. In one embodiment, the transport vessel <b>110</b> may pull the carrier <b>300</b> while it is still floating at or near the surface of the ocean water via the deployment line <b>230</b>. Alternatively, the carrier <b>300</b> may be lifted on to the deck of the transport vessel <b>110</b> and then transported to another location, or the carrier <b>300</b> may be secured to the side of the transport vessel <b>110</b> for transportation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an alternative embodiment, vessel <b>110</b> may be used to first lower carrier <b>300</b> into the body of water by lowering line <b>230</b>, and allowing chain <b>240</b> to rest on the ocean floor <b>40</b>, then disconnecting line <b>230</b> from lifting device <b>112</b>. After carrier <b>300</b> has been installed at a desired location in the body of water, equipment <b>170</b> may be retrieved with line <b>160</b> as described above and connected to carrier <b>300</b>. Then line <b>160</b> may be disconnected from equipment <b>170</b>, and line <b>230</b> retrieved and reconnected to lifting device <b>112</b>, to transport carrier <b>300</b> with equipment <b>170</b> inside.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, a retrieval and deployment system <b>200</b> in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein is shown. In this embodiment, two transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> are used, as compared to the system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. Similar to the above embodiment, the transport vessel <b>110</b> deploys buoys <b>120</b> that are attached to the transport vessel <b>110</b> through the deployment line <b>130</b> and support chain <b>140</b>. After deployment, the buoys are lowered towards the ocean floor <b>40</b> to retrieve the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. The buoys may be raised and lowered using the lifting device <b>112</b> that is disposed on the transport vessel <b>110</b>, such as by increasing and decreasing the length of the deployment line <b>130</b> and support chain <b>140</b> which are connected to the buoys <b>120</b>. Further, the weight and/or length of the support chain <b>140</b> may be used to control the depth of the buoys <b>120</b>. As the buoys <b>120</b> reach a depth near the ocean floor <b>40</b>, the support cable <b>160</b> coupled to the buoys <b>120</b> connects to the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. The connection may be accomplished using the assistance of the ROV <b>115</b>. After the support cable <b>160</b> is attached to the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>, the buoys <b>120</b> may raise the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to a specific depth below the surface of the ocean <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> is being raised to a specific depth, the carrier <b>300</b> may be deployed from a second transport vessel <b>111</b>. During deployment and operation, a support chain <b>240</b> is attached to one end of the carrier <b>300</b>, in which the support chain <b>240</b> may be coupled to the transport vessel <b>111</b> via the deployment line <b>230</b>. The support chain <b>240</b> is positioned and lengthened such that the support chain <b>240</b> pulls down on one end of the carrier <b>300</b>. Similar to the above embodiment, the carrier <b>300</b> is lowered to a depth below the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. If necessary, the support chain <b>240</b> may be allowed to slacken and/or placed on the ocean floor <b>40</b> to isolate the carrier <b>300</b> from heave of the second transport vessel <b>111</b>. Following the lowering of the carrier <b>300</b> to a depth below the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>, the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> is positioned and placed within the carrier <b>300</b>. After being placed within the carrier <b>300</b>, the ROV <b>115</b> may then be used to engage at least one locking mechanism to secure the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to the carrier <b>300</b>. As shown, ROV <b>115</b> is shown connected to vessel <b>110</b>, but alternatively could be connected to vessel <b>111</b> or a third vessel (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">After equipment <b>170</b> has been connected to carrier <b>300</b>, support cable <b>160</b> may then be detached from the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> using the ROV <b>115</b>. After the support cable <b>160</b> has been disconnected, the carrier <b>300</b> is raised toward the surface of the ocean <b>30</b> by drawing in deployment line <b>230</b> though the use of the lifting device <b>112</b> on vessel <b>111</b>. As the carrier <b>300</b> nears the surface of the ocean <b>30</b>, the support chain <b>240</b> and deployment line <b>230</b> may remain connected to the carrier <b>300</b>. In this embodiment, the second transport vessel <b>111</b> may pull the carrier <b>300</b> while it is still floating near the surface <b>30</b> of the ocean water via the deployment line <b>230</b>. Alternatively, the carrier <b>300</b> may be lifted on to the deck of the second transport vessel <b>111</b> and then transported to another location, or the carrier <b>300</b> may be secured to the side of the second transport vessel <b>111</b> for transportation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A method similar to those described above may be used to deploy sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. During the deployment operation, the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> is attached to the carrier <b>300</b> while at the surface of the ocean <b>30</b>. Similar to above, the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> may be attached to the carrier <b>300</b> through the use of a locking mechanism. Once the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> is connected to the carrier <b>300</b>, the carrier <b>300</b> is deployed and lowered towards the ocean floor <b>40</b> via the support chain <b>240</b> and deployment line <b>230</b>. While the carrier <b>300</b> is being lowered, the buoys <b>120</b> may be deployed and lowered to a depth above the carrier <b>300</b>. The support cable <b>160</b> is then connected to the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. After the support cable <b>160</b> is attached to the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>, the locking mechanism is deactivated. Both the connection of the support cable <b>160</b> and the deactivation of the locking mechanism may be accomplished using the assistance of the ROV <b>115</b>. The sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> may then be removed from the carrier <b>300</b>, such as by raising the buoys <b>120</b> until the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> has been completely removed from within the carrier <b>300</b>. Finally, the buoys <b>120</b> may transfer the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to a well head <b>210</b> or other desired location near the ocean floor <b>40</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> are configured to transport, retrieve, and/or deploy sub-sea equipment. In one embodiment, the transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> include lifting devices <b>112</b> that are used to control the length of the deployment lines <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> released from the transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>. Accordingly, the lifting devices <b>112</b> may be used to control the depth of the buoys <b>120</b> and/or carrier <b>300</b>. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the lifting devices <b>112</b> may include winches, cranes, or other lifting devices known in the art. In certain embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, a single transport vessel <b>110</b> may be used to transport, retrieve, and/or deploy the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. In other embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, more than one transport vessel, such as two transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>, may be used to transport, retrieve, and/or deploy the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. The transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may include work boats, tug boats, ships, or other transport vessels known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ROV <b>115</b>, which may swim on an umbilical <b>117</b> from a cage <b>119</b>, may be used to monitor and/or assist with launching, lowering, releasing, and/or locking of the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. Additionally, the ROV <b>115</b> may provide visual feedback to the operators while maneuvering equipment during deployment and retrieval operations.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The buoys <b>120</b> are configured to transfer the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> and are typically made of sealed vessels, synthetic foam, or syntactic foam, or other buoyant materials known in the art. As such, the buoys <b>120</b> are capable of applying a buoyancy force on the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> while submerged within the ocean water. As used herein, buoyancy force is the upward force on an object produced by the surrounding fluid (i.e., ocean water). The buoyancy force of the buoys <b>120</b> may move the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> upwards and downwards during deployment and retrieval operations. Further, the buoys <b>120</b> are attached to the support chain <b>140</b> and the support cable <b>160</b>. In certain embodiments, the buoys are attached to the support chain <b>140</b> and support cable <b>160</b> through swivels, hooks, or other attachment methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The support chain <b>140</b> couples the buoys <b>120</b> to the deployment line <b>130</b>. The support chain <b>240</b> couples the carrier <b>300</b> to the deployment line <b>230</b>. Further, as stated above, the support chains <b>140</b>, <b>240</b> allow the transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> to move vertically, relatively independently of the buoys <b>120</b> and the carrier <b>300</b>. As a result, the transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> may heave up and down with minimal corresponding movement of the buoys <b>120</b> and/or the carrier <b>300</b>. The weight of the support chains <b>140</b>, <b>240</b> should be sufficient to counteract most of the buoyancy force of the buoys <b>120</b> and the carrier <b>300</b>, thereby allowing the depth of the buoys <b>120</b> and carrier <b>300</b> to be adjusted. Selecting the support chain size and weight requires establishing a balance between optimizing the &#x201c;belly,&#x201d; the portion of chain containing &#x201c;slack&#x201d; of the support chain <b>140</b>, <b>240</b>, and de-coupling the buoys <b>120</b> and/or carrier <b>300</b> from the transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the size of the support chain should facilitate a reasonable &#x201c;belly&#x201d; length and be fairly easy to handle. Alternatively, a portion of support chains <b>140</b> and/or <b>240</b> may be laid on the ocean floor <b>40</b> to isolate vessel <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> movement from movement of buoys <b>120</b> and/or carrier <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The deployment line <b>130</b> and the deployment line <b>230</b> are configured to couple the support chain <b>140</b> to the transport vessel <b>110</b> and the support chain <b>240</b> to the transport vessel <b>111</b>, respectively. The deployment lines <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> are typically steel cables. However, in certain embodiments, the deployment lines <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> may include chains, wires, ropes or any other deployment device known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, the deployment lines <b>130</b>, <b>230</b> may be configured to couple the transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> to the carrier <b>300</b> during operation. In one embodiment, the deployment line <b>230</b> may be connected to an end of the carrier <b>300</b> and be configured to raise and lower the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>, in addition to assist in stabilizing the carrier <b>300</b> during operation. In other embodiments, the deployment line <b>230</b> may be coupled to other locations on the carrier <b>300</b>, such as, the middle section. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the deployment line <b>230</b> may have sufficient strength to allow the transport vessels <b>110</b>, <b>111</b> to pull the carrier <b>300</b> to another location of deployment and/or retrieval.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The support cable <b>160</b> is configured to couple the buoys <b>120</b> to the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. The support cable <b>160</b> has sufficient strength to support the weight of the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>, which allows the buoys <b>120</b> to transfer the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to various depths during operation. Similar to the deployment lines <b>130</b>, <b>230</b>, the support cable <b>160</b> may include ropes, chains, wires, or any other support device known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, as shown, clump weights, or other similar weighting devices, may be used to increase the weight of the support chains <b>140</b>, <b>240</b>. For example, by attaching one or more clump weights to the support chain <b>140</b>, the support chain <b>140</b> may increase in weight without having to increase the size or length of the support chain. Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the clump weights may be used with other components of the present disclosure, such as with the buoys and/or support cables, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the carrier <b>300</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure is shown. The carrier <b>300</b> includes floatation devices <b>310</b> and structural frames <b>320</b> that are coupled together. In this embodiment, both the structural frames <b>320</b> and the floatation devices <b>310</b> include an opening or axial bore <b>318</b> therethrough that allows the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to be received and released from the carrier <b>300</b>. The floatation devices <b>310</b> provide the required buoyancy force to move the carrier <b>300</b> along with the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> during the retrieval and deployment operations, in addition to providing structural continuity for the carrier <b>300</b>. The structural frames <b>320</b> provide a structure to which the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> is secured. In addition, the structural frames <b>320</b> and the floatation devices <b>310</b> may offer protection to the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> while being deployed, retrieved, and/or transported.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C, in certain embodiments, the structural frame <b>320</b> includes support members <b>322</b>.

Further, the support members <b>322</b> form an opening <b>324</b> within the support frame <b>320</b>, which allows the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> to be received by the carrier <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>). One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the opening <b>324</b> may vary in size depending upon the type of sub-sea equipment <b>170</b> being handled by the carrier <b>300</b>. Further, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the structural frame <b>320</b> may be buoyant, partially buoyant, or non-buoyant.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, in certain embodiments, the carrier <b>300</b> is modular.

The connections <b>326</b> may include bolts, nuts, latches or any other connection device known in the art, that allow the structural frame <b>320</b> to be connected and disconnected from the floatation device <b>310</b>, thereby enabling the carrier <b>300</b> to be modular. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the modularity of the carrier <b>300</b> may make the carrier <b>300</b> easier to transport, both on land and at sea, and capable of being assembled at the location of retrieval and/or deployment. Furthermore, the connections <b>326</b> may allow additional structural frames <b>320</b> and/or additional floatation devices <b>310</b> to be connected to the carrier <b>300</b>, such as to make a longer or shorter carrier <b>300</b>, depending on the length and/or weight of the sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>. By allowing additional structural frames <b>320</b> and floatation devices <b>310</b> to be connected to the carrier <b>300</b>, the carrier <b>300</b> may be configured in various shapes and sizes, which may permit the carrier <b>300</b> to receive various types and sizes of sub-sea equipment <b>170</b>.
