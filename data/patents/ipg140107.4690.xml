<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2006-111035, filed Nov. 10, 2006, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods and apparatuses consistent with the present invention relate to authentication and an image display apparatus thereof, and more particularly, to an authenticating method which prevents an abnormal screen from being displayed due to High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) authentication error, and an image display apparatus thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Widespread distribution of digital images has brought introduction of interface between digital image devices such as settop boxes, DVD players, multimedia sources such as PCs, and video displays such as AV devices, monitors, digital televisions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Digital interfaces such as Digital Visual Interface (DVI) and High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) are available, and unlicensed copying of digital content through the digital interfaces is prohibited under the specification, High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the structure of a multimedia source system being connected with an associated video display through a digital interface. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a settop box <b>10</b> is connected with a TV <b>100</b> through DVI/HDMI cable.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The settop box <b>10</b> detects that it is connected with the TV <b>100</b> through DVI/HDMI cable, based on a HPD signal being input from the TV <b>100</b>. The settop box <b>10</b> determines that the TV <b>100</b> has a HDCP authentication key, in response to a high HPD signal. Upon determination that the TV <b>100</b> has the HDCP authentication key, the settop box <b>10</b> outputs digital video data which represent normal screen on the TV <b>100</b>. If determining that the TV <b>100</b> does not have a HDCP authentication key, the settop box <b>10</b> outputs scrambled digital video data, which represent abnormal image on the TV <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The settop box <b>10</b> generally determines the presence of a HDCP authentication key of the TV <b>100</b> in every two or three seconds. However, some settop boxes determine that the TV <b>100</b> does not have a HDCP authentication key, if the TV <b>100</b> is turned on after the settop boxes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, some settop boxes output scrambled digital video data on the TV <b>100</b>, mistakenly determining that the TV <b>100</b> does not have a HDCP authentication key.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The similar mistake can arise when the HDCP authentication of the TV <b>100</b> was successful. That is, in certain cases, erroneous authentication information may be transmitted to the settop box <b>10</b> or the authentication information may not be transmitted to the settop box <b>10</b> at all, due to communication error between the TV <b>100</b> and the settop box <b>10</b>, or by accidental power reset.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Because the settop box <b>10</b> erroneously determines that the TV <b>100</b> does not have a HDCP authentication key, scrambled digital video data is output on the TV <b>100</b> and as a result, abnormal screen is displayed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the TV <b>200</b> may include a connecting unit <b>210</b>, an image processing unit <b>220</b>, a display unit <b>230</b>, a storage unit <b>240</b>, a controller <b>250</b>, and a reset signal generating unit <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The connecting unit <b>210</b> is connected with the settop box <b>10</b>, and receives digital image data therefrom. The connecting unit <b>210</b> receives a HDMI recognition signal according to a voltage being output from the settop box <b>10</b>, and a HDCP authentication request signal, and outputs a high level of Hot Plug Detection (HPD) signal and a HDCP authentication response signal to the settop box <b>10</b> as a response signal.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The image processing unit <b>220</b> processes the digital image data being received through the connecting unit <b>210</b> into a displayable form, using the HDCP authentication key, and displays the digital image corresponding to the processed digital image data on the display unit <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The storage unit <b>240</b> stores settings of a HPD signal which is optimized to the settop box <b>10</b>, according to the control of the controller <b>250</b>. In one exemplary implementation, the storage unit <b>240</b> may be an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The controller <b>250</b>, upon receipt of a HDCP authentication request signal from the connecting unit <b>210</b>, controls the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> to output a HPD signal. The controller <b>250</b>, upon receipt of a HDCP authentication request signal from the connecting unit <b>210</b>, outputs a HDCP authentication response signal to the settop box <b>10</b> through the connecting unit <b>210</b>, to indicate the presence of the HDCP authentication key.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If a HDCP authentication response signal, indicating a successful HDCP authentication, is not received from the settop box <b>10</b>, or scrambled digital image data is received, the controller <b>250</b> determines that a HDCP authentication error is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The controller <b>250</b> controls the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> to change a reset duration such that a HPD signal, which is optimized to the settop box <b>10</b>, is generated and output. The controller <b>250</b> also causes the settings associated with the optimized HPD signal to be stored in the storage unit <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the control of the controller <b>250</b>, the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> changes the reset duration such that a HPD signal is generated and output to the settop box <b>10</b> through the connecting unit <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The settop box <b>10</b> determines that the TV <b>200</b> has been disconnected and then connected, or the TV <b>200</b> is being turned on, if the HPD signal being input through the connecting unit <b>210</b> is changed from low level to high level, and thus performs HDCP authentication again.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the reset generating unit <b>260</b> may include resistors R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b>, and transistor Q<b>1</b>, and receive 5V voltage. A control signal is output by the controller <b>250</b> to change the reset duration of the reset signal. The control signal may be either a low level signal or a high level signal.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Because different reset durations are required for the multimedia sources, that is, because different Hot Plug Reset Durations (HPRD) are required for each of the multimedia sources, a HDCP authentication may not be performed with an initial HPD signal of the TV <b>200</b>. That is, because the settop box <b>10</b> determines that the TV <b>200</b> is not connected, if the low level HPRD contained in the HPD signal being received from the TV <b>200</b> does not match the HPRD required by the settop box <b>10</b>, the HDCP authentication may not be performed. Accordingly, the controller <b>250</b> of the TV <b>200</b> outputs a control signal to the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> such that an optimized reset signal, that is, a HPD signal, which is optimized to the requirement by the settop box <b>10</b>, is generated and output to perform HDCP re-authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">More specifically, upon receipt of a low level control signal from the controller <b>250</b>, the transistor Q<b>1</b> of the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> is switched off, and 5V voltage is output as a high level reset signal, that is, output as a HPD signal by the resistors R<b>2</b> and R<b>3</b>. Upon receipt of a high level control signal from the controller <b>250</b>, the transistor Q<b>1</b> is switched on, and 5V voltage is grounded and output as a low level HPD signal.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the duration that the controller <b>250</b> inputs a high level control signal, that is, according to a high level input duration, a HPRD being output by the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> is changed. Accordingly, in order for the settop box <b>10</b> to re-perform HDCP authentication, the controller <b>250</b> sequentially increments the high level input duration until a HPD signal, which is optimized to the settop box <b>10</b>, is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart provided to explain a method of authentication of an image display apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in one implementation, the settop box <b>10</b> determines the presence or absence of a HDCP authentication key in the TV <b>200</b> only once, that is, upon turning on. Accordingly, in this implementation, the settop box <b>10</b> does not determine the presence or absence of a HDCP authentication key, once the settop box <b>10</b> determined that there is no HDCP authentication key in the TV <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After the settop box <b>10</b> is turned on (S<b>410</b>), the TV <b>200</b> is turned on (S<b>420</b>). Because the TV <b>200</b> is turned on after the settop box <b>10</b>, the settop box <b>10</b> determines that the TV <b>200</b> does not have a HDCP authentication key.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The controller <b>250</b> of the TV <b>200</b> determines whether or not the HDCP authentication is successful (S<b>430</b>). That is, the controller <b>250</b> determines that the HDCP authentication is unsuccessful, that is, determines that the HDCP authentication includes an error, if a HDCP authentication request signal is not received from the settop box <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Upon determination that the HDCP authentication is unsuccessful (S<b>430</b>-N), the controller <b>250</b> determines whether the reset settings corresponding to the settop box <b>10</b> are stored in the storage unit <b>240</b> (S<b>440</b>). The reset settings may include conditions for an optimal HPD signal for the settop box <b>10</b>, including, for example, the name or serial number of the settop box <b>10</b>, or a high level input duration at which a control signal to generate a low level HPRD as required by the settop box <b>10</b> is constantly input.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Upon determination that the reset settings of the settop box <b>10</b> are stored (S<b>440</b>-Y), the controller <b>250</b> controls the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> to generate a HPD signal according to the reset settings associated with the settop box <b>10</b> stored in the storage unit <b>240</b> and output the generated HPD signal (S<b>450</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Upon determination that the associated reset settings of the settop box <b>10</b> are not stored (S<b>440</b>-N), the controller <b>250</b> controls the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> to change the HPRD such that a HPD signal is generated and output (S<b>460</b>). For example, the controller <b>250</b> may output to the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b> a high level control signal, in which the high level input duration is extended by 200 ms. A certain high level input duration may be used, or alternatively, a corresponding menu may be provided such that the high level input duration is set by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The controller <b>250</b> determines whether or not digital image data for displaying normal image, is received from the settop box <b>10</b> (S<b>470</b>). That is, the controller <b>250</b>, upon receipt of the digital image data which is not scrambled, determines that the HPD signal is the HPD signal optimized to the settop box <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Additionally, upon receive of the digital image data which is not scrambled, the controller <b>250</b> determines that the settop box <b>10</b> performs the HDCP authentication again and that the HDCP authentication is successful.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Upon determination that the digital image data for displaying normal image is received (S<b>470</b>-Y), the controller <b>250</b> stores to the storage unit <b>240</b>, the reset settings of the HPD signal optimized to the settop box <b>10</b> (S<b>480</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Upon determination that the digital image data for displaying normal image is not received (S<b>470</b>-N), the controller <b>250</b> increments the high level input duration by 200 ms at a time and outputs to the reset signal generating unit <b>260</b>, until the digital image data for displaying normal image is received. Although the high level input duration is extended by 200 ms at a time, it is for the exemplary purpose. In another example, a certain fixed duration may be used, or a certain duration which is variable depending on situations, may also be used.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">After the settop box <b>10</b> is turned on (S<b>510</b>), and TV <b>200</b> is turned on (S<b>520</b>).

That is, the controller <b>250</b>, in response to a HDCP authentication request signal received through the connecting unit <b>210</b>, outputs a HDCP authentication response signal, indicating the presence of HDCP authentication key, to the settop box <b>10</b> through the connecting unit <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The controller <b>250</b> determines whether or not digital image data for displaying normal image is being received from the settop box <b>10</b> (S<b>540</b>).
