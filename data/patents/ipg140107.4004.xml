<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One disclosed aspect of the embodiments relates to an exposure apparatus and a device manufacturing method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, flip-chip mounting is being employed more frequently for the mounting of semiconductor devices. The manufacturing operations of a semiconductor device performed based on flip-chip mounting include an operation of forming a solder ball on the device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example of a known method for forming a solder ball is a plating method. In a plating method, in order to bring a conductive film formed on the wafer (substrate) into contact (be in a conductive state) with the electrode in the plating apparatus, the portion of the resist formed on the conductive film for contacting the electrode has to be peeled away.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">If the resist is a negative resist, this process may be performed by preventing the exposure light from irradiating a circumferential portion of the wafer. Specifically, this process may be performed by shielding the circumferential portion of the wafer. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,774 discusses a technique in which a light shielding plate is arranged on a wafer during exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-286062 discusses an imprinting apparatus that transfers a mold pattern onto a resist by irradiating UV-rays on the resist that is arranged on a wafer in contact with a mold. In the technique discussed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-286062, in order to define irradiation regions respectively corresponding to shot regions of peripheral parts of the wafer, four light shielding plates having arcs respectively corresponding to the outline of regions corresponding to first to fourth quadrants on a wafer are driven in an X-axis direction and a Y-axis direction, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If a light shielding plate is arranged on a wafer like in U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,774, since the light shielding plate has to be retracted each time the wafer is replaced, there are restrictions in terms of space and throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Rather than arranging the light shielding plate on the wafer, the light shielding plate could be arranged on a face that is optically conjugated with the wafer, as discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-286062, and could shield a peripheral region of the wafer with this light shielding plate. In such a technique, the light shielding plate is positioned so that the distance from the periphery of the wafer to the boundary of the peripheral region is constant (i.e., a peripheral region on the inner side is shielded for a predetermined width from the periphery of the wafer) based on the position of a periphery shot region on the wafer for each periphery shot region.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, when shielding the wafer based on its outer shape as a reference, the distance between a drive reference position of the light shielding plate drive unit for driving the light shielding plate and the actual center position of the wafer (position that will serve as the exposure reference) is not always the same.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">If the distance between the drive reference position of the light shielding plate and the center position of the wafer is misaligned, when the light shielding plate is positioned based on the position of the periphery shot region on the wafer, the light shielding plate will be mispositioned by that displacement amount. Consequently, the distance from the periphery of the wafer to the boundary of the peripheral region is different for each periphery shot region, so that the width of the peripheral region shielded by the light shielding plate may not be set the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One disclosed aspect of the embodiments is directed to an exposure apparatus and a device manufacturing method capable of reducing displacement from a desired position due to the effect of displacement between an actual drive reference position of a light shielding plate drive unit and a position serving as an exposure reference (e.g., an optical axis position).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an aspect of the embodiments, an exposure apparatus including an optical system having an illumination optical system configured to illuminate an original formed with a pattern with light from a light source and a projection optical system configured to project an image of the pattern on a substrate that includes an arc-shaped portion on an outer edge, includes a light shielding plate arranged on or near to a conjugate plane with a object plane of the projection optical system on an optical path in the optical system, and including an arc-shaped portion for defining at least a part of an outer edge of a region on which the pattern image is projected on the substrate in an arc shape, a rotational drive unit configured to rotatably drive the light shielding plate around an axis of rotation along an optical path in the optical system, a shift drive unit configured to shift-drive the light shielding plate in a direction intersecting the axis of rotation, an acquisition unit configured to acquire information relating to a relative position between a reference axis serving as a reference when the pattern image is projected on the substrate by the optical system and the axis of rotation, and a control unit configured to control the rotational drive unit and the shift-drive unit so that, when projecting the pattern image on a circumferential portion near an outer edge of the substrate, the light shielding plate is positioned at a predetermined position based on the information relating to the relative position.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition, the exposure apparatus <b>100</b> includes an autofocus unit <b>10</b> for measuring the position (focus position) in the Z-axis direction of the substrate <b>9</b> held on the substrate stage <b>6</b>, and a control unit <b>21</b> including a central processing unit (CPU) and a memory, for controlling the entire exposure apparatus <b>100</b> (operations for exposing the substrate <b>9</b>). The exposure apparatus <b>100</b> also includes a light detection sensor <b>50</b> for detecting the exposure light quantity on the substrate stage <b>6</b> and an input interface <b>51</b> that allows the parameters necessary for apparatus control to be input from outside the apparatus, including displacement between the center position of the projection optical system and the center of rotation of the light shielding plate drive unit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a configuration of the illumination optical system <b>1</b> in detail. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in the present exemplary embodiment, the illumination optical system <b>1</b> includes a light source <b>11</b>. However, the illumination optical system <b>1</b> does not necessarily have to include the light source <b>11</b>, and the illumination optical system <b>1</b> and the light source <b>11</b> may be separately provided.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although in the present exemplary embodiment an ultrahigh pressure mercury lamp is used as the light source <b>11</b>, an excimer laser (KrF excimer laser or ArF excimer laser etc.) may also be used. For a condenser mirror <b>12</b>, usually, an elliptical mirror is used. However, the condenser mirror <b>12</b> is not limited to an elliptical mirror. A facet mirror optimized so as to increase the degree of concentration at the condensing point may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A shutter <b>13</b> adjusts the exposure amount on the substrate <b>9</b> on which a resist (photosensitizing agent) has been coated by adjusting open/close time under the control of the control unit <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A zoom relay optical system <b>14</b>, which has a zoom function, changes the light flux diameter at a fly-eye lens <b>15</b>. In the exposure apparatus <b>100</b>, to optimize the imaging forming ability of the projection optical system <b>5</b> according to the pattern to be transferred onto the substrate <b>9</b>, a coherence factor (&#x3c3; value) represented by (numerical aperture (NA) of illumination optical system <b>1</b>)/(NA of projection optical system <b>5</b>) is required.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present exemplary embodiment, the &#x3c3; value may be changed by changing the light flux diameter at the fly-eye lens <b>15</b> that determines the NA of the illumination optical system <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The fly-eye lens <b>15</b> splits the light flux incident on an entrance surface at the wave front to generate a secondary light source on the exit surface. The fly-eye lens <b>15</b> may be replaced with a cylindrical lens array. A condenser optical system <b>16</b> superimposes the beams of light split at the wavefront by the fly-eye lens <b>15</b> over each other on the surface to be illuminated to form a uniform illuminance distribution on the surface to be illuminated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A masking blade <b>17</b> is arranged on the surface to be illuminated of the condenser optical system <b>16</b>. The masking blade <b>17</b>, which is configured from a variable aperture diaphragm, determines the shape of one shot region (shot shape) to be repeatedly transferred by the exposure apparatus <b>100</b> by an operation and repeat method under the control of the control unit <b>21</b>. In other words, the masking blade <b>17</b> shields the light incident on a region further outwards than the straight sides defining the outer edge of the shot region on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A relay optical system <b>18</b> projects the illuminance distribution formed on a position of the masking blade <b>17</b> onto a light shielding plate <b>19</b>. Further, a relay optical system <b>20</b> projects the illuminance distribution formed on a position of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> onto the reticle <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The light shielding plate <b>19</b> may change the shape of the region on which the pattern is transferred according to the exposure position of the substrate <b>9</b> during the repeated exposure of the substrate <b>9</b> by the exposure apparatus <b>100</b> by the operation and repeat method.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The light shielding plate <b>19</b> is arranged on or near to a conjugate plane with the object plane of the projection optical system <b>5</b> in the illumination optical system <b>1</b>. The light shielding plate <b>19</b> includes on its edge an arc (an arc-shaped portion) that overlaps a circular boundary line on the inner side from the periphery of the substrate <b>9</b>, and defines the region where the pattern is to be transferred onto the substrate <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The light shielding plate <b>19</b> may function as a desired light shielding member as long as it is arranged on or near to a conjugate position with the object plane of the projection optical system <b>5</b> on the optical path in the optical system configured from the illumination optical system <b>1</b> and the projection optical system <b>5</b>. Further, the expression &#x201c;a conjugate position with the object plane of the projection optical system <b>5</b>&#x201d; may also be restated as &#x201c;a conjugate position with the pattern face that is determined by the arrangement of the reticle <b>2</b>&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The light shielding plate <b>19</b> is driven in the periphery shot region on the substrate <b>9</b> via a drive unit <b>22</b>. For example, under the control of the control unit <b>21</b>, the drive unit <b>22</b> rotatably drives the light shielding plate <b>19</b> around the axis parallel to the optical axis of the illumination optical system <b>1</b>, and linearly drives the light shielding plate <b>19</b> in the plane perpendicular to the optical axis of the illumination optical system <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present exemplary embodiment, in terms of the arrangement of the parts, the masking blade <b>17</b> and the light shielding plate <b>19</b> are arranged at different optically conjugate positions in the illumination optical system <b>1</b>, with the relay optical system <b>18</b> arranged therebetween. However, if there is no problem in terms of arrangement, the masking blade <b>17</b> may be arranged adjacent to the light shielding plate <b>19</b>. If the masking blade <b>17</b> is to be arranged adjacent to the light shielding plate <b>19</b>, but these parts do not fit in the same position, it is desirable to arrange the light shielding plate <b>19</b> at an optically conjugate position with the substrate <b>9</b>, and arrange the masking blade <b>17</b> at a defocused position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If the defocused amount due to such an arrangement is not acceptable, the light is shielded by the masking blade <b>17</b> so that the light is not incident on the region further outwards than the straight sides defining the outer edge along a first direction in the shot region. Further, a light shielding member for shielding the light with a Cr pattern on the reticle <b>2</b> is provided so that the light is not incident on the region further outwards than the straight sides defining the outer edge along a second direction orthogonal to a first direction in the shot region.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, the shape of the shot region may be determined by a Cr pattern on the reticle <b>2</b>. To prevent transfer due to defects such as peeling of the Cr pattern on the reticle <b>2</b>, the masking blade <b>17</b> may shield light over a larger region than the shape of the shot region. The order of the arrangement position of the masking blade <b>17</b> and the light shielding plate <b>19</b> in the illumination system does not matter. Either of these parts may be arranged on the light source <b>11</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The light shielding plate <b>19</b> will now be described in more detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a transfer region on the substrate <b>9</b> seen from above the face of a paper sheet. Although a substrate made from silicon is usually used for the substrate <b>9</b>, substrates made from glass, sapphire, or a compound may also used.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the region on which the pattern may be transferred by the exposure apparatus <b>100</b> in one exposure is determined based on the image forming region of the projection optical system <b>5</b>, it is generally smaller than the size of the substrate <b>9</b>. Therefore, an exposure method that repeats the transfer of the pattern (exposure of the substrate <b>9</b>) while stepping the substrate <b>9</b> is used in the exposure apparatus <b>100</b>. This method is called a &#x201c;step and repeat method&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The region indicated by the hatched lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> indicates the shot region on which the pattern is transferred by one exposure. By repeatedly exposing a plurality of shot regions while stepping the substrate <b>9</b>, the same pattern &#x201c;C&#x201d; may be transferred onto the whole of the substrate <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As described above, in the operation of forming a solder ball, a region where the resist has been peeled away has to be present on the substrate <b>9</b> in order to bring the conductive film on the substrate <b>9</b> into contact (be in a conductive state) with the electrode in the plating apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, this region corresponds to a circumferential portion of the substrate <b>9</b>, i.e., a peripheral region <b>92</b> that is on the inner side from the periphery of the substrate <b>9</b> by a predetermined width (in the present exemplary embodiment, &#x201c;d&#x201d;). The peripheral region <b>92</b> of the substrate <b>9</b> needs to be shielded during exposure if the resist coated on the substrate <b>9</b> is a negative resist. In other words, when transferring the pattern onto a periphery shot region <b>91</b> of the substrate <b>9</b>, the periphery shot region <b>91</b> needs to be exposed by defining a transfer region like that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, i.e., defining a part of the outer edge of the shot in an arc shape.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of a configuration of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> for defining the periphery shot region <b>91</b> as a transfer region like that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is viewed from the optical axis direction of the illumination optical system <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The light shielding plate <b>19</b> is configured from a light shielding portion <b>191</b> for shielding the exposure light and an aperture portion <b>192</b> that allows the exposure light to pass through. The light shielding portion <b>191</b> is a frame that includes an arc-shaped and a roughly identical arc-shaped edge portion <b>191</b><i>a </i>of the periphery (outer edge) of the substrate <b>9</b>, and a straight edge portion <b>191</b><i>b </i>that does not directly contribute to the light shielding of the peripheral region <b>92</b> of the substrate <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Ideally, it is desirable for the arc edge portion <b>191</b><i>a</i>, which is the arc-shaped portion of the light shielding plate <b>19</b>, to be a circular and roughly identical arc shape that is smaller than the radius (radius of curvature) of the circular shape of the arc-shaped portion of the periphery (outer edge) of the substrate <b>9</b> by the amount &#x201c;d&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The aperture portion <b>192</b> has a size that is big enough to allow light flux broader than the light flux necessary to illuminate the exposed shot region to pass.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">When exposing (projecting an image of the pattern) a shot near the center of the substrate <b>9</b>, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is retracted and moved to a position that allows light flux broader than the light flux contributing to exposure of the shot to pass through the aperture portion <b>192</b>. At that time, the light flux has cross-section defined as a rectangular shape by the masking blade <b>17</b>, which is another light shielding member, not by the light shielding plate <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">However, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is not limited to the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The light shielding plate <b>19</b> may be configured by a light shielding portion that includes a circular edge portion, or may be configured by a light shielding portion in which only a part includes an arc-shaped edge portion.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">This is because the drive unit <b>22</b> may rotatably drive the light shielding plate <b>19</b> in a rotating direction (arrow AR<b>1</b>) around the optical axis of the illumination optical system <b>1</b>, and linearly drive the light shielding plate <b>19</b> in a direction (arrow AR<b>2</b>) parallel to a straight line connecting the apexes of the arc edge portion <b>191</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, the drive unit <b>22</b> has two mechanisms such as a rotational drive unit for rotatably driving the light shielding plate <b>19</b> in a rotating direction (arrow AR<b>1</b>) around the optical axis, and a shift-drive unit for shift-driving (translation driving) the light shielding plate <b>19</b> in a direction (arrow AR<b>2</b>) parallel to a straight line connecting the apexes of the arc edge portion <b>191</b><i>a</i>. In addition, the drive unit <b>22</b> may also have another shift-drive unit mechanism for shift-driving in a direction (arrow AR<b>3</b>) perpendicular to a straight line connecting the apexes of the arc edge portion <b>191</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates positioning of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> by the drive unit <b>22</b> under the control of the control unit <b>21</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the positional relationship between the periphery shot region <b>91</b> of the substrate <b>9</b> and the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is illustrated. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when exposing the periphery shot region <b>91</b>, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is positioned at a position that shields the exposure light incident on the peripheral region <b>92</b> that is near the periphery (outer edge) on the inner side from the periphery (outer edge) of the substrate <b>9</b> by the amount &#x201c;d&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">More specifically, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is positioned so that the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is rotatably driven by just the amount &#x3b8; around the optical axis of the illumination optical system <b>1</b>, and so that the center (x, y) of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is positioned at a position shifted (linearly driven) in the center direction of the substrate <b>9</b> from the center (x<b>1</b>, y<b>1</b>) of the periphery shot region <b>91</b> by just the amount L. Here, the &#x201c;center of the periphery shot region <b>91</b>&#x201d; is the center of the shot region in a state in which a part of the periphery shot region <b>91</b> is not shielded by the arc in the same manner as the center portion.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Basically, the optical axis of the optical system configured from the illumination optical system <b>1</b> and the projection optical system <b>5</b> is arranged so as to, during exposure of the periphery shot region <b>91</b>, pass through the center of this periphery shot region <b>91</b> and the center of the pattern portion of the reticle.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, L is the linear driving amount of the light shielding plate <b>19</b>, and is represented by the following Equation 1 using the values illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>

In addition to the exposure parameters, the exposure processing information includes information required for the positioning (control) of the light shielding plate <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The exposure processing information includes, for example, information indicating whether a layer (underlayer) is formed on the substrate <b>9</b> to be exposed (i.e., whether the exposure processing is a first sequence or a second sequence), and layout information indicating the array of the plurality of shot regions on the substrate <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, the exposure processing information may also include a substrate arrangement offset indicating the amount of displacement between the center of the substrate <b>9</b> and the center of the substrate stage <b>6</b> that occurs when arranging the substrate <b>9</b> on the substrate stage <b>6</b>, and light shielding plate control mode information indicating the control mode of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> when exposing the periphery shot region <b>91</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In operation S<b>604</b>, the substrate <b>9</b> to be exposed is carried in to the exposure apparatus <b>100</b> by a substrate conveyance robot, and this substrate <b>9</b> is arranged on the substrate stage <b>6</b>. During this process, based on the substrate arrangement offset included in the exposure processing information, the substrate <b>9</b> is held on the substrate stage <b>6</b> so that the center of the substrate <b>9</b> and the center of the substrate stage <b>6</b> match.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In operation S<b>606</b>, based on the sequence information included in the exposure processing condition acquired in operation S<b>602</b>, it is determined whether a layer is formed on the substrate <b>9</b> to be exposed. If it is determined that a layer is formed on the substrate <b>9</b> (YES in operation S<b>606</b>), the processing proceeds to operation S<b>608</b>. If it is determined that a layer is not formed on the substrate <b>9</b> (NO in operation S<b>606</b>), the processing proceeds to operation S<b>612</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In operation S<b>608</b>, the alignment mark on the layer formed on the substrate <b>9</b> is detected (roughly detected) by the alignment detection unit <b>4</b> (i.e., pre-alignment is performed). In operation S<b>610</b>, based on the detection result obtained in operation S<b>608</b>, the alignment mark on the layer formed on the substrate <b>9</b> is precisely detected (precise detected) by the alignment detection unit <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As described below, based on the detection results in operations S<b>608</b> and S<b>610</b>, the amount of displacement between the center position (substrate center position) of the substrate <b>9</b> corresponding to the center position of the substrate stage <b>6</b> and the center position (layer center position) of the array of the plurality of shot regions in the layer formed on the substrate <b>9</b> may be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In operation S<b>612</b>, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is driven and positioned by the drive unit <b>22</b>. Specifically, if a layer is not formed on the substrate <b>9</b> to be exposed, as described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is positioned based on the layout information included in the exposure processing condition acquired in operation S<b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, if a layer is formed on the substrate <b>9</b> to be exposed, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is positioned based on the layout information included in the exposure processing condition acquired in operation S<b>602</b>, and the amount of displacement between the substrate center position and the layer center position determined from the detection results in operations S<b>608</b> and S<b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">However, as described above, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is used for shielding the exposure light incident on the peripheral region <b>92</b> when exposing the periphery shot region <b>91</b> of the substrate <b>9</b>. Therefore, if the target shot region (shot region on which the pattern is to be transferred) is not the periphery shot region <b>91</b>, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> does not have to be exactly positioned, as long as the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is retracted from the optical path in the illumination optical system <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">If the target shot region is not the periphery shot (also referred to as circumferential shot) region <b>91</b>, i.e., if a shot in the center portion of the substrate is to be exposed, the light flux that has passed through the aperture portion <b>192</b> of the frame body light shielding plate <b>19</b> is shielded by the masking blade <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The light flux that has passed through the aperture portion formed by the masking blade <b>17</b> reaches the substrate <b>9</b>, and exposes the substrate.

Further, the positioning of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> may be performed in parallel with the movement of the substrate stage <b>6</b> that is necessary to position the target shot region on the substrate <b>9</b> at the exposure position.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In operation S<b>614</b>, the target shot region on the substrate <b>9</b> is exposed to transfer the pattern of the reticle <b>2</b> onto this target shot region. In operation S<b>616</b>, it is determined whether all of the shot regions on the substrate <b>9</b> held on the substrate stage <b>6</b> have been exposed (i.e., whether the pattern has been transferred onto all shot regions).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">If it is determined that not all of the shot regions on the substrate <b>9</b> have been exposed (NO in operation S<b>616</b>), the processing proceeds to operation S<b>612</b>, and the next shot region is processed as the target shot region. If it is determined that all of the shot regions on the substrate <b>9</b> have been exposed (YES in operation S<b>616</b>), the processing proceeds to operation S<b>618</b>. In operation S<b>618</b>, the substrate <b>9</b> on which all shot regions have been exposed is collected by the substrate conveyance robot, and the substrate is carried out from the exposure apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">To form the non-exposed region indicated by width &#x201c;d&#x201d; on a circumferential portion of the substrate <b>9</b>, the following two conditions need to be satisfied.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Condition 2. That the reticle <b>2</b> and the substrate <b>9</b> have been aligned (their positional relationship has been clarified).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">An adjustment method for realizing condition 1 when condition 2 is satisfied will now be described in detail.

The series of processes including exposure processing, stage driving, and driving of the light shielding plate performed in the following adjustment flow is executed by the control unit <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">First, in operation S<b>1001</b> in the flowchart of FIG. <b>10</b>, positioning of the reference point of the reticle <b>2</b> (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;center <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the reticle <b>2</b>&#x201d;) and the center of rotation <b>96</b><i>c </i>of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> is performed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the reticle <b>2</b> used for this positioning as viewed from above a sheet of paper, which defines the X axis and the Y axis as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The reticle <b>2</b> includes at least two scales <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>as a pattern that may be transferred onto the substrate. The Y coordinate from the center of the reticle <b>2</b> in the scale <b>40</b> is known. The value of the scale <b>40</b> represents the X coordinate on the reticle <b>2</b>. The light shielding plate <b>19</b> has the shape illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The positioning of the center <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the reticle <b>2</b> and the center of rotation <b>96</b><i>c </i>of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> will be described in detail based on the flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In the description of this example, the first arc of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> will be used.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In operation S<b>2001</b>, the reticle and the wafer are carried in, and exposure conditions such as the exposure amount, layout on the wafer, and drive unit drive conditions are set. In operation S<b>2002</b>, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is rotatably driven by the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> and linearly driven by the linear drive unit <b>95</b> based on the drive conditions, so that the light shielding plate <b>19</b> moves to the first position illustrated as an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, at the first position, the reticle <b>2</b> is shielded by the light shielding plate <b>19</b>, and the first arc of the shielding plate <b>19</b> and an aperture member <b>23</b> are positioned on the reticle <b>2</b>. Although the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> and the linear drive unit <b>95</b> are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the relationship among the light shielding plate <b>19</b>, the rotational drive unit <b>96</b>, and the linear drive unit <b>95</b> is as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. At the same time, the substrate stage <b>6</b> holding the substrate <b>9</b> is driven to a shot position. In operation S<b>2003</b>, a predetermined exposure amount is irradiated on the substrate <b>9</b> from the irradiation system.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A shot S<b>1</b> is transferred onto the substrate <b>9</b> as the shape defined by the pattern of the reticle <b>2</b> by the light shielding plate <b>19</b>. In operation S<b>2004</b>, with the linear drive shaft direction fixed based on the drive unit drive conditions, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> rotatably driven 180&#xb0; around the center of rotation <b>96</b><i>c </i>of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> to move to a second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). At the same time, the substrate stage <b>6</b> holding the substrate <b>9</b> is driven to the next shot position.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In operation S<b>2005</b>, the shot S<b>2</b> is similarly transferred by irradiating a predetermined exposure amount on the substrate <b>9</b> from the irradiation system. In operation S<b>2006</b>, the substrate <b>9</b> is carried out, and development is performed. With this development, a resist image of the shots S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> is formed on the substrate <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In operation S<b>2007</b>, based on the shot S<b>1</b> of the first position and the shot S<b>2</b> of the second position of the light shielding plate <b>19</b>, the center of rotation <b>96</b><i>c </i>of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> with respect to the center <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the reticle <b>2</b> is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The values <b>41</b><i>a </i>and <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the intersection of the scales <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>with the edge of the first arc of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> for the shot S<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> are read and recorded. At the same time, the values <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the intersection of the scales <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>with the straight edge of the straight slit-shaped aperture member <b>61</b> for the shot S<b>1</b> are read and recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The values (<b>43</b><i>a</i>, <b>43</b><i>b</i>, <b>44</b><i>a</i>, and <b>44</b><i>b</i>) for the shot S<b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> are similarly read and recorded. The reading of the scales may be performed using a multi-purpose light microscope, for example. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> illustrate a case in which the resist at the exposed portion has peeled away due to development, i.e., a case in which a positive resist is used, a negative resist may also be used. In this example, a case in which a positive resist is used will be described as such a case is easier to illustrate.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Thus, the scale <b>40</b> indicates the coordinate value of a center reference of the reticle <b>2</b>. First, the center coordinate Oa of a first circle formed by the first arc is calculated based on the scale values <b>41</b><i>a </i>and <b>41</b><i>b </i>for the first position shot S<b>1</b> and the radius of the first arc. Similarly, the center coordinate Ob of a second circle formed by the first arc is calculated based on the scale values <b>43</b><i>a </i>and <b>43</b><i>b </i>for the second position shot S<b>2</b> and the radius of the first arc.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The center point O of the center coordinates Oa and Ob of the first and second circles is the center of rotation of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b>. Based on this, position adjustment is performed so as to match the center of the reticle <b>2</b> with the center of rotation of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">However, there will always be error in the angle of rotation when rotatably driving from the first position to the second position with the rotational drive unit <b>96</b>. Although there are various causes for this error in the angle of rotation of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b>, examples include error in the rotary encoder used to detect the motor angle, and gear backlash. Thus, in practice, it is impossible to eliminate error.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref> illustrates a case in which the light shielding plate <b>19</b> has been rotated 180+&#x3b1;&#xb0; (wherein &#x3b1; is rotation error) from a first position to a second position. The center coordinate Oc of a second circle formed by the first arc is obtained from a shot exposed in the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>. The center point Oe of the center coordinates Oa and Oc of the first and second circles is determined as the center of rotation <b>96</b><i>c </i>of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b>. That is, a point different from the true center of rotation <b>96</b><i>c </i>is calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>, this has a substantial effect especially on the calculation accuracy of the Y coordinate of a center rotation coordinate. Therefore, correction is performed using the value of the intersection of the scale <b>40</b> with the straight edge of the simultaneously-recorded slit-shaped aperture member <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The slope T<b>1</b> of the straight line that passes through the two points of coordinates <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the intersection of the scale <b>40</b> with the straight edge of the slit-shaped aperture member <b>61</b> at the first position is obtained. Similarly, the slope T<b>2</b> of the straight line that passes through the two points of coordinates <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>of the intersection of the scale <b>40</b> with the straight edge of the slit-shaped aperture member <b>61</b> at the second position is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">If the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is correctly rotated by 180&#xb0; from the first position to the second position, these two slopes are identical, i.e., T<b>1</b>=T<b>2</b>. By calculating the difference T<b>1</b>&#x2212;T<b>2</b>=&#x3b1; of these two slopes, it may be seen that the actual angle of rotation when rotated from the first position to the second position is 180+&#x3b1;&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Next, a correction method using the actual angle of rotation will be described. If the distance in the X direction between the center coordinate Oa of the first circle at the first position and the center coordinate Oc of the second circle at the second position is P, then it may be seen that since the error in the angle of rotation for a rotation angle of 180&#xb0; is &#x3b1;&#xb0;, the Y coordinate Ocy of the center coordinate Oc of the second circle at the second position is corrected based on that.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">A correction amount &#x3b4;y may be defined by P sin(&#x3b1;/2). The calculation accuracy for determining the center of rotation <b>96</b><i>c </i>of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> may be improved based on the corrected center coordinate Od of the second circle at the second position and the center coordinate Oa of the first circle at the first position even if there is error in the angle of rotation for the rotational drive unit <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Based on the above result, the center of rotation <b>96</b><i>c </i>of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> may be adjusted so that it matches the center <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the reticle <b>2</b>. Further, although it is desirable for the first arc, the aperture member and the light shielding member of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> to be simultaneously projected onto the wafer, the disclosure is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">By restricting the illumination region with the masking blade <b>17</b>, the positioning adjustment of the center of rotation of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> and the reticle <b>2</b> may be performed by individually projecting onto the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Further, although the scale <b>40</b> on the reticle <b>2</b> is arranged along the X axis, this scale <b>40</b> may also be arranged along the Y axis. In this case, the positioning adjustment may be performed by rotating the first and second positions of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> by further 90&#xb0; from the case described in this exemplary embodiment. In addition, the positioning adjustment may also be performed by rotating the first and second positions to an appropriate position based on the scale on the reticle <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Next, in operation S<b>1002</b> of the flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the drive origin of the linear drive unit <b>95</b> that rotatably drives the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is adjusted. Based on this adjustment, the X axis of the reticle <b>2</b> and the drive shaft of the linear drive unit <b>95</b> that linearly drives the light shielding plate <b>19</b> may be made parallel. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, although an already parallel state is illustrated for simplification, in actual practice there is error in the shape of the parts and in how the parts are installed, so that the X axis and the drive shaft are not parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The drive origin of the rotational drive unit <b>96</b> may be set so as to have an offset so that the slope of the straight line passing through the center coordinate Oa of the first circle and the center coordinate Od of the second circle as determined above is zero. Further, the same adjustment may be performed for the second arc of the light shielding plate <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Next, in operation S<b>1003</b> of the flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the drive origin of the linear drive unit <b>95</b> that linearly drives the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is adjusted. Based on this adjustment, the positions in the drive shaft direction of the linear drive unit <b>95</b> and the X axis direction of the reticle <b>2</b> are matched. The linear drive unit <b>95</b> is then fixed, and the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is driven by the linear drive unit <b>95</b> to the position where the scale <b>40</b> on the reticle <b>2</b> intersects the first arc of the light shielding plate <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The substrate <b>9</b> is exposed in this state. After carrying out the wafer and developing, the drive origin of the linear drive unit <b>95</b> may be set so as to have an offset by reading the value of the intersection of the scale <b>40</b> with the first arc and setting so that this value is a designated value. Based on this adjustment, the positioning of the first arc of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> with the reticle <b>2</b> is completed. Further, the same adjustment may be performed for the second arc of the light shielding plate <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In the second exemplary embodiment, the light shielding plate <b>19</b> is described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. However, it is obvious that adjustment may be performed in the same manner even for the shapes illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B</figref>, <b>9</b>C, <b>9</b>D, <b>9</b>E, and <b>9</b>F.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">For the light shielding plate <b>19</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9F</figref>, the actual angle of rotation may be calculated using the straight edge of a light shielding member <b>73</b><i>a </i>or <b>73</b><i>b</i>. In this case, it is necessary to further provide a scale that intersects with the straight edge of the light shielding member <b>73</b><i>a </i>or <b>73</b><i>b </i>in addition to the scale <b>40</b> on the reticle <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Further, if a straight edge portion <b>191</b><i>b </i>of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be projected along with the circle edge on the wafer, such a configuration may be similarly used for the calculation of the actual angle of rotation. Moreover, although the second exemplary embodiment is described based on the minimum number of shots required for adjustment, in actual practice an average of a plurality of shots may be used to reduce the effect of scale reading error on calculation accuracy. According to one embodiment, the number of shots is not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In addition, in the second exemplary embodiment, although the center coordinate of a circle is calculated based on the coordinates of two scales on the reticle <b>2</b> and the radius of an arc, the center of a circle may be calculated based on the coordinates of three scales by providing at least one more scale on the reticle. Similarly, to reduce the effect of scale reading error on calculation accuracy, an average of the center coordinates of a circle determined from the respective combinations of three scales from among a plurality of scales may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">It may be understood that, in the second exemplary embodiment, the purpose of an aperture member or a light shielding member is to be used for positional adjustment. When forming a light shielding region defined by a light shielding width d from a periphery of the substrate <b>9</b>, pattern transfer onto the wafer by the aperture member or the light shielding member is not unnecessary. It may even be a problem. Specifically, pattern transfer of the aperture member or the light shielding member is only performed when adjusting the position of the light shielding plate <b>19</b>. Consequently, the aperture member or the light shielding member needs to be selected based on whether pattern transfer onto the wafer is to be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">More specifically, this member may be selected based on whether an aperture member is to be blocked, or whether a light shielding member is to be removed or moved to a position where pattern transfer onto the wafer does not occur. Further, the unit for selecting whether a pattern is to be transferred onto the wafer by an aperture member or a light shielding member may be automatic or manual, and the method for performing this selection is not limited.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In the second exemplary embodiment, the adjustment performed in operation S<b>1001</b> of the flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is performed based on information obtained from a shot exposed on the substrate <b>9</b>. However, the adjustment may also be performed using a light detection sensor <b>50</b> on the substrate stage <b>6</b>. The light detection sensor <b>50</b>, which is a light detection unit, is a sensor that receives light irradiated from an illumination system and detects an exposure light quantity on the wafer face.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">An edge of the light shielding plate <b>19</b> may be detected by the light detection sensor <b>50</b> based on a stage coordinate reference. More specifically, the coordinates at which illuminance is zero may be detected while driving the stage. Based on the two coordinates at which illuminance is zero and the radius of the arc, the center coordinate of that circle may be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Similarly, using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> as an example, the slope of the slit straight portion of the aperture member may also be determined. If the light shielding plate <b>19</b> has the shape illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, the position of the center of gravity for each of aperture members <b>63</b><i>a </i>and <b>63</b><i>b </i>may be detected using an illuminance detection sensor. It may be easily understood that even if the aperture member has no straight portions, the above-described angle correction may be performed by using the slope of the straight line connecting the two centers of gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The series of processes including projection processing on the light detection sensor <b>50</b>, stage driving, and driving of the light shielding plate is executed by the control unit <b>21</b>. The light detection sensor <b>50</b> detection result is processed by a detection calculation unit, and the obtained displacement amount of the center of rotation is registered in a database.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Then, the drive unit for driving the light shielding plate is corrected by the control unit <b>21</b> based on the displacement amount of the center of rotation registered in the database. When an illuminance detection sensor is used, note that the relationship between the reticle and the center of rotation of the drive unit is not directly applied.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In this case, it is necessary to know in advance the positional relationship between the wafer on the substrate stage <b>6</b> and the illuminance detection sensor, and indirectly align the reticle center with the center of rotation of the drive unit. Further, it may easily be understood that the adjustment performed in operations S<b>1002</b> and S<b>1003</b> of the flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also may be similarly performed using the light detection sensor <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Next, the method for manufacturing a device (a semiconductor device, a liquid crystal display device etc.) according to an exemplary embodiment will be described. A semiconductor device is manufactured by performing a pre-process of producing an integrated circuit on a wafer, and a post-process of completing the integrated circuit chip on the wafer produced in the pre-process as a finished product.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The pre-process includes an operation of exposing a wafer coated with a photosensitizing agent using the above-described exposure apparatus, and an operation of developing the wafer. The post-process includes an assembly operation (dicing and bonding), and a packaging operation (encapsulating). A liquid crystal display device is manufactured by performing a process for forming a transparent electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The process for forming the transparent electrode includes an operation of coating a photosensitizing agent on a glass substrate on which a transparent electrode film has been vapor deposited, an operation of exposing the glass substrate coated with the photosensitizing agent using the above-described exposure apparatus, and an operation of developing the glass substrate.
