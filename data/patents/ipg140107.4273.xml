<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Read disturb presents a serious problem to the operation of nonvolatile memory cells such as floating gate and charge trapping memory cells. Read disturb occurs when read operations are performed on nonvolatile memory cells; despite being applied for a read operation rather than a program operation, some programming still occurs while applying a read bias arrangement. Over the course of many read operations, read disturb changes raise the threshold voltage of the affected nonvolatile memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Read disturb occurs in NAND strings because the read bias arrangement voltage Vpass is sufficiently high to cause programming. In a NAND string of nonvolatile memory cells arranged in series, a read voltage Vread is applied to the word line of a selected memory cell in the NAND string, and a pass voltage Vpass is applied to the word line of unselected memory cell in the NAND string.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a graph of threshold voltages distributions, showing the HVt and LVt distributions, the word line read voltage window and the word line pass voltage window. Vpass is sufficiently high to turn on the channel under unselected memory cells in the NAND string regardless of the data values stored on the unselected memory cells. In particular, Vpass is sufficiently high to turn on the channel under a memory cell storing the data value associated with the highest threshold voltage distribution. Vread is sufficiently high to turn on the channel under a selected memory cells in the NAND string with a data value associated with a threshold voltage distribution that is lower than Vread, and is sufficiently low to turn off the channel under a selected memory cells in the NAND string with a data value associated with a threshold voltage distribution that is higher than Vread.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various aspects approach the read disturb problem by reducing the Vpass voltage. Typically, the Vpass voltage exceeds the highest threshold voltage distribution, so that regardless of the data values stored on the unselected memory cells of a NAND string, the channel is turned on under unselected memory cells of a NAND string. However, various embodiments reduce the Vpass voltage below the maximum of the highest threshold voltage distribution. Various embodiments accomplish this by storing a single selected data bit per NAND string. Other unselected memory cells in the NAND string that do not store user selected data, store a threshold voltage from a low threshold voltage distribution, so that the reduced Vpass turns on the unselected memory cells of a NAND string.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first aspect has the reduced Vpass voltage. A second aspect has both the reduced Vpass voltage and an unreduced Vpass voltage, depending on the instructions. A third aspect has both the reduced Vpass voltage and an unreduced Vpass voltage, depending on the instruction register. Various aspects are discussed below.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The plurality of memory cells is arranged in series in a semiconductor body. The series has a first end and a second end. Memory cells in the plurality of memory cells have a threshold voltage in one of a first threshold voltage distribution associated with a first data value and a second threshold voltage distribution associated with a second data value. The first threshold voltage distribution has a first minimum and a first maximum. The second threshold voltage distribution has a second minimum and a second maximum. The first threshold voltage distribution is a lower voltage distribution than the second threshold voltage distribution.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph of threshold voltages distributions, showing the HVt and LVt distributions, the word line read voltage window and the modified word line pass voltage window.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0069">The Vpass window is no longer sufficiently high to turn on the channel under unselected memory cells in the NAND string regardless of the data values stored on the unselected memory cells, because the Vpass window does not extend past the maximum of the HVt distribution. However, Vpass is assured to be sufficiently high to turn on the channel under a memory cell storing the data value associated with LVt, the low threshold voltage distribution. Vread is sufficiently high to turn on the channel under a selected memory cells in the NAND string with a data value associated with a threshold voltage distribution that is lower than Vread (such as LVt), and is sufficiently low to turn off the channel under a selected memory cells in the NAND string with a data value associated with a threshold voltage distribution that is higher than Vread (such as HVt).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0070">The read disturb problem is addressed, because the Vpass voltage is reduced. If multiple bits were stored in the NAND string, then the reduced Vpass voltage could present a problem, because the unselected memory cells in the NAND string might not have the channel underneath turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0071">However, embodiments store a single data bit per NAND string. Other unselected memory cells in the NAND string that do not store user selected data, store a threshold voltage from a low threshold voltage distribution, so that the reduced Vpass turns on the unselected memory cells of a NAND string.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram of a NAND string of nonvolatile memory cells, applying the modified word line pass voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0073">The NAND string between the bit line BL and the source line SRC has a series of nonvolatile memory cells between pass transistors. A diffusion region is between adjacent transistor/memory cell structures. Alternatively, the diffusion region can be removed, and replaced with an inversion region by adding a gate structure which applies an appropriate voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0074">Vread is applied to the word line of the memory cell selected for reading. Vpass is applied to the other word lines of the memory cells not selected for reading. Typically, Vpass is applied to turn on the underlying channel regardless of the particular data value and its associated threshold voltage distribution that is stored, and Vpass is accordingly set to be high enough to turn on the underlying channel in case a data value associated with a high threshold voltage distribution is stored. However, because embodiments store one data bit per string, Vpass for unselected memory cells does not need to be so high. V<sub>SLG </sub>is applied to the end select gates SLG<b>1</b> and SLG<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram of a NAND array of nonvolatile memory cells, storing a single data bit per NAND string.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0076">In the shown data strings, all the threshold voltage distributions are either high HVt or low LVt. In either case, the reduced Vpass is used. In the event that Vpass is used with a memory string that stores HVt, the Vpass voltage may not be sufficient to turn on the underlying channel. However, this is not a problem, because the underlying channel of the memory cell having the gate which receives Vread will not be turned on either, anyway.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0077">In one embodiment, the shown data storage pattern is performed with dedicated program and read instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0078">In another embodiment, the shown data storage pattern is performed with multiple normal program and read instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is another diagram of a NAND array of nonvolatile memory cells, storing a single data bit per NAND string.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0080">In the shown data strings, all the threshold voltage distributions are not either high HVt or low LVt. Instead, the default distribution is LVt, and some subset of one or more memory cells stores either high HVt or low LVt. This subset stores a same data bit. The memory cells in the subset can be on either end of the NAND string, in the middle of the NAND string, be adjacent memory cells, or nonadjacent memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0081">In the shown case, the memory string of bit line BL<b>1</b><i>e </i>has multiple memory cells under at least WL<b>0</b> and WL<b>29</b> with HVt. Vread is applied to at least either WL<b>0</b> or WL<b>29</b> to read the stored data bit of the memory string of bit line BL<b>1</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0082">In the event that Vpass is used with memory cells in the subset of the memory string that stores HVt, the Vpass voltage may not be sufficient to turn on the underlying channel. However, this is not a problem, because the underlying channel of the memory cell in the subset having the gate which receives Vread will not be turned on either, anyway.</p>
