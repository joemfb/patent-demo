<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a face driver. More particularly this invention concerns such driver used in a lathe or the like for transmitting torque to an end face of a workpiece.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A standard face driver has a body in which a compression spring is directly or indirectly braced against a centering rod having a centering point, and having a driver disk that surrounds the centering rod and serves for contacting the workpiece. Such a face drivers is used in cooperation with a tailstock to hold workpieces at their end faces when it is not possible to hold them on their side or peripheral surfaces, for example because that is where machining is to be done. As a result of the holding at the end faces, torque must be transmitted via the end faces of the workpiece, and in addition forces that act during axial and radial machining must not be allowed to interfere with the holding and the position of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A face driver of the above-described type is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,647,841 in which a spacer disk on the one hand and a swash plate on the other hand are provided between the body and the workpiece, the spacer disk and the swash plate each being supported by steel rollers that are aligned orthogonally with respect to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, a face driver from Basile GmbH is known from prior public use where a compensating system is used that, with the aid of wedge levers, allows driving by four drive pins. The wedge lever body is held in the correct position by two wedge lever pins that are supported by two wedge lever supports. Two floating plates are situated on the wedge lever body, and are held in position on the wedge lever body by two elastic elements. The four driving pins are guided by the driving pin head. The centering point is independent from the driving pin, and is tensioned by a disk spring assembly. For left/right rotation there is an option to exchange the driving pins.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved face driver.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object is the provision of such an improved face driver that overcomes the above-given disadvantages, in particular that can be used with a workpiece whose end face is not perpendicular to the axis about which it is to be rotated for machining and where rotation direction can be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further object is to provide a face driver that may be integrated into the existing design of conventional face drivers, while at the same time reducing the difficulty of operation and maintenance.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A face driver engageable with an end face of a workpiece has according to the invention a body rotatable about an axis and a head rotationally fixed on the body and formed with a plurality of guides open axially forwardly toward the workpiece and radially offset from the axis. A centering rod axially shiftable in the body on the axis has a front-end point engageable with the face of the workpiece. A compression spring in the body urging the rod axially forward toward the workpiece, a driver disk surrounds the centering rod and has a front face turned axially toward and engageable with the workpiece and a back face turned axially toward the body and formed with a plurality of rearwardly open and radially extending grooves aligned with the guides. Respective support pins axially shiftable in the guides have front-end heads engaged in the respective grooves so as to rotationally couple the driver disk rotationally to the body while permitting the driver disk to tip with axial displacement of the pins.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The face driver according to the invention is characterized by a very simple design in which the torque may be transmitted from the body coupled to the work spindle of the lathe, to the driver disk by the support pins that engage in the grooves of the driver disk, and as a result of the axial displaceability of the support pins the driver disk may be carried along in an oscillating manner; i.e., the driver disk may be adapted to inclined workpiece surfaces without impairing the holding or transmission of torque to the workpiece at its end face. The driver disk may have teeth on its front side facing the workpiece, although the invention may also be implemented using any other known variant for the contact between the end face of the workpiece and the driver disk.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Within the scope of the invention, it is particularly preferred that the support pins are braced against a compensating disk at their back ends facing away from the driver disk, since in this manner the axial displaceability of the support pins is coupled together, and compensation via the support pins acting on the driver disk is achieved when the driver disk contacts the end face of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is also advantageous when at least three support pins are provided, and the compensating disk is spherically swivelable on the body on a bearing. This design provides a three-point bearing in which the ends of the support pin facing the driver disk are appropriately aligned via the spherical swiveling of the compensating disk on the body. Alternatively, inclined surfaces that are associated with the support pins may be provided on the compensating disk, by means of which the a planar face of the compensating disk is radially displaced on the body in a compensating manner.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the invention, the grooves have V-forming bevels for cooperating with the associated centering heads, thus in particular facilitating play-free cooperation of the support pins with the driver disk, and especially changing between right and left rotational directions without interfering with the oscillating drive. The cooperation of the three-point bearing and the guiding of the support pins in the V-forming bevels of the grooves prevents the driver disk from twisting, regardless of the direction of torque and the oscillating function.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To further facilitate cooperation of the support pins with the grooves in the driver disk, the centering heads have part-spherical front ends, so that the support pins are able to align in the V-forming bevels in the grooves via the spherical front ends, and to maintain this alignment regardless of the rotational direction of the work spindle. Within the scope of the invention, it is further provided that the centering rod extends through a central passage in the compensating disk; i.e. the compensating disk is on the centering rod and in this respect can swivel without slipping radially.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As seen in FIG. a face driver has a metallic body <b>1</b> centered on an axis and formed at its rear region with an external Morse taper for coupling to the work spindle of a lathe or the like. A compression spring <b>2</b> bears indirectly via a pusher rod <b>13</b> on a centering rod <b>12</b> having a point <b>4</b> fitted in an axially centered passage of the body <b>1</b> and the pressure it exerts is applied as a variable centering force to the point <b>4</b> that can dig into a workpiece shown schematically at W. The face driver also has an annular driver disk <b>7</b> that coaxially surrounds the centering rod <b>12</b> and can contact the workpiece W, as well as a driver head <b>3</b> in which a plurality of support pins <b>5</b> are axially slidable in respective guides <b>14</b> extending parallel to but offset radially from the center axis A. The driver head <b>3</b> is rotationally and axially fixed to the body <b>1</b> by angularly equispaced screws <b>11</b> that pass through the driver head <b>3</b> and engage in respective threaded holes in the body <b>1</b>. Each support pin <b>5</b> has a centering head <b>10</b> having a spherical centering surface that engages in a respective radial groove <b>8</b> in the driver disk <b>7</b>, the grooves <b>8</b> each having V-forming bevels <b>9</b> for fitting with the associated centering head <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the embodiment illustrated in the drawing, the support pins <b>5</b> are braced against a compensating disk <b>6</b> at their rear ends facing away from the driver disk <b>7</b>. The compensating disk <b>6</b> and the body <b>1</b> having complementary part-spherical surfaces to that the disk <b>6</b> can swivel on the body <b>1</b> about a point on the axis A. The embodiment shown in the drawing has three pins <b>5</b> that ensure three-point support of the driver disk <b>7</b>. The centering rod <b>12</b> extends through a central hole of the compensating disk <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The face driver according to the invention allows the corotating driver disk <b>7</b> to contact the workpiece W with its front face turned toward the workpiece W, even if the face of the workpiece W is at an angle to a plane perpendicular to the axis ! of the work spindle and of the face driver when the workpiece is mounted on a tailstock. The driver disk <b>7</b> bears with teeth <b>15</b> that dig into the end face of the workpiece, and via the compensating disk <b>6</b> displaces the support pins <b>5</b> in the guides <b>14</b> in a compensating manner. At the same time, the support pins <b>5</b> press the spherical front ends of the centering heads <b>10</b> into the grooves <b>8</b> having the V-forming bevels <b>9</b>, so that the driver disk <b>7</b> is carried along in a play-free, oscillating manner.</p>
