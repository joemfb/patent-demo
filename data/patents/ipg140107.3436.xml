<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/232,188 filed Aug. 7, 2009, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to power supplies and in particular to power supplies for light emitting diodes (LED) for use in a roadway or external lighting fixture.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Roadway or street lighting fixtures are exposed to a range of environmental factors that impact performance and longevity of lighting fixtures. Existing roadway lighting commonly uses high-intensity discharge lamps, often high pressure sodium lamps (HPS). The power supply designs have been relatively simply but the light quality, efficiency and controllability of the fixtures has been less than ideal. The introduction next generation lighting fixtures such as light emitting diode (LED) based lighting fixtures provides greater efficiency, light quality and controllability however present challenges in ensuring reliable operation for the life of the lighting fixture. Factors such as thermal control, power efficiency, current regulation and packaging constraints must be accounted for to meet operation requirements. The temperature extremes and packaging restraints require an efficient design to ensure reliability. Providing a power supply that meets the demanding design requirements and cope with environmental extremes has not to date been achievable. In addition, single-ended primary inductance converters (SEPIC) have only been utilized in single channel configurations due to interference between channels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, apparatus and methods that enable an improved LED power supply remains highly desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided a power supply for providing a constant current to a light emitting diode (LED) load. The power supply comprises a power controller receiving an alternating current (AC) input and providing a direct current (DC) output voltage controlled to maintain a constant feedback voltage, the DC output voltage provided to a high side of the LED load, the DC output voltage relative to a common power line coupled to a low side of the LED load and the power controller; a current sense resistor connected in series on the high side of the LED load; a current sensing circuit coupled across the current sense resistor providing a reference current at an output line proportional to a current sense voltage across the current sense resistor; and a current selector resistor coupled between the output line of the current sensing circuit and the common power line coupled to the low side of the LED load, the current selector resistor and the reference current generating a current-sensed voltage for use as the feedback voltage used by the power controller wherein the DC output voltage provided by the power controller is controlled to provide a constant current to the LED load.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided a lighting fixture for mounting above an illumination surface. The lighting fixture comprises a housing supporting a light emitting diode (LED) light string for illuminating the illumination surface; and a power supply for providing a constant current to a light emitting diode (LED) load. The power supply comprises a power controller receiving an alternating current (AC) input and providing a direct current (DC) output voltage controlled to maintain a constant feedback voltage, the DC output voltage provided to a high side of the LED load, the DC output voltage relative to a common power line coupled to a low side of the LED load and the power controller; a current sense resistor connected in series on the high side of the LED load; a current sensing circuit coupled across the current sense resistor providing a reference current at an output line proportional to a current sense voltage across the current sense resistor; and a current selector resistor coupled between the output line of the current sensing circuit and the common power line coupled to the low side of the LED load, the current selector resistor and the reference current generating a current-sensed voltage for use as the feedback voltage used by the power controller; wherein the DC output voltage provided by the power controller is controlled to provide a constant current to the LED load.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure there is provided a method of controlling a lighting fixture. The method comprises rectifying an alternating current (AC) input; producing a controlled voltage output from the AC input using a single ended primary inductance converter; producing a sensing current proportional to the controlled voltage output using a current sense resistor in series with the controlled voltage output and a current sensing circuit connected across the current sense resistor; generating a feedback voltage using the sensing current and a current selector resistor; and adjusting the controlled voltage output to maintain the feedback voltage at a reference voltage, wherein the controlled voltage output provides a constant current to an light emitting diode (LED) load.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A single-ended primary inductance converter (SEPIC) power supply for driving multiple strings of light emitting diode (LED) lamps in lighting fixtures is provided. High power factor and high efficiency are realized in a single-stage architecture. The SEPIC architecture described herein uses the ripple steering technique to reduce the switching frequency components of the input current. Other advantages of the SEPIC power supply include reduced inrush current, inherent output short circuit protection, and reduced electromagnetic emissions. High reliability and a long operating lifetime to match the lifetime LEDs are major requirements for the power supplies. This requirement may be achieved by partitioning the power of the lighting fixture into a plurality of power supplies which may help to keep all semiconductor junction temperatures below 100&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The LED lighting fixture can comprise multiple channels of LEDs, with each channel comprising one or more strings of LEDs, to provide control in light distribution and light intensity. In an embodiment a four channel configuration can be utilized, with 24 LEDs per channel, although any number of channels and LED configurations can be utilized. Each LED may have a nominal voltage drop of 3.0V. Since the voltage across each LED string can be less than the minimum AC input voltage, the SEPIC topology works well in this application. The SEPIC disadvantages of higher voltage and current stresses are mitigated by splitting the converter into four power supplies, with lower power dissipation for each. This architecture also allows the lighting fixture to operate at any one of a plurality of light intensities by switching each power supply independently to control the cumulative light intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts in a block diagram components of a lighting fixture <b>100</b>. The lighting fixture <b>100</b> uses light emitting diodes (LEDs) to illuminate a surface. The lighting fixture <b>100</b> may typically be mounted above an illumination surface. The lighting fixture <b>100</b> may comprises one or more LED channels <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>, <b>102</b><i>d</i>, <b>102</b><i>n </i>(referred to generally as <b>102</b>). Each of the LED channels <b>102</b> may comprise a power supply and one or more LED strings. For example each LED channel may comprise 25 LEDs, as 2 strings of 12 LEDs each connected in series. As described further herein, each power supply provides a constant current to the one or more LED strings of the LED channel <b>102</b>. Each power supply receives power from a connection to an alternating current (AC) source such as an AC mains connection.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The lighting fixture <b>100</b> is depicted as having four LED channels <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c</i>, <b>102</b><i>d</i>, although fewer or additional LED channels may be used. The lighting fixture may include a light controller <b>110</b> that controls the operation of the lighting fixture, and in particular controls the operation of power supplies of the LED channels <b>120</b>. The light controller <b>110</b> may comprise a micro controller device such as an Atmel ATtiny85. The micro-controller may be programmed to accept data from external sensors and to produce signals to control the output from the LEDs. The LED output can be triggered by, motion detection, time of night dimming, temperature compensation, wireless control, etc. The light controller <b>110</b> may control the LED channels <b>120</b>, for example to turn on or off individual LED channels <b>120</b> in order to control the illumination output of the lighting fixture <b>100</b>, based on input from one or more input components. The input components may include one or more input sensors for measuring at least one variable. The one or more input sensors may include a motion sensor <b>120</b><i>a </i>for detecting and measuring movement, an ambient temperature sensor <b>120</b><i>b </i>for measuring ambient temperature levels or an ambient light <b>120</b><i>c </i>sensor for measuring ambient light levels. Additional input sensors may be used, such as an output light sensor for measuring light levels output by the light sensor or a fixture temperature sensor for measuring a temperature of the lighting fixture. The controller <b>110</b> may receive additional input from one or more input components comprising, for example, an atomic clock <b>130</b><i>a </i>for generating a time based signal or a wired or wireless transceiver <b>130</b><i>b </i>for receiving and/or transmitting communication messages to a control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it will be appreciated that the components used in the lighting fixture <b>100</b> may be mounted in an appropriate housing. Further, various components may be mounted remote from the housing of the lighting fixture <b>100</b>. For example, an ambient temperature sensor may be mounted remote from the lighting fixture <b>100</b> such as at a base of a mounting pole used to mount the housing of the lighting fixture <b>100</b> above an illumination surface.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, multiple LED channels <b>102</b> can be controlled by a single light controller <b>110</b> to control overall light output of the lighting fixture <b>100</b>. Each LED channel <b>102</b> can be controlled by light controller <b>110</b>. Light controller <b>110</b> can provide input to individual LED channels to control the output of the channel based upon external input provided to the lighting fixture <b>100</b>. Light controller <b>110</b> may control the operation of the LED channels based on inputs provided to the light controller <b>110</b>. The light controller may receive input from a motion sensor <b>120</b><i>a </i>to detect motion and turn on one or more LED channels only when motion is detected in order to conserve power. This may apply to a situation where the LED channels are turned off during low traffic periods, typically after midnight.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A wired (Ethernet, or power line communication, etc.) or wireless (WiFi, WiMax, paging, etc.) transmit/receive interface <b>130</b><i>b </i>may be provided to allow the light controller to turn on or off and/or dim, and/or monitor performance remotely either through direct wireless communication or through wireless networks. The light control may control the illumination level by turning on or off one or more LED channels. Obviously the illumination provided by a single LED channel is less than the illumination level provided by all LED channels <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An ambient light sensor <b>120</b><i>c </i>and/or light output sensors may be provided to monitor LED output and daylight to control the desired light output. For example, less light may be required at dusk or dawn, and so the light controller may detect the ambient light conditions using the ambient light sensor <b>120</b><i>c </i>and turn on an appropriate number of LED channels <b>120</b> to provide the desired illumination level for the measured ambient light level.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An atomic clock input <b>326</b> may also be provided to ensure timing synchronization. Other types of input such as temperature values may also be provided to improve efficiency of the power supply or trigger operation of the lighting fixture <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition to controlling the illumination level of the lighting fixture by controlling the number of LED channels <b>102</b> turned on, the light controller <b>110</b> may also control the brightness of each individual LED channel <b>120</b>. The brightness of an LED channel is determined by the current passing through the LED strings. Depending on the design of the power supply of the LED channel, it may be possible to vary the current provided to the LED strings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">If it is possible to control the current provided to the LED strings of an LED channel <b>120</b>, the light controller <b>110</b> may be configured to provide additional control over the LED channels. For example, the light controller <b>110</b> may adjust the current provided to an LED string in order to account for the aging of the LEDs. As LEDs age, they require additional current to produce the same output light levels. The light controller <b>110</b> may count each power on sequence of an LED channel and store it into internal memory to keep track of how long each LED channel has been in operation. In order to reduce false counting of days due to power brown outs or outages etc, the controller may only count a day if the LED channel is on for a minimum of four hours. The day counter is not meant to be precise, but a general indication of how long the LED channel had been in use. With this scheme, the light controller can be programmed to control the current to the LED strings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts in a schematic components of a portion of a lighting fixture, which may be for example lighting fixture <b>100</b>. The components include an input circuit <b>202</b> and four LED channels, each comprising a power supply connected to an LED load as well as connections to a light controller, such as light controller <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The input circuit <b>202</b> comprises a connection <b>204</b> for connecting the input circuit <b>202</b> to an AC mains power source. The input circuit includes a primary surge protector <b>206</b> which may comprise a varistor connected across the hot and neutral lines of the AC input. The input circuit <b>202</b> may further comprise a thermal protector <b>208</b> in series in the hot line of the AC input. The thermal protector <b>208</b> may provide a temperature operated switch which opens above a threshold temperature, such as for example 95&#xb0; Celsius. The input circuit <b>202</b> may further comprise an electro magnetic interference (EMI) filter <b>210</b> The EMI filter may comprise a capacitor coupled across the hot and neutral lines of the AC input, an inductor in series in the hot and neutral lines of the AC input and a pair of capacitors connected in series with each other across the hot and neutral lines of the AC input. The capacitors may be connected to earth ground at the connection point between the two capacitors. The EMI filter <b>210</b> limits any conducted interference introduced by the power supplies of the lighting fixture to the utility grid. The EMI filter <b>210</b> removes harmonic noise and conducted emissions that could transfer to the utility grid. The input circuit <b>202</b> provides a live AC line (ACL) and a neutral AC line (ACN) that is distributed to the power supplies of the individual LED channels. The input circuit <b>202</b> may further include a secondary surge protector <b>212</b> connected across the output lines from the EMI filter <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each LED channel <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may comprise an individual power supply <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, <b>220</b><i>d </i>(referred to collectively as <b>220</b>) connected to the ACL and ACN provided by the input circuit. Each LED channel may further comprise an LED load <b>222</b><i>a</i>. It should be appreciated that although only a single LED load <b>222</b><i>a </i>is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each individual power supply <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, <b>220</b><i>d </i>would also be connected to a respective LED load (not shown). Each LED load (referred to generally by <b>222</b>) may comprise one or more LED strings. Each LED channel may further comprise connectors <b>224</b><i>a</i>, <b>224</b><i>b</i>, <b>224</b><i>c</i>, <b>224</b><i>d </i>(referred to generally as <b>224</b>) for coupling the individual control lines, including a disable line (DIS<b>1</b>, DIS<b>2</b>, DIS<b>3</b>, DIS<b>3</b>) used to disable respective individual power supplies, and a return line (RET<b>1</b>, RET<b>2</b>, RET<b>3</b>, RET<b>4</b>) which may provide an isolated ground plane for each individual power supply. The connectors <b>224</b> may form part of the respective power supplies <b>220</b> or the may be coupled to the respective power supplies <b>220</b> through a signal bus <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts the individual power supplies <b>220</b> as being separate, they may be manufactured on the same printed circuit board (PCB), which may simplify the manufacturing process, reduce cost, and/or provide a more convenient form factor. Multi channel power supplies realized on a single PCB without isolation, are susceptible to interference and noise from adjacent channels. The switching frequency of each channel may not be exactly the same and so cause noise to form on the common neutral line which is passed on to the RET lines of each channel. The result is an unstable channel ground and fluctuating output. To overcome this, each power supply <b>220</b> has been isolated as much as possible from each other. Separate RET/ground planes are provided for each power supply and each power supply has its own bridge network for rectifying the AC input on the ACL and ACN lines.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts in a schematic components of a power supply <b>300</b> for use in a lighting fixture, for example lighting fixture <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The power supplies <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may comprise a power supply such as power supply <b>300</b>. The power supply <b>300</b> includes ACL connection <b>302</b><i>a </i>and ACN connection <b>302</b><i>b </i>for receiving the AC input. The power supply <b>220</b> also includes a DIS connection <b>304</b> and a RET connection <b>306</b>. The DIS connection <b>304</b> provides a connection to a controller, such as light controller <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that may be used to disable the power supply <b>300</b> so that no current will flow through the LED light string <b>399</b> connected to the power supply <b>300</b>. The RET connection <b>306</b> may connect a common power line <b>308</b> to a ground plane of the lighting fixture. The common power line <b>308</b> may be connected to a low side of the LED light string <b>399</b> as well as the power controller.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The power supply includes a power factor correction (PFC) single ended primary inductance controller (SEPIC) power controller <b>310</b>. The power controller <b>310</b> provides a controlled voltage Vcc as output. The controlled voltage output Vcc is controlled by the power controller <b>310</b> based on a feedback voltage supplied to the power controller <b>310</b>. The power controller <b>310</b> adjusts the controlled output voltage in order to maintain, or to try to maintain, the feedback voltage at a particular voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The typical configuration of a PFC SEPIC power controller provides a constant output voltage where the output current will vary depending on the load that is connected. The use of a PFC SEPIC power controller to directly power an LED string would result in the voltage across the LED load being maintained constant, which would in turn result in a varying current passing through the LEDs. The varying current would results in flickering or pulsing in the light which is undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to use a PFC SEPIC power controller <b>310</b> to power LED light string <b>399</b> with a constant current, a feedback circuit is added in order to generate the feedback voltage used by the PFC SEPIC to maintain the output voltage Vcc. The feedback circuit comprises a current sense resistor R<b>20</b> connected in series on a high side of the LED light string <b>399</b>. The current sense resistor R<b>20</b> generates a voltage across it that is proportional to the current passing through it, and so passing through the LED string <b>399</b>. A current sensing circuit <b>320</b> connected across the current sense resistor R<b>20</b> senses the voltage and generates a reference current at an output line <b>322</b>. The reference current is proportional to the sensed voltage across the current sense resistor R<b>20</b>. In order to generate the feedback voltage required by the power controller <b>310</b>, a current selector resistor R<b>21</b> is connected between the output line <b>322</b> and the common power line <b>308</b>. The feedback voltage is generated across the current selector resistor R<b>21</b> and is proportional to the reference current, which in turn is proportion to the voltage across the current sense resistor R<b>20</b>, which in turn is proportional to the current flowing through the current sense resistor R<b>20</b> and the LED light string <b>399</b>. The power controller <b>310</b> adjusts the controlled output voltage Vcc to maintain the feedback voltage Vfb at a reference voltage. Since the feedback voltage Vfb is based on the current flow through the LED light string <b>399</b>, the power controller <b>310</b> adjusts Vcc to maintain Vfb, which results in the power controller providing a constant current to the LED light string <b>399</b>. The components providing the feedback voltage loop are chosen so that the total loop transfer function is the same is if the output voltage was being regulated directly.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The power controller <b>310</b> attempts to maintain the feedback voltage Vfb at a reference voltage. The feedback voltage is generated by the reference current passing through the current selector resistor R<b>21</b>. As such the constant current provided to the LED light string <b>399</b> by the power controller <b>310</b> can be varied by adjusting the resistance of the current selector resistor R<b>21</b>. By selecting a smaller resistance for current selector resistor R<b>21</b>, a larger reference current will need to pass through it in order to produce the same feedback voltage Vfb. The voltage drop across R<b>20</b> will need to be larger in order to increase the reference current. In order to increase the voltage drop across R<b>20</b>, in order to provide the feedback voltage, the current passing through the resistor R<b>20</b> must be larger, as compared to the current passing through the current sense resistor R<b>20</b> when a larger current selector resistor R<b>21</b> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition to the current sense resistor R<b>20</b>, current sensing circuit <b>320</b> and current selector resistor R<b>21</b>, the power supply <b>300</b> may further comprise a current sense ripple filter capacitor C<b>12</b>. The current sense ripple filter capacitor C<b>12</b> may be installed in parallel with R<b>21</b> to help reduce excessive ripple on the reference current waveform which can cause the power controller <b>310</b> to become unstable.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts in a schematic components of a power supply <b>400</b> for use in a lighting fixture. The power supply <b>400</b> is similar to the power supply <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>; however it includes additional components that may increase the protection of the circuits, or provide increased functionality or simplify manufacturing. Components of the power supply <b>400</b> that function the same way as the corresponding components in power supply <b>300</b> are not further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The current sensing circuit <b>402</b> is coupled across the current sense resistor R<b>20</b>. The current sensing circuit <b>402</b> comprises a high side current mirror U<b>2</b> the sense the voltage across the current sense resistor and provides an output current lout that is proportional to the sensed voltage across the current sense resistor R<b>20</b>. The current sensing circuit <b>402</b> further includes protection circuit that comprises a zener diode D<b>5</b> connected to the high side of current sense resistor R<b>20</b>. The zener diode D<b>5</b> is connected in series with two resistors R<b>24</b> and R<b>25</b>. A p-type transistor Q<b>1</b> has its base connected between the zener diode D<b>5</b> and the resistor R<b>24</b>. The emitter of transistor Q<b>1</b> is connected to the output of the high side current mirror U<b>2</b>. The collector of transistor Q<b>1</b> provides a reference current at an output line <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In contrast to power supply <b>300</b> which included a single current selector resistor R<b>21</b>, the power supply <b>400</b> comprises a plurality of current sense resistors that can be connected to the output line <b>404</b> by a plurality of switches. Each resistor may be connected to the output line <b>404</b> through a respective switch. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the switches may be a simple jumper selector P<b>1</b>. Using a jumper to select the current selector resistor R<b>21</b>, R<b>22</b>, R<b>23</b> does not allow a different value of resistor to be selected, and so change the current provided to the LED load, since physical access to the lighting fixture is required. However, this arrangement may be beneficial from a supply management perspective since a single part can be used to provide multiple currents and so it is not necessary to maintain multiple part numbers. Furthermore, the jumper may be repositioned to select a different resistor as the lighting fixture ages and so provide additional current to the LEDs causing them to be brighter.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The switches used for selecting the current sense resistor R<b>21</b>, R<b>22</b>, R<b>23</b> may be controlled by a signal. For example the switches may be implemented using a transistor. Each transistor may be turned on, and so connect the associated resistor to the output line, by a signal line (not shown) that may be controlled by the light controller of the lighting fixture. Having controllable switches connecting the current selector resistors to the output line can allow the light controller to change the value of the current selector resistor during operation of the lighting fixture changing current supplied to the LEDs and so the brightness of the LED strings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The power supply <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 300</figref> depicts an LED load <b>399</b> connected to two contacts. The power supply <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> comprises 4 contacts allowing two LED strings to be connected in series. This may allow the power supply <b>400</b> to power more LED, or allow the power supply to power the same number of LEDs, but have smaller LED strings.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The power supply may also comprise a no load protection circuit for protecting the circuit when no load is present. If no load is present, the feedback voltage Vfb will be zero and the power controller will continually increase the controlled output voltage Vcc which may cause damage. The no load circuit allows a feedback voltage Vfb to be generated even when no load is connected and so limits the maximum controlled output voltage Vcc that will be generated. In the power supply <b>400</b> the no load protection circuit is a zener diode Z<b>6</b> connected across the low side of current sense resistor R<b>20</b> and the output line <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts in a schematic components of a PFC SEPIC power controller <b>500</b> for use in a power supply of a lighting fixture. The power controller <b>500</b> may be used in for example power supply <b>300</b> or power supply <b>400</b>. The power controller <b>500</b> comprises a bridge rectifier block <b>502</b> that converts the AC input on ACL line and ACN line to a DC input for a power factor correction (PFC) circuit <b>504</b>. The PFC circuit <b>504</b> receives the now rectified AC signal to produce a lower voltage by Buck/Boost inductor <b>506</b>. The buck/boost inductor <b>506</b> converts high DC voltage to lower DC voltage. Output rectification and filtering block <b>508</b> are provided to reduce ripple from voltage and current to provide a cleaner output voltage Vcc. The reduced voltage waveform Vcc is provided to drive the LEDs as described above. The feedback voltage is provided to the PFC circuit <b>504</b> which adjusts the power controller to control the output voltage Vcc so that the feedback voltage will be maintained at a reference voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The PFC circuit may include a current mode PFC controller U<b>1</b> which operates in transition mode, on the boundary between discontinuous and continuous current in the input inductor (Pri). The PFC controller U<b>1</b> has a fixed on time and a variable frequency. This type of controller is simpler than the more conventional fixed frequency, average current mode controller.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In steady-state operation, the input (Pri) and output (Sec) inductors see the same voltage. The output diode sees the sum of the input and output voltages. The MOSFET M<b>1</b> current is the sum of the currents in the input and output inductors. Likewise, the voltage across the MOSFET M<b>1</b> is the sum of the input and output voltages, which is also seen by the main capacitor, C<b>10</b>. These observations can be used to determine component voltage and current ratings for the design.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The AC input into the power controller is converted to a full-wave rectified sine with an rms value of Vpk/&#x221a;2, where Vpk is the peak voltage of the AC input. The PFC controller U<b>1</b> senses both the MOSFET M<b>1</b> current and the actual value of the rectified mains voltage. Operating in the 40 kHz to 100 kHz frequency range, the MOSFET M<b>1</b> turns on and remains on until a current limit is reached, when it switches off. The current limit is proportional to the input voltage and thus the peak current in the MOSFET M<b>1</b> is quasi-sinusoidal and in-phase with the mains voltage. Thus the power factor is very close to 1 and so provides high efficiency. The bandwidth of the controller is kept very low (typically &#x3c;30 Hz) to keep the power factor high.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The PFC controller U<b>1</b> may have an internal error amplifier and reference voltage for control of the output voltage in a standard boost PFC pre-regulator. Normally, the output voltage would be sensed by a voltage divider and the feedback voltage fed back to the error amplifier. However, as described above, the feedback voltage is provided by a high side current mirror, which allows the power controller <b>500</b> to provide a constant current output.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The power controller <b>500</b> may also include a disable input line (DIS) that allows the power controller <b>500</b> to be turned off.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It will be appreciated that the above selection of components is only one possible selection that provides a particular power supply. Various component selections can be made based on the design specification and requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts in a flow chart a method <b>400</b> of controlling a lighting fixture. An alternating current (AC) input is rectified (<b>602</b>). A controlled voltage output is produced (<b>604</b>) from the rectified AC input using a PFC SEPIC controller. A sensing current proportional to the controlled voltage output is produced (<b>606</b>). The sensing current is produced by a current sensing circuit that is connected across a current sensing resistor. The current sensing resistor is connected in series with the controlled voltage output line. A feedback voltage is generated by the sensing current that passes through a current selector resistor (<b>608</b>). The feedback voltage is provided to a PFC controller. The current selector and the PFC controller are both connected to a common neutral or return line. The feedback voltage generated across the current selector resistor is relative to the common neutral or return line. The controlled voltage output is adjusted based on the feedback voltage (<b>610</b>). The controlled voltage output is adjusted to maintain the feedback voltage at a reference voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts in a component flow diagram a process of powering an LED string in a lighting fixture. An AC power source <b>700</b> provides an input AC signal that is fed to the EMI filter block <b>702</b>. The EMI filter block <b>702</b> may limit any conducted interference introduced by the lighting fixture to the utility grid by removing harmonic noise and conducted emissions that could transfer to the grid. A bridge rectifier block <b>704</b> converts the AC input to a DC input. The power factor correction circuit (PFC) <b>714</b> receives the now rectified AC signal to produce the lower voltage by Buck/Boost inductor <b>706</b>. The PFC circuit <b>714</b> uses the output of the AC rectifier block <b>704</b>, a feedback voltage generated by current selector <b>750</b>, as well as a monitored current that is filtered by current sense ripple filter <b>745</b> to control the output voltage produced by the buck/boost inductor <b>706</b>. The buck/boost inductor <b>706</b> converts high DC voltage to lower DC voltage. Output rectification block <b>710</b> and filtering block <b>716</b> are provided to reduce ripple from voltage and current to provide a cleaner output. The reduced voltage waveform is provided to drive the LED's <b>718</b>. A current sense block <b>730</b> produces an output current to the current selector that is proportional to the current in the power line of the LED's. The current selector <b>750</b> generates a voltage which is directly proportional to the current flowing to the LED's based on the output current produced by the current sense block <b>730</b>. The current sense ripple filter <b>745</b> filters the current waveform that is sensed by the PFC circuit <b>714</b> which can provide more stable operation of the lighting fixture. A no load protection module <b>740</b> is provided to ensure protection of the power supply when no load is connected.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a method of controlling multiple LED channels. An input is received <b>802</b> by the light controller to provide a control of the illumination level required by the light fixture. The input such as remote wired or wireless input, ambient light sensor, light output or motion sensors input, or determining the age of the fixture and LED degradation can be used to determine what the illumination level <b>804</b> is targeted or desired. The determined illumination level is used to determine the number of channels required to achieve the desired light output. The LED channel state <b>806</b> can then be determined. The appropriate channels can then be enabled or disabled to achieve the desired light out put at <b>808</b>. The illumination level may be determined on such factors as ambient light, output degradation, special events.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts in a flow chart a method of powering an LED string. EMI filtering of incoming AC current is performed at <b>902</b>. The AC input is then rectified at <b>904</b> to convert the AC to full-wave DC voltage and current. At <b>906</b> the high DC voltage is converted to lower voltage DC, for example voltage step-down is performed from 165 Volts to 36 Volts. The primary current is monitored at <b>908</b> for power factor correction by PFC circuit <b>114</b>. If current exceeds design tolerances short circuit protection is performed by the PFC circuit at <b>910</b>. Based upon the determined current, a correction factor can be applied to ensure current tolerances at <b>912</b>. Output rectification is performed at <b>914</b> to reduce ripple from voltage and current to provide cleaner output. Secondary side filtering is then performed at <b>916</b> and the current is then applied to the LED engine at <b>918</b>. The LED current is measured at <b>920</b>. The micro-controller can then average current signal to perform an averaging function to high ripple LED current. The output mode of the LED is then determined at <b>930</b> where the micro-controller is programmed to control the state of an LED channel.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The current power on cycle can be determined by the micro-controller and determine the &#x201c;age&#x201d; of the fixture by counting power on cycles. The micro-controller can determine the required LED current to achieve the desired output. The micro-controller can then send a feedback signal to the power factor correction circuit to adjust the required current to the LED by calculating the desired feedback voltage output based on the gathered data. External input may also be provided to the micro-controller such as signals from motion sensors, a wireless TX/RX interface or ambient light and/or light output sensor. Additional input may be provided in calculating the desired on/off state, light intensity or current required to maintain a light intensity of the LED fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A power supply according to the present disclosure may be designed to accept any input voltage, including two standard input voltages; i.e., 120 Vac, 60 Hz (North American Voltage) or 240 Vac, 50 Hz (European Voltage). For each input voltage a separate power supply is used. The design is the same with only several changes in component values for each version to accept the lower or higher voltage and different frequencies. This method may be used over typical universal input voltage design as it keeps efficiency as high as possible by optimizing the component values for each supply and its corresponding input rather than making a compromise so that the power supply can work at all levels.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As described above, it is possible to control the light output by a lighting fixture by controlling the number of LED channels that are turned on. Further output level control may be provided by controlling the brightness of each LED channel. This brightness control may be accomplished by varying the resistance of the current selector resistor which will change the current provided to the LEDs. The output level may be adjusted in other ways as well, for example by limiting the current provided by the power controller prior to the LED load.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the light control can adjust amount of current going to the LEDs, it may do so by initially providing the minimum amount of current to the LED's to provide the minimum lumen output as required by IES standards. The current may then be adjusted to gradually increases the current over time to maintain the lumen output to compensate for the natural reduction of lumen output by the aging LED's (LEDs decrease in output by 20% over 20 years). Running the LED's at lower currents make them much more efficient as they run much cooler. This can provide significant savings over HPS fixtures which need to have higher initial output (lumens) to maintain proper IES light levels towards the end of their life.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If the lighting fixture includes a light controller to control operation of one or more LED channels, other control schemes can easily be added such as motion detection to turn on or increase (or decrease) light levels when a vehicle or pedestrian is present, temperature compensation to reduce current to the LED's if they are running too hot ensuring a longer life, time of day dimming to have the light turn on or adjust light levels to coincide with traffic cycles, and remote control operation (wireless) to allow a remote programmable control that allows for changes in light levels in real time or change the programming of the micro for particular events such as festivals, emergencies, tourist season.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Certain adaptations and modifications of the described embodiments can be made. Therefore, the above discussed embodiments are considered to be illustrative and not restrictive.</p>
