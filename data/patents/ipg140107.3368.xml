<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to transmission of electrical power to sub-sea electrical equipment such as a motor driving a compressor/pump located far away from the shore, and more particularly to a system and method for sharing power among different source-side converter modules without a communication link in a transmission and distribution system that employs modular stacked DC (MSDC) technology for sub-sea applications.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Transmission of electrical power to oil and gas sub-sea electrical equipment often requires high power to be transmitted over long distances. Such a transmission is done at high voltages to reduce losses. At the receiving sub-sea end, the voltage is stepped-down and then distributed to the individual loads. Distribution distances are typically much shorter than the transmission distance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Three phase 50/60 Hz AC power transmission and distribution is a mature technology. Using this technology, step-up transformers are used at the sending end to increase the voltage to transmission levels (e.g. 72 kV). At the subsea end, step down transformers are used to reduce the voltage to distribution levels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">AC transmission, although mature, provides technical challenges for applications where bulk power is transmitted over long cables. Due to cable capacitance, a significant amount of reactive power needs to be provided by the power source and carried by the cable. Capacitance causes charging current to flow along the length of the AC cable. Because the cable must carry this charging current in addition to the useful load current, the cable losses are high; the cables are over-rated and expensive. Large reactive power requirements may trigger power system stability issues. The limitation of 50/60 Hz AC transmission and distribution can be alleviated by reducing the power transmission frequency (e.g. 16&#x2154; Hz). This reduces the reactive power requirement by the cable capacitance. However, this solution is at the expense of increase in size of magnetic components such as transformers. At high power levels, the size and weight penalty would be excessive.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, multiphase booster pumps require electrically driven motors delivering a shaft power between 2 MW and 6 MW. Such pump clusters may require power on the order of 20 MW to be transmitted over 50 kms.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, sub-sea motors driving a gas compressor typically have a higher nominal power (e. g., in the order of 10 or 15 MW). As such, sub-sea compression clusters may be required to transmit a total power in the order of 50 to 100 MW over a distance of 100 or 200 km. The transmission of high power over a distance of more than 100 km and distributing the power sub-sea is very challenging with AC transmission and distribution systems because of the high charging currents and the high number of components involved in the distribution system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, DC transmission can be achieved more efficiently over long distances than AC transmission. High voltage (HV) DC transmission typically requires the usage of power electronic converters in the transmission systems that are capable of converting between HVAC and HVDC. Each switch of the converter for conventional HVDC converter topologies is designed to handle high voltages. The converter nominal voltage may range from tens-of-kilovolts to hundreds-of-kilovolts, depending upon the application. Such switches are typically configured utilizing a plurality of series connected semiconductor devices (e.g., such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and thyristors). Because of the size and the high number of components involved, conventional HVDC terminals are not well suited for sub-sea installations.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Power converters are also required on the load side of a power distribution system. Typically, a power converter in conjunction with a high voltage transformer is used to step down the voltage from the DC transmission level to the voltage level used in the power distribution system. The variable speed drive (VSD) of the sub-sea pump/compressor motor converts this distribution level voltage to variable frequency AC voltage required to run the motor over a wide range of speed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Modular stacked DC converter architectures are well suited for sub-sea applications requiring transmission and distribution over long distances. Unlike other DC transmission options, wherein the dc transmission (link) voltage is controlled, i.e. maintained nearly constant, the dc transmission (link) current is controlled in a modular stacked dc converter. One MSDC architecture <b>10</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The MSDC architecture gets its name from the fact that the architecture uses several dc-dc/ac-dc/dc-ac converter modules stacked and connected in series on the dc side, both at the sending end and at the receiving end of the transmission link such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The sending end/top-side converters <b>12</b> comprise a set of ac-dc converters <b>14</b>, which draw power from the ac mains or grid <b>16</b>. Each of these converters <b>14</b> is cascaded with a dc-dc converter <b>18</b>. These dc-dc converters <b>18</b> are connected in series and they are controlled so as to regulate the current in the dc cable <b>20</b> connecting the top-side <b>12</b> to the sub-sea installation <b>22</b>. It shall be understood that the sending-end ac-dc <b>14</b> and dc-dc converter <b>18</b> stages (shown explicitly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can be replaced by a single ac-dc converter that combines the functions of both the stages. The sub-sea/receiving-end <b>22</b> also comprises several dc-dc converters <b>19</b> connected in series. Each of these converters <b>19</b> is cascaded with a dc-ac inverter/motor drive <b>24</b>. These dc-dc converters <b>19</b> are controlled to regulate the dc link voltage to that required by the down-stream motor drive <b>24</b>. It shall also be understood that the subsea dc-dc <b>19</b> and motor drive <b>24</b> (shown explicitly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) can also be replaced by a single dc-ac converter that combines the functions of both the stages. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts two-level converters used for the ac-dc, dc-dc and motor drive modules, it shall be understood that at high power levels, multi-level stacks will be used for these converter modules.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sending end converters <b>12</b> may derive power from a single or multiple sources/generators <b>30</b> located in one place as illustrated for one embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. According to another embodiment, the sending end converters <b>12</b> may derive power from several sources <b>30</b> that are located in places separated by large geographical distances such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In both of these embodiments, there is a need to share the total load power between the different connected sources <b>30</b>. According to one embodiment, a supervisory controller can be employed that will communicate the power to be delivered by each module, wherein each module is connected to one source <b>30</b>. This approach requires communication lines between the controller and each module. Any failure of a corresponding communication link or the supervisory controller itself will undesirably shut down the entire system. System reliability is one of the critical features in sub-sea transmission and distribution systems; and such single point failures are not acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In view of the foregoing, there is a need to share the total load in a sub-sea transmission and distribution system among the front-end converters equally or proportional to their ratings in a manner that is not susceptible to single point communication link failures such as those exhibited by systems that employ a supervisory controller.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The MSDC architecture comprises two sets of converters including sending end/top-side converters and receiving end/sub-sea converters, as stated herein. According to one embodiment, sharing power between different sending end converters <b>18</b> is accomplished by programming each of the sending end dc-side converters <b>18</b> with a droop curve <b>40</b> such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this regard, each sending end dc-side converter is programmable via integrated programmable software/firmware. According to one embodiment, each dc-side converter <b>18</b> comprises an integrated programmable controller that includes, for example, at least one of a CPU or a DSP and corresponding memory devices, such as RAM and/or ROM that may be programmable, such as EPROM/EEPROM devices. Programmable logic devices may also be employed to provide the requisite programmable control features. A particular dc-side converter <b>18</b> droop curve <b>40</b> is determined from the magnitude of the link current (I<sub>link</sub>) flowing through the dc cable, such as dc cable <b>20</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the average output voltage (V<sub>dc(avg)</sub>) of the particular dc-side converter <b>18</b>. The load shared by the particular converter <b>18</b> is then determined as the product of (I<sub>link</sub>) and dc voltage V<sub>dc </sub>at the operating point <b>42</b>, e.g. V<sub>dc(avg)(opn)</sub>*I<sub>link(opn)</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sending end converters <b>18</b> in the MSDC system at no load will put out a very low voltage, just to supply the system losses. The link current will be the highest under these conditions. When the system load increases, the magnitude of link current decreases and the converters <b>18</b> shift to a new operating point delivering a higher voltage and thereby supplying an increased power to meet the load demand.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to one embodiment, a single droop curve <b>40</b> can be programmed in a local controller associated with each front end converter <b>18</b> of the same or substantially the same rating. The droop curve(s) can be either linear such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> or non-linear such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref> according to particular embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph illustrating a droop curve for converters <b>18</b> having a common power rating. Alternatively, for converters <b>18</b> of different power ratings contributing to the link current, the load can be shared proportional to their power ratings by using different droop curves such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that illustrates linear droop curves <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> for converters having power ratings that are different from one another. Non-linear droop curves such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> can also be employed for converters having power rating different from one another in another embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates sending end converters <b>12</b> configured to provide load sharing by corresponding onshore dc-side converters <b>18</b> according to one embodiment. Each dc-side converter <b>18</b> is programmed to generate an average output voltage <b>60</b> corresponding to its respective dc-side converter operating point.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Load sharing between converters in the absence of a physical communication link has been demonstrated by the present inventors using computer simulations for a system comprising series connected sending end dc-dc converters <b>18</b> such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Input voltages employed for this embodiment were 200 volts and 250 volts respectively. Droop characteristics <b>70</b> employed to simulate results of load sharing by the onshore converters <b>18</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A three (3) kHz switching frequency was also employed to simulate the results.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts dc-dc converter load sharing results <b>80</b> for the dc-dc converters <b>18</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> based on the droop curve depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> according to one embodiment. These results are generated when the dc-dc converters <b>18</b> share a load power of 400 Watts, i.e. 200 Watts each. It can be seen that as the input voltage is higher for the second converter (250 V), the generated pulse width (V<sub>dc2</sub>) is smaller than that corresponding to the first converter (V<sub>dc1)</sub>. Simulation results were obtained by filtering the switching ripple in the current prior to application of droop characteristics to determine the average output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates changes in dc-dc converter load sharing in response to load changes. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts the effect as load power changes from about 400 W to about 2 kW. It can be seen the link current initially dips. The programmed droop causes the dc-dc converters <b>18</b> to increase their corresponding output voltages and hence support the increased load. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates dc-dc converter steady state load sharing conditions subsequent to the load changes described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In summary explanation, exemplary embodiments of sub-sea power transmission/distribution network have been described herein that include a plurality of standard proven power converter building blocks on each of the power source side and the sub-sea load side, wherein the power source side converters and the sub-sea load side converters are each configured to provide a modular stacked dc converter architecture.
