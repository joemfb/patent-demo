<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method for manipulating an environment to create a tactical combat scenario requires the coordinated implementation of various actions. One requires detonating an explosion simulator to create a smoke cloud with pseudo shrapnel. Another requires activating a sound enhancer, and yet another involves making a fire-ball. The combined result of these concerted actions is a perception of a single explosive event.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention pertains generally to training aids. More particularly, the present invention pertains to training aids that are used in training exercises to simulate a tactical combat environment. The present invention is particularly, but not exclusively, useful as a system and method for safely combining elements of smoke, pseudo shrapnel, noise and fire into the perception of a single explosive event for the purpose of manipulating both the physical and sensory aspects of a training scenario.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Data collected by the U.S. Department of Defense over many years shows that the probability of a combatant receiving a mortal wound, or sustaining a debilitating wound that effectively eliminates his/her combat effectiveness, is highest during the combatant's first few exposures to combat. The logical conclusion to be drawn from this observation is that a person is best prepared for combat by having had previous combat experiences. Training, of course, can significantly contribute to this experience. Moreover, the more realistic the training, the better prepared the individual will be for actual combat.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Heretofore, the most notable simulations of combat have been presented in the movies, and by the military in their training programs. In the movies, however, situations simulating combat are scripted, orchestrated, rehearsed and presented under tightly controlled circumstances. Every event in the simulation is planned and practiced. Importantly, every combat simulation presented in the movies is performed &#x201c;for the camera.&#x201d; Although there is an emphasis on realism, it is not combat and, indeed, is not really presented to achieve a physical perception of actual combat. On the other hand, although military training exercises are conducted with efforts to include as much realism as possible, due to the real time flow of events the chaotic dimensions of actual combat are often restrained. In particular, the perception of hostile fire from an aggressor force that is commonplace in combat can be allowed to become unrealistically distant.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is axiomatic that hyper-realism for the sights and sounds of a combat training environment is an important factor for the effectiveness level of the training. Importantly, it is well known that the mere perception of danger is often sufficient to create a combat response in a trainee. Further, for a training scenario, the perception of combat need not include the destructive forces that accompany ordinary explosions. Stated differently, a coordinated combination of smoke, fire and noise can simulate an actual explosion even though no destruction results, and even though the smoke, fire and noise may each come from separate sources.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In light of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method for manipulating an environment to create a tactical combat scenario that creates a perception of an actual destructive explosion without creating destructive forces. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method for manipulating an environment to create a tactical combat scenario by selectively coordinating the presentation of smoke, fire and noise to create a perception of a destructive explosion. Yet another object of the present invention is to repetitively recreate combat scenarios for compliance with a military training schedule. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a system and method for manipulating an environment to create a tactical combat scenario that is easy to use and install, that is simple to operate and that is cost effective.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, a system for creating a tactical combat scenario in an environment requires the concerted employment of explosion simulators, sound enhancers, and fire-ball generators. Though these various components can be independently employed, and sometimes are, when used together they are capable of creating a perception of a single explosive event. Importantly, the perception is created by a smoke cloud with an associated fire-ball that includes pseudo shrapnel and is accompanied by a realistic audio effect. Most importantly, the explosive event can be created within a very short distance from an individual (e.g. less than 0.30 meters or one foot) without causing any significant personal injury.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The explosive simulator of the present invention involves a &#x201c;lifter&#x201d; that directs a smoke cloud, with associated pseudo shrapnel, in a generally vertical direction. Structurally, this lifter includes a mortar that has a rectangular base member. Four contiguous sides extend upwardly at an angle from the edge of the base member. Together, the sides and the base member of the mortar define a receptacle. A handle that is affixed to a side of the mortar, outside the receptacle, can be incorporated with the mortar. In addition to providing a means for grasping and carrying the mortar, this handle will also orient the mortar at an angle when the mortar is tipped or tilted on its side.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to prepare the explosive simulator for operation, a detonator is positioned in the receptacle of the mortar, on the base member. An electrical wire is then run from the detonator to a remote controller to establish an electrical connection between the remote controller and the detonator. As envisioned for the present invention, the detonator is preferably either a 59.14 mL (2 oz.) or a 118.29 mL (4 oz.) black powder charge. Once the detonator has been positioned in the receptacle, cardboard can be positioned over the detonator. Chunks of Peruvian cork are then placed on top of the detonator/cardboard, and a powder like material, such as Fuller's earth, is positioned over the chunks of Peruvian cork. The explosive simulator is, thus, operationally loaded and can be pre-positioned in an environment, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Sound enhancers for use with the present invention are generally hollow metal tubes that are affixed (i.e. welded) perpendicularly onto a metal base plate. A sound making device, comprised of aluminum and potassium percholate powder, can then be dropped into the lumen of the hollow tube. Like the explosive device, an electrical wire is run from the sound making device to the remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Fire-balls are generated for the present invention by a device sometimes referred to herein as a &#x201c;MAPP (methylacetylene-propadiene propane) Popper,&#x201d; &#x201c;Propane Popper,&#x201d; or fire-ball generator. (MAPP (methylacetylene-propadiene propane) gas is a mixture of liquefied petroleum gas [LPG] and methylacetylene-propadiene. MAPP (methylacetylene-propadiene propane) is the trademark for a product of the Dow Chemical Company.) For the present invention, this fire-ball generator includes a hollow cylinder having a wall that defines a chamber. Further, the wall is formed with a plurality of air vents that extend through the wall near an end of the cylinder. Also included is a fluid container that is positioned in the chamber for movement between first and second end caps that are respectively engaged to the ends of the cylinder. In detail, the first end cap has a hollow probe that projects from the end cap and into the chamber. At the other end of the cylinder, the second end cap is formed with a depression for receiving an explosive charge. This explosive charge is connected to the remote controller.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the operation of the fire-ball generator, when the explosive charge is exploded by the remote controller, the fluid container is driven against the probe. This causes the probe to pierce the fluid container, and thereby expel fluid from the container through the probe, which vaporizes under atmospheric pressure. Simultaneously, sparks from the explosive charge are directed through the vents in the wall of the cylinder for contact with the expelled fluid outside the cylinder. This generates the fire-ball. In addition to the components mentioned above, the fire-ball generator can also include a fluid deflector that is mounted on the first end cap, outside the chamber, but in fluid communication with the hollow probe. Further, this deflector can be mounted for rotation on the first end cap. Thus, when fluid is expelled from the container through the probe, the deflector can be oriented to spray the fluid (gas) in a predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As envisioned for the present invention, the explosive simulator can be pre-positioned in an environment, as desired. The sound enhancer can then also be pre-positioned at a first predetermined distance from the explosion simulator. Additionally, the &#x201c;popper,&#x201d; fire-ball generator, may also be pre-positioned at a second predetermined distance from the explosion simulator. Depending on the particular training scenario, these first and second distances may be substantially the same, or quite different from each other. Moreover, the first predetermined distance may be less than one foot, or greater than twenty feet, and the position of the fire-ball generator can be similarly varied.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In line with the above disclosure, an implementation of the system of the present invention requires pre-placement of the components in the environment, and absolute control of their detonations or activations by the remote controller. With this in mind, an explosion simulator can be positioned to project its smoke cloud upwardly, or at an angle (if the mortar is tipped onto its handle side). Further, the explosion simulator can be positioned directly on the ground, or buried in a road bed. In each case, a sound enhancer can be appropriately positioned adjacent the explosion simulator or at an extended distance from the explosion simulator. A fire-ball generator can be similarly employed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a specific example of an employment of the present invention, consider the use of a pseudo RPG (Rocket-Propelled-Grenade). In this example, an explosive simulator can be pre-positioned near a predetermined location where the pseudo RPG is to be aimed. Additionally, a sound enhancer can be pre-positioned within less than a foot of the explosion simulator. And, a fire-ball generator can be similarly positioned. A wire is then connected between a launch pad and the predetermined location. The pseudo RPG is actually an elongated, cylindrical shaped stick having a plastic-foam cone mounted on its front end, with the stick connected for movement along the wire. When a propellant on the aft-end of the stick is energized, the stick and cone (pseudo RPG), moves from the launch pad and along the wire to the point at the predetermined location in the environment. When the pseudo RPG reaches the predetermined location, the remote controller detonates the explosion simulator and activates the sound enhancer and the fire-ball generator.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system in accordance with the present invention is shown and is generally designated <b>10</b>. As shown, the system <b>10</b> includes an explosion simulator <b>12</b> that is connected via an electrical wire <b>14</b> to a remote controller <b>16</b>. Also included is a sound enhancer <b>18</b> that is connected via an electrical wire <b>20</b> to the remote controller <b>16</b>, and a fire-ball generator <b>22</b> that is likewise connected via an electrical wire <b>24</b> to the remote controller <b>16</b>. It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that although electrical wires <b>14</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>24</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for connection with the remote controller <b>16</b>, the wires <b>14</b>, <b>20</b> and <b>24</b> are exemplary. These connections, alternatively, may be electronic, and therefore wireless. As shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the system <b>10</b> is being employed with the explosion simulator <b>12</b> buried in a road bed <b>26</b> for simulating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack on a convoy <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the system <b>10</b> is shown being employed for the simulation of an attack on troops <b>30</b>, of which the troops <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>and <b>30</b><i>c </i>are exemplary. In this case, the troops <b>30</b> are shown being attacked by a pseudo Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) <b>32</b>. For this scenario, the pseudo RPG <b>32</b> requires use of a wire <b>34</b> that has one end attached to a predetermined point <b>36</b> at a location in an environment where the troops <b>30</b> are expected to be, some time during a training exercise. The other end of the wire <b>34</b> is attached to a launch pad <b>38</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the launch pad <b>38</b> is shown to be a hand-held device that is being carried by an actor <b>40</b> who is dressed as an indigenous person. It is to be appreciated, however, that the launch pad <b>38</b> need not be hand-held, and instead may be located wherever desired. Further, the wire <b>34</b> may initially be buried and raised from the ground by the actor <b>40</b> before activation of the pseudo RPG <b>32</b>. In any event, during an operation of the pseudo RPG <b>32</b>, the wire <b>34</b> should be above head height in order to avoid garroting the troops <b>30</b> or the RPG from striking the troops <b>30</b>. In detail, the pseudo RPG <b>32</b> includes a stick <b>42</b> that has a plastic-foam cone <b>44</b> attached to its fore end. Eyelets <b>46</b><i>a </i>and <b>46</b><i>b </i>connect the stick <b>42</b> to the wire <b>34</b>, and a propellant <b>48</b> at the aft end of the stick <b>42</b> propels the pseudo RPG <b>32</b> along the wire <b>34</b> from the launch pad <b>38</b> to the predetermined point <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">After the pseudo RPG <b>32</b> arrives at the predetermined point <b>36</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows there is an explosive event <b>45</b>. Specifically, to create this explosive event <b>45</b> an explosion simulator <b>12</b> is detonated. The result is a smoke cloud <b>50</b>, as well as accompanying pseudo shrapnel <b>52</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the explosive event <b>45</b> is directed upward. Consequently, although the troop <b>30</b><i>a </i>may, perhaps, be within a foot of the explosion simulator <b>12</b>, he/she may well be startled and frightened, but will not be injured.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An important part of the explosion simulator <b>12</b> (i.e. &#x201c;lifter&#x201d;) is a mortar <b>54</b>, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. For purposes of the present invention, the mortar <b>54</b> can be positioned either upright (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), or tilted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). The structural components of the mortar <b>54</b>, as well as the contents that make it operational, are best appreciated by a cross-reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>4</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is will be seen that the mortar <b>54</b> has a base member <b>56</b> that is substantially, though not necessarily, rectangular. Extending upward from this base member <b>56</b> is a plurality of side <b>58</b>, of which the sides <b>58</b><i>a </i>and <b>58</b><i>b </i>are exemplary. In detail, the sides <b>58</b> are sloped upwardly from the base member <b>56</b> at an angle &#x201c;a&#x201d; to a height &#x201c;h&#x201d; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Further, a handle <b>60</b> can be affixed to a side <b>58</b> of the mortar <b>54</b> for the purposes of carrying the mortar <b>54</b> or supporting the mortar <b>54</b> when it is tilted (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). With this structure, the mortar <b>54</b> forms a chamber <b>62</b> for holding contents that will create the explosive event <b>45</b> for explosion simulator <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The contents used for loading the mortar <b>54</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and include (from bottom to top): a detonator <b>64</b>, cardboard <b>66</b> (optional); cork chunks <b>68</b> and a powder material <b>70</b>. Preferably, the detonator <b>64</b> is black powder and is formed either in a 2 oz. or 4 oz. block. The detonator <b>64</b> is then connected via the wire <b>14</b> to the remote controller <b>16</b>. For the present invention, the cork chunks <b>68</b> are preferably a &#x201c;Peruvian cork,&#x201d; and the powder material <b>70</b> is preferably a commercially available material known as &#x201c;Fuller's earth.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, two embodiments are shown for a sound enhancer <b>18</b> in accordance with the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> it is seen that the sound enhancer <b>18</b> includes a base plate <b>72</b> on which a hollow tube <b>74</b> has been attached. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, only the base plate <b>72</b> is used. For both embodiments, a noise maker <b>76</b> of a type well known in the art, comprised of aluminum and potassium percholate powder, is attached to the wire <b>20</b>. In the case of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the noise maker <b>76</b> is positioned in the lumen <b>78</b> of the hollow tube <b>74</b>. In both cases, the wire <b>20</b> is electrically connected to the remote controller <b>16</b> for selective activation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> it will be seen that a fire-ball generator <b>22</b> (i.e. MAPP (methylacetylene-propadiene propane) Popper) as envisioned for the present invention includes a hollow cylinder <b>80</b>. The cylinder <b>80</b> has a wall <b>82</b> that defines a chamber <b>84</b>, and it has a plurality of air vents <b>86</b> that pass through the wall <b>82</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also shows a fluid container <b>88</b> positioned inside the chamber <b>84</b> that contains a flammable liquid <b>90</b>, such as propane or MAPP (methylacetylene-propadiene propane) gas. It is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that the hollow cylinder <b>80</b> is formed with notches <b>92</b> and <b>94</b>. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the notches <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are each one of a pair of opposed notches <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> it is seen that the fire-ball generator <b>22</b> includes an end cap <b>96</b> that is formed with a depression <b>98</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) for receiving an explosive charge (not shown). The wire <b>24</b> is then attached to the explosive charge for detonation by the remote controller <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> also shows the fire-ball generator <b>22</b> includes an end cap <b>100</b> that has a hollow probe <b>102</b>. More specifically, the hollow probe <b>102</b> is formed with a lumen <b>104</b>, and has a blade <b>106</b> that projects from the end cap <b>100</b>. Further, the end cap <b>100</b> can include a fluid deflector <b>108</b> that is mounted for rotation on the end cap <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the assembly of the fire-ball generator <b>22</b>, the fluid container <b>88</b> is first positioned in the chamber <b>84</b> of the hollow cylinder <b>80</b>. The end cap <b>100</b> is then placed with its probe <b>102</b> projecting into the chamber <b>84</b>, and the yoke <b>110</b><i>a </i>is engaged with the hollow cylinder <b>80</b>. Specifically, for this engagement the yoke <b>110</b><i>a </i>extends through the notch <b>92</b> for engagement with the notch <b>112</b> on end cap <b>100</b>. Likewise, the end cap <b>96</b> is engaged with the hollow cylinder <b>80</b> as the yoke <b>110</b><i>b </i>extends through the notch <b>94</b> for engagement with the notch <b>114</b> on end cap <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the operation of the fire-ball generator <b>22</b>, the fire-ball generator <b>22</b> is positioned horizontally so that the probe <b>102</b> is aligned with the flammable liquid <b>90</b> in fluid container <b>88</b>. The remote controller <b>16</b> then detonates the explosive charge held in the depression <b>98</b> on end cap <b>96</b>. With this detonation, the fluid container <b>88</b> is driven into contact with the blade <b>106</b> of probe <b>102</b>. This causes the probe <b>102</b> to pierce the fluid container <b>88</b> and to eject the flammable liquid <b>90</b> from the fluid container <b>88</b>, vaporizing the liquid under atmospheric pressure to form a gas cloud. Specifically, the flammable liquid <b>90</b> exits the fluid container <b>88</b> via the lumen <b>104</b> of probe <b>102</b> and is thereafter spewed outwardly, as a gas, in a direction determined by the orientation of the fluid deflector <b>108</b>. As this gas is leaving the fluid deflector <b>108</b>, sparks from the detonation of the explosive charge exit the hollow cylinder <b>80</b> via the air vents <b>86</b>. When these sparks contact the gas the fire ball is generated.</p>
