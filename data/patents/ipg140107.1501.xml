<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Presently, belt-conveyor assembly lines are widely used in automated assembly manufacturing processes. Workpieces are placed on the conveyor belt of the assembly line and sent to assembly stations. At some of the assembly stations, the workpieces may need to be manually arranged in a predetermined orientation, which results in a waste of manpower that is costly.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, an embodiment of a workpiece orientation apparatus <b>100</b> includes a base <b>11</b>, at least one guiding bar <b>12</b> assembled to the base <b>11</b>, two spaced pushing bars <b>13</b>, a linear actuator <b>14</b>, a connecting member <b>15</b>, a rotary shaft <b>16</b>, two first connecting bars <b>17</b>, and a second connecting bar <b>18</b>. The base <b>11</b> is a substantially a U-shaped board. In the illustrated embodiment, there are two spaced guiding bars <b>12</b>, which are mounted in perpendicular to sidewalls (not labeled) of the base <b>11</b> along a first direction X.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The two pushing bars <b>13</b> are disposed perpendicular to the guiding bar <b>12</b>. The two pushing bars <b>13</b> are slidably connected to the two guiding bars <b>12</b>, arranged along the first direction X, and are configured for orientating every two workpieces (not shown) sent along an assembly line (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The linear actuator <b>14</b> is mounted on the base <b>11</b> and positioned adjacent to the guiding bar <b>12</b>. The linear actuator <b>14</b> is configured for providing a linear driving force along a second direction Y perpendicular to a base of the base <b>11</b> and the first direction X. The linear actuator <b>14</b> includes a support seat <b>141</b> fixed to the base <b>11</b>, a motor <b>142</b>, a screw rod <b>143</b>, and a nut <b>144</b>. The support seat <b>141</b> is substantially U-shaped, and includes a side plate <b>1411</b>, a bottom plate <b>1412</b> perpendicularly connected to one bottom end of the side plate <b>1411</b>, and a top plate <b>1413</b> perpendicularly connected to the opposite other top end of the side plate <b>1411</b>. The bottom plate <b>1412</b> is fixed to the base <b>11</b> and defines a first mounting hole <b>1415</b>. A second mounting hole <b>1414</b> is defined through the top plate <b>1413</b> opposite to and coaxial with the first mounting hole <b>1415</b>. The motor <b>142</b> is mounted on the support seat <b>141</b> and configured for driving the screw rod <b>143</b> to rotate. The screw rod <b>143</b> is mounted to the support seat <b>141</b> and is connected to the motor <b>142</b>. Two ends of the screw rod <b>143</b> are rotatably assembled into and received within the first and second mounting holes <b>1415</b>, <b>1414</b>, respectively. The nut <b>144</b> is screwed onto the screw rod <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The connecting member <b>15</b> is fixed to the nut <b>144</b> of the linear actuator <b>14</b>, and is driven by the linear actuator <b>14</b> to move back and forth along the second direction Y relative to the base <b>11</b> and the support seat <b>141</b>. When the screw rod <b>143</b> is driven by the motor <b>142</b> to rotate, then, the nut <b>144</b> rotates relative to the screw rod <b>143</b> and moves along an axial direction of the screw rod <b>143</b> (namely the second direction Y), thereby driving the connecting member <b>15</b> to move along the second direction Y to a preset position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The rotary shaft <b>16</b> is mounted to the connecting member <b>15</b> along a direction perpendicular to the screw rod <b>143</b>, and is positioned above the base <b>11</b> along a direction perpendicular to the guiding bar <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The two first connecting bars <b>17</b> have the same length as the second connecting bar <b>18</b>. The second connecting bar <b>18</b> is positioned between the two first connecting bars <b>17</b>. Each first connecting bar <b>17</b> defines a connecting hole <b>171</b> for connecting the two first connecting bars <b>17</b> together by a hinge pin <b>172</b>. One end of each first connecting bar <b>17</b> is aligned with and connected to one end of the second connecting bar <b>18</b> and are rotatably assembled together on the rotary shaft <b>16</b>. The other ends of the two first connecting bars <b>17</b> are rotatably connected to one of the pushing bars <b>13</b> and the other end of the second connecting bar <b>18</b> is rotatably connected to the other pushing bar <b>13</b> and are all positioned between the two guiding bars <b>12</b>. Thus, the first connecting bars <b>17</b> and the second connecting bar <b>18</b> are symmetrically positioned relative to the second direction Y. As the rotary shaft <b>16</b> together with the connecting member <b>15</b> is driven by the linear actuator <b>14</b> to move in either direction along the second direction Y, then, the first connecting bars <b>17</b> and the second connecting bar <b>18</b> are driven to rotate relative to the rotary shaft <b>16</b>, which in turn causes the two pushing bars <b>13</b> to move or slide along relative to the guiding bar <b>12</b> along the first direction X.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, the workpiece orientation apparatus <b>100</b> may further include an extra belt conveyor mechanism <b>145</b> disposed between the motor <b>142</b> and the screw rod <b>143</b> for providing a driving force or changing the speed of the motor <b>142</b>. The belt conveyor mechanism <b>145</b> includes a driving wheel <b>1451</b> assembled to one output shaft (not labeled) of the motor <b>142</b>, a driven wheel <b>1452</b> fixed to the screw rod <b>143</b>, and a conveyor belt <b>1453</b> assembled to the driving wheel <b>1451</b> and the driven wheel <b>1452</b>. The conveyor belt <b>1453</b> can be a timing belt, or a flat belt etc. Preferably, the belt conveyor mechanism <b>145</b> is mounted to the bottom plate <b>1412</b> and positioned at a side away from the top plate <b>1413</b>, and the motor <b>142</b> is mounted adjacent to the side at the top plate <b>1413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is to be understood that the linear actuator <b>14</b> can also be a gear-rack structure.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is to be understood that the number of the first connecting bar <b>17</b> can be one.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is to be understood that an extra latching ring <b>173</b> could be applied and detachably assembled to a distal end of the rotary shaft <b>16</b> for preventing the first connecting bar <b>17</b> and the second connecting bar <b>18</b> from departing from the rotary shaft <b>16</b> during usage. Specifically, the latching ring <b>173</b> is substantially C-shaped, a latching groove (not labeled) is predefined in the rotary shaft <b>16</b> corresponding to the latching ring <b>173</b>, such that the latching ring <b>173</b> is detachably latched into the latching groove of the rotary shaft <b>16</b>. It is to be noted that, the latching ring <b>173</b> could be also a screw nut.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">During use of the workpiece orientation apparatus <b>100</b>, the workpiece orientation apparatus <b>100</b> is applied to an assembly line for orientating workpieces sent by the assembly line. The every two workpieces are sent by the assembly line to move toward the base <b>11</b> and the two pushing bars <b>13</b>. When the connecting member <b>15</b> is driven by the linear actuator <b>14</b> to move downwardly along the second direction Y, then, the first and second connecting bars <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> are rotated relative to the rotary shaft <b>16</b> for being opened outwardly, with an angle between the first and second connecting bars <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> to be increasing; meanwhile, the two pushing bars <b>13</b> are driven to slide along the guiding bar <b>12</b> away from each other, thereby separating the every two workpieces apart by the two pushing bars <b>13</b>. When the connecting member <b>15</b> is driven by the linear actuator <b>14</b> to move upwardly along the second direction Y, then, the first and second connecting bars <b>17</b>, <b>18</b> are folded toward each other; meanwhile, the two pushing bars <b>13</b> are driven to slide along the guiding bar <b>12</b> toward each other, thereby fulfilling the combination to the every two workpieces sent by the assembly line. It is easy to control and operate the workpiece orientation apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
