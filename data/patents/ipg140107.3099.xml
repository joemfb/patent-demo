<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application relates to laser cutting or scribing and, in particular, to a method of manufacturing integrated circuitry using ultrashort laser pulses at a high repetition rate to ablate material.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Integrated circuits (ICs) are generally fabricated in an array on or in a semiconductor substrate. ICs generally include several layers formed over the substrate. One or more of the layers may be removed along scribing lanes or streets using a mechanical saw or a laser. After scribing, the substrate may be throughout, sometimes called diced, using a saw or laser to separate the circuit components from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor manufacturers have been shrinking transistor sizes in ICs to improve chip performance. This has resulted in increased speed and device density. To facilitate further improvements, semiconductor manufacturers use materials to reduce the capacitance of dielectric layers. For example, to form a finer circuit pattern, a semiconductor wafer having a low dielectric constant (low-k) insulating film is laminated on the surface of the semiconductor substrate. Low-k dielectrics may include, for example, an inorganic material such as SiOF or SiOB or an organic material such as polyimide-based or parylene-based polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, conventional mechanical and laser cutting methods are not well suited for scribing many advanced finished wafers with, for example, low-K dielectric materials. Relatively low density, lack of mechanical strength and sensitivity to thermal stress make low-k dielectric material very sensitive to stress. Conventional mechanical wafer dicing and scribing techniques are known to cause chips, cracks and other types of defects in low-k materials, thus damaging the IC devices. To reduce these problems, cutting speeds are reduced. However, this severely reduces throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, known laser techniques can produce excessive heat and debris. Traditionally, laser pulse widths in the tens of nanoseconds or more have been used for semiconductor cutting or scribing. However, these long pulse widths allow excessive heat diffusion that causes heat affected zones, recast oxide layers, excessive debris and other problems. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view schematic of a semiconductor material <b>100</b> diced using a conventional laser cutting technique. Near a cut area <b>102</b>, a heat affected zone <b>104</b> and recast oxide layer <b>106</b> has formed. Cracks may form in the heat affected zone <b>104</b> and reduce the die break strength of the semiconductor material <b>100</b>. Thus, reliability and yield are reduced. Further, debris <b>108</b> from the cut area <b>102</b> is scattered across the surface of the semiconductor material <b>100</b> and may, for example, contaminate bond pads.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, conventional laser cutting profiles may suffer from trench backfill of laser ejected material. When the wafer thickness is increased, this backfill becomes more severe and reduces dicing speed. Further, for some materials under many process conditions, the ejected backfill material may be more difficult to remove on subsequent passes than the original target material. Thus, cuts of low quality are created that can damage IC devices and require additional cleaning and/or wide separation of the devices on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method for laser cutting or scribing that increases throughput and improves cut surface or kerf quality is, therefore, desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The embodiments disclosed herein provide systems and methods of scribing a finished wafer that includes low-k dielectric and/or other materials as fast as or faster than existing mechanical and/or laser methods. However, the laser scribing is performed with reduced or no mechanical and/or thermal stress and with reduced or no debris. Thus, little or no post process cleaning is required. Further, clean, straight edge cuts are produced with no additional lateral separation of the devices on wafer required to accommodate the scribing process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a method of cutting a plurality of layers formed over a substrate is provided. Each of the plurality of layers has a respective laser ablation threshold that varies with laser pulse width. The method includes determining a minimum laser ablation threshold for each of the plurality of layers and selecting the highest of the minimum laser ablation thresholds. The method also includes generating a beam of one or more laser pulses having a fluence in a range between the selected laser ablation threshold and approximately ten times the selected laser ablation threshold, and scribing a kerf between a plurality of integrated circuits formed in the plurality of layers. The kerf passes through the plurality of layers to a top surface of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain such embodiments, the laser pulses have a pulse width in a range between approximately 0.1 picosecond and approximately 1000 picoseconds. Further, the beam has a pulse repetition rate in a range between approximately 100 kHz and approximately 100 MHz and can cut through approximately 10 &#x3bc;m of material at a speed in a range between approximately 200 mm/second and approximately 1000 mm/second. In addition, or in other embodiments, the energy per pulse is in a range between approximately 1 &#x3bc;J and approximately 100 &#x3bc;J.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, a method is provided for scribing a wafer having a plurality of integrated circuits formed thereon or therein. The integrated circuits are separated by one or more streets. The method includes generating a beam of one or more laser pulses. The laser pulses have a pulse width selected so as to minimize an ablation threshold of a target material. The method further includes ablating a portion of the target material with the beam at a pulse repetition frequency in a range between approximately 5.1 MHz and approximately 100 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, a method is provided including generating a beam of one or more laser pulses that have a pulse width in a range between approximately 0.6 picosecond and approximately 190 picoseconds. The method further includes ablating a portion of the target material with the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, a method is provided including generating a beam of one or more laser pulses that have a pulse width in a range between approximately 210 picoseconds and approximately 1000 picoseconds. The method further includes ablating a portion of the target material with the beam.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The ability of a material to absorb laser energy determines the depth to which that energy can perform ablation. Ablation depth is determined by the absorption depth of the material and the heat of vaporization of the material. Parameters such as wavelength, pulse width duration, pulse repetition frequency, and beam quality can be controlled to improve cutting speed and the quality of the cut surface or kerf. In one embodiment, one or more of these parameters are selected so as to provide a substantially low fluence (typically measured in J/cm<sup>2</sup>) that has just enough energy to ablate the target material. Thus, the amount of excessive energy deposited into the material is reduced or eliminated. Using a lower fluence reduces or eliminates recast oxide layers, heat affected zones, chipping, cracking, and debris. Thus, die break strength is increased and the amount of post-laser cleaning required is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,186 to Mourou et al. teaches that the ablation threshold of a material is a function of laser pulse width. As used herein, &#x201c;ablation threshold&#x201d; is a broad term that includes its ordinary and customary meaning, and includes, for example, a sufficient fluence required to remove material for scribing or cutting. Traditional pulse widths in the nanosecond range generally require a higher ablation threshold as compared to that of shorter pulse widths. Shorter pulses increase peak power and reduce thermal conduction. To increase spatial resolution, the Mourou et al. patent teaches using pulse widths in the femtosecond range. However, femtosecond laser pulse widths remove smaller amounts of material per pulse as compared to traditional nanosecond pulses. Thus, the amount of time required to cut or scribe a line is increased and throughput is reduced. Further, in the femtosecond pulse range, the ablation threshold may increase as the femtosecond pulses become shorter.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, in one embodiment disclosed herein, pulse widths are selected in the picosecond range to lower the ablation threshold while removing more material per pulse than femtosecond pulses. In the picosecond range, the time constant for electrons initially excited by the laser pulse to exchange energy with the bulk of material (e.g., electron thermalization with consecutive electron-lattice interaction) is in the picosecond range. For example, the time constant may be on the order of approximately 1 to 10 picoseconds. Thus, it is thought that pulses of shorter or comparable duration result in &#x201c;cold&#x201d; Coulomb type ablation without significant heating. Accordingly, thermal stressing and/or melting of the material is eliminated or reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Artisans will recognize from the disclosure herein that pulses in the range between approximately 1 picosecond and approximately 10 picoseconds may provide some thermal type ablation. However, using relatively low fluence per pulse that is only slightly above the ablation threshold reduces excessive energy that produces melted debris. Thus, cleaner kerfs are produced. Further, the heat effects are generally limited to the laser spot because the pulse widths are too short for heat to diffuse or propagate outside the irradiated area. However, when the pulse becomes too short, the effective depth of the laser light interaction with the material is shortened and the efficiency of the ablation is reduced (e.g., less electrons are initially excited by the laser pulse).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To increase cutting speed in certain embodiments, the pulse repetition frequency is selected so as to provide cutting speeds of conventional saw or laser semiconductor cutting processes. High pulse repetition frequencies are used to ablate material quicker. Further, high pulse repetition frequencies allow more energy to be used for ablation before it is dissipated in the surrounding materials.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As discussed in detail below, beam shaping is used in certain embodiments to improve kerf quality. Laser beams can be shaped to create, for example, a substantially flat kerf bottom that generates less debris and reduces or eliminates damage to the substrate. In addition to an improved sidewall profile, beam shaping also reduces the width of the recast oxide layer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For convenience, the term cutting may be used generically to include scribing (cutting that does not penetrate the full depth of a target work piece) and throughcutting, which includes slicing (often associated with wafer row separation) or dicing (often associated with part singulation from wafer rows). Slicing and dicing may be used interchangeably in the context of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Reference is now made to the figures in which like reference numerals refer to like elements. For clarity, the first digit of a reference numeral indicates the figure number in which the corresponding element is first used. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided for a thorough understanding of the embodiments disclosed herein. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, or materials. Further, in some cases, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail in order to avoid obscuring aspects of the invention. Furthermore, the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> are side view schematics of an exemplary work piece <b>200</b> that is cut according to certain embodiments of the invention. The work piece <b>200</b> includes layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> formed over a substrate <b>208</b>. As an artisan will recognize, the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> may include interconnect layers separated by insulation layers, including low-k dielectrics, to form electronic circuitry. For example, the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> may include materials such as Cu, Al, SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN, fluorsilicated glass (FSG), organosilicated glass (OSG), SiOC, SiOCN, and other materials used in IC manufacture. For illustrative purposes, three layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>. However, an artisan will recognize that more layers or fewer layers can be used for particular ICs. As shown, the substrate <b>208</b> comprises Si. However, an artisan will also recognize that other materials useful in IC manufacture can be used for the substrate <b>208</b> including, for example, glasses, polymers, metals, composites, and other materials. For example, the substrate <b>208</b> may include FR4.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Electronic circuitry is formed in active device areas <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> that are separated from each other by scribing lanes or streets <b>214</b>. An artisan will recognize that test structures are often formed in and around the streets <b>214</b>. To create individual ICs, the work piece <b>200</b> is scribed, throughout, or both, along the streets <b>214</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a laser beam <b>216</b> according to one embodiment is shown scribing the work piece <b>200</b> by ablating the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> in the area of the street <b>214</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the result of the laser scribing process is a laser kerf <b>218</b> that passes from the top surface of the top layer <b>202</b> through the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> to the top surface of the substrate <b>208</b>. As discussed below, in certain embodiments, the laser beam <b>216</b> is shaped so as to increase the quality of the kerf's sidewall profile and reduce or prevent damage to the substrate <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The laser beam <b>216</b> comprises a series of laser pulses configured to provide the lowest possible fluence to the work piece <b>200</b> that still provides a desired material ablation of the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and/or the substrate <b>208</b>. In one embodiment, the fluence of the laser beam <b>216</b> is selected so as to be in a range between the ablation threshold of the work piece <b>200</b> and approximately ten times the ablation threshold of the work piece <b>200</b>. In another embodiment, the fluence of the laser beam <b>216</b> is selected so as to be in a range between the ablation threshold of the work piece <b>200</b> and approximately five times the ablation threshold of the work piece <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To lower the ablation threshold, according to one embodiment, the pulse width is set in a range between approximately 0.1 picosecond and approximately 1000 picoseconds. In other embodiments, the pulse width is set in a range between approximately 1 picosecond and approximately 10 picoseconds. In other embodiments, the pulse width is set in a range between 10 picoseconds and 40 picoseconds. However, an artisan will recognize from the disclosure herein that other pulse widths can be used. For example, in one embodiment, the pulse width is in a range between approximately 0.6 picosecond and approximately 190 picoseconds, while in another embodiment, the pulse width is in a range between approximately 210 picoseconds and 1000 picoseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the laser beam <b>216</b> is generated using an average power in a range between approximately 10 W and approximately 50 W and an energy per pulse between approximately 1 &#x3bc;J and approximately 100 &#x3bc;J. When the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> have a combined thickness in a range between approximately 8 &#x3bc;m and approximately 12 &#x3bc;m, the laser beam <b>216</b> is configured to cut through the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> at a rate in a range between approximately 200 mm/second and approximately 1000 mm/second using high pulse repetition frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In certain embodiments, the separation between pulses is in a range between approximately 1 nanosecond and approximately 10 nanoseconds to allow substantially complete heat dissipation. In other embodiments, the separation between pulses is in a range between approximately 10 nanoseconds and approximately 1 microseconds to allow the plume of ablated material in a first pulse to spread to a sufficiently low density so as to not significantly interact with a subsequent pulse. In certain such embodiments, the pulse repetition frequency is in a range between approximately 1 MHz and approximately 100 MHz. In other embodiments, the pulse repetition frequency is in a range between approximately 5.1 MHz and approximately 100 MHz. In another embodiment, the pulse repetition frequency is in a range between approximately 50 kHz and approximately 4 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At high pulse repetition frequencies (e.g., above approximately 1 MHz and, more particularly, above approximately 10 MHz), residual pulse energy may accumulate in the form of heat because deposited energy does not have sufficient time to dissipate between pulses. The cumulative effects generally increase ablation efficiency and may also increase melting. However, the melting is generally limited to the irradiated area and may be concentrated in the center of the kerf. Depending on the particular application, increased melting in the center of the kerf may increase or decrease the desired quality of the kerf.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an exemplary embodiment, the laser beam <b>216</b> is generated using a DUETTO&#x2122; laser available from Time-Bandwidth Products of Zurich, Switzerland. The DUETTO&#x2122; laser has a wavelength of approximately 1064 nm, a pulse repetition frequency in a range between approximately 50 kHz and approximately 4 MHz, an average power of approximately 10 W or more, a peak power of up to approximately 16 MW, an energy per pulse of up to approximately 200 &#x3bc;J, and a pulse width of up to approximately 12 picoseconds. Alternatively, in another exemplary embodiment, the laser beam <b>216</b> is generated using a RAPID&#x2122; picosecond laser available from Lumera-Laser GmbH of Kaiserslautern, Germany.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Harmonics of the 1064 nm laser can also be used to improve ablation for specific materials. For example, a wavelength of approximately 532 nm can be used to ablate Cu, a wavelength of approximately 355 nm can be used to ablate Si and certain low-k dielectrics, and a wavelength of approximately 266 nm can be used to ablate glass. In one embodiment, the wavelength is selected based at least in part on the respective materials and relative thicknesses of the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and/or the substrate <b>208</b> so as to increase cutting speed. For example, the wavelength may be optimized to ablate a thick Cu layer rather than a relatively thin dielectric layer. In an alternative embodiment, the wavelength may be changed between ablation of one or more of the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, and/or the substrate <b>208</b>. An artisan will also recognize that using the harmonics will also improve the ability to focus the laser beam because focusing is dependent on wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">To scribe the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, according to one embodiment, the fluence of each laser pulse is set at or above the highest ablation threshold in the stack of layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> for a given wavelength, pulse energy, and pulse duration. In one embodiment, the fluence of each laser pulse is set in a range between approximately one and ten times the highest ablation threshold in the stack. In another embodiment, the fluence of each laser pulse is set in a range between approximately one and five times the highest ablation threshold in the stack.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, it may be determined that the third layer <b>206</b> has a higher ablation threshold than the first and second layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. Thus, using short pulses in the picosecond range, setting the fluence of the laser pulses so as to ablate the third layer <b>206</b> also provides ablation of the first and second layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the fluence is set at approximately 1.5 times the highest ablation threshold in the stack. If, for example, the third layer <b>206</b> has an ablation threshold of approximately 10 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>at a pulse width of approximately 10 picoseconds, the laser beam <b>216</b> is configured to generate approximately 20 &#x3bc;J pulses with a spot size of approximately 10 &#x3bc;m to achieve a fluence in a range between approximately 15 &#x3bc;J/cm<sup>2 </sup>and approximately 20 &#x3bc;J/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An artisan will recognize that more layers or less layers may be ablated or partially ablated during the laser scribing process. For example, the laser beam <b>216</b> may be configured to ablate the top two layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> without ablating the third layer <b>206</b>. Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the laser beam <b>214</b> may be configured to cut through the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> and the substrate <b>208</b> to fully separate the active device areas <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> from one another (e.g., dicing). In certain embodiments, silicon substrates having a thickness in a range between approximately 10 &#x3bc;m and approximately 760 &#x3bc;m are throughout using a laser cutting process. Artisans will recognize from the disclosure herein that other substrate thicknesses can also be throughout according to the methods described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, in one embodiment, the work piece <b>200</b> is scribed to remove at least a portion of the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> in the street <b>214</b>. The work piece <b>200</b> can then be mechanically broken or mechanically sawed along the kerf path <b>218</b> to complete the dicing process. Thus, materials that may be damaged by the saw and/or that can damage the saw, such as low-k dielectrics or test structures, can be removed before sawing. In one embodiment, the saw follows the kerf <b>218</b> so as to not touch the layers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. Advantageously, cracking and debris are reduced, die break strength is increased and overall yield is improved.</p>

As discussed above, the layers <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> may include, for example, materials such as Cu, Al, SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN, fluorsilicated glass (FSG), organosilicated glass (OSG), SiOC, SiOCN, and other materials used in IC manufacture. The substrate <b>306</b> may include, for example, Si, FR4, glass, polymer, metal, composite material, and other materials used in IC manufacture.</p>

As shown, electronic circuitry is formed in active device areas <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> that are separated from each other by a street <b>312</b>. In this example, the work piece <b>300</b> is scribed such that laser kerfs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> are formed using laser parameters described herein on both sides of the street <b>312</b>. In one embodiment, the laser kerfs <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> are each in a range between approximately 5 &#x3bc;m and approximately 10 &#x3bc;m wide. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, in certain embodiments, the laser kerfs <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> extend into the substrate <b>306</b>. However, in other embodiments, the laser kerfs <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> remove material only in one or both of the layers <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The laser scribes <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> act as &#x201c;crack stops&#x201d; or physical barriers for heat and mechanical stress during further processing. Thus, the laser scribes <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> provide mechanical separation and thermal separation between the street <b>312</b> and the active device areas <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>. For example, after creating the laser scribe lines <b>314</b>, <b>316</b> using laser ablation techniques described herein, the street <b>312</b> can be mechanically sawed to dice the active device areas <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>. The harsh effects of sawing the street <b>312</b> do not propagate to the active device areas <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> such that cracking and chipping associated with mechanical sawing is reduced or eliminated in these areas.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As discussed above, in certain embodiments, the laser beam <b>216</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is shaped so as to increase the quality of the kerf's sidewall profile and reduce or prevent damage to the substrate <b>208</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> graphically illustrates the difference between a simplified Gaussian beam irradiance profile <b>402</b> and a simplified shaped beam irradiance profile <b>404</b>. The center of the Gaussian beam irradiance profile <b>402</b> is much larger than the vaporization threshold <b>406</b> and the melting threshold <b>408</b> as compared to the shaped beam irradiance profile <b>404</b>. Thus, the Gaussian beam puts a larger amount of excessive energy into the target material, especially at the center of the beam.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the slope of the Gaussian beam irradiance profile <b>402</b> between the melting threshold <b>408</b> and the vaporization threshold is less than that of the shaped beam irradiance profile <b>404</b>. Thus, the Gaussian beam will produce a wider recast oxide layer because a wider area of material will be melted but not vaporized. For example, the arrows <b>410</b> represent the width of the recast oxide layer produced by the Gaussian beam while the arrows <b>412</b> represent the width of the recast oxide layer produced by the shaped beam. Due to the rapid slope of the shaped beam irradiance profile <b>404</b> between the melting threshold <b>408</b> and the vaporization threshold <b>406</b>, the shaped beam produces a narrower recast oxide layer.</p>

Beam shaping components can be selected to produce pulses having an inverted irradiance profile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> that is clipped outside dashed lines <b>610</b> to facilitate ablation to further improve kerf taper. Artisans will appreciate that beam shaping components can be designed to supply a variety of other irradiance profiles that might be useful for specific applications.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an electron micrograph of a kerf <b>700</b> scribed through interconnect and low-k dielectric layers <b>702</b>. The kerf <b>700</b> is approximately 35 &#x3bc;m wide and was scribed using a laser having a wavelength of approximately 355 nm. As described herein, a short pulse width (e.g., in the picosecond range) and a rapid pulse rate frequency were used to achieve low fluence ablation at high speeds. The kerf <b>700</b> was scribed at a speed of over 500 mm/s with a &#x201c;top hat&#x201d; shaped beam. The beam shaping provides a kerf bottom that is substantially flat and sides that are substantially vertical and well defined. Further, there is substantially no chipping or cracking.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In certain embodiments disclosed herein, scribing can be accomplished using a single laser pass. However, in certain other embodiments, the amount of material removed per pulse is not sufficient to achieve the desired scribe depth in one laser pass. In certain such embodiments, each location in the scribe line is exposed with multiple pulses to achieve desired material removal. In one such embodiment, material is exposed with pulses overlapping in the direction of a cut.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> schematically illustrates sequentially exposing a work piece <b>800</b> to laser pulses in the direction of a cut. Each pulse ablates a certain spot size <b>802</b> to a pulse ablation depth. To achieve an overall ablation depth, sequential pulses have an overlap offset or bite size <b>804</b> in the direction of the cut. For example, a first pulse removes material in a first area <b>806</b>. Then, a second pulse shifted in the direction of the cut (e.g., to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) removes additional material from a second area <b>808</b> and a third area <b>808</b>&#x2032;. The width of the second area <b>808</b> and the third area <b>808</b>&#x2032; (when combined) is the same as the width of the first area <b>806</b> (e.g., the spot size <b>802</b>). The second area <b>808</b> is to the side of the first area <b>806</b> in the direction of the cut and has a width equal to the bite size <b>804</b>. The third area <b>808</b>&#x2032; is below a portion of the first area <b>806</b>. Thus, the overall ablation depth increases from the first pulse to the second pulse.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The scribing process continues as additional pulses are sequentially applied to the work piece <b>800</b> in the direction of the cut. The overall depth of the cut increases with each pulse until a desired depth <b>810</b> is reached. After the desired depth <b>810</b> is reached, additional pulses continue to remove material in the direction of the cut without increasing the overall depth past the desired depth <b>810</b>. For a given spot size <b>802</b>, the bite size <b>804</b> will define the desired depth <b>810</b>. The desired depth <b>810</b> is equal to the pulse ablation depth of a single pulse multiplied by the ratio of the spot size <b>802</b> to the bite size <b>804</b>. For the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the bite size <b>804</b> is approximately one-seventh the size of the spot size <b>802</b>. Thus, the desired depth <b>810</b> is seven times the pulse ablation depth of a single pulse (and is first reached after seven pulses).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, the cut speed is controlled by first selecting the pulse duration as discussed above to reduce the threshold of ablation. Advantageously, in certain embodiments, a pulse width is selected that provides substantially the lowest ablation threshold for the target material or materials. Then, the spot size is selected to provide the desired fluence for a selected energy per pulse. Based on the single pulse ablation depth, the bite size is then selected to provide the overall ablation depth. As discussed above, the pulse repetition frequency is then selected to increase cut speed. In certain embodiments, lower pulse repetition frequencies (e.g., approximately 70 kHz) are used with high pulse energies (e.g., approximately 50 &#x3bc;J to approximately 100 &#x3bc;J) to ablate at a low fluence and a high speed by changing the aspect ratio of the laser spot from symmetrical (e.g., circular) to asymmetrical (e.g., elliptical or rectangular) so as to distribute the energy of the pulses in the direction of the cut. Thus, rather than focusing the energy on a small circular spot, an elliptical or rectangular spot spreads the energy of each pulse to lower the fluence while removing material in the direction of the cut. A shaped rectangular beam, for example, may be configured such that the longer dimension of the rectangle is in the direction of the cut.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although the embodiments above have been described with respect to singulating semiconductor wafers, artisans will recognize other applications such as memory repair and laser micromachining. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an electron micrograph of a micromachined pattern <b>900</b> in a semiconductor material using the laser ablation methods described above. The exemplary pattern <b>900</b> includes trenches <b>902</b> approximately 51 &#x3bc;m wide cut in a precise pattern. The trenches <b>902</b> have substantially flat bottoms and well defined side walls. Further, the distance <b>904</b> between trenches is as small as approximately 25 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Artisans will recognize from the disclosure herein that other patterns and more precise cuts can also be achieved. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an electron micrograph of a micromachined pattern <b>1000</b> in a semiconductor material using the laser ablation methods described above. The exemplary pattern <b>1000</b> includes trenches <b>1002</b> approximately 50 &#x3bc;m wide that are separated in some locations <b>1004</b> by distances approximately 10 &#x3bc;m wide.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, it can be observed that there is substantially no chipping, cracking or contamination. In certain embodiments, some cleaning may be desired to remove small amounts of debris. For example, conventional high pressure water or solid CO<sub>2 </sub>&#x201c;sand blasting&#x201d; techniques can be used after laser ablation to remove particles or debris. However, the ablation processes discussed herein are generally cleaner than conventional laser or mechanical saw cutting techniques and require less cleaning than conventional processes or no cleaning at all. Thus, additional lateral separation between devices on a wafer is not required to accommodate the dicing process. Further, due to the low fluence used with short wavelengths, there are less problems with heat affected zones, cracking, peeling, and chipping. Thus, higher die break strengths and overall process yields are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It will be obvious to those having skill in the art that many changes may be made to the details of the above-described embodiments without departing from the underlying principles of the invention.
