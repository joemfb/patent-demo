<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">All organisms have developed exquisite metabolic pathways that maintain energy homeostasis by balancing their intake and metabolism of energy with their expenditure needs of the organism. In mammals, these pathways regulate food intake, glucose homeostasis, storage of energy in fat and/or muscle, and mobilization of energy by, for instance, physical activity. Malfunctioning of these pathways, often resulting from excess energy intake relative to energy expenditure, leads to imbalance in energy homeostasis and can lead to a wide range of metabolic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, high cholesterol, and hyperlipidemia.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The high incidence of metabolic disorders in humans and their related impact on health and mortality represents a significant threat to public health. For instance, obesity, clinically defined as a body mass index of over 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, is estimated to affect 35.7% of the U.S. adult population. Obesity increases the likelihood of many diseases, such as heart disease and type II diabetes, which is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide. In the U.S., obesity is estimated to cause roughly 110,000-365,000 deaths per year. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels or low glucose tolerance, and is estimated to affect 8% of the U.S. population. Diabetes is also significantly associated with higher risk of death from vascular disease, cancer, renal disease, infectious diseases, external causes, intentional self-harm, nervous system disorders, and chronic pulmonary disease (N Engl J Med 2011; 364:829-841). Metabolic syndrome, in which subjects present with central obesity and at least two other metabolic disorders (such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes), is estimated to affect 25% of the U.S. population.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sirtuins are highly conserved protein deacetylases and/or ADP-ribosyltransferases that have been shown to extend lifespan in lower model organisms, such as yeast, <i>C. elegans</i>, and <i>drosophila</i>. In mammals, sirtuins have been shown to act as metabolic sensors, responding to environmental signals to coordinate the activity of genes that regulate multiple energy homeostasis pathways. For example, studies have shown that sirtuin activation mimics the effects of caloric restriction, an intervention demonstrated to significantly extend lifespan, and activates genes that improve glucose homeostasis and the conversion of fat to energy by fatty acid oxidation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many efforts have been attempted to develop treatments for metabolic disorders by targeting specific energy metabolism pathways. These efforts have resulted in the development of, for example, isoflavones (U.S. Patent Application No. 20110165125), tetrahydrolipstatin (U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,996), and compositions that modulate the SIRT1 and AMPK pathways (U.S. Patent Application Nos. 20100210692, 20100009992, 20070244202 and 20080176822). However, these efforts are of limited success. For instance, use of the SIRT1 activator resveratrol in humans is hampered by its limited bioavailability, necessitating high dosages which have raised safety concerns.

Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention. The concentration of various components in the disclosed compositions are exemplary and not meant to be limited to the recited concentration per se.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">As used herein, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; or &#x201c;individual&#x201d; includes mammals. Non-limiting examples of mammals include humans and mice, including transgenic and non-transgenic mice. The methods described herein can be useful in both human therapeutics, pre-clinical, and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the subject is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the subject is human. Other mammals include, and are not limited to, apes, chimpanzees, orangutans, monkeys; domesticated animals (pets) such as dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, rats, rabbits, and ferrets; domesticated farm animals such as cows, buffalo, bison, horses, donkey, swine, sheep, and goats; or exotic animals typically found in zoos, such as bear, lions, tigers, panthers, elephants, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, giraffes, antelopes, sloth, gazelles, zebras, wildebeests, prairie dogs, koala bears, kangaroo, pandas, giant pandas, hyena, seals, sea lions, and elephant seals.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The terms &#x201c;administer&#x201d;, &#x201c;administered&#x201d;, &#x201c;administers&#x201d; and &#x201c;administering&#x201d; are defined as the providing a composition to a subject via a route known in the art, including but not limited to intravenous, intraarterial, oral, parenteral, buccal, topical, transdermal, rectal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraosseous, transmucosal, or intraperitoneal routes of administration. In certain embodiments of the subject application, oral routes of administering a composition may be preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">As used herein, &#x201c;agent&#x201d; or &#x201c;biologically active agent&#x201d; refers to a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical compound or other moiety. Non-limiting examples include simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule, a peptide, a protein, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA), an oligonucleotide (including e.g., aptomer and polynucleotides), an antibody, an antibody derivative, antibody fragment, a vitamin derivative, a carbohydrate, a toxin, or a chemotherapeutic compound. Various compounds can be synthesized, for example, small molecules and oligomers (e.g., oligopeptides and oligonucleotides), and synthetic organic compounds based on various core structures. In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; refers to that amount of a compound described herein that is sufficient to effect the intended application including but not limited to disease treatment, as defined below. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g., reduction of proliferation or down regulation of activity of a target protein. The specific dose will vary depending on the particular compounds chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">A &#x201c;modulator&#x201d; of a pathway refers to a substance or agent which modulates the activity of one or more cellular proteins mapped to the same specific signal transduction pathway. A modulator may augment or suppress the activity and/or expression level or pattern of a signaling molecule. A modulator can activate a component in a pathway by directly binding to the component. A modulator can also indirectly activate a component in a pathway by interacting with one or more associated components. The output of the pathway can be measured in terms of the expression or activity level of proteins. The expression level of a protein in a pathway can be reflected by levels of corresponding mRNA or related transcription factors as well as the level of the protein in a subcellular location. For instance, certain proteins are activated by translocating in or out of a specific subcellular component, including but not limited to nucleus, mitochondria, endosome, lysosome or other membranous structure of a cell. The output of the pathway can also be measured in terms of physiological effects, such as mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, or glucose uptake.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">An &#x201c;activator&#x201d; refers to a modulator that influences a pathway in a manner that increases the pathway output. Activation of a particular target may be direct (e.g. by interaction with the target) or indirect (e.g. by interaction with a protein upstream of the target in a signaling pathway including the target).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">A &#x201c;suppressor&#x201d; can be a modulator that influences a pathway in a manner that decreases pathway output.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The term &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to compositions that have less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about 1%, less than about 0.5%, less than 0.1% or even less of a specified component. For example a composition that is substantially free of non-branched chain amino acids may have less than about 1% of the non-branched chain amino acid lysine.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">A &#x201c;sub-therapeutic amount&#x201d; of an agent, an activator or a therapy is an amount less than the effective amount for that agent, activator or therapy, but when combined with an effective or sub-therapeutic amount of another agent or therapy can produce a desired result, due to, for example, synergy in the resulting efficacious effects, and/or reduced side effects.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">A &#x201c;synergistic&#x201d; or &#x201c;synergizing&#x201d; effect can be such that the one or more effects of the combination compositions are greater than the one or more effects of each component alone, or they can be greater than the sum of the one or more effects of each component alone. The synergistic effect can be about, or greater than about 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 110, 120, 150, 200, 250, 350, or 500% or even more than the effect on a subject with one of the components alone, or the additive effects of each of the components when administered individually. The effect can be any of the measurable effects described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Compositions</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The invention provides for compositions that can increase or modulate the output of a sirtuin pathway. The sirtuin pathway includes, without limitation, signaling molecules such as, Sirt1, Sirt3, and AMPK. The output of the pathway can be determined by the expression level and/or the activity of the pathway and/or a physiological effect. In some embodiments, activation of the Sirt1 pathway includes stimulation of PGC1-&#x3b1; and/or subsequent stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. In general, a sirtuin pathway activator is compound that activates or increases one or more components of a sirtuin pathway. An increase or activation of a sirtuin pathway can be observed by an increase in the activity of a pathway component protein. For example, the protein can be Sirt1, PGC1-&#x3b1;, AMPK, Epac1, Adenylyl cyclase, Sirt3, or any other proteins and their respective associated proteins along the signaling pathway depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (Park et. al., &#x201c;Resveratrol Ameliorates Aging-Related Metabolic Phenotypes by Inhibiting cAMP Phosphodiesterases,&#x201d; Cell 148, 421-433 Feb. 3, 2012). Non-limiting examples of physiological effects that can serve as measures of sirtuin pathway output include mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, palmitate uptake, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, weight loss, heat production, visceral adipose tissue loss, respiratory exchanger ratio, insulin sensitivity, inflammation marker level, vasodilation, browing of fat cells, and irisin production. Examples of indicia of browning of fat cells include, without limitation, increased fatty acid oxidation, and expression of one or more brown-fat-selective genes (e.g. Ucp1, Cidea, Prdm16, and Ndufs1). In some embodiments, changes in one or more physiological effects that can serve as measures of sirtuin pathway output are induced by increasing irisin production, such as by administering a composition of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">An increase in mitochondrial biogenesis can be evidenced by an increase in the formation of new mitochondria and/or by an increase in mitochondrial functions, such as increased fatty acid oxidation, increased heat generation, increased insulin sensitivity, increased in glucose uptake, increased in vasodilation, decreased in weight, decreased in adipose volume, and decreased inflammatory response or markers in a subject.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The compositions can be combination compositions which may include one or more synergistic components. In some embodiments, the synergistic effect of the combination compositions can allow for reduced dosing amounts, leading to reduced side effects to the subject and reduced cost of treatment. In other embodiments, the synergistic effect can allow for results that are not achievable through any other conventional treatments. The subject combination compositions provide a significant improvement in the regulation of energy metabolism.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In some embodiments, the compositions can be combination compositions of one or more branched chain amino acids and/or metabolites thereof and a sirtuin-pathway activator can have one or more characteristics. The combination compositions (a) can have a synergistic effect in increasing the sirtuin-pathway output, (b) increase sirtuin-pathway output by at least about 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, or 20 fold, (c) have a molar ratio of branched chain amino acids and/or metabolites thereof to sirtuin-pathway output that is greater than about 20, (d) be formulated as a unit dosage for oral ingestion, where the sirtuin-pathway activator is a substantially homogeneous population of polyphenol molecules, and (e) can have a synergistic effect and further comprise a food carrier. Any of the compositions described herein can have one or more of these characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In some embodiments, the present invention provides a composition comprising (a) one or more types of branched amino acids and/or metabolites thereof and (b) a sirtuin-pathway activator present in a sub-therapeutic amount, wherein the composition is synergistically effective in increasing the sirtuin-pathway output by at least about 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 500 or more fold as compared to that of component (b) when it being used alone.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In some embodiments, the sirtuin-pathway activator or AMPK pathway activator can be a polyphenol. For example, the polyphenol can be chlorogenic acid, resveratrol, caffeic acid, piceatannol, ellagic acid, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), grape seed extract, or any analog thereof. In some embodiments, the activator can be resveratrol, an analog thereof, or a metabolite thereof. For example, the activator can be pterostilbene or a small molecule analog of resveratrol. Examples of small molecule analogs of resveratrol are described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 20070014833, 20090163476, and 20090105246, which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The polyphenol can be a substantially homogeneous population of polyphenols. The polyphenol can be one type of polyphenol, wherein the composition can exclude all other types of polyphenols. In other embodiments, the composition can comprise two, three, or four types of polyphenols, and exclude all other types of polyphenols. In some embodiments, the composition can comprise 1, 2, 3, or 4 types of polyphenols and less than 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 2% of any other types of polyphenols. In some embodiments, a composition further comprises a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, and/or other sirtuin pathway activator.</p>

<p id="p-0316" num="0512">In some embodiments, the sirtuin pathway activator modulates the activity of phosphodiesterase (PDE). In some embodiments, the sirtuin pathway activator is a PDE inhibitor, such as a non-specific PDE inhibitor. PDE inhibitors can be naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring (e.g. manufactured), and may be provided in the form of a natural source comprising the PDE inhibitor, or an extract thereof (e.g. purified). Examples of non-specific PDE inhibitors include, but are not limited to, caffeine, theophylline, theobromine, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), pentoxifylline (3,7-dihydro-3,7-dimethyl-1-(5oxohexyl)-1H-purine-2,6-dione), aminophylline, paraxanthine, and salts, derivatives, metabolites, catabolites, anabolites, precursors, and analogs thereof. Non-limiting examples of natural sources of PDE inhibitors include coffee, tea, guarana, yerba mate, cocoa, and chocolate (e.g. dark chocolate).</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0513">In some embodiments, a PDE inhibitor is administered in place of or in addition to resveratrol or other sirtuin pathway activator. In some embodiments, compositions comprising one or more components described herein comprise a PDE inhibitor in place of or in addition to resveratrol or other sirtuin pathway activator. Typically, a PDE inhibitor is provided in an amount that is synergistic with one or more other components of a composition or method of treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0514">Branched Chain Amino Acids</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0515">The invention provides for compositions that include branched chain amino acids. Branched chain amino acids can have aliphatic side chains with a branch carbon atom that is bound to two or more other atoms. The other atoms may be carbon atoms. Examples of branched chain amino acids include leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Branched chain amino acids may also include other compounds, such as 4-hydroxyisoleucine. In some embodiments, the compositions may be substantially free of one or more, or all of non-branched chain amino acids. For example, the compositions can be free of alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, and/or tyrosine. In some embodiments, the compositions may be substantially free of isoleucine and/or valine.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0516">Without being limited to theory, ingestion of branched chain amino acids, such as leucine, can stimulate tissue protein synthesis via both mTOR-dependent and -independent pathways, as well as to exert an antiproteolytic effect. These effects predominate in muscle, but also can manifest in other tissues, including adipose tissue. Given the energetic cost of protein synthesis and turnover, leucine may increase fatty acid oxidation and net energy utilization and attenuate adiposity. Indeed, leucine has been reported to exert a thermogenic effect and to augment weight and adipose tissue loss during energy restriction. Also, leucine and leucine-rich diets can favorably modulate inflammatory cytokine patterns in adipocytes and mice.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0517">In some embodiments, any of the compositions described herein can include salts, derivatives, metabolites, catabolites, anabolites, precursors, and analogs of any of the branched chain amino acids. For example, the metabolites of branched chain amino acids can include hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB), &#x3b1;-hydroxyisocaproic acid, and keto-isocaproic acid (KIC), keto isovalerate, and keto isocaproate. Non-limiting exemplary anabolites of branched chain amino acids can include glutamate, glutamine, threonine, &#x3b1;-ketobytyrate, &#x3b1;-aceto-&#x3b1;-hydroxy butyrate, &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-dihydroxy-&#x3b2;-methylvalerate, &#x3b1;-keto-&#x3b2;-methylvalerate, &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-dihydroxy isovalerate, and &#x3b1;-keto isovalerate.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0518">In certain embodiments of the invention, any of the compositions disclosed herein can be formulated such that they do not contain (or exclude) one or more amino acids selected from the group consisting of lysine, glutamate, proline, arginine, valine, isoleucine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glycine, threonine, serine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, alanine, tryptophan, methionine, glutamine, taurine, carnitine, cystine and cysteine. The compositions can be substantially free of any non-branched chain amino acids. The mass or molar amount of a non-branched chain amino acid can be less than 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, or 5% of the total composition.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0519">Vitamin B6</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0520">Without being limited to any particular theory or mode of action, elevations in the active B6 metabolite (pyridoxal phosphate) can reduce the tone and activity of the adipocyte calcium channel. Intracellular free Ca2+ is a primary regulator of adipocyte fatty acid synthase expression and activity, which can result in a suppression of both the expression and activity of fatty acid synthase, which in turn is one of the rate limiting steps in neutral lipid synthesis in adipocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0521">As used herein, vitamin B6 includes its different forms, including pyridoxine, pyridoxine 5&#x2032;-phosphate, pyridoxal, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal 5&#x2032;-phosphate, pyridoxamine, pyridoxamine 5&#x2032;-phosphate. In other embodiments, vitamin B6 can also include 4-pyridoxic acid, which is a catabolite of the above forms of vitamin B6 that is excreted. The compositions described herein can include any one or more of these forms of vitamin B6.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0522">The active form of vitamin B6 in the body is pyridoxal 5-phosphate, which is a coenzyme for all transamination and some decarboxylation and deamination reactions. Furthermore, pyridoxal 5-phosphate is required as a coenzyme for all transamination reactions which occur in the body (Peterson D L, Martinez-Carrion M. The mechanism of transamination. Function of the histidyl residue at the active site of supernatant aspartate transaminase. J Biol. Chem. 1970 Feb. 25; 245(4):806-13).</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0523">In some embodiments, any of the compositions described herein can include salts, derivatives, metabolites, catabolites, anabolites, precursors, and analogs of any of the forms of vitamin B6. Exemplary catabolites of vitamin B6 include 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-5-formylpyridine-4-carboxylate and 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5,-dicarboxylate. Exemplary analogs of vitamin B6 are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,230,009, and 6,369,042. Exemplary precursors of vitamin B6 are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,495,101.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0524">Pharmaceutically Active Agents</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0525">The combination compositions can further include one or more pharmaceutically active agents. Examples of therapeutically active agents include ibuprofen, aldoril, and gemfebrozil, verapamil, maxzide, diclofenac and metrolol, maproltiline, triazolam and minoxidil. For example, the combination compositions can comprise a pharmaceutically active anti-diabetic agent, weight loss agent, or calcium regulation agent. U.S. Pat. No. 7,109,198 and U.S. Patent Application No. 20090142336 describe a variety of pharmaceutically active agents or therapeutically active agents suitable for inclusion in a combination composition described herein. Examples of anti-diabetic agents include biguanides (such as metformin), thiazoladinediones and meglitinides (such as repaglinide, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone), alpha glucosidease inhibitors (such as acarbose), sulfonylureas (such as tolbutamide, acetohexamide, tolazamide, chlorpropamide, glipizide, glyburide, glimepiride, gliclazide), incretins, ergot alkaloids (such as bromocriptine), and DPP inhibitors (such as sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, lingliptin, dutogliptin, gemigliptin, alogliptin, and berberine). The anti-diabetic agent can be an oral anti-diabetic agent. The anti-diabetic agent can also be injectable anti-diabetic drugs, including insulin, amylin analogues (such as pramlintide), and inretin mimetics (such as exenatide and liraglutide). Examples of anti-obesity therapeutic agents include lipase inhibitors (such as Orlistat), dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotoninergic compounds, cannabinoid receptor antagonists (such as rimonabant), exenatide, pramlintide, and CNS agents (such as topimerate). These examples are provided for discussion purposes only, and are intended to demonstrate the broad scope of applicability of the invention to a wide variety of drugs. It is not meant to limit the scope of the invention in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0526">In some embodiments, one or more components described herein, such as resveratrol, leucine, HMB, and KIC can be combined with two or more pharmaceutically active agents. For example, a sirtuin pathway activator can be combined with glipizide and metformin, glyburide and metformin, pioglitazone and glimepiride, pioglitazone and metformin, repaglinide and metformin, rosiglitazone and glimepiride, rosiglitazone and metformin, or sitagliptin and metformin.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0527">The amount of pharmaceutical agent, or any other component used in a combination composition described herein, can be a used in an amount that is sub-therapeutic. In some embodiments, using sub-therapeutic amounts of an agent or component can reduce the side-effects of the agent. Use of sub-therapeutic amounts can still be effective, particularly when used in synergy with other agents or components.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0528">A sub-therapeutic amount of the agent or component can be such that it is an amount below which would be considered therapeutic. For example, FDA guidelines can suggest a specified level of dosing to treat a particular condition, and a sub-therapeutic amount would be any level that is below the FDA suggested dosing level. The sub-therapeutic amount can be about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 50, 75, 90, or 95% less than the amount that is considered to be a therapeutic amount. The therapeutic amount can be assessed for individual subjects, or for groups of subjects. The group of subjects can be all potential subjects, or subjects having a particular characteristic such as age, weight, race, gender, or physical activity level.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0529">In the case of metformin hydrochloride, the physician suggested starting dose is 1000 mg daily, with subject specific dosing having a range of 500 mg to a maximum of 2500 mg daily (metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets label www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/021574s0101bl.pdf). The particular dosing for a subject can be determined by a clinician by titrating the dose and measuring the therapeutic response. The therapeutic dosing level can be determined by measuring fasting plasma glucose levels and measuring glycosylated hemoglobin. A sub-therapeutic amount can be any level that would be below the recommended dosing of metformin. For example, if a subject's therapeutic dosing level is determined to be 700 mg daily, a dose of 600 mg would be a sub-therapeutic amount. Alternatively, a sub-therapeutic amount can be determined relative to a group of subjects rather than an individual subject. For example, if the average therapeutic amount of metformin for subjects with weights over 300 lbs is 2000 mg, then a sub-therapeutic amount can be any amount below 2000 mg. In some embodiments, the dosing can be recommended by a healthcare provider including, but not limited to a patient's physician, nurse, nutritionist, pharmacist, or other health care professional. A health care professional may include a person or entity that is associated with the health care system. Examples of health care professionals may include surgeons, dentists, audiologists, speech pathologists, physicians (including general practitioners and specialists), physician assistants, nurses, midwives, pharmaconomists/pharmacists, dietitians, therapists, psychologists, physical therapists, phlebotomists, occupational therapists, optometrists, chiropractors, clinical officers, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, medical laboratory technicians, radiographers, medical prosthetic technicians social workers, and a wide variety of other human resources trained to provide some type of health care service.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0530">Dosing Amounts</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0531">In some embodiments, a composition comprises an amount of a sirtuin pathway activator, such as a polyphenol (e.g. resveratrol). The amount of sirtuin pathway activator may be a subtheratpeutic amount, and/or an amount that is synergistic with one or more other compounds in the composition or one or more other compounds administered simultaneously or in close temporal proximity with the composition.

<p id="p-0349" num="0545">In some embodiments, the molar or mass ratios are circulating molar or mass ratios achieved after administration one or more compositions to a subject. The compositions can be a combination composition described herein. The molar ratio of a combination composition in a dosing form can be adjusted to achieve a desired circulating molar ratio. The molar ratio can be adjusted to account for the bioavailiability, the uptake, and the metabolic processing of the one or more components of a combination composition. For example, if the bioavailiability of a component is low, then the molar amount of a that component can be increased relative to other components in the combination composition. In some embodiments, the circulating molar or mass ratio is achieved within about 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 3, 5, or 10, 12, 24, or 48 hours after administration. The circulating molar or mass ratio can be maintained for a time period of about or greater than about 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, or 96 hours.</p>

<p id="p-0365" num="0561">Dosing Forms</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0562">The compositions described herein can be compounded into a variety of different dosage forms. It can be used orally as a tablet, chewable tablet, caplets, capsule, soft gelatin capsules, lozenges or solution. It can also be used as a nasal spray or for injection when in its solution form. In some embodiments, the composition may be a liquid composition suitable for oral consumption. Compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion, including liquid dosage forms (e.g., a suspension or slurry), and oral solid dosage forms (e.g., a tablet or bulk powder). Oral dosage forms may be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, emulsions, lipophilic and hydrophilic suspensions, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by an individual or a patient to be treated. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of formulation. For example, the active ingredients can be brought into association with a carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. Capsules suitable for oral administration include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. Optionally, the inventive composition for oral use can be obtained by mixing a composition a solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0563">The liquid forms, in which the formulations disclosed herein may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection, include aqueous solution, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic natural gums, such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0564">A subject can be treated by combination of an injectable composition and an orally ingested composition.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0565">Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicles before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid); and artificial or natural colors and/or sweeteners.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0566">The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is conducted in accordance with generally accepted procedures for the preparation of pharmaceutical preparations. See, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th Edition (1990), E. W. Martin ed., Mack Publishing Co., PA. Depending on the intended use and mode of administration, it may be desirable to process the magnesium-counter ion compound further in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. Appropriate processing may include mixing with appropriate non-toxic and non-interfering components, sterilizing, dividing into dose units, and, enclosing in a delivery device.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0567">This invention further encompasses anhydrous compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water may be added (e.g., 5%) in the arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected. An anhydrous composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0568">An ingredient described herein can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0569">Some examples of materials which may serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; and (21) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0570">Binders suitable for use in dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0571">Lubricants which can be used to form compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0572">Lubricants can be also be used in conjunction with tissue barriers which include, but are not limited to, polysaccharides, polyglycans, seprafilm, interceed and hyaluronic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0573">Disintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0574">Examples of suitable fillers for use in the compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0575">When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0576">The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0577">In one embodiment, the composition may include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and/or dissolution of the compound of the present invention and to minimize precipitation of the compound of the present invention. This can be especially important for compositions for non-oral use, e.g., compositions for injection. A solubilizer may also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and/or other components, such as surfactants, or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0578">The composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include, without limitation, detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, buffering agents, polymers, antioxidants, preservatives, chelating agents, viscomodulators, tonicifiers, flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof. A non-exhaustive list of examples of excipients includes monoglycerides, magnesium stearate, modified food starch, gelatin, microcrystalline cellulose, glycerin, stearic acid, silica, yellow beeswax, lecithin, hydroxypropylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and crospovidone.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0579">The compositions described herein can also be formulated as extended-release, sustained-release or time-release such that one or more components are released over time. Delayed release can be achieved by formulating the one or more components in a matrix of a variety of materials or by microencapsulation. The compositions can be formulated to release one or more components over a time period of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 hours. The release of the one or more components can be at a constant or changing rate.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0580">Using the controlled release dosage forms provided herein, the one or more cofactors can be released in its dosage form at a slower rate than observed for an immediate release formulation of the same quantity of components. In some embodiments, the rate of change in the biological sample measured as the change in concentration over a defined time period from administration to maximum concentration for an controlled release formulation is less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% of the rate of the immediate release formulation. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the rate of change in concentration over time is less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% of the rate for the immediate release formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0581">In some embodiments, the rate of change of concentration over time is reduced by increasing the time to maximum concentration in a relatively proportional manner. For example, a two-fold increase in the time to maximum concentration may reduce the rate of change in concentration by approximately a factor of 2. As a result, the one or more cofactors may be provided so that it reaches its maximum concentration at a rate that is significantly reduced over an immediate release dosage form. The compositions of the present invention may be formulated to provide a shift in maximum concentration by 24 hours, 16 hours, 8 hours, 4 hours, 2 hours, or at least 1 hour. The associated reduction in rate of change in concentration may be by a factor of about 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.5 or at least 0.8. In certain embodiments, this is accomplished by releasing less than about 30%, 50%, 75%, 90%, or 95% of the one or more cofactors into the circulation within one hour of such administration.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0582">Optionally, the controlled release formulations exhibit plasma concentration curves having initial (e.g., from 2 hours after administration to 4 hours after administration) slopes less than 75%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20% or 10% of those for an immediate release formulation of the same dosage of the same cofactor.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0583">In some embodiments, the rate of release of the cofactor as measured in dissolution studies is less than about 80%, 70%, 60% 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% of the rate for an immediate release formulation of the same cofactor over the first 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0584">The controlled release formulations provided herein can adopt a variety of formats. In some embodiments, the formulation is in an oral dosage form, including liquid dosage forms (e.g., a suspension or slurry), and oral solid dosage forms (e.g., a tablet or bulk powder), such as, but not limited to those, those described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0585">The controlled release tablet of a formulation disclosed herein can be of a matrix, reservoir or osmotic system. Although any of the three systems is suitable, the latter two systems can have more optimal capacity for encapsulating a relatively large mass, such as for the inclusion of a large amount of a single cofactor, or for inclusion of a plurality of cofactors, depending on the genetic makeup of the individual. In some embodiments, the slow-release tablet is based on a reservoir system, wherein the core containing the one or more cofactors is encapsulated by a porous membrane coating which, upon hydration, permits the one or more cofactors to diffuse through. Because the combined mass of the effective ingredients is generally in gram quantity, an efficient delivery system can provide optimal results.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0586">Thus, tablets or pills can also be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate. In some embodiments, a formulation comprising a plurality of cofactors may have different cofactors released at different rates or at different times. For example, there can be additional layers of cofactors interspersed with eneteric layers.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0587">Methods of making sustained release tablets are known in the art, e.g., see U.S. Patent Publications 2006/051416 and 2007/0065512, or other references disclosed herein. Methods such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,606,909, 4,769,027, 4,897,268, and 5,395,626 can be used to prepare sustained release formulations of the one or more cofactors determined by the genetic makeup of an individual. In some embodiments, the formulation is prepared using OROS&#xae; technology, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,919,373, 6,923,800, 6,929,803, and 6,939,556.

<p id="p-0392" num="0588">In some embodiments, the compositions can be formulated in a food composition. For example, the compositions can be a beverage or other liquids, solid food, semi-solid food, with or without a food carrier. For example, the compositions can include a black tea supplemented with any of the compositions described herein. The composition can be a dairy product supplemented any of the compositions described herein. In some embodiments, the compositions can be formulated in a food composition. For example, the compositions can comprise a beverage, solid food, semi-solid food, or a food carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0589">In some embodiments, liquid food carriers, such as in the form of beverages, such as supplemented juices, coffees, teas, sodas, flavored waters, and the like can be used. For example, the beverage can comprise the formulation as well as a liquid component, such as various deodorant or natural carbohydrates present in conventional beverages. Examples of natural carbohydrates include, but are not limited to, monosaccharides such as, glucose and fructose; disaccharides such as maltose and sucrose; conventional sugars, such as dextrin and cyclodextrin; and sugar alcohols, such as xylitol and erythritol. Natural deodorant such as taumatin, stevia extract, levaudioside A, glycyrrhizin, and synthetic deodorant such as saccharin and aspartame may also be used. Agents such as flavoring agents, coloring agents, and others can also be used. For example, pectic acid and the salt thereof, alginic acid and the salt thereof, organic acid, protective colloidal adhesive, pH controlling agent, stabilizer, a preservative, glycerin, alcohol, or carbonizing agents can also be used.

<p id="p-0398" num="0594">The subject application provides methods of increasing sirtuin pathway output (including AMPK, a signaling molecule in the sirtuin pathway) in a subject. As described herein, the output of the sirtuin pathway can be characterized at the molecular level or by a resulting physiological effect. In some embodiments, the invention provides for methods of increasing fatty acid oxidation in a subject comprising the administration of a composition as disclosed herein to the subject. In various embodiments of the invention, a composition is administered to the subject in an amount that delivers synergizing amounts of one or more branched amino acids and a polyphenol sufficient to increase fatty acid oxidation within the cells of the subject.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0595">The methods described herein can be useful for a variety of applications. These applications include (a) an increase in sirtuin-pathway output, (b) an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, (c) an increase in the formation of new mitochondria, (d) an increase in mitochondrial functions, (e) an increase in fatty acid oxidation, (f) an increase in heat generation, (g) an increase in insulin sensitivity, (h) an increase in glucose uptake, (i) an increase in vasodilation, (j) a decrease in weight, (k) a decrease in adipose volume, (l) a decrease in inflammatory response or markers in a subject, and (m) an increase in irisin production. Any of these applications can be achieved by administering one or more compositions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0596">Accordingly, the invention provides a method for administering a composition comprising (a) one or more types of branched amino acids and/or metabolites thereof and (b) a sirtuin-pathway activator present in a sub-therapeutic amount, wherein the composition is synergistically effective in increasing the sirtuin-pathway output by at least about 5 fold as compared to that of component (b) when it is being used alone.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0597">The output of the pathways can be measured using one or more methods, disclosed herein and/or known in the art. For example, fatty acid oxidation can be determined by measuring oxygen consumption, or <sup>3</sup>H-labeled palmitate oxidation. Mitochondrial biogenesis can be measured using a mitochondrial probe by using fluorescence. AMPK activity can be determined by measuring AMPK phosphorylation via an ELISA assay or by Western blot.

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Effects of Leucine, KIC and HMB alone, or in Combination with Resveratrol on Mitochondrial Biogenesis</heading>
<p id="p-0444" num="0640">The experiment shows that Leucine stimulates muscle protein synthesis via a partially mTOR-independent mechanism. We have shown that catabolic systems are also stimulated to fuel this process, resulting in increased mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). To address the mechanism of this effect, we first determined its mTOR-dependence by assessing leucine stimulation of FAO in the presence and absence of 20 nM rapamycin; although rapamycin inhibited FAO in c2c12 myotubes, the degree of leucine stimulation was preserved (&#x2dc;50%, p&#x3c;0.03; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0641">We next investigated the role of intact leucine (0-0.5 mM) vs. its metabolites, &#x3b1;-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) (0-0.5 mM) and HMB (0-50 &#x3bc;M). All three compounds induced comparable increases in FAO (&#x2dc;60-70%, p&#x3c;0.001; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Both leucine and HMB increased myotube mitochondrial biogenesis (assessed fluorometrically via NAO binding) by &#x2dc;50%, (p&#x3c;0.005, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Consistent with this, HMB and leucine both stimulated expression of mitochondrial regulatory (PGC-1&#x3b1; and NRF-1) and component (UCP3) genes (p&#x3c;0.01, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). These data demonstrate that leucine stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation independently of mTOR and that these effects appear to be mediated by its metabolite, e.g., HMB.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Stimulation of SIRT1 and SIRT 3</heading>
<p id="p-0446" num="0642">The effects of leucine, KIC and HMB on activation of SIRT1 were assessed in the presence and absence of resveratrol in a cell-free system. SIRT1 activity was measured by using the SIRT1 Fluorimetric Drug Discovery Kit (BML-AK555, ENZO Life Sciences International, Inc. PA, USA). In this assay, SIRT1 activity is assessed by the degree of deacetylation of a standardized substrate containing an acetylated lysine side chain. The substrate utilized is a peptide containing amino acids 379-382 of human p53 (Arg-His-Lys-Lys[Ac]), an established target of SIRT1 activity; SIRT1 activity is directly proportional to the degree of deacetylation of Lys-382. Samples were incubated with peptide substrate (25 &#x3bc;M), and NAD<sup>+</sup> (500 &#x3bc;M) in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37&#xb0; C. on a horizontal shaker for 45 minutes. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2 mM nicotinamide and a developing solution that binds to the deacetylated lysine to form a fluorophore. Following 10 minutes incubation at 37&#xb0; C., fluorescence was read in a plate-reading fluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. Resveratrol (100 mM) served as a SIRT1 activator (positive control) and suramin sodium (25 mM) as a SIRT1 inhibitor (negative control). A standard curve was constructed using deacetylated substrate (0-10 &#x3bc;M). Leucine, KIC and HMB all significantly increased SIRT1 activity in a dose-responsive manner, while valine (a branched chain amino acid control) exerted no significant effect. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> demonstrates the effects of leucine and its' metabolites on SIRT1 activity at the physiological concentrations of each compound found after a leucine-rich meal. As shown in the figure, these effects are quantitatively comparable (and not significantly different from) to those exerted by a low dose of resveratrol (e.g. 10 &#x3bc;M).</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0643">For assaying SIRT3 activity, adipocytes (3T3-L1) were grown to confluence, differentiated and incubated with leucine (0.5 mM), HMB (5 uM), resveratrol (200 nM), HMB (5 uM)+resveratrol (200 nM) or vehicle for 4 hours. Mitochondrial protein was then isolated from the cells, and Sirt3 activity was assessed by fluorometric measurement of deacetylation of a Sirt3 substrate, similar to the methodology described above for Sirt1. The Sirt3 substrate was a peptide containing amino acids 317-320 of human p53 (Gln-Pro--Lys-Lys[Ac]). Resveratrol, leucine and HMB exerted no significant independent effect on Sirt3 activity. However, combining resveratrol (200 nM) with HMB (5 uM) resulted in a 58% increase in Sirt3 activity (p&#x3c;0.03, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>

In the presence of low glucose, only the combination treatments (200 nM resveratrol+5 uM HMB; 200 nM resveratrol+0.5 mM leucine) stimulated modest increases in fatty acid oxidation (18%, p&#x3c;0.05), while the individual components exerted no independent effect (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). High glucose medium reduced fatty acid oxidation by 46% (p&#x3c;0.05). The low dose of resveratrol used exerted no effect on fatty acid oxidation under high glucose conditions, while the leucine and HMB exerted modest, but significant, effects (27% and 29%, respectively, p&#x3c;0.05 vs. control, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In contrast, the leucine-resveratrol and HMB-resveratrol combinations each exerted a markedly greater effect (118% and 91% stimulation, respectively; p&#x3c;0.005 vs. control and vs. the independent effects of leucine, HMB and resveratrol; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). These data demonstrate synergy between resveratrol and leucine or its metabolite, HMB, in stimulation of fat oxidation and promotion of a more oxidative phenotype under conditions that model hyperglycemia.</p>

However, the combination of a low dose of resveratrol with either HMB or leucine resulted in significant, marked decreases in plasma insulin. This reduction in insulin with no change in plasma glucose reflects significant improvements in muscle and whole-body insulin sensitivity, as demonstrated by significant and substantial decreases in NOMA<sub>IR </sub>(homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance) and corresponding increases in skeletal muscle <sup>18</sup>F-deoxyglucose uptake (table 2 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0463" num="0667"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the effects of dietary treatments on adipose tissue Sirt1 activity. Neither resveratrol nor HMB exerted significant independent effects on Sirt1 activity, although high dose resveratrol exhibited a non-significant trend towards an increase. In contrast, combining a low dose of resveratrol with either HMB or leucine resulted in &#x2dc;two-fold increases in tissue Sirt1 activity. Such sirtuin activation would be anticipated to reduce inflammatory response. Consistent with this concept, the high dose of resveratrol significantly reduced circulating IL-6, while the combination of a low dose of resveratrol (which exerted no independent effect) with HMB resulted in a markedly greater lowering of IL-6 (table 3). Similarly, while neither HMB nor a low dose of resveratrol exerted any effect on MCP-1 or c-reactive protein, the combination of a low dose of resveratrol with either HMB or leucine resulted in significant decreases in both inflammatory biomarkers. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory cytokine adiponectin was increased in response to a low dose of resveratrol in combination with either HMB or leucine, while the individual components at these doses exerted no significant effect (table 3).</p>

<p id="p-0465" num="0669">Collectively, these data demonstrate synergy between low doses of resveratrol and leucine or its metabolite HMB in activating Sirt1 and Sirt1-dependent outcomes. These include increased fat oxidation and attenuation of adiposity and obesity, augmentation of insulin sensitivity and reversal of insulin resistance, and attenuation of systemic inflammatory stress.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Synergistic Effects of Polyphenols and Related Compounds on Sirtuin Activation and Downstream Pathways</heading>
<p id="p-0466" num="0670">All compounds were tested for potential to independently or synergistically modulate sirtuin signaling either by direct stimulation or indirect via upstream signaling via AMPK. A key outcome of Sirt1 signaling is stimulation of PGC1-&#x3b1; and subsequent stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Accordingly, fatty acid oxidation, measured as palmitate-induced oxygen consumption as described below, was utilized as a sensitive first level of screening for aerobic mitochondrial metabolism. A dose-response curve for fatty acid oxidation was established for each compound studied, and a &#x201c;sub-therapeutic dose&#x201d; was defined as the highest dose that exerted no effect in this system. This dose, typically found to be in the 200-1000 nM range for most compounds studied, was then used to evaluate synergistic effects with leucine, HMB, or sub-therapeutic doses of other compounds. These experiments were conducted in fully differentiated adipocytes (3T3-L1) and myotubes (C2C12). To evaluate the impact of these combinations on cross-talk between adipose and muscle tissues, adipocytes were treated for 48 hours, the medium collected (conditioned media, CM) and then exposed to myotubes; similar experiments were conducted with myotubes treated, CM collected, and exposed to adipocytes. Following assessment of fatty acid oxidation, Sirt1 activity, AMPK activity, mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose utilization (measured as glucose-induced extracellular acidification in the absence of fatty acids in the media) were assessed for lead combinations and appropriate controls.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0671">Cell Culture: C2C12 and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection) were plated at a density of 8000 cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>(10 cm<sup>2 </sup>dish) and grown in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotics (growth medium) at 37&#xb0; C. in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate with a standard differentiation medium consisting of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 250 nM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Preadipocytes were maintained in this differentiation medium for 3 days and subsequently cultured in growth medium. Cultures were re-fed every 2-3 days to allow &#x3e;90% cells to reach fully differentiation before conducting chemical treatment. For differentiation of C2C12 cells, cells were grown to 100% confluence, transferred to differentiation medium (DMEM with 2% horse serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin), and fed with fresh differentiation medium every day until myotubes were fully formed (3 days).</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0672">Measurements:</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0673">Fatty Acid Oxidation: Cellular oxygen consumption was measured using a Seahorse Bioscience XF24 analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, Mass.) in 24-well plates at 37&#xb0; C., as described by Feige et al. (Feige J, Lagouge M, Canto C, Strehle A, Houten S M, Milne J C, Lambert P D, Mataki C, Elliott P J, Auwerx J. Specific SIRT1 activation mimics low energy levels and protects against diet-induced metabolic disorders by enhancing fat oxidation. Cell Metabolism 2008; 8:347-358) with slight modifications. Cells were seeded at 40,000 cells per well, differentiated as described above, treated for 24 hours with the indicated treatments, washed twice with non-buffered carbonate-free pH 7.4 low glucose (2.5 mM) DMEM containing carnitine (0.5 mM), equilibrated with 550 &#x3bc;L of the same media in a non-CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator for 45 minutes, and then inserted into the instrument for 15 minutes of further equilibration, followed by O<sub>2 </sub>consumption measurement. Three successive baseline measures at five-minute intervals were taken prior to injection of palmitate (200 &#x3bc;M final concentration). Four successive 5-minute measurements of O<sub>2 </sub>consumption were then conducted, followed by 10 minute re-equilibration and another 3-4 5-minute measurements. This measurement pattern was then repeated over a 4-6 hour period. Data for each sample were normalized to the pre-palmitate injection baseline for that sample and expressed as % change from that baseline. Pre-palmitate injection values were 371&#xb1;14 pmol O<sub>2</sub>/minute for myotubes and 193&#xb1;11 pmol O<sub>2</sub>/minute for adipocytes. The area under of the curve of O<sub>2 </sub>consumption change from baseline for each sample was then calculated and used for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0674">Glucose Utilization: In the absence of a fatty acid source and oxidative metabolism, glycolysis and subsequent lactate production results in extracellular acidification, which was also measured using a Seahorse Bioscience XF24 analyzer. Cells were prepared and equilibrated similar to the methods described above for fatty acid oxidation, with the exclusion of carnitine from the medium. Following instrument equilibration and three baseline measurements, glucose was injected to a final concentration of 10 mM in each well. Measurements were taken as described above utilizing the sensors for extracellular acidification rather than O<sub>2 </sub>consumption. Insulin (final concentration of 5 nM) was added to some wells as a positive control. Data for each sample were normalized to the pre-glucose injection baseline for that sample and expressed as % change from that baseline. The area under of the curve of extracellular acidification change from baseline for each sample was then calculated and used for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0675">Mitochondrial Biogenesis: Mitochondrial biogenesis was assessed as change in mitochondrial mass, as described by Sun et al. (Sun X and Zemel M B (2009) Leucine modulation of mitochondrial mass and oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes. Nutrition and Metabolism 6:26 (doi:10.1.1186/1743-707S-6-26)). The mitochondrial probe NAO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was used to analyze mitochondrial mass by fluorescence (excitation 485 nm and emission 520 nm), and quantitative data were obtained with a fluorescence microplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). The intensity of fluorescence was expressed as arbitrary units per &#x3bc;g protein and normalized to control values within each assay.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0676">AMPK Activity:</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0677">AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was measured using a commercial kit (CycLex AMPK Kinase Assay Kit, CycLex Co, Ltd, Nagano, Japan). The assay is based upon AMPK phosphorylation of IRS-1 S789. Phosphorylated IRS-1 S789 is then detected by an anti-phospho-mouse IRS-1 S789 monoclonal antibody, which is then bound to horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse IgG which catalyzes a chromogenic reaction with tetra-methylbenzidine. Color formation is proportional to AMPK activity and was measured in 96-well ELISA plates at dual wavelengths (450/540 nm) using a microplate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.). These values are expressed as fluorescent units/mg protein and normalized to control values within each assay.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0678">Sirt1 Activity: SIRT1 activity was measured by using the SIRT1 Fluorimetric Drug Discovery Kit (BML-AK555, ENZO Life Sciences International, Inc. PA, USA). The assay measures SIRT1 activity by the degree of deacetylation of a standardized substrate containing an acetylated lysine side chain. The substrate utilized is a peptide containing amino acids 379-382 of human p53 (Arg-His-Lys-Lys[Ac]), an established target of SIRT1 activity; SIRT1 activity is directly proportional to the degree of deacetylation of Lys-382. Samples were incubated with peptide substrate (25 &#x3bc;M), and NAD<sup>+</sup> (500 &#x3bc;M) in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37&#xb0; C. on a horizontal shaker for 45 minutes. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2 mM nicotinamide and a developing solution that binds to the deacetylated lysine to form a fluorophore. Following 10 minutes incubation at 37&#xb0; C., fluorescence was read in a plate-reading fluorometer (Synergy HT, BioTek Instruments, Winooski, Vt.) at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. Resveratrol (100 mM) served as a SIRT1 activator (positive control) and suramin sodium (25 mM) as a SIRT1 inhibitor (negative control). A standard curve was constructed using deacetylated substrate (0-10 &#x3bc;M).</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0679">Statistics: Data were analyzed via one-way analysis of variance and least significant difference test was used to separate significantly different group means</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0680">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0681">Resveratrol-Leucine and Resveratrol-HMB: Leucine (0.5 mM) and HMB (5 &#x3bc;M) stimulated Sirt1 activity and fatty acid oxidation by 30-50%, similar to the effects of 10 &#x3bc;M resveratrol, while lower levels of resveratrol (here 200 nM) exerted no effect; leucine, HMB and a low dose of resveratrol exerted no independent effects on Sirt3. However, the combination of either leucine or HMB with 200 nM resveratrol resulted in a &#x2dc;90% stimulation of Sirt1, a &#x2dc;60% stimulation of both Sirt3 and 91%-118% increases in fatty acid oxidation (p&#x3c;0.005).</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0682">The concentrations of leucine and HMB in all experiments described below are 0.5 mM (leucine) and 5 &#x3bc;M (HMB). Each of the compounds studied in combination with leucine or HMB were studied at concentrations that exerted no independent effect on the variables under study in order to assess potential synergies. These concentrations are defined for each compound below.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0683">Chlorogenic Acid: Chlorogenic acid is a naturally occurring polyphenol described as a hydroxycinnamic acid; it is an ester of caffeic acid and L-quinic acid (evaluated below). Chlorogenic acid dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 500 nM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0684"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the effects of the chlorogenic acid combinations in myotubes, and significant quanitative data are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Chlorogenic acid (500 nM)/HMB elicited a 42% increase in fatty acid oxidation with 6 hour treatment (p=0.003) and 441% over 24 hours (p=0.05) in skeletal muscle cells (myotubes), while no significant effect was observed in adipocytes. Notably, adding resveratrol (200 nM) attenuated or eliminated these effects, suggesting potential competition for a common site of action (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0685">The chlorogenic acid/HMB combination stimulated adipocyte Sirt1 activity 40% (p=0.005) while the chlorogenic acid/leucine combination stimulated Sirt1 by 67% (p=0.0001) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) and more modestly stimulated AMPK activity (30-35%, NS: p=0.078). In contrast to myotubes, the chlorogenic acid/HMB and chlorogenic acid/leucine combinations exerted no direct effect on adipocyte fatty acid oxidation; however, adipocyte conditioned media experiments demonstrated that treatment of adipocytes with these combinations for 48 hours resulted in conditioned media that stimulated myotube fatty acid oxidation by 76% (p=0.013).</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0686">Both chlorogenic acid-leucine and chlorogenic acid-HMB exerted significant effects on glucose utilization as measured by extracellular acidification responses to glucose addition (chlorogenic acid-leucine: 53%, p=0.007; chlorogenic acid-HMB: 35%, p=0.045; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0687">Caffeic Acid: Caffeic acid is another naturally occurring phenolic compound described as another hydroxycinnamic acid. Caffeic acid dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 1 &#x3bc;M or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0688"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> show the effects of the caffeic acid combinations in myotubes, and the quantitative data is summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The caffeic acid-leucine combination exerted a modest, non-statistically significant increase in myotube fatty acid oxidation (35%), while the caffeic acid-HMB combination exerted significant effects on fatty acid oxidation in both adipocytes (361%, p=0.05) and myotubes (182%, p=0.016). These effects were inhibited by the addition of 200 nM resveratrol, suggesting competition, similar to that seen with chlorogenic acid (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0689">Quinic Acid: Quinic acid is a naturally occurring polyol found in coffee beans and some other plant products. Although not a polyphenol, it is evaluated here because it is a component of chlorogenic acid and may be produced via hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid. Quinic acid dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 500 nM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0690"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> show the effects of the quinic acid combinations in adipocytes, and the quantitative data is summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Quinic acid-HMB and quinic acid-leucine combinations produced robust increases in adipocyte fatty acid oxidation (141% for the quinic acid-HMB combination, p=0.05; 320% for the quinic acid-leucine combination, p=0.012; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) and more modest increases in myotubes (&#x2212;30%, p=0.03). Unlike chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid, addition of resveratrol (200 nM) did not attenuate these effects. The quinic acid combinations appear not to exert their effects directly on Sirt1, as there was no short-term effect on Sirt1 activity, and instead acts upstream with a significant increase in AMPK activity (47%, p&#x3c;0.0001; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). Both the quinic acid-leucine and quinic acid-HMB combinations exerted significant effects on glucose utilization as measured by extracellular acidification responses to glucose addition in both adipocytes and myotubes (quinic acid-HMB, 99%, p=0.05; quinic acid-leucine, 224%, p=0.0003; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0691">Other Polyols: As noted above, quinic acid was evaluated as a hydrolysis product of chlorogenic acid. To determine if the robust effects of quinic acid reflected the effects of a unique molecule (quinic acid) or polyols as a class of compounds, other polyols were evaluated, as follows. These data suggest that effects of quinic acid are not readily extrapolated to other polyols.</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0692">Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol analogue of glucose. Sorbitol dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 500 nM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. Addition of this level of sorbitol to either HMB or leucine resulted in stimulation of myotube fatty acid oxidation (44-70%, p=0.023). However, these effects are not significantly different from the independent effects of leucine and HMB in the absence of sorbitol, indicating no synergy.</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0693">Myo-inositol is a polyol metabolite of glucose. Myo-inositol dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 100 nM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. Combining 100 nM myo-inositol with leucine or HMB produced 60% increase in fat oxidation, comparable to the independent effects of leucine and HMB in the absence of myo-inositol, indicating no synergy.</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0694">Maltitol is a disaccharide made by hydrogenation of maltose. Maltitol dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 100 nM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. However, no synergy was noted.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0695">Cinnamic Acid: Cinnamic acid is a naturally occurring phenolic found in cinnamon oil. It bears strong structural homology to both caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid. Cinnamic acid dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 500 nM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0696">The cinnamic acid combinations exerted robust effects in both adipocytes and myotubes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> show the effects of the cinnamic acid combinations in myotubes, and the quantitative data for adipocytes and myotubes is summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, respectively. Cinnamic acid-HMB and cinnamic acid-leucine combinations increased adipocyte fatty acid oxidation by 290% (p=0.004) and 1227% (p=0.006), respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). In myotubes, the same combinations increased fatty acid oxidation by 199% (p=0.02) and 234% (p=0.05) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>). Further, treatment of adipocytes with these cinnamic acid combinations to produce adipocyte conditioned media which was then applied to myotubes resulted in a 273% increase in myotube fatty acid oxidation (p=0.0002). As with quinic acid, these effects were not attenuated by the addition of 200 nM resveratrol and there was no short-term effect on Sirt1 activity. Instead, the primary effect of these combinations appears to be AMPK-mediated, with Sirt1 effects occurring downstream over a longer period of time, as the combinations resulted in 136-157% increases in AMPK activity (p=0.0001; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0697">Ferulic Acid: Ferulic acid is another hydroxycinnamic acid. Ferulic acid is naturally occurring in coffee and apples, as well as some other fruits, legumes and grains. Ferulic acid dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 500 nM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. Ferulic acid combinations exerted strong effects on fatty acid oxidation. The ferulic acid-HMB combination increased fatty acid oxidation by 1281% (p=0.018) in adipocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>) and by 82% in myotubes (p=0.05) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>). However, the ferulic acid-leucine combination exerted no significant effect in adipocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>), but increased fatty acid oxidation by 137% in myotubes (p=0.034; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). Similar to cinnamic acid, the effects of the ferulic acid-HMB combination in adipocytes and the ferulic acid-leucine combination in myocytes were not attenuated by the addition of resveratrol and there was no short-term direct effect on Sirt1 activity, but there was a significant stimulation of AMPK activity (55-62%, p=0.05; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0698">Piceatannol: Piceatannol is a polyphenol classified as a stilbene. It is a metabolite of resveratrol and is naturally occurring in red wine. Piceatannol dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 1 nM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. To date, only fatty acid oxidation experiments have been conducted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-36</figref>). Data from these experiments demonstrate significant effects of both combinations in both adipocytes and myotubes. The piceatannol-leucine combination elicited a 73% increase in fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes (p=0.05) and a 2301% increase in fatty acid oxidation in myotubes (p=0:039), and the piceatannol-HMB combination elicited a 60% increase in adipocytes (p=0.05) and a 6085% increase in myotubes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0699">Ellagic Acid: Ellagic acid is a large polyphenol naturally occurring in strawberries, raspberries and grapes, as well as a number of other plant products. This polyphenol failed to exert a significant effect in most of our assays, and dose-response curves of ellagic acid indicated little activity, even at high concentrations (50 &#x3bc;M).</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0700">Epigallocatechin Gallate (EGCG): EGCG is a polyphenol ester of epigallocatechin and gallic acid. EGCG is the predominant catechin in green tea. Despite claims to the contrary, we find this compound to be minimally active in directly stimulating fatty acid oxidation and do not detect synergistic effects with either HMB or leucine in stimulating fatty acid oxidation. However, EGCG (1 &#x3bc;M) did exert significant effects on glucose utilization as measured by extracellular acidification. This level of EGCG exerted no independent effect on glucose utilization, but stimulated a 94% increase in glucose utilization when combined with HMB (p=0.015; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>) and a 156% increase in glucose utilization when combined with leucine (p=0.017; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>). Notably, adding resveratrol to this combination exerted no additional effect, but also did not attenuate the observed effects. The effects of these combinations on AMPK and Sirt1 activities have not yet been determined.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0701">Fucoxanthin: Fucoxanthin is a non-polyphenolic pigment found in brown seaweed (&#x201c;Sea Mustard&#x201d;; <i>Undaria pinnatifida</i>). Fucoxanthin dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 100 nM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0702">Fucoxanthin-HMB and fucoxanthin-leucine combinations both exerted potent effects on fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes (fucoxanthin-HMB, 425% increase, p=0.033; fucoxanthin-leucine, 148% increase, p=0.05; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38-40</figref>) and myotubes (fucoxanthin-HMB, 236% increase, p=0.05; fucoxanthin-leucine, 82% increase, p=0.024). Addition of resveratrol neither attenuated nor augmented these effects.</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="0703">Fucoxanthin combination with both HMB and leucine significantly augmented glucose utilization in myotubes and adipocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41 and 42</figref>). The fucoxanthin-HMB combination resulted in a 59% increase (p=0.038) and the fucoxanthin-leucine combination resulted in a 63% increase (p=0.034) in myotubes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>). In adipocytes, the fucoxanthin-HMB combination resulted in a 321% increase (p=0.02) and the fucoxanthin-leucine combination resulted in a 557% increase (p=0.003; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="0704">The effects of the fucoxanthin combinations on AMPK and Sirt1 activity have not yet been determined.</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0705">Grape Seed Extract: Grape seed extract (GSE) is an undifferentiated mixture of polyphenols, including resveratrol, and other naturally occurring compounds in grape. It was selected for study as a broad example of synergy with a naturally occurring group of polyphenols. Since it is a mixture, it is not possible to define concentrations in molar units, so mass units are used for this section. GSE dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 1 &#x3bc;g/mL or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. GSE-leucine increased adipocyte fatty acid oxidation by 74%, but this did not reach statistical significance. The GSE-HMB combination increased fatty acid oxidation by 2262% (p=0.04; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43 and 44</figref>). The effects of both combinations were attenuated by the addition of resveratrol to the combinations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>). GSE-leucine and GSE-HMB combinations modestly increased both AMPK activity (40-80%, p&#x3c;0.01; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>) and Sirt1 activity (15-20%, p&#x3c;0.03).</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0706">Metformin: Metformin, a biguanide, is a commonly prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent. Its known mechanism of action is via stimulation of AMPK, resulting in increased insulin sensitivity as well as increased fat oxidation. Thus, metformin, HMB, leucine, and several of the polyphenols discussed above converge on the same signaling pathways. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether combinations of metformin with these compounds exert a synergistic effect, thereby lowering the concentration of metformin necessary to achieve therapeutic effect.</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0707">Metformin dose-response curves indicate concentrations of 0.1 mM or below exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. This level is substantially lower than concentrations used to assess independent effects of metformin in cellular studies (2-10 mM). Combining metformin with resveratrol (200 nM) and HMB resulted in a 1607% increase in myotube fatty acid oxidation (p=0.0001; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>), while the metformin-leucine-resveratrol combination elicited a 1039% increase (p=0.001). Omitting resveratrol from the combinations resulted in statistically significant, but more modest, synergistic interactions with metformin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>). Metformin-HMB elicited a 58% increase in myotube fatty acid oxidation (p=0.05) while metformin-leucine elicited a 176% increase (p=0.03). These combinations also significantly augmented glucose utilization in myotubes by 61 and 51%, respectively (p=0.028 for both). Both metformin-HMB and metformin-leucine stimulated myotube glucose utilization by 50-60% (p=0.03; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0708">Consistent with these data, these combinations also significantly increased AMPK activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>). The metformin-HMB combination increased myotube AMPK activity by 50% (p=0.031) and the metformin-leucine combination by 22%. Inclusion of resveratrol (200 nM) significantly augmented these effects; metformin-HMB-resveratrol increased AMPK activity by 86% (p=0.026) and the metformin-leucine-resveratrol combination resulted in a 95% increase (p=0.017). These combinations exerted similar effects on Sirt1 activity. Metformin-HMB increased Sirt1 activity by 38% and 58% in adipocytes and myotubes, respectively (p=0.001 for both). Comparable effects were observed for mitochondrial biogenesis (metformin-HMB-resveratrol, 35%, p=0.001; metformin-leucine-resveratrol, 27%, p=0.013; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0709">Notably, combining metformin with either grape seed extract or chlorogenic acid resulted in similar stimulation of Sirt1 activity. Metformin-grape seed extract increased activity by 24% (p=0.001) and metformin-chlorogenic acid increased activity by 42% (p=0.004).</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0710">Rosiglitazone: Rosiglitazone is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class. Its adverse event profile has raised significant concern, limiting its current use, although it is still approved. TZDs act by binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#x3b3;). One of the targets of PPAR&#x3b3; is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1&#x3b1;), a regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation that is a downstream mediator of Sirt1. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether combinations of rosiglitazone with the compounds investigated here exert a synergistic effect, thereby lowering the concentration of metformin necessary to achieve therapeutic effect.</p>
<p id="p-0507" num="0711">Rosiglitazone dose-response curves indicate concentrations below 1 nM exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. This level is lower than that typically used in cell culture experiments (10 nM-10 &#x3bc;M) and is markedly lower than plasma levels typically achieved following IV or oral dosing (400 nM-1.7 &#x3bc;M).</p>
<p id="p-0508" num="0712">Combining rosiglitazone with either leucine or HMB resulted in significant stimulation of fatty acid oxidation in both mytubes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>) and adipocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>). The rosiglitazone-HMB combination stimulated fatty acid oxidation by 521% (p=0.004), and the rosiglitazone-leucine combination stimulated fatty acid oxidation by 231% (p=0.023) and myotube fatty acid oxidation by 92% (p=0.009). Combining rosiglitazone with resveratrol (200 nM) also resulted in stimulation of fatty acid oxidation (177%, p=0.003); however, adding resveratrol to the rosiglitazone-HMB or rosiglitazone-leucine combinations was not more effective than the combinations in the absence of resveratrol in myotubes and attenuated the effects of the combinations in adipocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0509" num="0713">Combining rosiglitazone with either HMB or leucine resulted in marked increases in glucose utilization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>). The rosiglitazone-HMB combination stimulated a 322% increase (p=0.05) and the rosiglitazone-leucine combination stimulated a 341% increase. A comparable increase was found when resveratrol (200 nM) was combined with rosiglitazone (415%, p=0.001), but adding resveratrol to either the rosiglitazone-HMB or rosiglitazone-leucine combinations did not further augment glucose utilization.</p>
<p id="p-0510" num="0714">Phosphodiesterase (PDE) Inhibitors: The effects of resveratrol on Sirt1 activation may be mediated, in part, via inhibiting cAMP Phosphodiesterase, resulting in upregulation of AMPK and subsequent activation of Sirt1 rather than a direct effect. However, other this effect may only be relevant at high (&#x3e;50 &#x3bc;M) resveratrol concentrations. Accordingly we have evaluated the effects of various non-specific PDE inhibitors, as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0511" num="0715">Caffeine is a naturally occurring methyl-xanthine found primarily in coffee, tea, guarana and yerba mate. Caffeine is both an adenosine antagonist and a non-specific PDE inhibitor. Caffeine dose-response curves indicate concentrations below 10 nM exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. This level is &#x2dc;0.1% of the plasma concentration observed following caffeine consumption (1-10 &#x3bc;M). Combining 10 nM of caffeine with resveratrol (200 nM) resulted in a 254% increase in fatty acid oxidation in myotubes (p=0.03; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>), while neither component exerted an independent effect. Combining caffeine with 0.5 mM leucine stimulated adipocyte fatty acid oxidation by 732% (p=0.008; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54 and 55</figref>), and combining caffeine with 5 &#x3bc;M HMB resulted in a 334% increase in fat oxidation in myotubes (p=0.05; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>). The caffeine-leucine combination also markedly improved muscle cell glucose utilization as measured by extracellular acidification responses to glucose addition (574% improvement, p=0.003). Caffeine also exhibited significant synergy with metformin (0.1 mM), resulting in a 240% increase in myotube fatty acid oxidation (p=0.013; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>), although it did not exert a synergistic effect on glucose utilization.</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="0716">Theophylline is a metabolite of caffeine that is also naturally occurring in tea and cocoa. Theophylline dose-response curves indicate concentrations below 1 &#x3bc;M exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. Combining theophylline with 5 &#x3bc;M HMB resulted in a 396% increase in myotube fatty acid oxidation (p=0.03; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>). Similar synergy occurred between theophylline and resveratrol (486%, p=0.03), while combining HMB, resveratrol and HMB did not further augment this effect (382%, p=0.05; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>). Theophylline exhibited a similar synergy with HMB and leucine in adipocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57 and 58</figref>), although no synergy was observed with resveratrol in adipocytes.</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="0717">Theobromine is a naturally occurring methylxanthine found primarily in cocoa and dark chocolate, as well as yerba mate and tea. Experiments were conducted with a cocoa extract standardized to 12% theobromine; dose-response curves indicated concentrations below 0.1 &#x3bc;g/mL exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. Combining cocoa extract/theobromine with 5 &#x3bc;M HMB resulted in a 260% increase in fat oxidation (p=0.021), and the cocoa extract/theobromine combination with 0.5 mM leucine resulted in a 673% increase (p=0.00035) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59 and 60</figref>). Combining the cocoa extract/theobromine with resveratrol exerted no significant effect on fat oxidation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59 and 60</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0514" num="0718">Isobutylmethylxanthine (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; IBMX) is a methyl xanthine similar to caffeine. It serves as both an adenosine antagonist and a non-specific PDE inhibitor. IBMX dose-response curves indicate concentrations below 50 nM exert no effect; accordingly, this was the concentration used in synergy experiments. IBMX exhibited weak but statistically significant synergy with HMB, but not leucine, in stimulating fat oxidation (73% increase, p=0.05) and glucose utilization (66%, p=0.05) in myotubes.</p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0719">These data demonstrate significant synergistic effects of a several naturally occurring polyphenols on fat oxidation and glucose utilization when these polyphenols are combined with either HMB or leucine. These effects occur at levels which produce no independent effects and which are readily achievable via diet or supplementation. These effects, mediated via Sirt1 and AMPK signaling, are significantly more robust for several of the polyphenols than those we previously observed for a low dose of resveratrol combined with either HMB or leucine and more robust than effects observed by us and others for high dose resveratrol. Chlorogenic acid (a hydroxycinnamic acid) and its hydrolysis product, quinic acid, as well as compounds structurally related to chlorogenic acid (cinnamic acid, ferulic acid) exerted especially robust effects. Highly significant effects were also observed with the resveratrol metabolite piceatannol as well as with a non-polyphenolic compound from seaweed (fucoxanthin, a xanthophyll that exhibits a highly resonant structure commonly observed in polyphenols). These effects can also be recapitulated with naturally occurring non-specific PDE inhibitors. Thus, moderate levels of leucine and HMB can be utilized in synergistic combinations with a number of polyphenols and related compounds to stimulate AMPK and sirtuin signaling and achieve benefits comparable to or exceeding those found with high-dose resveratrol.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0720">These data also demonstrate that leucine and HMB exhibit significant synergies with pharmaceuticals that converge on the same signaling pathways, thereby conferring efficacy to otherwise non-therapeutic doses of these drugs. This can be an effective strategy for decreasing the levels of these drugs required to achieve therapeutic efficacy, thereby attenuating side effects and adverse events otherwise associated with them.</p>

<p id="p-0523" num="0733">Results</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0734">The high dose (300 mg/kg bw) reduced plasma insulin by 27% (from 62 to 45 uU/mL, p&#x3c;0.02, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>) and in the HOMA<sub>IR </sub>index by 35% (from 29 to 18 units, p&#x3c;0.025, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>), but exerted no significant effect on plasma glucose in these highly insulin resistant animals. However, there were no significant effects on body composition. A low dose of metformin (here 150 mg/kg) and a very low dose (50 mg/kg) exerted no significant independent effects on any variable studied. In contrast, combining either the low or very low dose of metformin with HMB resulted in significant decreases in plasma insulin from 62 uU/mL to 43 uU/mL (p&#x3c;0.02, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>) comparable to that seen with high dose metformin, and there was no significant difference between the low metformin-HMB blend versus the very low metformin-HMB blend. Consistent with this observation, the HOMA<sub>IR </sub>index decreased from 29 units on the control diet to 19 on the low metformin-HMB blend and to 16 on the very low metformin-HMB blend (p&#x3c;0.025, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>), reflecting an improvement in insulin sensitivity comparable to that found with high dose metformin. This is also reflected in the results of the insulin tolerance test; animals on the control, low-dose or very low-dose of metformin exhibited minimal changes in blood glucose in response to the insulin challenge (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>). In contrast, those on the standard metformin dose and those on either the low or very low dose of metformin combined with HMB exhibited &#x2dc;60 mg/dL decreases in blood glucose over the 30 minute linear portion of the response curve (p&#x3c;0.02; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>). Moreover, the metformin-HMB blends reduced visceral adiposity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>). Animals on the control diet had a mean visceral fat mass of 4.5 g, and this was not affected by metformin at any dosage in the absence of HMB.

In this assay, SIRT1 activity is assessed by the degree of deacetylation of a standardized substrate containing an acetylated lysine side chain. The substrate utilized is a peptide containing amino acids 379-382 of human p53 (Arg-His-Lys-Lys[Ac]), a target of SIRT1 activity; SIRT1 activity is directly proportional to the degree of deacetylation of Lys-382. Samples are incubated with peptide substrate (25 &#x3bc;M), and NAD<sup>+</sup> (500 &#x3bc;M) in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37&#xb0; C. on a horizontal shaker for 45 minutes. The reaction is stopped with the addition of 2 mM nicotinamide and a developing solution that binds to the deacetylated lysine to form a fluorophore. Following 10 minutes incubation at 37&#xb0; C., fluorescence is read in a plate-reading fluorometer at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. Resveratrol (100 mM) serves as a SIRT1 activator and suramin sodium (25 mM) as a SIRT1 inhibitor; wells including each are utilized as positive and negative controls in each set of reactions. A standard curve is constructed using deactylated substrate (0-10 &#x3bc;M). Data is normalized to cellular protein concentration measured via BCA-assay.</p>

<p id="p-0533" num="0743">Compounds at doses having no independent effects on fatty acid oxidation were tested for synergistic combinatorial effects on fatty acid oxidation and on irisin secretion. Compounds used included resveratrol (200 nM), cinnamic acid (1 &#x3bc;M), Chlorogenic acid (0.5 &#x3bc;M), quinic acid (500 nM), caffeine (10 nM), leucine (0.5 mM), and HMB (5 &#x3bc;M). As described in Example 5, C2C12 myotubes treated with the indicated combinations of compounds were used to produce conditioned media, with which 3T3-L1 adipocytes were then treated. Fatty acid oxidation was measured as in Example 5. Irisin levels were measured by Western blot and ELISA, both in conditioned media and in plasma from mice treated according to Example 4.</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0744">Western Blot: The FNDC5 antibody (which binds irisin) was obtained from Abeam (Cambridge, Mass.). C2C12 myotubes were treated as described in Example 5, with the indicated compound combinations, and the media and cellular fractions were prepared as described by Bostrom et al (Nature (2012) 481:463-468). Protein was measured by BCA kit (Thermo Scientific). For Western blot, 6 &#x3bc;g protein (media) or 25 &#x3bc;g (cell lysate) was resolved on 4-20% gradient polyacrylaminde gels (Criterion precast gel, Bio-Rad Laboratroies, Hercules, Calif.), transferred to PVDF membranes, incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA in TBS) and then incubated with primary antibody (FNDC5), washed and incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Visualization and chemiluminescent detection was conducted using BioRad ChemiDoc instrumentation and software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.) and band intensity was assessed using Image Lab 4.0 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.), with correction for background and loading controls. Purified FNDC5 (Abeam, Cambridge, Mass.) was used as a positive control in these blots. FNDC5 was detected at 26-28 kDA and irisin was detected at 22-24 kDA.</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0745">ELISA: Irisin was also detected in C2C12 incubation media from treated cells and in mouse plasma using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Results:</p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0746">In Vitro: Conditioned media from cells treated with combinations of resveratrol and leucine, resveratrol and HMB, cinnamic acid and leucine, and cinnamic acid and HMB increased fatty acid oxidation in adipocytes, which was not observed for the compounds when used alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>). The combinations of resveratrol with either leucine or HMB, cinnamic acid with HMB, and chlorogenic acid with either leucine or HMB resulted in significant increases in FNDC5 protein expression in muscle cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>), while the individual components exerted no effect. Combining quinic acid with leucine also results in a significant increase in FNDC5 expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>), and in irisin secretion into the media (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 72 and 73</figref>), while the individual component exert no effect. Measurement of irisin secretion into the media was measured by Western blot (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68 and 72</figref>) and by ELISA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>). Combining resveratrol with leucine resulted in a 234% increase in irisin secretion, from 6.76 to 22.55 ng/ml (p=0.008) and the resveratrol-HMB combination elicited a 122.5% increase (p=0.00001, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 68 and 69</figref>). Similarly, the cinnamic acid-leucine combination stimulated a 40% increase (p=0.0005), while the cinnamic acid-HMB combination did not significantly stimulate irisin release into the media (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>). Although the chlorogenic acid combinations with leucine or HMB increased muscle FNDC5 protein expression, this combination resulted in only modest, non-significant increases in irisin secretion into the media. However, a three-way combination of chlorogenic acid, caffeine, and either leucine or HMB results in significant increases in both FNDC5 protein expression in skeletal muscle cells and of irisin secretion into the media (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>).</p>

The low-dose of resveratrol exerted no independent effect on this variable.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0749">These data indicate that, in addition to direct stimulation of sirtuin signaling and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and fat cells, leucine-polyphenol combinations also stimulate irisin release from skeletal muscle, thereby further promoting adipocyte fat oxidation.</p>

<heading id="h-0028" level="1">Signaling of BCAA Plus Sirtuin Pathway Activator Compositions Through Irisin in vitro</heading>
<p id="p-0540" num="0750">C2C12 myotubes are treated a branched chain amino acid or a metabolite thereof (BCAA), a sirtuin pathway activator, both of these, or no treatment as a control, as in Example 5. The branched chain amino acid can be leucine, such as at 0.5 mM. The sirtuin pathway activator can be resveratrol, such as at 200 nM. Myotubes are treated according to one or more of the experiments described in Example 5 to produce conditioned media. Conditioned media is split into two samples, one that is untreated and one that is treated to reduce or remove irisin. Treatment to remove or inactivate irisin can include immunoprecipitation of irisin, addition of an irisin-neutralizing antibody, or size exclusion (e.g. by filtration or a co-culture of myotubes with adipocytes, where the two cell types are separated by a membrane having a pore size smaller than the size of irisin). Measurement of the mRNA and/or protein levels of FNDC5 (irisin precursor protein) is used to confirm increased FNDC5 expression, synergistically induced by treatment with the combination composition. Measurement of irisin levels before and after treatment of the conditioned media (such as by Western blot or ELISA as described in Example 8) is used to confirm increased irisin production in untreated media and degree of reduction in the treated media. 3T3-L1 adiposytes are then treated with either treated or untreated conditioned media. An output of mitochondrial biogenesis is then measured, such as fatty acid oxidation, glucose utilization, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial mass, or one or more indicia of fat cell browning (e.g. expression of browning-associated genes, such as Ucp1; and increase in fatty acid oxidation). Gene expression can be measured as in Example 4. Other measures of mitochondrial biogenesis can be measured as in Example 5. It is expected that combinations of BCAA (or BCAA metabolites) and sirtuin pathway activators synergistically increase irisin expression, and that adipocytes exposed to untreated media (as in Example 5) will show signs of synergistic increases in mitochondrial biogenesis. It is further expected that treatment of the conditioned media to remove or inactivate irisin from conditioned media giving a synergistic effect will significantly reduce the mitochondrial biogenesis otherwise observed. Such a result will indicate that combination compositions of this kind produce at least a portion of their synergistic effects through irisin signaling.</p>

<p id="p-0541" num="0751">Six week old male c57/BL6 mice were fed a high-fat diet with fat increased to 45% of energy (Research Diets D12451) for 6 weeks to induce obesity. At the end of this obesity induction period, animals were randomly divided into seven different diet treatment groups with 10 animals per group (overall 70 animals) and maintained on these diet for 6 weeks, according to groups in Example 4. Measurements, samples, and tissues were collected as in Example 4. Tissues collected included subcutaneous adipose tissue, which is ordinarily a white adipose tissue. RNA was extracted from the subcutaneous adipose tissue, and gene expression was evaluated according to methods described in Example 4. Gene expression analysis included determining the expression levels of PGC1&#x3b1; (a known activator of FNDC5 expression, which is the precursor of irisin) and UCP1 (a brown-fat-selective gene, an increase in expression of which is stimulated by irisin). Plasma levels of irisin were also evaluated, the results of which are described in Example 8 and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>. Mice may also evaluated for increases in other indicators of induction of fat cell browning, including increased expression in subcutaneous fat and other adipose tissue of one or more other brown-fat-selective genes (e.g. Cidea, Prdm16, and Ndufs1). Protein expression may also be determined by Western blot or ELISA, as in Example 8. Fat cell browning is also indicated by an increase in fatty acid oxidation in fat cells.</p>
<p id="p-0542" num="0752">Minimal UCP1 expression was detected in white subcutaneous adipose tissue in control mice. However, supplementing the diets of these diet-induced obese mice with a low dose of resveratrol (12.5 mg/kg diet) and a two-fold increase in dietary leucine (from 1.21 to 2.42%) for six weeks resulted in a 344% increase in UCPI expression (p&#x3c;0.05, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>). The low dose of resveratrol exerted no independent effect on this variable, and the HMB-resveratrol combination exerted no detectable effect. Consistent with these observations, there was a corresponding two-fold upregulation of PGC1&#x3b1; expression in white adipose tissue in response to feeding the resveratrol-leucine combination (p=0.04, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0543" num="0753">These data indicate that, in addition to direct stimulation of sirtuin signaling and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and fat cells, the resveratrol-leucine combination also stimulates browning of white adipose tissue. This correlates with our observation that the leucine-resveratrol combination stimulates irsin release from muscle both in vitro and in vivo (see, e.g., Example 8).</p>
