In addition, the second electrode <b>82</b> is pressed towards the bimetal plate <b>76</b> (in the Y direction) and is elastically deformed by the inner wall surface <b>282</b>A in the insertion hole <b>282</b> and thus the second contact <b>92</b> moves towards the bimetal plate <b>76</b> (in the Y direction). As a result, the state where the second contact <b>92</b> is separated from the first contact <b>91</b> is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When the pressing force (the external force) does not act on the pressing member <b>277</b> pressed towards the bimetal plate (in the Y direction) any more, the second electrode <b>82</b> elastically deformed is restored to the original state with its own elastic force and the second contact <b>92</b> thus comes into contact with the first contact <b>91</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">On the other hand, when the pressing member <b>277</b> is kept pressed towards the bimetal plate <b>76</b> (in the Y direction), the second electrode <b>82</b> is maintained in the elastically-deformed state and the state where the second contact <b>92</b> and the first contact <b>91</b> are separated from each other is maintained. Accordingly, the electrical circuit <b>25</b> is broken and the supply of power to the heat source <b>64</b>B from the power supply unit <b>21</b> is continuously stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this way, the second modification has the same operation as in the above-mentioned exemplary embodiment. With a simple configuration like a single member of the pressing member <b>277</b>, when the pressing member <b>277</b> is kept pressed towards the bimetal plate <b>76</b> (in the Y direction), the second electrode <b>82</b> is maintained in the elastically-deformed state and the state where the second contact <b>92</b> and the first contact <b>91</b> are separated from each other is maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the pressing member <b>277</b> may include an insertion groove <b>292</b> into which the third portion <b>94</b>C of the second electrode <b>82</b> is inserted instead of the insertion hole <b>282</b>. The pressing member <b>277</b> may have an insertion groove <b>291</b> into which the third portion <b>93</b>C of the first electrode <b>81</b> is inserted instead of the insertion hole <b>281</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In this configuration, an inner wall surface <b>291</b>A in the insertion groove <b>291</b> facing the bottom wall <b>72</b>C (the &#x2212;Y direction) of the case member <b>72</b> serves as a portion pressing the first electrode <b>81</b> when the end <b>277</b>A close to the bimetal plate <b>76</b> is pressed to move to the first electrode <b>81</b> (in the &#x2212;Y direction) by the deformation of the bimetal plate <b>76</b> into the convex shape (the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">An inner wall surface <b>292</b>A in the insertion groove <b>292</b> facing the bimetal plate <b>76</b> (the Y direction) serves as a portion pressing the second electrode <b>82</b> to maintain the state where the first contact <b>91</b> and the second contact <b>92</b> are separated from each other at the time of restoring the bimetal plate <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The invention is not limited to the above-mentioned exemplary embodiment, but may be modified, changed, and improved in various forms. For example, the above-mentioned modifications may be appropriately combined.</p>
