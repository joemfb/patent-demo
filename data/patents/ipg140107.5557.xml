Components of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The wireless communication unit <b>110</b> may include at least one module that enables radio communication between the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and a radio communication system or between the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and a network in which the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is located. For example, the wireless communication unit <b>110</b> may include a broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b>, a mobile communication module <b>112</b>, a wireless Internet module <b>113</b>, a short-range communication module <b>114</b> (or local area communication module), and a location information module <b>115</b> (or position information module).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> may receive broadcasting signals and/or broadcasting related information from an external broadcasting management server through a broadcasting channel. The broadcasting channel may include a satellite channel and a terrestrial channel, and the broadcasting management server may be a server that generates and transmits broadcasting signals and/or broadcasting related information or a server that receives previously created broadcasting signals and/or broadcasting related information and transmits the broadcasting signals and/or broadcasting related information to a terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The broadcasting signals may include not only TV broadcasting signals, radio broadcasting signals, and data broadcasting signals but also signals in the form of a combination of a TV broadcasting signal and a radio broadcasting signal. The broadcasting related information may be information on a broadcasting channel, a broadcasting program or a broadcasting service provider, and may be provided even through a mobile communication network. In the latter case, the broadcasting related information may be received by the mobile communication module <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The broadcasting related information may exist in various forms. For example, the broadcasting related information may exist in the form of an electronic program guide (EPG) of a digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) system or in the form of an electronic service guide (ESG) of a digital video broadcast-handheld (DVB-H) system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> may receive broadcasting signals using various broadcasting systems. More particularly, the broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> may receive digital broadcasting signals using digital broadcasting systems such as a digital multimedia broadcasting-terrestrial (DMB-T) system, a digital multimedia broadcasting-satellite (DMB-S) system, a media forward link only (MediaFLO) system, a DVB-H and integrated services digital broadcast-terrestrial (ISDB-T) systems. The broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> may receive signals from broadcasting systems providing broadcasting signals other than the above-described digital broadcasting systems.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The broadcasting signals and/or broadcasting related information received through the broadcasting receiving module <b>111</b> may be stored in the memory <b>160</b>. The mobile communication module <b>112</b> may transmit/receive a radio signal to/from at least one of a base station, an external terminal and/or a server on a mobile communication network. The radio signal may include a voice call signal, a video telephony call signal or data in various forms according to transmission and reception of text/multimedia messages.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wireless Internet module <b>113</b> may correspond to a module for wireless Internet access and may be included in the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or may be externally attached to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. Wireless LAN (WLAN or Wi-Fi), wireless broadband (Wibro), world interoperability for microwave access (Wimax), high speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) and so on may be used as a wireless Internet technique.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The short-range communication module <b>114</b> may correspond to a module for local area communication. Further, Bluetooth&#xae;, radio frequency identification (RFID), infrared data association (IrDA), ultra wideband (UWB) and/or ZigBee&#xae; may be used as a local area communication technique.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The location information module <b>115</b> may confirm or obtain a location or position of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. The location information module <b>115</b> may obtain position information by using a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The GNSS is a terminology describing a radio navigation satellite system that revolves around the earth and transmits reference signals to predetermined types of radio navigation receivers such that the radio navigation receivers can determine their positions on the earth's surface or near the earth's surface. The GNSS may include a global positioning system (GPS) of the United States, Galileo of Europe, a global orbiting navigational satellite system (GLONASS) of Russia, COMPASS of China, and/or a quasi-zenith satellite system (QZSS) of Japan, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A global positioning system (GPS) module <b>115</b> is a representative example of the location information module <b>115</b>. The GPS module <b>115</b> may calculate information on distances between one point or object and at least three satellites and information on a time when distance information is measured and apply trigonometry to the obtained distance information to obtain three-dimensional position information on the point or object according to latitude, longitude and altitude at a predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A method of calculating position and time information using three satellites and correcting the calculated position and time information using another satellite may also be used. Additionally, the GPS module <b>115</b> may continuously calculate a current position in real time and calculate velocity information using the location or position information.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The A/V input unit <b>120</b> may input (or receive) an audio signal and/or a video signal. The A/V input unit <b>120</b> may include a camera <b>121</b> and a microphone <b>122</b>. The camera <b>121</b> may process image frames of still images or moving images obtained by an image sensor in a video telephony mode or a photographing mode. The processed image frames may be displayed on a display <b>151</b>, which may be a touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The image frames processed by the camera <b>121</b> may be stored in the memory <b>160</b> or may be transmitted to an external device through the wireless communication unit <b>110</b>. The mobile terminal <b>100</b> may also include at least two cameras <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The microphone <b>122</b> may receive an external audio signal in a call mode, a recording mode and/or a speech recognition mode, and the microphone <b>122</b> may process the received audio signal into electric audio data. The audio data may then be converted into a form that can be transmitted to a mobile communication base station through the mobile communication module <b>112</b> and output in the call mode. The microphone <b>122</b> may employ various noise removal algorithms (or noise canceling algorithm) for removing or reducing noise generated when the external audio signal is received.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The user input unit <b>130</b> may receive input data for controlling operation of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> from a user. The user input unit <b>130</b> may include a keypad, a dome switch, a touch pad (constant voltage/capacitance), a jog wheel, a jog switch and/or so on.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sensing unit <b>140</b> may sense a current state of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, such as an open/close state of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, a position of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, whether a user touches the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, a direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and acceleration/deceleration of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and the sensing unit <b>140</b> may generate a sensing signal for controlling operation of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. For example, in an example of a slide phone, the sensing unit <b>140</b> may sense whether the slide phone is opened or closed. Further, the sensing unit <b>140</b> may sense whether the power supply <b>190</b> supplies power and/or whether the interface <b>170</b> is connected to an external device. The sensing unit <b>140</b> may also include a proximity sensor <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The output unit <b>150</b> may generate visual, auditory and/or tactile output, and the output unit <b>150</b> may include the display <b>151</b>, an audio output module <b>152</b>, an alarm <b>153</b> and a haptic module <b>154</b>. The display <b>151</b> may display information processed by the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. The display <b>151</b> may display a user interface (UI) and/or a graphic user interface (GUI) related to a telephone call when the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is in the call mode. The display <b>151</b> may also display a captured and/or received image, a UI or a GUI when the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is in the video telephony mode or the photographing mode.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The display <b>151</b> may include at least one of a liquid crystal display, a thin film transistor liquid crystal display, an organic light-emitting diode display, a flexible display and/or a three-dimensional display. The display <b>151</b> may be of a transparent type or a light transmissive type. That is, the display <b>151</b> may include a transparent display.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The transparent display may include a transparent liquid crystal display. A rear structure of the display <b>151</b> may also be of a light transmissive type. Accordingly, a user may see an object located behind the body (of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>) through the transparent area of the body of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> that is occupied by the display <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The mobile terminal <b>100</b> may also include at least two displays <b>151</b>. For example, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may include a plurality of displays <b>151</b> that are arranged on a single face at a predetermined distance or integrated displays. The plurality of displays <b>151</b> may also be arranged on different sides.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the display <b>151</b> and a sensor sensing touch (hereafter referred to as a touch sensor) form a layered structure that is referred to as a touch screen, the display <b>151</b> may be used as an input device in addition to an output device. The touch sensor may be in the form of a touch film, a touch sheet, and/or a touch pad, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The touch sensor may convert a variation in pressure applied to a specific portion of the display <b>151</b> or a variation in capacitance generated at a specific portion of the display <b>151</b> into an electric input signal. The touch sensor may sense pressure of touch as well as position and area of the touch.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the user applies a touch input to the touch sensor, a signal corresponding to the touch input may be transmitted to a touch controller. The touch controller may then process the signal and transmit data corresponding to the processed signal to the controller <b>180</b>. Accordingly, the controller <b>180</b> may detect a touched portion of the display <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The proximity sensor <b>141</b> (of the sensing unit <b>140</b>) may be located in an internal region of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, surrounded by the touch screen, or near the touch screen. The proximity sensor <b>141</b> may sense an object approaching a predetermined sensing face or an object located near the proximity sensor <b>141</b> using an electromagnetic force or infrared rays without having mechanical contact. The proximity sensor <b>141</b> may have a lifetime longer than a contact sensor and may thus have a wide application in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The proximity sensor <b>141</b> may include a transmission type photo-electric sensor, a direct reflection type photo-electric sensor, a mirror reflection type photo-electric sensor, a high-frequency oscillating proximity sensor, a capacitive proximity sensor, a magnetic proximity sensor, and/or an infrared proximity sensor. A capacitive touch screen may be constructed such that proximity of a pointer is detected through a variation in an electric field according to proximity of the pointer. The touch screen (touch sensor) may be classified as a proximity sensor <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For ease of explanation, an action of the pointer approaching the touch screen without actually touching the touch screen may be referred to as a proximity touch and an action of bringing the pointer into contact with the touch screen may be referred to as a contact touch. A proximity touch point of the pointer on the touch screen may correspond to a point of the touch screen at which the pointer is perpendicular to the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The proximity sensor <b>141</b> may sense the proximity touch and a proximity touch pattern (e.g., a proximity touch distance, a proximity touch direction, a proximity touch velocity, a proximity touch time, a proximity touch position, a proximity touch moving state, etc.). Information corresponding to the sensed proximity touch action and proximity touch pattern may then be displayed on the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The audio output module <b>152</b> may output audio data received from the wireless communication unit <b>110</b> or stored in the memory <b>160</b> in a call signal receiving mode, a telephone call mode or a recording mode, a speech recognition mode and a broadcasting receiving mode. The audio output module <b>152</b> may output audio signals related to functions, such as a call signal incoming tone and a message incoming tone, performed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. The audio output module <b>152</b> may include a receiver, a speaker, a buzzer, and/or the like. The audio output module <b>152</b> may output sounds through an earphone jack. The user may hear the sounds by connecting an earphone to the earphone jack.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The alarm <b>153</b> may output a signal for indicating generation of an event of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. For example, an alarm may be generated when receiving a call signal, receiving a message, inputting a key signal, and/or inputting a touch.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flowchart showing an operation of a mobile terminal according to an embodiment. Other operations, orders of operations and embodiments are also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown therein, the controller <b>150</b> may allow for a determination as to whether the mobile terminal <b>100</b> enters a specific area.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The specific area may be a selection area that is set in advance by the user. The controller <b>150</b> may calculate (or determine) a current location of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> through the location information module <b>115</b>. The controller <b>150</b> may determine whether or not the current location of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> is within a preset selection area.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">When the mobile terminal <b>100</b> enters a specific area, contents of a usable payment method (or allowable payment method) may be output in operation S<b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The user may set in advance a payment method (such as a card or the like) that may be used for payment in a specific selection area. When the set payment method exists, the controller <b>150</b> may display the contents on the display <b>151</b> or output the contents through the audio output module <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Thereafter, the payment method may be selected in operation S<b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The selection of the payment method may be automatically performed through the controller <b>150</b> or may be performed by a user's operation of selecting a specific payment method.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The mobile terminal <b>100</b> may determine whether or not tagging is made in operation S<b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The tagging may be an operation to set a communication link through Near Field Communication (NFC). For example, the moving of a first electronic device closer to a second electronic device within a predetermined distance may be tagging. When the tagging is made, a communication link may be set between the first electronic device and the second electronic device. Once the communication link is set, data exchange may be made through the communication link.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">When the mobile terminal is tagged, an operation in which payment is made using the selected payment method may be performed in operation S<b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Since the communication link is set when the tagging is made, a data exchange may be performed through the set communication link. Data being exchanged may be information regarding payment using a specific card, which is the selected payment method. That is, in the preset area, payment may be made using a preset card.</p>
