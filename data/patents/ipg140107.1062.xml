<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A removable and replaceable keying component which is required for operation of a mechanism and which component includes a waveguide having a photochromic portion. A method of controlling operation of a mechanism, preferably a dispenser, having a removable component comprising the steps of measuring electromagnetic radiation passing through a waveguide carrying at least in part on the removable component and permitting operation of the mechanism only when the measured electromagnetic radiation corresponds with one or more pre-selected parameters. Preferably, the method involves directing emitted electromagnetic radiation with pre-selected input parameters selected from a plurality of input parameters.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SCOPE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a key system for determining conditions of compatibility of a replaceable component of a mechanism, preferably a dispenser such as a fluid dispenser and, more particularly, to an optical key system sensing electromagnetic waves transmitted through a waveguide to determine if the waveguide has a photochromic portion.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Key systems are known in which a particular key is required to be received in a key system as to control an aspect of operation. Many different types of keys are used as, for example, keys to open locks in doors and operate machinery such as automobiles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the context of dispensing systems, U.S. Patent Publication US 2006/0124662 to Reynolds et al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, teaches an electrically powered key device on a refill container to determine if the refill container is compatible with a fluid dispenser. The refill container provides a coil terminated by one of a number of capacitors and the container is received in a housing that provides a pair of coils that are in spacial relationship with the installed refill coil. By energizing the housing's coil, the other coil detects the unique electronic signature which, if acceptable, permits the dispensing system to dispense material. The system thus utilizes a near field frequency response to determine whether the refill container is compatible with the dispensing system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such previously known key devices using near field frequency response suffer the disadvantage that they are relatively complex and require a number of metal coils. This has the disadvantage of precluding substantially the entirety of the key device to be manufactured from plastic material and causes difficulties in recycling.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Photochromic and the related word photochromism are words which do not have a rigorous technical definition.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Photochromic is often defined as describing compounds that undergo a transformation of a chemical species between two forms by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation where the two forms have different absorption spectra, that is, different abilities to absorb electromagnetic radiation in a range of &#x201c;test wavelengths&#x201d;, as in wavelength or strength. Often the word photochromic is used to describe a &#x201c;reversible&#x201d; reaction where an absorption band of the electromagnetic spectrum, typically in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, changes dramatically in strength or wavelength. Typically, the reaction is a photochemical reaction by the absorption of &#x201c;activating electromagnetic radiation&#x201d; in a range of &#x201c;activating wavelengths&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, photochromic compounds can be considered to be either reversible or irreversible. Thus, while many technical definitions refer to photochromism as reversible, in this application and in the following claims:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">1. the term &#x201c;irreversible photochromic&#x201d; is used to refer to photochemical reactions that yield a permanent change by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">2. the term &#x201c;reversible photochromic&#x201d; is used to refer to photochemical reactions by the absorption of electromagnetic radiation that are reversible; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">3. the term &#x201c;photochromic&#x201d; as used includes reactions which are reversible polychromic as defined in (2) above and reactions which are irreversible photochromic as defined in (1) above.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0012">The activating electromagnetic radiation absorbed in the photochromic reaction is to be considered as being in a range of activating wavelengths which may be any wavelength electromagnetic radiation but is preferably light, more preferably near visible light, ultraviolet light, and visible light.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">The different abilities of the two forms of a chemical species of a photochromic compound to absorb electromagnetic radiation may be different abilities to absorb electromagnetic radiation in any range of test wavelengths which may be any wavelength electromagnetic radiation but is preferably light, more preferably, near visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light and visible light.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0014">The two forms of a reversible photochromic compound may be considered to be an unactivated form in which the compound or dye is in an unactivated state and an activated form in which the compound or dye is in an activated state.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0015">Another somewhat arbitrary requirement of reversible photochromic compounds is that they require the two forms to be stable under ambient conditions for a reasonable time. The timescale of reversion is important for many embodiments of the invention considered in this application, and photochromic compounds may be selected or molecularly engineered with timescale of reversion as may be desired. For example, a reversible photochromic compound in an unactivated state may on receiving an adequate &#x201c;dose&#x201d; of activating electromagnetic radiation change from an unactivated state to an activated state and in the activated state will inherently in the absence of the activating electromagnetic radiation inherently return to the unactivated state. As one alternative, the reversible photochromic dye in the activated state may on receiving an adequate &#x201c;dose&#x201d; of unactivating electromagnetic radiation change from the activated state to the unactivated state. The timescale of reversion may be the only significant difference between what might be considered an irreversible photochromic compound and reversible photochromic compound.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0016">Reversion of reversible photochromic compounds may also be affected by the absence or presence of electromagnetic radiation in a range of wavelengths, notably light and therefore by darkness, being the absence of light.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0017">The timescale of reversion of reversible photochromic compounds is often shorter at higher temperatures and accelerated by heating. A close relationship exists between photochromic and thermochromic compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0018">The extent to which photochromic compounds considered to be stable at ambient conditions and particularly thermally stable at ambient temperatures may be significant and photochromic compounds may be selected or can also be molecularly engineered with stability including thermal stability as may be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0019">The time that a reversible photochromic compound may be considered to revert from the activated state to the unactivated state at normal ambient room temperatures, may be referred to as the &#x201c;reversion time period&#x201d;. The time that a reversible photochromic compound may be considered to change from an unactivated state to an activated state at normal ambient room temperature may be referred to as the &#x201c;activation time period&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0020">The ability of a waveguide containing a reversible photochromic compound in an unactivated state to transmit electromagnetic radiation in a range of test wavelength is referred to as the &#x201c;inherent transmission characteristic&#x201d; or the &#x201c;unactivated transmission characteristic&#x201d;. The ability of a waveguide containing a reversible photochromic compound in an activated state to transmit electromagnetic radiation in the range of test wavelengths is referred to as the &#x201c;activated transmission characteristic&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0021">Compounds which are known and can be used as reversible photochromic dye include spiropyrans, spirooxazines, diarylethenes, azobenzenes, photochromic quinones and inorganic photochromics including silver and zinc halides and silver chloride. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,913,544 and 4,851,530 teach exemplary known photochromic compounds and dyes. Such photochromic compounds and dyes are known for use in a variety of materials including plastic and glass. For example, photochromic dyes sold under the trade mark REVERSACOL by James Robertson Ltd. are dyes which are preferably activated light from 350-410 nm and may be readily incorporated into various materials including low density polyethylene at, for example, 0.05% concentration. Such photochromic dyes may be selected so as to provide for different activation time periods and different reversion time periods for the activated dyes to fade from an activated state with maximum absorbance of test wavelengths of light to an inactivated state with lower absorbance of test wavelengths of light. Such REVERSACOL photochromic dyes may be used in various polymer matrix including polyolefins, vinyls, acrylic resins and styrenes. The preferred usage can be in relatively inexpensive low density polyethylene in the range of 0.1% to 2% by weight.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0023">To at least partially overcome other disadvantages of the previously known devices, the present invention provides a method of controlling the operation of a mechanism, preferably a dispenser, having a removable component with a waveguide by selectively passing electromagnetic radiation through the waveguide and sensing electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the waveguide so as to determine if the waveguide includes a compatible photochromic portion.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0028">The present invention provides a method of controlling the operation of a mechanism, preferably a dispensing mechanism, by selectively inputting electromagnetic radiation into a waveguide, sensing transmitted electromagnetic radiation through the waveguide and controlling operation based on whether or not the sensed radiation indicates the waveguide may have a photochromic dye, including one or more of a reversible photochromic portion and an irreversible photochromic portion.

<p id="p-0027" num="0029">In accordance with the present invention, there is provided various combinations of features of the optical waveguide, the electromagnetic emitter and the electromagnetic sensor for determining whether any particular waveguide is compatible with a mechanism with which it is to be associated. The waveguides may have a varying combination of features of: (1) permanent capabilities for specific electromagnetic light wave absorption and transmission as by having a permanent colour, and (2) variable capabilities for light absorption and transmission as via the use of photochromic dyes which may be reversible and/or irreversible. Any combination of one or more of these features may be used alone or together in combination with other features such as size, position and placement of the waveguides and the use of frangible elements on the waveguide to provide advantageous arrangements for uniquely coding and keying waveguide containing components for use in specific mechanisms and methods for determination if any of the waveguide containing components meet the criteria of any specific of the mechanisms.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0128" num="0130">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which illustrates a dispenser assembly <b>10</b> in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The dispenser assembly <b>10</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, includes a removable reservoir assembly <b>12</b> adapted to be secured to a housing formed by a combination of a backplate assembly <b>14</b>, a presser member <b>15</b> and a shroud <b>16</b>. The backplate assembly <b>14</b> has a generally forwardly directed faceplate <b>17</b> from which a horizontally disposed support plate <b>18</b> extends forwardly supported by two side plates <b>19</b>. The presser member <b>15</b> is pivotally mounted to the backplate assembly <b>14</b> between the two side plates <b>19</b> with stub axles <b>20</b> received in journaling bores <b>21</b> in each of the side plates <b>19</b>. The housing is completed by the shroud <b>16</b> being coupled to the backplate assembly <b>14</b> to substantially enclose the support plate <b>18</b> and the presser member <b>15</b>. The reservoir assembly <b>12</b> is adapted to removably couple to the assembled housing.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0131">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> comprises a reservoir bottle <b>22</b>, a pump assembly <b>25</b> and a key collar <b>26</b>. The bottle <b>22</b> has a threaded neck <b>27</b> about an outlet <b>28</b>. A locking tab <b>29</b> extends forwardly and axially relative to the threaded neck <b>27</b> and is of generally rectangular shape in horizontal, axial cross-section having flat parallel side faces and an end face normal thereto. The pump assembly <b>25</b> includes a piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> having an outer flange <b>31</b> which is internally threaded such that the outer flange <b>31</b> may be threadably engaged onto the threaded neck <b>27</b>. The pump assembly <b>25</b> further includes a piston <b>32</b> and a valve member <b>33</b>. The piston <b>32</b> is reciprocally movable coaxially within a cylindrical chamber formed within the piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> so as to dispense fluid from inside the bottle <b>22</b> out of the outlet <b>28</b> internally through the piston <b>32</b> and out a discharge opening <b>34</b> of the outer end of the piston <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0132">The bottle <b>22</b> and pump assembly <b>25</b> is shown assembled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. To the assembly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the key collar <b>26</b> is applied by sliding the collar <b>26</b> axially upwardly such that the collar <b>26</b> comes to be engaged in a snap-fit upon the outer flange <b>31</b> against removal from the outer flange <b>31</b> and with the locking tab <b>29</b> engaging in a slotway <b>46</b> on the collar <b>26</b> so as to prevent rotation of the collar <b>26</b> relative to the bottle <b>22</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the collar <b>26</b> has an axial upper end <b>35</b> and an axial lower end <b>36</b> with a central, generally cylindrical opening <b>37</b> extending therethrough. A generally cylindrical side wall <b>38</b> about the opening <b>37</b> carries approximate the lower end <b>36</b> three radially inwardly extending lower shoulder members <b>39</b> presenting stop shoulders <b>80</b> directed axially toward the upper end <b>35</b>. Approximate the upper end <b>35</b>, the side wall <b>38</b> includes three radially inwardly directed upper shoulder members <b>40</b>. The upper shoulder members <b>40</b> have a catch surface <b>81</b> directed towards the lower end <b>36</b> and a bevelled camming surface <b>82</b> directed towards the upper end <b>35</b>. On sliding of the collar <b>26</b> coaxially upwardly onto the outer flange <b>31</b>, the camming surface <b>82</b> of the upper shoulder members <b>40</b> engage with an outer lower surface <b>83</b> of the outer flange <b>31</b> biasing the upper shoulder members <b>40</b> radially outwardly to permit the outer flange <b>31</b> to move relative the collar <b>26</b> axially toward the lower end <b>36</b> into the opening <b>37</b> of the collar <b>26</b>. Once an upper end <b>84</b> of the outer flange <b>31</b> becomes located below the upper shoulder member <b>40</b>, the upper shoulder member <b>40</b> returns to its inherent unbiased position with the catch surface <b>81</b> disposed above the upper end <b>84</b> of the outer flange <b>31</b> radially inwardly therefrom thus locking the outer flange <b>31</b> between the stop shoulders <b>80</b> of the lower shoulder member <b>39</b> and the catch surface <b>81</b> of the upper shoulder member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0133">The collar <b>26</b> carries on its upper end <b>35</b> a pair of upwardly extending lock tabs <b>45</b> providing a slotway <b>46</b> therebetween. The slotway <b>46</b> is sized to closely receive the locking tab <b>29</b> of the bottle <b>22</b> therebetween. When coupling the collar <b>26</b> onto the assembled bottle <b>22</b> and pump assembly <b>25</b>, the slotway <b>46</b> is circumferentially aligned with the locking tab <b>29</b> on the bottle <b>22</b> such that the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> when fully assembled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has the locking tab <b>29</b> on the bottle <b>22</b> received within the slotway <b>46</b> preventing relative rotation of the collar <b>26</b> and bottle <b>12</b>. In the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> and the collar <b>26</b> are secured to the bottle <b>22</b> against removal. That is, the key collar <b>26</b> and piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> are preferably secured on the bottle <b>22</b> substantially against removal other than by significant breaking or deformation of the bottle <b>22</b> or key collar <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0134">The extent to which removal or attempted removal of the collar <b>26</b> and/or pump assembly <b>25</b> is possible or is not possible, or may require destruction of one or more of the bottle <b>22</b>, key collar <b>26</b> or piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> can be selected as desired. For example, at the time of assembly, the bottle <b>22</b>, piston chamber forming member <b>30</b> and collar <b>26</b> can be permanently secured together as with glue or by sonic welding.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0135">In a preferred embodiment, the interior side wall <b>38</b> of the collar <b>26</b> may be knurled with axially extending alternating ribs and slotways only partially shown at <b>170</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> such that a complementarily knurled outer surface of the outer flange <b>31</b> having axially extending alternating ribs and slotways may couple with ribs on the side wall <b>38</b> preventing relative rotation of the piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> relative to the collar <b>26</b> once the collar is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0136">With the backplate assembly <b>14</b>, presser member <b>15</b> and shroud <b>16</b> assembled and, for example, secured to a wall, the assembled reservoir assembly <b>12</b> may be coupled thereto by the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> moving vertically downwardly relative the backplate assembly <b>14</b> with the collar member <b>26</b> and pump assembly <b>25</b> to pass vertically downwardly through an opening <b>190</b> in the plate <b>18</b>, and the entire reservoir assembly <b>12</b> then being urged rearwardly to engage a rear support portion <b>191</b> of the plate <b>18</b> above the collar <b>26</b> and below a lower shoulder <b>192</b> on the bottle placing the piston <b>32</b> into a position for coupling with or in which it is coupled with the presser member <b>15</b>. Removal of the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> is accomplished by reversed movement forwardly then upwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0137">The backplate assembly <b>14</b> includes and carries an activation unit <b>48</b> best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The activation unit <b>48</b> includes as only schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an electric motor <b>49</b> which rotates via a series of gears <b>50</b>, a drive wheel <b>51</b> carrying an eccentrically mounted axially extending cam post <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The cam post <b>52</b> couples to an inner end of the presser member <b>15</b> such that in rotation of the drive wheel <b>51</b> in one full revolution, the presser member <b>15</b> is pivoted about its stub axles <b>20</b> downwardly and then upwardly, returning to the same position. The presser member <b>15</b> is coupled to the piston <b>32</b> by engagement between catch members (not shown) carried by the presser member <b>15</b> with an engagement flange <b>54</b> on the piston <b>32</b>. Such catch members and engagement may be similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,373,970 to Ophardt dated Dec. 20, 1994, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, which engagement necessarily results on coupling of the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> with the backplate assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0138">In one cycle of operation, the motor <b>49</b> is operated so as to rotate the drive wheel <b>51</b> 360 degrees and thus move the piston <b>32</b> in a single stroke inwardly and outwardly to dispense an allotment of fluid from the bottle <b>22</b>. The motor <b>49</b> is an electric motor and its operation may be controlled by a control mechanism receiving various inputs. The activation unit <b>48</b> shown is adapted to be used as a touchless dispenser in which the presence of a user's hand below the presser member <b>15</b> underneath the discharge outlet <b>34</b> is sensed by a hand sensing system including an electromagnetic radiation emitter <b>53</b> located at the bottom front of the activator unit <b>48</b> to direct radiation downwardly and forwardly towards the position the user's hand is to be placed and an electromagnetic radiation sensor <b>54</b> also located near the bottom front of the activation unit <b>48</b> adapted to sense radiation reflected off the user's hand. The hand sensing system, on suitable receipt of reflected radiation from the hand, provides a suitable signal to the control mechanism indicating the presence of the hand, for example, satisfying at least one condition for operation of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0139">While the use of a hand sensing mechanism involving electromagnetic emitter <b>53</b> and sensor <b>54</b> is illustrated, many other systems may be provided to provide a primary indication that fluid should be dispensed. For example, these could include providing a simple on/off switch to be manually activated, or a requirement for identification as by use of a fingerprint as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,206,238 to Ophardt, issued Mar. 27, 2001.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0140">The activation unit <b>48</b> also includes portions of an optical key system towards determining if the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> is compatible with the activation unit <b>48</b>, that is, whether the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> meets pre-selected criteria to permit use with the activation unit <b>48</b>. The activation unit <b>48</b> includes an electromagnetic radiation key emitter <b>55</b> and an electromagnetic radiation key sensor <b>56</b>. Each is provided on the front face of the activation unit <b>48</b> on an upper portion of the activation unit and directed forwardly. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the key emitter <b>55</b> includes a generally cylindrical shroud <b>57</b> about its lamp and the key sensor <b>56</b> includes a similar shroud <b>58</b> about its sensor, which shrouds <b>57</b> and <b>58</b> substantially prevent any transmission of electromagnetic radiation therethrough and effectively serve to directionalize the key emitter <b>55</b> and key sensor <b>56</b> so as to restrict emissions or receptions of either to light passing through the outer end of the shrouds <b>57</b> and <b>58</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>, the collar <b>26</b> has two arms <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> which extend rearwardly from the collar <b>26</b> toward each of the key emitter <b>55</b> and key sensor <b>57</b>. The collar <b>26</b> provides an electromagnetic radiation waveguide from an end face <b>62</b> at the end of arm <b>60</b> through the collar <b>26</b> to the face <b>63</b> at the end of the arm <b>61</b> providing an outlet to the waveguide. The waveguide is schematically illustrated in dashed lines as <b>64</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as extending in a generally U-shape within a U-shaped rim <b>65</b> of material disposed proximate the upper end <b>35</b> of the collar <b>26</b> about its outer periphery.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0141">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, electromagnetic radiation emitted by the key emitter <b>55</b> enters the waveguide <b>64</b> via the inlet end face <b>62</b> and is conducted via the waveguide <b>64</b> through the collar <b>26</b> with electromagnetic radiation to exit the waveguide <b>64</b> via the outlet end face <b>63</b> with the radiation exiting the waveguide via the outlet end face <b>63</b> to be sensed by the key sensor <b>56</b>. The activation unit <b>48</b> includes a key control system under which as a prerequisite to dispensing, having regard to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the key emitter <b>55</b>, the electromagnetic radiation sensed by the key sensor <b>56</b> is to comply with one or more pre-selected parameters. As by way of a non-limiting example, the key emitter <b>55</b> may emit electromagnetic radiation within a selected range of wave lengths and, in the absence of the key sensor <b>56</b> sensing electromagnetic radiation within the range of emitted radiation, the motor <b>49</b> may not be permitted to operate. Thus, in the simplest case, should a non-compliant reservoir assembly <b>12</b> which has the bottle <b>22</b>, pump assembly <b>25</b> but not the collar <b>26</b>, be coupled to the backplate assembly <b>14</b> and would not have a waveguide, the radiation of a selected wavelength emitted by key emitter <b>55</b> would not be directed to or sensed by the key sensor <b>56</b> and the control mechanism of the activation unit would not permit dispensing.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0142">In the preferred embodiment, the collar <b>26</b> may preferably be formed as by injection moulding from a plastic material which permits transmission of electromagnetic radiation therethrough. As is known to a person skilled in the art, various plastic materials such as polycarbonate plastics can be used which provide a resultant product having electromagnetic radiation transmitting properties. Radiation which may enter the light transmitting collar <b>26</b> as by being directed normal to the inlet end face <b>62</b> will, to some extent, be reflected internally by reason of such light impinging at relatively low angles on the external surfaces of the collar forming effectively the sides of the wave guide. A portion of the radiation directed into the collar <b>26</b> is passed through the collar <b>26</b> as around the U-shaped external rim <b>65</b> with some proportion of the radiation to be directed substantially perpendicular to the exit end face <b>63</b> to exit the waveguide and be sensed by the key sensor <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0143">The collar <b>26</b> may be formed as unitary element all from the same radiation transmitting properties or may be formed from a number of different materials. For example, to increase internal reflection, exterior surfaces of the collar <b>26</b> especially about the rim <b>65</b> could be coated with a reflective material other than on the inlet end face <b>62</b> and the outlet end face <b>63</b>. The collar <b>26</b> may be formed such that merely a U-shaped portion of the collar, for example, substantially corresponding to the U-shaped rim <b>65</b> may comprise light transmitting materials and the remainder of the collar may be formed of other plastic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0144">The collar <b>26</b> may be formed to incorporate therein one or more pre-existing optical fibres, for example, disposed to extend internally within the U-shaped rim as with an inlet end of an optical fibre to be presented at the inlet end face <b>62</b> and an outlet end of the optical fibre to be presented at an outlet end face <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0145">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> which shows a second embodiment of a collar <b>26</b> in accordance with the present invention which will have, when assembled, an identical appearance to the collar <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The collar <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is formed from three pieces, namely, a base <b>66</b>, a top <b>67</b> and an optical fibre member <b>68</b>. The base <b>66</b> and top <b>67</b> are injection moulded from plastic and are adapted to snap-fit together against separation. The base <b>66</b> has an upwardly directed U-shaped half channel <b>69</b> formed therein and the top <b>67</b> has a similar downwardly directed U-shaped half channel <b>96</b>. The optical fibre <b>68</b> is positioned sandwiched between the base <b>66</b> and top <b>77</b> received between the half channel member <b>69</b> carried on the base and the half channel member <b>96</b> carried on the top. The optical fibre <b>68</b> has a first end <b>97</b> open to the end face <b>62</b> of the arm <b>60</b> and a second end <b>98</b> open to the end face <b>63</b> of the arm <b>61</b> such that the optical fibre member <b>68</b> provides the waveguide through the collar <b>26</b>. In the assembled collar <b>26</b>, the optical fibre member <b>68</b> is secured within the collar <b>26</b> against removal. The optical fibre member <b>68</b> may comprise a short length of a conventional optical fibre or may preferably comprise an extrusion of plastic material having appropriate light transmitting properties such as a cylindrical extrusion of flexible polycarbonate or other plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0146">The channelway which is formed by combination of the half channels <b>69</b> and <b>96</b> may preferably have adjacent each end face <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> a port portion of restricted cross-sectional closely sized to tightly hold each end of the optical fibre member <b>68</b> therein and with interior portions of the channelway interior from the port portions of increased diameter to facilitate easy insertion of interior portions of the optical fibre members <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0147">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> which illustrates a third embodiment of a collar <b>26</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at the rear end of the collar <b>26</b>, an internal compartment <b>102</b> is provided closed at its rear by a rear wall <b>110</b> having four port portions <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> therethrough. Two optical fibre members <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> are shown. Each optical fibre has a first end secured in one of the port portions and a second end secured in another of the port portions such that each optical fibre member provides a respective waveguide from one port portion to a second port portion. Opposite each of the port portions, four elements <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>213</b> and <b>214</b> are schematically shown, each of which is intended to schematically illustrate either a key emitter or a key sensor to be carried on an activation unit such as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> suitably located in front of a respective of the port portions. Of the four elements, preferably, at least one comprises an emitter and at least one comprises a sensor. In one preferred embodiment, each of these elements may each comprise either an emitter or a sensor or, preferably, both. Preferably, each of the elements <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>213</b> and <b>214</b> are carried on a computerized control circuit permitting selected operation of each of the elements either as an emitter or a sensor or to be inoperative. Such an activation unit can be electronically keyed to adopt a particular configuration of sensors and emitters.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0148">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, two optical fibre members <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> are shown. It is to be appreciated that merely one optical fibre member need to be provided. For example, a single optical fibre member could be provided to connect any two of the port portions. For example, an optical fibre could have one end connected to the port portion <b>111</b> and a second end connected to any one of the port portions <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> or <b>114</b>. In a simple configuration, the element <b>121</b> could be programmed to be a key emitter and a selected one of the elements <b>212</b>, <b>213</b> and <b>214</b> could be selected to be a sensor having regard to the corresponding port portion to which the end of a single optical fibre member may be connected. The collar member thus, by suitable positioning of the optical fibre member, may be configured to provide a waveguide at a matching location. If desired, a second optical fibre member could be used to couple the remaining two of the port portions which are not assumed by the first optical fibre member as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0149">Each of the optical fibres which is used may have different radiation transmission characteristics. For example, one of the optical fibre members may be tinted blue such that that optical fibre serves as a filter to prevent passage therethrough of light which is not within a range of corresponding blue wavelengths. Similarly, the other optical fibre could be tinted red and yellow so as to act as filters merely permitting the passage of red or yellow wavelength light.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0150">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> which illustrates a fourth embodiment of a wave guide in accordance with the present invention similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, however, incorporating three different optical fibres <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>107</b>. Additionally, each of the port portions <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are each shown as having three opening therethrough, each of which opening is adapted to receive the end of one optical fibre member. Thus, up to three optical fibre members can be received in each port portion. In the particular configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a first end of each of the three optical fibres is connected to the port portion <b>111</b>, however, merely one end of a different one of the three optical fibres is connected to each of the ports <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and <b>114</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as one preferred non-limiting example, the optical fibre <b>105</b> preferably is tinted blue so as to act as a filter and prevent the passage of light other than of corresponding blue wavelength light therethrough. The optical fibre <b>106</b> is tinted red and acts as a filter to prevent the passage of light other than corresponding red wavelength light therethrough. The optical fibre <b>107</b> is tinted yellow and acts as a filter to prevent the passage of light other than corresponding yellow wavelength light therethrough. The element <b>211</b> may be adapted to selectively emit light containing all of blue, red and yellow light or merely one or more of blue, red or yellow light at different times and each of the sensors <b>212</b>, <b>213</b> and <b>217</b> will look at an appropriate time for light, the absence of light of any wavelength or, alternatively, light at a selected blue, red and/or yellow wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0151">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> which illustrates a fifth embodiment of a collar member <b>26</b> having similarities to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, however, in which the optical fibre members have been removed and are to be replaced by one of the three waveguide inserts shown as <b>171</b>, <b>172</b> and <b>173</b> in schematic exploded perspective in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Each of the waveguide inserts is preferably injection moulded from a light transmitting material such as polycarbonate. Insert <b>171</b> is adapted to provide light transmission from the portal portion <b>111</b> to the portal portion <b>114</b>. An insert <b>172</b> is adapted to be inserted as shown to provide communication between portal <b>111</b> and portal <b>113</b> or if inverted 180 degrees to provide communication between portal <b>112</b> and portal <b>114</b>. Insert <b>173</b> is adapted to provide communication between portals <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>. By the suitable selection of a relatively simple injection moulded plastic insert <b>171</b>, <b>172</b> or <b>173</b>, the collar member <b>26</b> may be configured to have a desired waveguide therein. Each of the inserts may be provided to have different radiation transmission properties and may, for example, act as a colour filter. Each insert <b>171</b>, <b>172</b> and <b>173</b> is sized to closely fit inside the compartment <b>102</b> with side locating tabs <b>174</b> provided to extend the side-to-side dimension of inserts <b>172</b> and <b>173</b>. Each insert has two faces <b>176</b> and <b>177</b> to serve as an inlet/outlet to its waveguide relative its respective portals. Curved portions <b>178</b> and <b>179</b> of the wall of the insets opposite the faces <b>176</b> and <b>177</b> assist in directing radiation internally from one face to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0152">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> which schematically illustrates a sixth embodiment of the collar and key sensing system in accordance with the present invention. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the collar <b>26</b> is identical to the collar in the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> with the exception that the arms <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> are removed and a key member <b>70</b> is provided to extend rearwardly. The actuation unit <b>48</b> is modified such that a key emitter <b>71</b> is located to one side of the key member <b>70</b> directing radiation sideways through the key member <b>70</b> and a key sensor <b>72</b> is on the other side of the key member <b>70</b> directed sideways. In this manner, the key emitter <b>71</b> directs radiation into an inlet face <b>74</b> on one side of the key member <b>70</b> and the key sensor <b>72</b> senses radiation passing outwardly through an outlet face <b>75</b> on the other side of the key member <b>70</b>. The key member <b>70</b> preferably provides a waveguide for transmission of electromagnetic radiation. As one non-limiting example, the waveguide may include a waveguide which acts like a filter which substantially prevents any transmission of radiation therethrough of light of a first certain characteristic or wavelength yet lets light of a second characteristic or wavelength pass through, and the key sensor <b>72</b> at the time light of both the first and second certain characteristic or wavelengths is emitted by the key emitter <b>71</b> looks for the absence of light of the first characteristic or wavelength and the presence of light of the second characteristic or wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0153">With the key member <b>70</b> located in a vertical slotway between the key emitter <b>71</b> and the key sensor <b>72</b>, their engagement can prevent relative rotation of the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> relative the backplate assembly <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0154">While the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a collar merely with the key members, it is to be appreciated that a modified collar could be provided in having both the arms <b>64</b> and <b>65</b> providing a first waveguide and the key block providing a second guide and that two separate key emitters may be provided and two separate key sensors may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0155">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> which illustrates a seventh embodiment of a key member in accordance with the present invention which has features similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a central key member <b>70</b> is provided serving as a waveguide for passage of radiation laterally therethrough. On either side of the key member <b>70</b>, there are provided a pair of waveguide extensions <b>151</b> and <b>152</b> adapted to be securely carried on the backplate assembly. Each waveguide extension includes an outer face <b>153</b> or <b>154</b> directed laterally towards a respective face <b>74</b> or <b>75</b> of the key member <b>70</b> and an inner end <b>155</b> or <b>156</b> directed rearwardly and adapted for optical coupling with a key emitter/sensor element <b>71</b> or <b>72</b> also carried on the backplate assembly. As in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the collar <b>26</b> includes at the end of each arm <b>60</b> and <b>61</b>, end faces <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> served to be optically coupled with two key emitters/sensors <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> carried on the activation unit.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0156">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a portion of the waveguide is provided as the waveguide extensions <b>151</b> and <b>152</b> on the activation unit and a portion of the waveguide is provided as the key member <b>40</b> on the collar member <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0157">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> which illustrates a selective optical coupling mechanism illustrating a pair of key emitter or sensor elements <b>56</b> and <b>57</b> disposed opposite to optical first windows <b>163</b>, <b>164</b> carried in a coupling unit <b>165</b>. The coupling unit <b>165</b> is a generally rectangular shaped member with a pair of cavities <b>166</b>, <b>167</b> having a narrow end <b>168</b> open to the first windows <b>163</b>, <b>164</b> and a wide end <b>169</b> open to second windows <b>181</b>, <b>182</b>, <b>183</b> with two for each of the cavities. A waveguide member <b>184</b> having a generally parallelogram shape is adapted to be received within either cavity <b>166</b> or <b>167</b> in a position which connects a first window to one of the second windows. The waveguide member <b>184</b> can be rotated 180 degrees and placed in a cavity so as to provide a waveguide between a first window at the first end and a different other of the second window at the second end. Such an arrangement can be provided either in a cavity in the collar member <b>26</b> or in a portion of a cavity on the activation unit and thus can form another method for mechanically selecting a relative path of a portion of the waveguide either carried by the collar <b>26</b> or the activation member <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0158">It is to be appreciated that different waveguide members <b>184</b> may have different properties such as different abilities to transmit, filter, block or polarize electromagnetic radiation passed therethrough. For example, a plurality of such members could be provided of different tinted colours, blue, red, yellow, green and the like and provide simple members which can be readily manually inserted to a customized activation member or a collar member for a particular desired configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0159">In accordance with the present invention, the electromagnetic radiation may be selected having regard to pre-selected parameters. These parameters may include radiation within one or more ranges of wavelengths, electromagnetic radiation within one or more ranges of intensity, polarized electromagnetic radiation, and electromagnetic radiation within one or more ranges of duration and at one or more different points in time.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0160">The waveguide which is provided may have electromagnetic radiation transmitted properties selected from a plurality of properties and including the ability to transmit one or more ranges of wavelengths and or the ability to block one or more ranges of wavelengths, the ability to restrict the intensity of electromagnetic radiation which can be transmitted through the waveguide, preferably, as a function of most of the waveguide. The transmission properties may restrict the transmission of radiation having a first range of wavelengths yet permit transmission of radiation having a range of second wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0161">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> which illustrate cross-sections through the collar <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> along section lines A and B, respectively, in axially extending planes which extend radially from a center through the central opening <b>37</b>. In each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, the radially extending rim <b>65</b> is shown as rectangular in cross-section containing and effectively forming throughout the inner rectangular cross-sectional area of the rim <b>65</b> the waveguide <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates a schematic cross-sectional similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, however, at a cross-sectional point in between section lines A and B at a point in between a circumferential end of the shoulder member <b>40</b> and before the stop shoulder <b>80</b> is provided. The cross-sectional area shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> superimposes a dashed line showing the outline of the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. The cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is of a considerably reduced cross-sectional area compared to that shown in either <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> or <b>17</b>. That circumferential portion of the collar <b>26</b> represented by the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> comprises, in effect, a frangible portion. Insofar as a person may attempt to remove the collar <b>26</b> from engagement on the reservoir assembly, circumferentially applied forces on being transmitted to the reduced cross-sectional segment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> will result in breaking and rupture of the collar through this reduced cross-sectional area, thus, breaking and rupturing the wave guide <b>64</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the cross-sectional area of the waveguide <b>64</b> is shown to be a reduced sized triangular portion compared to the rectangular area shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>. The cross-sectional area of the waveguide through the frangible portion is selected to be adequate to permit radiation to pass through the waveguide in normal use. When the collar member <b>26</b> may be broken by circumferential severing through the reduced cross-sectional area portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the waveguide <b>64</b> will be broken with the broken waveguide preferably preventing or impairing the ability of the waveguide to transfer radiation through the break point. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, it is expected that initial fracture may occur in the lower portion below the triangular waveguide which may assist in splitting through the waveguide from the lower apex of the triangular waveguide upwardly to a wider portion at the top.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0163">Many modifications and variations of frangible waveguides or waveguides which will break if a collar is attempted to be physically removed can be envisioned. For example, in the context of a waveguide which incorporates a pre-existing optical fibre member such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a mechanism can be structured to sever the optical fibre member as a requirement of removal of the collar.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0164">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> which illustrates a schematic pictorial view of a portion of a waveguide <b>200</b> formed from three modular waveguide elements <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b>. The waveguide element <b>201</b> has a first end face <b>210</b> and a second end face <b>211</b>. The member <b>201</b> is a constant cross-sectional shape between the end faces. As schematically illustrated by the parallel lines <b>212</b>, the guide wave member <b>201</b> is polarized so as to restrict light passing between the end faces <b>210</b> and <b>211</b> to being light which propagates parallel to each other in a certain direction. Waveguide member <b>212</b> is identical to waveguide member <b>210</b>, however, is shown in the embodiment as rotated 90 degrees such that it has the schematic parallel lines <b>212</b> of waveguide member <b>202</b> is perpendicular to the parallel lines <b>212</b> on the waveguide member <b>201</b>. When arranged in this configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, the waveguide members <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> effectively block all light transmission therethrough. Waveguide member <b>203</b> is shown as a similarly sized waveguide member which may be selected, for example, to be of a particular colour such as the colour blue. The waveguide members <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> are each modular members which can be replaced or substituted by other members and thus by simple insertion or removal of different modular members provide for different light transmission characteristics of the resultant waveguide. While the waveguide member <b>203</b> is shown as being of a particular colour, it is to be appreciated that each of the waveguides <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> could be provided as modular elements in a plurality of different colours.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0165">Each of the waveguide members <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> may be stacked immediately adjacent to each other and, for example, to form a central portion of the replaceable waveguide <b>184</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. It is to be appreciated that in a manner similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a coupling unit similar to <b>165</b> could be provided as with a rectangular recess so as to receive each of the three waveguide members <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> aligned in a row.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0166">One or more of the waveguide members <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> may be provided as part of a waveguide on the activation unit and any one or more of the waveguide members <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> or <b>203</b> or other similar modular waveguide members may be provided on the collar <b>26</b>. Further, insofar as the waveguide may have different abilities to polarize light passing therethrough, such a waveguide may be used with either an emitter of polarized light or a sensor sensitive to polarized light.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0167">The use of a plurality of different modular guide members such as <b>201</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>203</b> to form the waveguide can provide a simplistic mechanism for customizing the waveguide to have selected key features.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0168">In the preferred embodiments illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in combination with a suitable waveguide, there is shown both a key emitter <b>55</b> and a key sensor <b>56</b>. It is not necessary in accordance with the present invention that a key emitter <b>55</b> be provided. The electromagnetic radiation to pass through the waveguide and be sensed by the key sensor may originate from an external light source such as, for example, the ambient light in any environment, for example, ambient light from lighting within a washroom or natural sunlight. For example, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the front portion of the shroud <b>16</b> indicated as <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> could be provided to transmit electromagnetic radiation therethrough which may impinge on a frontmost surface <b>221</b> of the collar <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> which could be flattened and directed forwardly so as to provide an entry point for light into the waveguide contained in the collar. In this case, merely the radiation sensor <b>56</b> need be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0169">Alternatively, entrance for ambient air to the waveguide could be provided at the sides or bottom of the waveguide through a suitable face in the waveguide disposed to permit entry into the waveguide of electromagnetic radiation from an external source. As another example, in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bottle and fluid within the bottle <b>22</b> may be provided to be electromagnetic radiation transmitting with light to pass downwardly through the bottle <b>22</b> through the lower shoulder <b>192</b> and down onto an upwardly directed surface of the collar <b>26</b>. The waveguide may then comprise the walls and shoulder of the bottle <b>22</b>, the fluid in the bottle as well as the collar <b>26</b>. Suitable selection of the radiation transmission properties therefore of the bottle walls and bottom and the fluid to be dispensed can be utilized in establishing pre-selected keying features.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0170">Insofar as light may pass downwardly through the shoulder <b>192</b> in the bottle <b>22</b> to the collar <b>26</b>, it would be possible to incorporate a component of the pump assembly such as a radially outwardly extending flange of the piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> as being part of the waveguide and in such an event, the waveguide might incorporate a path downwardly through the shoulder <b>192</b> of the bottle past or through the support plate <b>18</b> and axially through the outer flange <b>31</b> of the piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> as to a portion of the waveguide as to a sensor disposed axially below the outer flange <b>31</b>. Preferably, the waveguide would be at least partially through the collar <b>26</b> at some portion such as axially through the collar or radially outwardly through a portion of the collar <b>26</b> which would serve as a waveguide to couple light from the outer flange <b>31</b> to a sensor carried on the activation unit <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0171">Rather than use ambient light to pass through portions of the bottle and/or fluid in the bottle, a separate emitter could be provided as, for example, to pass radiation downwardly or sideways or otherwise which would pass through a portion of the bottle and/or the fluid in the bottle to be received by a sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0172">As to the nature of electromagnetic radiation to be used, many conventionally available sensors and/or emitters are available for use in emitting and sensing electromagnetic radiation in the visible light spectrum. This is not necessary, however, and electromagnetic radiation outside the visible spectrum may be used. This could be advantageous as, for example, to mask the nature of any modular components which may comprise a portion of a waveguide. For example, whether or not any modular waveguide element may appear to have a visible colour such as blue, red or yellow, insofar as it is adapted for transmission of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, then the presence or absence of colour in the modular unit could assist in fooling an imitator.</p>

Providing such locking tabs are preferred, however, the locking tabs need not as in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> be provided on the front of the collar facing outwardly but could be provided at other locations as on the rear of the collar diametric to the position shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Secondly, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, bridging between the arm <b>60</b> and the arm <b>61</b>, there is provided a thin frangible member <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows in addition to the key collar <b>26</b>, a separate board <b>218</b> which carries a key emitter <b>55</b> and a key sensor <b>56</b>.

Arm <b>61</b> includes an end face <b>63</b> which is shown as being normal to the key sensor <b>56</b> and is engaged by the key sensor. The arm <b>60</b> includes a reflecting outer side shoulder surface <b>222</b> disposed at 45 degrees to the end face <b>62</b>. Arm <b>61</b> similarly includes a reflecting outer side shoulder surface <b>223</b> at 45 degrees to the end face <b>63</b>. The arms <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> are joined by a bridge member <b>221</b> formed by a projection <b>224</b>, the frangible member <b>220</b> and a projection <b>225</b>. The arm <b>60</b> has the projection <b>224</b> extending laterally inwardly to an end face <b>226</b> disposed normal to the end face <b>62</b>.

An alternate longer optical path <b>264</b> is shown in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> as extending internally of the arm <b>60</b> and around the circumference of the key collar <b>26</b> and, hence, via the arm <b>61</b> to the key sensor <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0177">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> which illustrates a cross-sectional side view along section C-C&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> through the frangible member <b>220</b> and which therefore shows the projection <b>224</b> not in cross-section. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> schematically illustrates, as seen in cross-section, a pair of resilient catch members <b>230</b> and <b>231</b> secured to the activation unit <b>48</b> similar to the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Preferably, coupling of the key collar <b>26</b> to the activation unit <b>48</b> is accomplished by rearward sliding of the key collar <b>26</b> towards the activation unit <b>48</b> in a direction indicated by the arrow <b>239</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0178">The two resilient catch members <b>230</b> and <b>231</b> are schematically shown in cross-section as secured to the activation unit <b>48</b>. Each catch member <b>230</b> and <b>231</b> has a forwardly directed cam surface <b>232</b> and <b>233</b>, respectively, which on relative rearward movement of the key collar <b>26</b> will engage the frangible member <b>220</b> and cause deflection of the resilient catch members <b>230</b> and <b>231</b> upwardly or downwardly out of the path of the frangible member <b>220</b> until the frangible member <b>220</b> is received rearward of the respective catch shoulders <b>234</b> and <b>235</b> on each of the catch members <b>230</b> and <b>231</b>, whereupon the catch members <b>230</b> and <b>231</b> will under their inherent bias move to assume a latched position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> with their catch shoulders <b>234</b> and <b>235</b> disposed forwardly of a forward surface of the frangible member <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0179">With removal of the key collar <b>26</b> by forward sliding of the key collar away from the activation unit <b>48</b>, the catch members <b>230</b> and <b>231</b> will engage the frangible member <b>220</b> and prevent its forward movement. The frangible member <b>220</b> is preferably of a material and has a construction which will be broken and severed under manual forces which can be readily applied in sliding the key collar <b>26</b> forwardly. As a result, with forward movement of the key collar <b>26</b> and removal of the key collar <b>26</b> from coupling with the activation unit <b>48</b>, the frangible member <b>220</b> is broken and preferably severed from the key collar <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0180">As a result, if the key collar <b>26</b> with the broken or removed frangible member <b>220</b> is reinserted into the dispenser, then there will no longer exist the optical path <b>64</b> for transmission of electromagnetic radiation through the frangible member <b>220</b>. Thus, the electromagnetic transmission properties of the waveguide formed within the key collar <b>26</b> will have been changed by severing the frangible member <b>220</b> on removal of the key collar <b>26</b>. The nature of the electromagnetic radiation sensed by the key sensor <b>26</b> will be altered and the dispenser control mechanism can give suitable instructions as to how to deal with this event as, for example, to not permit operation of the dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0181">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> which shows an eighth embodiment of the key collar <b>26</b> similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> but with a few differences. Firstly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the arm <b>60</b> and the arm <b>61</b> are joined by the bridge member <b>221</b> which is of substantially constant cross-sectional area normal to the end faces <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> between the two arms <b>60</b> and <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0182">Secondly, extending laterally from outside surface <b>238</b> of the arm <b>61</b>, there is provided a cantilevered frangible member <b>220</b> having but one end secured to the arm <b>60</b>. The frangible member <b>220</b> has a cross-sectional area normal to the end face <b>62</b> of the arm <b>61</b> which is significantly reduced compared to that of the arm <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0183">As contrasted with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, two key emitters are provided, a first key emitter <b>55</b> and a second parallel key emitter <b>255</b>. The first key emitter <b>55</b> is disposed to direct radiation into the end face <b>62</b> of the arm <b>60</b>. The second key emitter <b>255</b> is located to engage a surface <b>262</b> on the frangible member <b>220</b> and to direct radiation into the frangible member <b>220</b>. The key sensor <b>56</b> engages the end face <b>63</b> of the arm <b>61</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the frangible member <b>220</b> is adapted to be severed from or removed from the key collar <b>26</b> on removal of the key collar <b>26</b> from the dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0184">While the frangible member <b>220</b> is coupled to the key collar <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, then electromagnetic radiation from the second key emitter <b>255</b> will enter the waveguide via the frangible member <b>220</b> and will be picked up by the key sensor <b>56</b>. However, insofar as a key collar is coupled on which the frangible member <b>220</b> has been severed from the key collar, then the key sensor <b>56</b> will not pick up radiation from the second emitter <b>255</b>. While two key emitters <b>56</b> and <b>256</b> are provided, only the key emitter <b>255</b> is needed to sense the removal of the frangible member <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0185">The frangible member <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> need not be severed from the key collar <b>26</b>, rather, it may be bent forwardly into, for example, assume a position bent away from the second key emitter <b>256</b> as, for example, to a 45 degree position and would result in a significant change in the waveguide transmission characteristic such that radiation from the second key emitter <b>255</b> would be significantly lessened to the extent it may enter the waveguide and thus be sensed by the key sensor <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0186">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the radiation is directed into the frangible member via the surface <b>262</b> which is in the same plane as end face <b>62</b> on the arm <b>60</b>. Alternatively, the key emitter <b>255</b> may direct radiation into the frangible member <b>220</b> at another location as, for example, at a lateral side surface <b>264</b> of the frangible member <b>220</b>, with the sensor <b>256</b> suitably re-positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows the use of a plurality of key emitters <b>55</b> and <b>255</b> and one key sensor <b>56</b>. Of course, in a similar arrangement, one or more key sensors could be used with at least one key sensor coupled to the frangible member <b>220</b> and one key emitter to input radiation to arm <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0188">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a reservoir bottle <b>22</b> is shown which is similar to the reservoir bottle <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>. As a notable difference, however, the reservoir bottle <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> carries as extending downwardly from its lower edge, a frangible member <b>220</b> which is in the form of a relatively thin plate member formed integrally with the reservoir bottle <b>22</b> as, for example, from plastic material and which is adapted to serve as a portion of a waveguide. The frangible member <b>22</b> is adapted on rearward sliding insertion of the bottle <b>22</b> to slide rearwardly so as to be received between a key emitter <b>355</b> and a key sensor <b>356</b> as schematically illustrated in a horizontal cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. The frangible member <b>220</b> is adapted to be severed or removed on removal of the reservoir bottle <b>22</b>. The frangible member <b>220</b> on the reservoir bottle <b>22</b> is to serve as a portion of a waveguide. The frangible member <b>220</b> on the bottle <b>22</b> may be in substitution of the key collar <b>26</b> and its waveguide as in the other embodiments or in combination therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0189">Frangible members <b>220</b> have been shown as coupled to the reservoir bottle <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> and to the key collar <b>26</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 24</figref>. Similar frangible members forming part of a waveguide may be coupled to the pump assembly as preferably to the piston chamber forming member <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0190">The particular nature of the frangible member <b>220</b> may vary widely. The objective is to provide an arrangement such that with insertion or removal of a removable component, comprising in the case of the preferred embodiment the reservoir assembly <b>12</b>, a portion of a waveguide carried by the removable reservoir assembly <b>12</b> becomes changed such that a control system can recognize a reservoir assembly <b>12</b> which has been coupled or uncoupled more than once and make an appropriate selection as to how to deal with this in control of the dispenser as one example, when the control system recognizes that a reservoir assembly has been coupled or uncoupled more than once then the control system may prevent dispensing of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0191">As another example, when the control system recognizes that a reservoir assembly has been coupled or uncoupled more than once, then the control system may merely permit thereafter a given number of activations of the piston pump after which the control system will prevent dispensing. In the context of the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> there are two distinct optical paths, a first optical paths between key emitter <b>55</b> and key sensor <b>56</b> and a second optical path between key emitter and <b>255</b> and key sensor <b>56</b>. The possibilities for the control system sensing include the following:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0192">A: Double Positive&#x2014;meaning sensing of electromagnetic radiation through the first optical path and sensing electromagnetic radiation through the second optical path;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0193">B: Double Negative&#x2014;meaning no sensing of electromagnetic radiation through the first optical path and no sensing electromagnetic radiation through the second optical path;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0194">C: First Positive/Second Negative&#x2014;meaning sensing of electromagnetic radiation through the first optical path and no sensing of electromagnetic radiation through the second optical path; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0195">D: First Negative/Second Positive&#x2014;meaning no sensing of electromagnetic radiation through the first optical path and sensing of electromagnetic radiation through the second optical path.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0196">A first rule of operation for the control system preferably is that operation is only permitted when the control system senses passage of electromagnetic radiation through the first optical path, that is there is either (A) Double Positive or (C) First Positive/Second Negative.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0197">A counter mechanism for the control system is to count activation of the piston <b>32</b> when there is electromagnetic radiation through the first optical path thus, under either condition (A) double positive or condition (C) First Positive/Second Negative. A second rule of operation is preferably is that after a maximum number of activations have been counted since the last resetting of the counter mechanism that operation of the pump is prevented. The maximum number of operations can be selected having regard to the volume of the fluid in any reservoir assembly which has been applied and the volume of dosage that is the amount of liquid which is to be dispensed by the piston <b>32</b> in a typical activation. If, for example, the reservoir assembly is a 1 liter and the dosage volume is 1 ml then a maximum number of activation could be selected to be, for example, 1000 activations, however, preferably there will be some buffer for inaccuracy of strokes, for example, an additional 5 percent to 25 percent thus representing, for example, as a maximum being selected between preferably 1050 and 1250 activations.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0198">The count preferably may be reset to zero at a time when in sequence the control system after sensing no radiation through the first optical path, that is either condition (B) double negative or condition (D) First Negative/Second Positive the senses (A) Double Positive. This is equivalent to a situation in which the reservoir assembly is removed such that (B) the Double Negative is sensed and then a new reservoir assembly with its fragile member <b>220</b> in tact is applied, in which case the reservoir assembly would be expected to have its reservoir is filled of fluid and it is reasonable to reset the counter to zero and permit in the normal course operation of the dispenser for dispensing of all of the fluid from the reservoir, stopping operation, however, preferably if more than a maximum activations have been carried out as reasonably necessary to empty the reservoir. Having the maximum number of activations used to stop operation when there has been a continuous double positive is not necessary but preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0199">From a condition in which the counter mechanism is counting, if the reservoir assembly is then removed, condition B a Double Negative would be sensed. If the same reservoir assembly is removed and then recoupled, such reservoir assembly will not have the frangible member <b>220</b> attached. On recoupling, there will be a sensing of condition C being First Positive and Second Negative. On such sensing, the control system will not restart the counter to zero but will continue with the same count. This permits a reservoir assembly which has been removed and recoupled to continue to be dispensed, however, only to the maximum number of activations. The same reservoir assembly may thus be removed and recoupled a number of times with a counter mechanism continuing to count and operation being permitted until such time as the maximum number of activations has arisen.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0200">If after removal of a reservoir assembly, a reservoir assembly is coupled which does not include either the first optical path or the second optical path then the condition (B) the double negative arises and no dispensing is permitted. Similarly, if a reservoir assembly might be applied which provides condition (D) of a First Negative and a second positive, then no dispensing arises.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0201">Whether or not the counter mechanism may be operative such that it will stop dispensing during the condition (A) of continuous Double Positive when a mechanism is reached arises, it is preferred that when condition (C) arises with First Positive and Second Negative that the counter mechanism stop dispensing when the maximum number of activations have been reached.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0202">The counter mechanism may have a separate total count function which counts the number of activations of the piston irrespective of whether or not anyone of the conditions A, B, C or D are present as, for example, to provide an indication of the life and overall usage of the dispenser. Of course, the counter mechanism and the maximum for each counter mechanism may be varied depending upon the volume of the reservoir, the nature of the fluid to be dispensed, the size and or stroke of the piston as would be appropriate. As well, the maximums of counter mechanism may be selected so as to ensure that all of the fluid is dispensed or to ensure that activations are stopped before all the fluid may be dispensed from the reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0203">The present invention teaches the use of a dual key system in which two key systems are sensed to control operation of the dispenser. The preferred embodiments teach that both key systems are optical systems. However, this is not necessary and the present invention includes a dual key system where one or both of the key systems are not optical but rather are another type of keying system. Such other types of key systems can include mechanical, magnetic, radio frequency, optical scanner, electrical and capacitor based systems including one or more of such key systems used in combination with each other and with optical key systems. For example, in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 24</figref>, the elements indicated <b>255</b> and <b>355</b> can comprise merely a capacitor which senses the present or absence of the frangible element <b>22</b>. As another alternative, the frangible element <b>220</b> may carry a magnet such as in a form of a magnetic strip and the elements <b>255</b> and <b>355</b> may comprise a magnetic detector. The frangible element <b>220</b> might carry a machine readable optical representation such as a bar code or universal product code and the elements <b>255</b> and <b>355</b> may comprise an optical reader such as a bar code reader. The frangible element <b>220</b> may carry radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag or transponder, whether passive, active or semi-active to be sensed by the element <b>255</b> and <b>355</b> being a complimentary sensory.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0204">Carrying a secondary keying system on the removable reservoir assembly for alteration of the secondary keying system on coupling or uncoupling of the removable reservoir assembly provides in the context of the operation described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, an improved control of the operation of a dispenser permitting as described above, amongst other things, the permitted coupling and recoupling of the same reservoir assembly to the dispenser for dispensing to a maximum number of actuations of the pump as described above. The use of such a frangible member whether optical, magnetic, a RFID tag or a bar code or otherwise could be used not only with the primary keying system disclosed in the present application as being optical but also with other keying systems such as that described in U.S. patent publication US2006/0124662 to Reynolds et al., using an electric coil/capacitor type system. An optical key system is preferred as in the proposed preferred embodiments in that all of the components of the optical key system on the removable reservoir assembly may be conveniently made from plastic as by injection moulding.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0205">As to the change of the characteristics of a waveguide on coupling of the removable reservoir assembly <b>12</b> to the dispenser, it is possible that selected frangible portions on the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> be removed on coupling or insertion rather than on removal. It is not necessary that the waveguide be changed by removal or severing of a frangible member. A portion of the removable reservoir assembly <b>12</b> which comprises a portion of the waveguide may be bended or deflected or otherwise manipulated in a manner so that they can come to be suitably positioned relative to a key emitter or a key sensor on coupling yet on removal or reinsertion would not adopt the same physical configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0206">It may be possible for unauthorized tampering of a device in accordance with the present invention as by the removal of the catch mechanism such as the catch members <b>230</b> and <b>231</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> to prevent the severance of frangible member <b>220</b> so that the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> could be reused. Alternatively, after severing of frangible member <b>220</b> from reservoir assembly <b>12</b>, efforts could be made to secure a frangible member in an appropriate location towards possibly having the wave path appear unchanged. Methods for overcoming such tampering include having a control mechanism count the number of activations to calculate when a reservoir assembly <b>12</b> may be considered to have its reservoir bottle empty and preventing operation after the reservoir bottle <b>22</b> is perceived to be empty as by not permitting use until the controller sees that there is a removal and replacement of the key member as in the sensing of the absence of a frangible member followed by the sensing of the presence of a frangible member. This arrangement may, for example, require the provision of additional key emitters, key sensors and members through which an optical path is sensed. The removal of the catch members <b>230</b> or <b>231</b> could be prevented by their physical location and/or by requiring some test by a control system to ensure that, in fact, the catch members may be intact.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0207">In the preferred embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> is removable as by moving vertically downward and then being slid rearwardly. It is to be appreciated that with various arrangements, the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> could be coupled to the remainder of the dispenser merely by moving vertically downwardly or merely sliding in one direction as, for example, horizontally or at an angle downwardly and rearwardly. Of course, in the preferred embodiments shown, the vertical opening through the support plate <b>18</b> is to be sized to permit the lower end of the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> including the key collar <b>26</b> to be moved downwardly therethrough before being slid rearwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0208">In the preferred embodiments illustrated, the optical sensor or emitters are shown as substantially in contact with the waveguide through which electromagnetic radiation is to be transferred. This is preferred but not necessary as light will transfer through air and can assist in the relative location of the various sensors and emitters and the entrances and exists of the waveguides.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0209">In accordance with the present invention, the various waveguides through which radiation is transmitted may be photochromic or include a photochromic portion. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the collar <b>26</b> may be formed as by injection moulding from a plastic material which includes at least one reversible photochromic dye. The reversible photochromic dye is a dye which inherently assumes an &#x201c;unactivated state&#x201d;. The dye when unactivated, that is, in an unactivated state, may be activated by radiation with a &#x201c;dose&#x201d; of activation electromagnetic radiation in a range of &#x201c;activation wavelengths&#x201d; for the dye so as to assume an activated state. After a period of time from being last radiated with the dose of activation electromagnetic radiation, the reversible photochromic dye returns to its unactivated state preferably returning inherently. When the dye is not activated, that is, when in the unactivated state, the dye has a different ability to absorb electromagnetic radiation in a range of &#x201c;test wavelengths&#x201d; than when the dye is activated, that is, in the activated state. Typically, the dye when in the unactivated state has a relatively low ability to absorb electromagnetic radiation in a range of the test wavelengths, as a result, when the first dye is not activated, the photochromic waveguide <b>64</b> has an &#x201c;inherent transmission characteristic&#x201d; for relative transmission of electromagnetic radiation in the range of test wavelengths which is relatively high. When such a dye is activated, that is, in an activated state, typically the dye absorbs electromagnetic radiation in the range of the test wavelengths to a substantially greater extent than the ability of the dye to absorb electromagnetic radiation in the range of the test wavelengths when dye is not activated. As a result, when the dye is activated, the photochromic waveguide <b>64</b> has an &#x201c;activated transmission characteristic&#x201d; for relative transmission of electromagnetic radiation in the range of the test wavelengths different than the inherent transmission characteristic of the photochromic waveguide when the dye is not activated. The activated transmission characteristic of the photochromic waveguide typically provides for substantially less transmission through the waveguide of electromagnetic radiation in the range of the test wavelength than the transmission characteristic, however, it could provide for greater transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0210">By way of a simple example, the collar <b>26</b> may be formed by injection moulding from low density polyethylene including an Oxford Blue REVERSACOL trade mark reversible photochromic dye which when radiated by a suitable dose of ultraviolet light preferably in the range of 350-410 nm becomes fully activated. The plastic forming the waveguide, with the dye unactivated may preferably be substantially colourless, clear and having relatively high ability to transmit light. When the Oxford Blue REVERSACOL dye is fully activated by a dose of the ultraviolet wavelength activation radiation wavelength, the dye absorbs blue light in a range of the test wavelengths appearing as Oxford Blue in the visible light spectrum. When the dye is activated, the plastic forming the waveguide <b>64</b> appears of an Oxford Blue colour. When the dye is activated, visible light in the range of the test wavelengths representing the Oxford Blue colour are significantly prevented from transmission through the waveguide <b>64</b> since such Oxford Blue light in the range of the test wavelengths is absorbed by the activated dye. Thus, the dye when activated provides the waveguide <b>64</b> with an activated transmission characteristic of relatively low transmission of visible light having the test wavelengths representing Oxford Blue colour compared to the inherent transmission characteristic of the waveguide <b>64</b> when the first dye is not activated and the waveguide permits substantially greater transmission of visible light in the range of the test wavelengths represented by the Oxford Blue colour.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0211">The dose of activation electromagnetic radiation in the range of activation wavelengths in this example with Oxford Blue REVERSACOL dye is a dose of ultraviolet radiation preferably in the range of 350-410 nm wavelengths. The dose of radiation provides adequate energy in the dose required to fully activate the dye as can be determined by simple experimentation. The reversion time period which is required from the dye of the waveguide last being fully activated until the dye of the waveguide returns to being unactivated can depend upon the fade rate for the dye and the concentration of the dye in the plastic. In respect of the Oxford Blue REVERSACOL dye, the concentration of the dye in the plastic may be selected so as to provide for a reversion time period, for example, of five minutes, such that, for example, after one minute, the plastic forming the waveguide appears only slightly tinted in blue colour and after, for example, five minutes, the dye is inactivated and the plastic forming waveguide has returned to its substantially clear uncoloured inherent appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0212">In the context of the above described example and with the waveguide <b>64</b> of a reversible photochromic dye in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref>, the key emitter <b>55</b> is selected to be an emitter which can selectively emit both (a) electromagnetic radiation in the range of activation wavelengths for the dye, that is, ultraviolet wavelengths in the range of 350-410 mm, and (b) electromagnetic radiation in the range of the test wavelengths representing the visible light of wavelengths represented by Oxford Blue colour. The control mechanism for the activation unit can at controlled times activate the key emitter <b>55</b> to emit a dose of the activation electromagnetic radiation in the range of ultraviolet activation wavelengths adequate to activate the dye in the waveguide <b>64</b>. The control mechanism controls the key emitter <b>55</b> in a manner to permit electromagnetic radiation in the range of test wavelengths representing the Oxford Blue colour to be emitted at desired times. The control mechanism preferably controls the timing of, intensity, energy and duration of each of the activation electromagnetic radiation in the range of activation wavelengths and the test electromagnetic radiation in the range of the test wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0213">The key sensor <b>56</b> is configured to sense electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the waveguide <b>64</b> and particularly to sense the timing, intensity, energy and duration of electromagnetic radiation in the range of test wavelengths, that is, of the Oxford Blue colour, notably over time.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0214">A preferred method of operation of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref> with the photochromic waveguide <b>64</b> involves in a controlled manner selectively inputting the activation electromagnetic radiation into the waveguide so as to selectively control whether or not any photochromic dye in the waveguide is activated or not activated over time. With the control mechanism controlling the times when the photochromic waveguide has its known different transmission characteristics for the electromagnetic radiation in the range of the Oxford Blue test wavelengths, the control mechanism can then at selected times input test electromagnetic radiation of the Oxford Blue colour test wavelength via the key emitter <b>55</b> and sense via the key sensor <b>56</b> the relative levels of Oxford Blue colour test wavelength of test electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the waveguide <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0215">By this method, the dispenser control can determine whether there is coupled to the dispenser a waveguide including the specific Oxford Blue REVERSACOL reversible photochromic dye. The determination as to whether any waveguide <b>64</b> coupled to the dispenser includes the Oxford Blue photochromic dye can be made by sensing the test electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the waveguide at a time when the photochromic dye if present in the waveguide should be activated. This may be carried out by inputting via the key emitter <b>55</b> into the waveguide <b>64</b> for transmission through the waveguide <b>64</b> input radiation representing a dose of the ultraviolet activation electromagnetic radiation adequate to activate the dye and, after inputting the dose of ultraviolet activation electromagnetic radiation sufficient to activate the dye so that the dye if present should be in the activated state, further inputting into the guideway <b>64</b> via the key emitter <b>55</b> for transmission through the guideway as input electromagnetic radiation, Oxford Blue coloured test electromagnetic radiation, followed by sensing with the key sensor <b>56</b> the relative levels of Oxford Blue wavelength electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the waveguide <b>64</b>, and determining from the Oxford Blue wavelength electromagnetic radiation sensed if the waveguide <b>64</b> relatively transmits the Oxford Blue wavelength electromagnetic radiation above or below a threshold value. Sensing transmitted Oxford Blue wavelengths electromagnetic radiation above a threshold valve is indicative of the first waveguide not having the activated transmission characteristic and that the waveguide <b>64</b> does not include Oxford Blue photochromic dye. If the transmitted Oxford Blue wavelength electromagnetic radiation sensed by the key sensor <b>56</b> is determined to be below the threshold valve, then this is indicative that the waveguide has the activated transmission characteristic and that the waveguide <b>64</b> includes the Oxford Blue photochromic dye. The control mechanism may control operation of the dispenser dependent upon whether or not the waveguide is indicated to include the Oxford Blue photochromic dye.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0216">The above referred to test to determine if the waveguide <b>64</b> includes the Oxford Blue wavelength photochromic dye would not be able to distinguish between a waveguide <b>64</b> including the Oxford Blue photochromic dye which has been activated and a waveguide <b>64</b> which permanently has a colour of the Oxford Blue wavelength. The method preferably may include other steps in which the ability of the waveguide when expected to be inactivated is tested to consider if its transmission of test electromagnetic radiation in the range of the test wavelength matches the inherent transmission characteristic. The dispenser may be operated in a method which determines, at a time when the waveguide <b>64</b> should be in an inactivated state, if the waveguide <b>64</b> has the capability of transmitting the Oxford Blue test electromagnetic radiation in a manner consistent with the waveguide <b>64</b> including the Oxford Blue photochromic dye that is inactivated. The control mechanism for the activation unit <b>48</b> controls and is cognizant of whether the waveguide <b>64</b>, if it contains the Oxford Blue photochromic dye, would be activated or unactivated. The control mechanism would expect that the waveguide <b>64</b> containing the Oxford Blue dye would not be activated: (a) before any dose of the ultraviolet activation electromagnetic radiation has been emitted by the key emitter <b>55</b>, or (b) after the reversion time period has passed following the last input of ultraviolet electromagnetic radiation to activate the dye. At such point in time as the control determines that the Oxford Blue photochromic dye if present in the waveguide <b>64</b> would not be activated, the following test procedure is carried out. Via the key emitter <b>55</b>, input electromagnetic radiation is input into the waveguide <b>64</b> comprising Oxford Blue wavelength test electromagnetic radiation. Simultaneously, the key sensor <b>56</b> is used to sense transmitted electromagnetic radiation transmitted through the waveguide <b>64</b> in the range of Oxford Blue colour test wavelengths. The control then makes a determination from the sensed Oxford Blue transmitted electromagnetic radiation as to the relative level of transmission of the Oxford Blue wavelength electromagnetic radiation. If the Oxford Blue wavelength electromagnetic radiation sensed is below a set threshold, then this is indicative of the waveguide not including the Oxford Blue reversible photochromic dye. If the Oxford Blue wavelength electromagnetic radiation sensed is above the relative threshold, then this is indicative of the waveguide including the Oxford Blue reversible photochromic dye.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0217">In respect of determining the relative transmission of the Oxford Blue wavelength test electromagnetic radiation through the waveguide from the key emitter <b>55</b> to the key sensor <b>56</b>, the control may compare the Oxford Blue wavelength test electromagnetic radiation emitted by the key emitter <b>55</b> with the Oxford Blue wavelength test electromagnetic radiation sensed by the sensor <b>56</b>. Alternatively, with knowledge, for example, of preset intensity levels of the Oxford Blue test electromagnetic radiation emitted by the key emitter <b>55</b>, the relative intensity of the Oxford Blue test electromagnetic radiation sensed by the key sensor <b>56</b> may itself indicate the relative ability of the waveguide to transmit the Oxford Blue test electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0218">Insofar as electromagnetic radiation in a range of wavelengths is required for a reversible photochromic dye to change from an activated state to an unactivated state, then the control mechanism may also control the application of such radiation to the waveguide as, for example, by controlling the key emitter to input such radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0219">The use of the collar <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> has been described above in which the waveguide <b>64</b> is formed as a unit by injection moulding from plastic material which permits transmission of electromagnetic radiation therethrough and includes as one photochromic dye an Oxford Blue REVERSACOL photochromic dye. Such a collar <b>26</b> may, however, include more than one photochromic dye, for example, two, three, four or five or more different photochromic dyes. The particular nature of the different photochromic dyes may be suitably selected. For example, each of the different photochromic dyes may be activated by activation electromagnetic radiation having the same range of activation wavelengths, for example, all may be activated by ultraviolet light. The dosage of such activation electromagnetic radiation of ultraviolet light to activate each different photochromic dyes may be the same or may vary as, for example, with the amount of energy required to activate one of the dyes being different than the amount of energy required to activate the other of the dyes such that varying the amount of energy of the activation electromagnetic radiation radiated can control which of the photochromic dyes may be activated.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0220">In one preferred embodiment, more than one photochromic dye may be used, each being activated by the same activation wavelength, for example, the same ultraviolet light and each being relatively equally activated by any dose of such ultraviolet light. Each of the photochromic dyes may have a range of test wavelengths that it selectively absorbs when activated, for example, to have different colour when activated and, preferably each, when unactivated, effectively is clear transmitting visible light and provides substantially no colour to the waveguide. Referring to the photochromic dye as having a colour when activated is a simplistic way of stating that the photochromic dye when activated has an enhanced ability to absorb electromagnetic radiation of a particular test wavelength, in this case, corresponding to visible light of the specific colour.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0221">The dispenser has been described above as being controlled by using a method which determines whether or not the waveguide includes a reversible photochromic first dye. In an analogous manner, the dispenser may be operated in a manner to determine whether the waveguide also includes a reversible photochromic second dye or a reversible photochromic third dye or any other different reversible photochromic dyes. If two or more of the different reversible photochromic dyes are activated by activation electromagnetic radiation in the same range of activated wavelengths, then these dyes may be activated simultaneously. Thereafter, emission of the test electromagnetic radiation for each photochromic dye and sensing of the transmission of such test electromagnetic radiation for each photochromic dye may be carried out while each of the photochromic dyes is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0222">Where multiple photochromic dyes are incorporated in the same wavelength <b>64</b>, it is possible to utilize photochromic dyes that are activated by activation electromagnetic radiation having different activation wavelengths. For example, a first photochromic dye in the wavelength might be activated by one of ultraviolet, visible or infrared light electromagnetic radiation as a first range of activation wavelengths and a second photochromic dye may be activated by radiation with electromagnetic radiation of a different second range of activation wavelengths which is outside the first range. With key emitter <b>55</b> capable of emitting the activation electromagnetic radiation selectively of the different desired ranges of activation wavelengths, the two different photochromic dyes may be selectively activated by the control mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0223">The two or more of the photochromic dyes in the same waveguide could have the ability when activated to selectively absorb the same test electromagnetic radiation. For example, different activation electromagnetic radiation may be used to selectively activate two different photochromic dyes, however, each of which may absorb light of the Oxford Blue wavelength. Nevertheless, selective testing may be carried out testing for the level of transmission of test electromagnetic radiation of the Oxford Blue wavelength in the various conditions of: (1) neither photochromic dyes being activated, (2) one of the photochromic dyes activated and the other of the photochromic dyes not being activated, or (3) both of the photochromic dyes being activated. Furthermore, each of the photochromic dyes which when activated may absorb the Oxford Blue wavelength to different extents and thus different level transmissions of Oxford Blue wavelengths electromagnetic transmission may be determined depending upon whether none, one or both of the photochromic dyes are activated.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0224">The present invention also provides for the use of irreversible photochromic dyes. An irreversible photochromic dye describes a dye that undergoes a relatively permanent change in its ability to absorb electromagnetic radiation in a range of test wavelengths upon exposure to activation electromagnetic radiation in a range of activation wavelengths. The irreversible photochromic dyes provide the waveguide with an inherent transmission characteristic when not activated which is different than an activated transmission characteristic when activated. For example, when not activated, the irreversible photochromic dye may not significantly absorb electromagnetic radiation of specific test wavelengths yet, when activated, may significantly absorb electromagnetic radiation of the specific test wavelengths. Alternatively, the irreversible photochromic dye may, when not activated, significantly absorb electromagnetic radiation in a range of test wavelengths yet, when activated, may not absorb electromagnetic radiation in the range of the test wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0225">In accordance with the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the collar <b>26</b> may be injection moulded in its entirety from a plastic material which contains an irreversible photochromic dye. For example, the irreversible photochromic dye may be a dye which when activated with activation electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet radiation within a certain dose in a period of time, substantially irreversible activates the dye to permanently significantly absorb electromagnetic radiation within a range of test wavelengths, for example, red colour visible light and thus assume a red colour.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0226">In accordance with the present invention, the dispenser may be controlled such that at some time in the cycle of operation, the irreversible photochromic dye may be activated such that the dye will permanently have the colour red and the waveguide will absorb red wavelength light.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0227">For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref>, the control mechanism may, for example, after initialization such as insertion of the removable reservoir assembly <b>12</b> or after its initial usage, activate the irreversible photochromic dye in the waveguide <b>64</b> as by activation with ultraviolet light such that the waveguide thereafter will permanently have an activated transmission characteristic of selectively absorbing electromagnetic radiation in a range of red light wavelengths. Before any removable reservoir assembly <b>12</b> may be permitted to be used in the dispenser in an initialization process, the control mechanism will preferably perform a suitable initialization test to determine if the waveguide transmits red wavelength electromagnetic radiation. If red wavelength electromagnetic radiation is not permitted to be transmitted at a time when a waveguide should be unactivated, then the dispenser may be controlled in a manner as to prevent operation with that reservoir. Thus, in this manner, after any particular removable reservoir assembly <b>12</b> and its collar <b>26</b> has been used in a dispenser assembly, that collar <b>26</b> and its waveguide are permanently marked by activation of the irreversible photochromic dye as a reservoir assembly <b>12</b> which should not be permitted to be removed, inserted and re-initialized for re-use another time in the dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0228">The time when the irreversible photochromic dye may be activated to permanently adopt its activated state, for example, red colour may take place at times other than after initialization or initial dispensing. For example, for any removable reservoir assembly at any time after insertion and before removal but preferably after checking to see that the waveguide <b>64</b> is an acceptable waveguide, the waveguide may then have its irreversible photochromic dye activated to prevent re-use after removal. The activation of the irreversible photochromic dye may take place at some set time after initial insertion as, for example, a pre-selected time in of hours, days or months after insertion or after a determination has been made that some pre-selected amount of fluid has been dispensed, or is calculated, estimated or expected to have been dispensed, from the reservoir. For example, the control mechanism may count the number of activations of the piston <b>32</b> such that after a maximum number of activations have been counted since last reset of the counter mechanism, the irreversible photochromic dye is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0229">An irreversible photochromic dye may be selected, for example, to be absorptive of electromagnetic radiation of test wavelengths, for example, red wavelength light when not activated and, when activated, be non-absorptive and therefore transmissive of the red colour test electromagnetic radiation. With such a irreversible photochromic dye, on initial insertion of the removable reservoir <b>12</b> which the collar <b>26</b> and while the wavelength should be unactivated, the control mechanism may conduct a test to ensure that the collar <b>26</b> has the inherent transmission characteristic, that is, is absorptive of red wavelength light. Thereafter, the collar may be irradiated with activation electromagnetic radiation to activate the photochromic dye and assume a transmission characteristic that permits increased transmission of red light. Subsequently, tests could be conducted to ensure if the waveguide permits the transmission of red light and prevent operation if red light is not adequately transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0230">In accordance with the present invention, one or more irreversible photochromic dyes may be used. Each irreversible photochromic dye may be activated by activation electromagnetic radiation having the same or different activation wavelengths. Each of the irreversible photochromic dyes may have the same or different test wavelength electromagnetic radiation which it will selectively absorb.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0231">In accordance with the present invention, any particular waveguide such as the waveguide <b>26</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may include one or more irreversible photochromic dyes and one or more irreversible photochromic dyes, each of which has a respective activation electromagnetic radiation in a range of activation wavelengths, each of which has a respective electromagnetic radiation in a range of test wavelengths which is adapted to selectively absorb. The various activation wavelengths of the activation electromagnetic radiation may be the same or different and the various test wavelengths of the electromagnetic radiation absorbed may be the different or the same.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0232">The irreversible photochromic dye may comprise a dye in respect of which the cumulative amount of activation electromagnetic radiation it receives will move the photochromic dye successively from an unactivated state towards an activated state, for example, progressively, as for example, to linearly with the energy of activation electromagnetic radiation received, increase the dye's ability to absorb electromagnetic radiation in the range of test wavelengths. In one embodiment, the waveguide <b>26</b> may include both a reversible photochromic dye and an irreversible photochromic dye, with each having the same activation wavelength, for example, ultraviolet wavelength light. With each successive dose of ultraviolet radiation to successively activate the reversible photochromic dye in the course of normal usage, the irreversible photochromic dye becomes increasingly activated until it is so fully activated that it would fail to meet a minimum threshold as to permit further usage in the dispenser it is coupled to or that it needs be accepted as a replacement waveguide if removed from the dispenser and reinserted.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0233">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, it is advantageous that the collar <b>26</b>, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may visually to a human handler have a specific colour or absence of colour. For example, on initial manufacture, the collar may appear clear or colourless. In the absence of application of appropriate input electromagnetic radiation and sensing appropriate output electromagnetic radiation, it would not be apparent to a user as to what inherent light transmitting characteristics of the waveguide will arise and thus would be difficult, in the absence of some not insubstantial testing and investigation, for any third party without knowledge of the transmission characteristics to determine what specific characteristics are found in that waveguide and are necessary to make it compatible with the component for which it is intended.</p>

Each of the waveguides <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> may have a different photochromic dye.

The tab <b>29</b> thus serves as a waveguide for passage of electromagnetic radiation therethrough and the tab <b>29</b> preferably includes a photochromic dye.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0246">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> which illustrates an arrangement in which the replaceable keying component is a piston <b>32</b> of a pump assembly <b>25</b> substantially the same as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The piston <b>32</b> includes an engagement flange <b>54</b> which, as shown in a vertical cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, is adapted for engagement with a presser member <b>15</b> such that movement of the presser member moves the piston <b>32</b> upwardly and downwardly as indicated by the arrow <b>257</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. The presser member <b>15</b> is shown to have a slotway <b>257</b> therethrough with catch members <b>258</b> to engage the engagement flange <b>54</b> and couple the engagement flange <b>54</b> to the presser member <b>15</b>. The presser member <b>15</b> is shown to have two key emitters <b>55</b> and two key sensors <b>56</b>. A first key emitter <b>55</b> is disposed to direct the electromagnetic radiation radially into the engagement flange <b>54</b> normal the axis <b>258</b> for passage radially and circumferentially through the engagement flange <b>54</b> to a diametrically opposed key sensor <b>56</b>. In addition, a second key emitter <b>55</b> is carried by the presser member <b>15</b> to direct electromagnetic radiation axially parallel to the axis <b>258</b> of the piston with the electromagnetic radiation to pass axially through the engagement flange for sensing by an oppositely disposed key sensor <b>56</b>. The engagement flange <b>54</b> thus serves the function of a waveguide. In each of the embodiments illustrated, where each of the respective key emitters engages or directs electromagnetic radiation into the respective waveguide, there is formed on the waveguide an inlet for electromagnetic radiation and similarly on each waveguide opposite and opposed to each key sensor, the waveguide provides an outlet for electromagnetic radiation. To enhance various portions of the circumferential surface of the engagement flange <b>54</b> to serve as an input or output, the circumferential surface may be faceted and provide surfaces substantially normal to the emitter and sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0247">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the presser member <b>15</b> may comprise a presser such as the presser <b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> which pivots about the stub axles <b>20</b>, however, in accordance with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, the presser member <b>15</b> is mounted to the housing for linear movement parallel to the axis <b>258</b> as by mounting the presser member <b>15</b> for sliding vertically relative to the side plates <b>19</b> of the backplate assembly <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> rather than for pivoting about the stub axles <b>21</b>. Preferably in a different arrangement, the engagement flange <b>54</b> may be adapted to be slid horizontally rearwardly into a forwardly open slot formed by the presser member <b>15</b> as is known, for example, in devices as taught by U.S. Pat. No. 5,431,309 to Ophardt issued Jul. 11, 1995 albeit disclosing a manually operated fluid dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0248">Each of the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 to 30</figref> may provide their respective waveguide and key emitter and key sensor in an arrangement which avoids the need for any of the other waveguides illustrated, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 26</figref> although any combination of two or more waveguides disclosed may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0249">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> which illustrates a cross-sectional view with an alternate embodiment of a fluid dispenser in accordance with the present invention substantially identical to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 26</figref>, however, with the notable exception that the collar <b>26</b> has been eliminated and the piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> has been utilized to provide a waveguide with radiation to be input into the outer flange <b>31</b> by a key emitter <b>55</b> to pass circumferentially about the outer flange <b>31</b> for sensing of transmitted electromagnetic radiation by the key sensor <b>56</b>. As shown, the key sensor <b>56</b> and key emitter <b>55</b> are secured to the support plate <b>18</b> of the backplate assembly <b>14</b>. In this embodiment, the structure of the dispenser is otherwise the same as the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0250">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> which shows an exploded view of another embodiment of a fluid dispenser in accordance with the present invention having similarities to the pump disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,482 to Ophardt issued Nov. 17, 1998. The dispenser <b>10</b> comprises a housing <b>14</b>, a replaceable reservoir assembly <b>12</b> and a cover <b>13</b>. The housing <b>14</b> is adapted to be mounted vertically as to a wall. The cover <b>13</b> is adapted to be coupled to the housing to permit insertion and removal of the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> preferably as in a known manner with the cover <b>13</b> hingedly connected to the housing <b>14</b>. The replaceable reservoir assembly <b>12</b> comprises a collapsible fluid container <b>22</b> and a pump assembly <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0251">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> which shows in cross-section the container <b>22</b> filled with fluid. The container <b>22</b> has a cylindrical outlet neck <b>27</b> which is externally threaded at its end to threadably receive a collar <b>26</b>. The neck <b>27</b> has a radially outwardly extending flange <b>326</b> disposed closely under a radially outwardly extending shoulder <b>192</b> of the wall <b>328</b> of the container so as to present a radially extending support slot <b>330</b> therebetween. The housing <b>14</b> has a horizontally extending support plate <b>332</b> with a forwardly open U-shaped slot <b>334</b> therein sized to be complementary to support slot <b>330</b> such that the support plate <b>332</b> can be received in slot <b>330</b> and support the weight of the container <b>22</b> and locate the container in a desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0252">The collar <b>26</b> supports a funnel-like plate <b>325</b> with a central opening <b>338</b> therethrough which opens into a feed tube <b>340</b>. A flapper valve member <b>336</b> is located in opening <b>338</b> to form a one-way valve which prevents flow upwardly from the feed tube <b>340</b> into the container.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0253">Fluid passing through the one-way valve formed by member <b>336</b> is conducted via feed tube <b>340</b> to the pump assembly <b>25</b> and then from pump assembly <b>25</b> via an exit tube <b>342</b> to out a discharge opening <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0254">The construction of the pump assembly <b>25</b> is best seen with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. The pump assembly <b>25</b> is a gear-type rotary pump with two intermeshing gear-like impellers, namely, a driver impeller <b>346</b> and a driven impeller <b>348</b>, received in a cavity within a pump casing. The casing <b>352</b> comprises a primary casing member <b>354</b> with a removable casing plug <b>356</b> defining the cavity therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0255">The impellers <b>346</b> and <b>348</b> are identical with each adapted to be rotated about its respective axis. Each impeller has a gear portion <b>358</b> disposed coaxially about the axis with radially and axially extending teeth <b>360</b>. Each impeller has an axle member <b>364</b> which extends axially from the gear portion <b>358</b> and serves to assist in journaling its impeller in the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0256">The cavity is formed so as to journal the impellers <b>346</b> and <b>348</b> for rotation with the axes of the impellers parallel, with the impellers disposed beside each other and with the teeth of one impeller intermeshing with the teeth of the other impeller in a nip between the impellers.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0257">The cavity is provided with flat, radially extending front and rear walls to relatively closely engage the flat, radially extending front and rear surfaces of the gear portions <b>358</b>. The front wall of the cavity is formed on the primary casing member <b>354</b> with two forwardly extending bores <b>365</b> sized to receive and journal the axle members <b>364</b> of the impellers to journal the impellers. The cavity has circumferential side wall defined by a part-cylinder forming surface disposed at a constant radius from the axis of the driver impeller <b>346</b> and a part-cylinder forming surface disposed at a constant radius from the axis of driven impeller <b>348</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0258">An inlet port <b>374</b> opens through the casing into the cavity on an upper side of the cavity above the nip. The feed tube <b>340</b> is connected to the inlet port <b>374</b> to permit fluid in the container to be in communication with the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0259">An outlet port <b>376</b> opens through the casing <b>352</b> into the cavity on a lower side of the casing below the nip. The exit tube <b>342</b> is received in a friction fit relation in the outlet port <b>376</b> to permit fluid from the cavity to flow out of the discharge outlet <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0260">The driver impeller <b>346</b> has its axle member <b>64</b> extend rearwardly from the rear surface of the impeller <b>346</b> out of the pump casing <b>352</b> though a journaling bore <b>386</b> in the plug <b>356</b> for operative connection to a motor <b>382</b>. The journaling bore <b>386</b> of plug <b>356</b> and the journaling bore of <b>356</b> of the casing <b>350</b> preferably engages the axle <b>64</b> in a sealed manner as by use of O-ring seals not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0261">The driver impeller <b>346</b> is shown to carry gear teeth <b>379</b> at its inner end to engage with a gear toothed drive <b>380</b> carried by the motor <b>382</b>. When the motor <b>382</b> rotates the driver impeller <b>346</b>, the driver impeller <b>346</b> engages the driven impeller <b>348</b> to rotate the driven impeller and to dispense fluid from the discharge outlet <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0262">The motor casing <b>392</b> carries a forwardly opening socket <b>408</b> defined within a forwardly extending wall <b>406</b>. Socket <b>408</b> has a cross-sectional shape, size and depth complementary to that of the casing. As shown in the preferred embodiment, the socket <b>408</b> and casing have complementary oval shapes in cross-section. The casing carries a stop flange <b>353</b> which extends radially relative the axis of the impellers at a forward end of the casing. The stop flange serves to engage a forward edge of the wall <b>406</b> when the casing <b>352</b> is fully inserted into socket <b>408</b>. Insertion and removal of the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> is accomplished by sliding the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> forwardly and rearwardly relative the housing <b>14</b> parallel the axis of the impellers with the support plate <b>332</b> received in the support slot <b>330</b> and the casing received in the socket <b>408</b>. With such rearward and forward sliding, the pump assembly <b>25</b> becomes engaged and disengaged with the motor <b>382</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0263">A control mechanism is provided which includes a proximity sensor which will sense the presence of a user's hand under the exit tube <b>342</b> and provide a signal to a control circuit coupling the sensor to the electric motor for actuating the motor. The control mechanism preferably controls the supply of power to the motor <b>382</b> so that whenever it is desired that fluid be dispensed, the motor is operated for a pre-selected period of time which will dispense a single dose being approximately a predetermined quantity of fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0264">The reservoir assembly <b>12</b> is preferably disposable and recyclable. In this regard, each element of the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> is preferably formed from recyclable plastic material. The container <b>22</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a collapsible container form made of recyclable plastic material. Similarly, the collar <b>326</b> and its one-way valve <b>336</b> can all be made from recyclable plastic materials. Each of the feed tube <b>340</b>, exit tube <b>342</b>, primary casing member <b>354</b> and casing plug <b>356</b> as well as the two impellers <b>346</b> and <b>348</b> are each preferably formed from recyclable plastic material. Thus, the entirety of the reservoir assembly <b>12</b> is preferably formed from recyclable plastic material which can, after use, readily be recycled.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0265">In the context of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 to 35</figref>, various different components of the dispenser may be used as a removable and replaceable keying component to carry a waveguide preferably including a photochromic portion.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0266"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> shows an arrangement in which the pump impeller <b>346</b> and notably its axle <b>364</b> may form a waveguide made from electromagnetic radiation transmitting plastic with radiation to be emitted via a key emitter <b>55</b> carried on the cover <b>13</b> and a key sensor <b>56</b> carried on the housing <b>14</b> with opposite ends of the axle member <b>364</b> forming the inlet and the outlet of the waveguide. The impeller <b>346</b> may be characterized as a movable material displacing element which is received inside a chamber for the pump assembly <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0267">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> which schematically illustrates a key sensor <b>56</b> and a key emitter <b>55</b> in an arrangement in which the casing <b>352</b> is used as a waveguide with an outlet and inlet provided on diametrically opposed sides of the casing <b>352</b>. In respect of use of the casing <b>352</b> as a waveguide, it is to be appreciated that the radiation may extend substantially in a straight line through a portion of the casing underneath the bores <b>65</b>. In an alternate configuration not shown, a key emitter could be provided at the top of the casing and a key sensor at the bottom of the casing, for example, in between the two bores <b>65</b> for passage of radiation vertically therebetween forward of the cavity. Each of the key emitter <b>55</b> and key sensor <b>56</b> shown only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> could be secured in suitably provided openings (not shown) in the wall <b>406</b> of the socket <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0268"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> illustrates the provision of a removable keying component as a chamber-forming body for a pump having a chamber for receiving a movable material displacing element, that is, the pump impeller therein.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0269">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> which shows an arrangement in which the threaded collar <b>326</b> engaged about the outlet neck <b>27</b> of the container <b>22</b> serves as a waveguide. Electromagnetic radiation is input into the collar <b>326</b> on the first side via key emitter <b>55</b>, passes circumferentially about the collar <b>326</b> to a key sensor <b>56</b> supported on an opposite side of the housing <b>14</b>. The collar <b>326</b> is preferably secured to the container <b>22</b> against removal by various means including welding, bonding and supplemental mechanical arrangements which prevent removal.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0270">The threaded collar <b>326</b> like the threaded outer flange <b>31</b> of the piston chamber-forming member <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is secured to the neck <b>27</b> of the bottle <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0271">While the outer flange <b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> and the collar <b>326</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> are shown as threaded onto the neck of the bottle, various other mechanical coupling arrangements can be provided as, for example, a one-way snap-fit arrangement which prevents removal.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0272">A flange member like outer flange member <b>31</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the collar <b>326</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> may form a simple cap with an outlet tube leading to a dispensing control mechanism which might merely be a simple arrangement which squeezes or releases the tube to control material discharge. Virtually any form or manner of a cap for closing the container <b>22</b> may be used conveniently as a keying component with a waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0273">In accordance with the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 to 35</figref>, the control mechanism will preferably include a mechanism to determine if electromagnetic radiation passing through the waveguide from the key emitter <b>55</b> to the key sensor <b>56</b> meets expected electromagnetic radiation profiles and the control mechanism may be operated to determine whether or not the waveguide includes an expected photochromic portion.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0274">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 to 38</figref> which illustrate a dispenser for sheet material wound in a roll, notably paper toweling of the type disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,069,354 to Alfano issued May 30, 2000.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0275">As can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>, the dispenser <b>610</b> includes a housing generally indicated <b>614</b> with a backplate <b>621</b>, typically to be mounted vertically to a wall as in a washroom and two side walls <b>623</b> which extend vertically and forwardly from the backplate <b>621</b>. On the inside of each of the side walls <b>623</b> there is mounted an end plug <b>600</b>. The end plugs carry a journaling portion <b>661</b> with a cylindrical outside surface which is received within a hollow core <b>670</b> of a roll of paper <b>672</b> carrying rolled layers of paper sheeting <b>674</b> which is to be dispensed. The hollow core <b>670</b> is thus rotatably journalled upon the journaling portions for rotation about the axis <b>700</b>. The end plugs <b>600</b> carry radially extending inwardly directed locating shoulder <b>663</b> to limit side-to-side movement of the hollow core <b>670</b>. The hollow core <b>670</b> is preferably formed out of material such as plastic to provide a waveguide which has an inlet at one end of the hollow core and an outlet at the other end of the hollow core. A key emitter <b>55</b> is provided in one of the end plugs <b>600</b> and a key sensor <b>56</b> is provided in the other end plug <b>600</b> each axially aligned with the circumferential wall of the hollow core <b>670</b> such that radiation may be selectively passed axially through the waveguide formed by the cylindrical wall of the hollow core <b>670</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0276"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> also shows a second waveguide being provided as a circular disc <b>702</b> which is fixedly secured inside the hollow core <b>670</b>. The disc <b>702</b> is made of a material which transmits electromagnetic radiation and preferably as with the other waveguide includes a photochromic portion. An axially centrally located key emitter <b>55</b> is provided on one end plug <b>600</b> to direct electromagnetic radiation through the hollow center of the hollow core <b>670</b> into the waveguide forming disc <b>702</b>. A complementary key sensor <b>56</b> is provided in the other end plug <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0277"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> shows the use of two different waveguides. It is to be appreciated that merely one or other of these waveguides may be provided. Each waveguide may preferably include a photochromic portion although this is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0278">In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the hollow core <b>670</b> is shown as preferably comprising a plastic material which forms a waveguide. Rather than have the entirety of the hollow core <b>67</b> being a plastic material, it may comprise a composite material, for example, a thin cylindrical tube of plastic material forming a waveguide about which there may be provided an additional tube of, for example, cardboard or other paper-like material. As well, rather than provide the waveguide on the hollow core to be a continuous cylinder, the waveguide might comprise but a strand of optical fiber carried on a cylindrical tube of paperboard type material.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0279">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> which shows a similar roll of paper <b>672</b> carried on a hollow core <b>670</b>, however, in which the core <b>670</b> carries a pair of end plugs <b>600</b> which are fixedly secured to the hollow core <b>670</b> of the roll of paper and with each end plug <b>600</b> being removably secured in a catch member <b>800</b> which is fixedly secured to the side wall <b>623</b>. The two end plugs <b>600</b> together with the hollow core <b>670</b> are rotatable as a unit with a cylindrical end flange <b>702</b> of each of the end plugs <b>600</b> received in a cylindrical journaling cavity within the catch members <b>800</b>. As seen, a key emitter <b>55</b> is provided in one catch member <b>800</b> and the same catch member has a key sensor <b>56</b> at a diametrically opposite location. The cylindrical disc <b>702</b> on the end plug <b>600</b> thus serves the function of a waveguide and preferably includes a photochromic portion.</p>
