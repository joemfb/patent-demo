<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an insect-resistant protein; an insect-resistance gene encoding the insect-resistant protein; a recombinant vector containing the insect-resistance gene; a host cell and a plant cell transfected with the recombinant vector; a transformant transformed by the insect-resistance gene and a method for producing the same; a protein recovered thereby; and an insect-resistant agent comprising them as active ingredients.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A protein having an insect resistance (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;insect-resistant protein&#x201d;) is a material essential for transferring genes into a plant to carry out hereditary breeding of a genetically insect-resistant plant. It may be also used as a novel insect-resistant agent such as agricultural chemicals by spraying an insect-resistant protein expressed in microorganisms, cultured cells and individual multicellular animals and plants and recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Insect-resistant proteins which are widely industrially used include Bt toxins (proteins) produced by <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i>, which is a Gram-positive bacterium.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such Bt toxins at low concentrations (about 1 ppm) are known to exhibit insecticidal and insect-resistant activities (e.g., see Non-Patent Document 1 or 2).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the above Bt toxins are derived from bacteria and thus have a deep-seated resistance for use as genetic resources for recombinants, such as gene recombination, and therefore it has been desired to detect insect-resistant proteins derived from plants.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In contrast, as insect-resistant proteins derived from plants, protease inhibitors derived from <i>Vigna sinensis </i>(for example, see Non-Patent Document 3 or Patent Document 1), amylase inhibitors derived from kidney beans (for example, see Non-Patent Document 4) and lectins derived from snowdrop (for example, see Non-Patent Document 5 or Patent Document 2) have been known.

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0015">However, it cannot be said that the Bt toxins which are insect-resistant proteins described in the above Non-Patent Documents 1 or 2 have a sufficient resistance to insects. In fact, insects having a resistance to the Bt toxins, such as <i>Plutella xylostella </i>and <i>Ostrinia furnacalis</i>, have appeared.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0016">The protease inhibitors described in the above Non-Patent Document 3 or Patent Document 1 show only such a degree of insect resistance activity as to reduce the growth of webworms by half in two weeks, even when added at a high concentration reaching 2% of total proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0017">The amylase inhibitors described in the above Non-Patent Document 4, when expressed in <i>Pisum sativum</i>, kill only 70% of vetch bruchid by a high expression of 2-3% of total soluble proteins of the beans, but 30% grow up normally. In addition, the expression of 1% shows such weak insect-resistant activity that 80% or more grow up to adults normally.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018">The lectins described in the above Non-Patent Document 5 or Patent Document 2 have such an extremely weak insect-resistant activity that the weight of a webworm fed with an artificial diet provided abundantly with a concentration of 2% of total proteins for one month is reduced by about 20%.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">In other words, all of the protease inhibitors, amylase inhibitors and lectins described in the above Non-Patent Documents 3-5 and Patent Documents 1 and 2 have an insufficient insect-resistant activity.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">An object of the present invention is to provide an insect-resistant protein exhibiting a sufficient resistance to insects, even when used in a small amount; an insect-resistance gene encoding said insect-resistant protein; a recombinant vector containing said insect-resistance gene; a host cell and a plant cell transfected with the recombinant vector; a transformant transformed by the insect-resistance gene and a method for producing the same; a protein recovered thereby; and an insect-resistant agent comprising them as active ingredients.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0021">The present inventors undertook thorough research for solving the above problems and thus found that, of proteins obtained from plant latexes, a protein having a given amino acid sequence has excellent insect resistance. As a result of further extensive research, the present inventors found that the above problems can be solved, and the present invention was thus accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0022">Specifically, the present invention relates to (1) an insect-resistant protein derived from a plant, comprising a first amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 in the Sequence Listing, a second amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2 in the Sequence Listing and a third amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:3 in the Sequence Listing, wherein the second amino acid sequence has at least one spppp sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0023">The present invention relates to (2) the insect-resistant protein in accordance with the above (1), wherein the second amino acid sequence is positioned between the first amino acid sequence and the third amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0024">The present invention relates to (3) an insect-resistant protein derived from a plant, comprising a fourth amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 4 in the Sequence Listing and at least one spppp sequence.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0026">The present invention relates to (5) the insect-resistant protein in accordance with the above (1), wherein the plant is a moraceous plant and the insect-resistant protein is extracted from a latex of said moraceous plant.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0027">The present invention relates to (6) an insect-resistant protein obtained by extracting a latex of a moraceous plant, centrifuging said latex to separate a supernatant, electrophoresing said supernatant under nondenaturing conditions to fractionate the supernatant, and collecting the insect-resistant protein from a fraction having a molecular weight of 50-60 kDa.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0028">The present invention relates to (7) an insect-resistance gene encoding the insect-resistant protein in accordance with any one of the above (1) to (6).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0029">The present invention relates to (8) an insect-resistance gene derived from a plant, comprising a sixth DNA having a 50% or more homology with DNA constituted of a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 6 in the Sequence Listing and at least one base sequence encoding an spppp sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0030">The present invention relates to (9) the insect-resistance gene in accordance with the above (8), wherein the sixth DNA is hybridized with DNA constituted of a complementary base sequence under stringent conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">The present invention relates to (10) an insect-resistance gene derived from a plant, comprising a seventh DNA having a 50% or more homology with DNA constituted of a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:7 in the Sequence Listing and at least one base sequence encoding an spppp sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">The present invention relates to (11) the insect-resistance gene in accordance with the above (10), wherein the seventh DNA is hybridized with DNA constituted of a complementary base sequence under stringent conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0033">The present invention relates to (12) a recombinant vector comprising the insect-resistance gene in accordance with any one of the above (8) to (11).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">The present invention relates to (13) a host cell transfected with the recombinant vector in accordance with the above (12).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">The present invention relates to (14) a plant cell transfected with the recombinant vector in accordance with the above (12).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">The present invention relates to (15) a transformant transformed by the insect-resistance gene in accordance with any one of the above (8) to (11).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037">The present invention relates to (16) a method for producing a transformant transformed by the insect-resistance gene in accordance with any one of the above (8) to (11).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">The present invention relates to (17) a protein recovered from the host cell in accordance with the above (13).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">The present invention relates to (18) a protein recovered from the plant cell in accordance with the above (14).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040">The present invention relates to (19) a protein recovered from the transformant in accordance with the above (15) or (16).</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0043">Furthermore, a configuration in which the above (1) to (21) are appropriately combined can be also adopted if serving the object of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0044">In accordance with an insect-resistant protein of the present invention, sufficient insect resistance is shown even at extremely low concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0045">In addition, the above insect-resistant protein is derived from a plant and has a low toxicity towards humans.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046">Furthermore, the above insect-resistant protein, by its coexistence with sugar-mimic alkaloids or other insect-resistant factors, has an action of boosting the functions of said insect-resistant factors.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047">The above insect-resistant protein, where the plant is a moraceous plant and the insect-resistant protein is extracted from a latex of said moraceous plant, is contained abundantly in said latex at one to several percent, and therefore is comparatively easily purified.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0060">A preferred embodiment of the present invention is described in detail.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Insect-Resistant Protein)</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0061">The insect-resistant protein of the present invention, derived from a plant, comprises a first amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1 in the Sequence Listing (hereinafter also conveniently referred to as &#x201c;first protein fragment&#x201d;), a second amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2 in the Sequence Listing (hereinafter also conveniently referred to as &#x201c;second protein fragment&#x201d;) and a third amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:3 in the Sequence Listing (hereinafter also conveniently referred to as &#x201c;third protein fragment&#x201d;), wherein the above homologies are independent respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0062">The above insect-resistant protein has the first amino acid sequence, the second amino acid sequence and the third amino acid sequence, wherein the second amino acid sequence has at least one spppp sequence and, therefore, shows sufficient insect resistance, even at an extremely low concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0063">In the case of a homology of 100%, the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1 in Sequence Listing (first protein fragment) is the same as the first amino acid sequence, the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2 in the Sequence Listing (second protein fragment) is the same as the second amino acid sequence, and the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:3 in the Sequence Listing (third protein fragment) is the same as the third amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0064">Accordingly, in case of a homology of 100%, the insect-resistant protein of the present invention comprises the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:1 in the Sequence Listing, the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:2 in the Sequence Listing and the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3 in the Sequence Listing. The above first protein fragment and the above third protein fragment are chitin binding motifs and are observed to have a homology with chitin binding protein mimicking hevein derived from rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0065">As used herein, a chitin binding protein mimicking hevein means a protein having a property of binding to chitin having a single or a plurality of amino acid sequences constituted of about 40 amino acids, which is seen in hevein and mimics a chitin binding site of which the inside is crosslinked by cysteine residue, in molecules.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0066">On the other hand, the repetition of a specific spppp sequence (SerProProProPro) is seen in the above second protein fragment. Further, in accordance with the insect-resistant protein of the present invention, the second amino acid sequence has at least one spppp sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0067">As used herein, the spppp sequence means a sequence in which typically 4, sometimes 3-7 residues Pro are bound together following Ser. Such spppp sequences are characterized by generally plurally repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0068">The insect-resistant protein of the present invention comprises the first amino acid sequence, the second amino acid sequence and the third amino acid sequence and therefore exhibits excellent insect resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0069">As used herein, the insect resistance means an insecticidal property or the characteristic of inhibiting the growth of insects (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;growth inhibition property&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0070">The sequence order of the first amino acid sequence, the second amino acid sequence and the third amino acid sequence is not particularly limited, but the second amino acid sequence is preferably positioned between the first amino acid sequence and the third amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0071">In this case, more insect resistance is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0072">The insect-resistant protein of the present invention is constituted of, for example, a fourth amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:4 in the Sequence Listing (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;active partial amino acid sequence&#x201d;). In case of a homology of 100%, the amino acid sequence (active partial amino acid sequence) represented by SEQ ID NO:4 in the Sequence Listing is the same as the fourth amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0073">Such a fourth amino acid sequence has at least one spppp sequence, and the amino acid sequence is identified by the reverse transcription reaction of total RNA derived from a latex to a template.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0074">In the active partial amino acid sequence, the second protein fragment is observed at amino acid number 46-97, and the first protein fragment and the third protein fragment are present at amino acid number 6-44 and amino acid number 106-144, respectively, so as to sandwich the second protein fragment. Further, in the active partial amino acid sequence, the function of the amino acid sequence beginning at amino acid number 145 is not definite but is believed to have the information of an enzyme for decomposing chitin.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0075">In accordance with the insect-resistant protein comprising the active partial amino acid sequence, insect resistance is surely shown.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076">The insect-resistant protein of the present invention comprises, for example, a fifth amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:5 in the Sequence Listing (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;full-length amino acid sequence&#x201d;). Further, in case of a homology of 100%, the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 5 in the Sequence Listing (full-length amino acid sequence) is the same as the fifth amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077">Such a fifth amino acid sequence has at least one spppp sequence, and the amino acid sequence is identified by the reverse transcription reaction of total RNA derived from a latex to a template.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078">The full-length amino acid sequence includes an active partial amino acid sequence. Specifically, the amino acid number 1-21 of the full-length amino acid sequence is added to the active partial amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">In the full-length amino acid sequence, the second protein fragment is observed at amino acid number 67-118, and the first protein fragment and the third protein fragment are present at amino acid number 27-65 and amino acid number 127-165, respectively, so as to sandwich the second protein fragment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">Further, in the full-length amino acid sequence, the amino acid sequence at base number 1-21 is believed to have positional information for integrating the above insect-resistant protein into an adequate position.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">In addition, the function of the amino acid sequence beginning at amino acid number 165 is not definite but is believed to have the information of an enzyme for decomposing chitin.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082">In accordance with the insect-resistant protein constituted of the full-length amino acid sequence, an amino acid sequence will be integrated into a precise position, and therefore insect resistance is more surely shown. Further, the insect-resistant protein constituted of these amino acid sequences is excellent in insect resistance though exhibiting no chitinase activity.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083">Insects against which the above insect-resistant protein exhibits insect-resistant activity include insects belonging to Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Odonata, etc., and arthropods such as mites.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">In addition, the above insect-resistant protein is derived from a plant and therefore has a low resistance to consumers and low toxicity in humans in comparison with proteins derived from bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0085">Such a plant is not particularly limited but is preferably a plant containing a latex.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0086">Specific examples include plants belonging to the family Asteraceae, the family Campanulaceae, the family Convolvulaceae, the family Moraceae, the family Euphorbiaceae, the family Asclepiadaceae, the family Apocynaceae, the family Musaceae, the family Papaveraceae, the family Anacardiaceae, the family Guttiferae, the family Leguminosae, the family Cactaceae, the family Liliaceae, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0087">Of these, the above preferred plant is a plant belonging to the family Moraceae. Specifically, the above insect-resistant protein is more preferably extracted from the latex of moraceous plants.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0088">Where the insect-resistant protein is extracted from moraceous plants, it is contained comparatively abundantly in the latex of the moraceous plants and therefore is easy to purify.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0089">The insect-resistant protein, by its coexistence with insect-resistant factors such as sugar-mimic alkaloids, has an action of boosting the functions of said insect-resistant factors.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0090">Sugar-mimic alkaloids described above include 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol, 1-deoxynojirimycin, 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-ribitol, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0091">To both terminals of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 4 or 5 in the Sequence Listing, other amino acids may be linked.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0092">In this case, from the viewpoint of showing an excellent insect resistance, 0.1 mass % or more of the total amount of protein containing the above other amino acids is preferably contained in the above amino acid sequence, and 0.2 mass % or more is more preferably contained in the above amino acid sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0093">The above insect-resistant protein is preferably used in insect-resistant agents such as insecticides, agricultural chemicals and baits for resisting insects.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0094">As used herein, the baits for resisting insects mean baits which contain an insect-resistant substance and exhibit insect resistance by feeding insects therewith. Specifically, where the above insect-resistant protein is used as a bait for resisting insects, by feeding, e.g., insects which damage humans or inhibit the growth of plants therewith, the growth of the insects is inhibited or the insects are killed, and therefore the insects can be easily removed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">The homology of the insect-resistant protein of the present invention is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0096">The insect-resistant protein of the present invention comprises a first amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 in the Sequence Listing, a second amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 2 in the Sequence Listing and a third amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:3 in the Sequence Listing.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0097">Preferably, the insect-resistant protein of the present invention also comprises a fourth amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:4 in the Sequence Listing.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0098">More preferably, the insect-resistant protein of the present invention further comprises a fifth amino acid sequence having a 50% or more homology with the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:5 in the Sequence Listing.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0099">As used herein, a 50% or more homology means that, in a given amino acid sequence (first protein fragment, second protein fragment, third protein fragment, active partial amino acid sequence and full-length amino acid sequence), 50% or more of the amino acids are in the same sequence. Specifically, it means that one or a plurality of amino acids of less than 50% of a given amino acid sequence may be changed by substitution, deletion, addition and/or insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0100">The above homology is preferably 70% or more, more preferably 80% or more, still more preferably 90% or more, further preferably 95% or more, still further preferably 98% or more, particularly preferably 99% or more, most preferably 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0101">In the above given amino acid sequence (first protein fragment, second protein fragment, third protein fragment, active partial amino acid sequence and full-length amino acid sequence), the number of amino acids which are substituted, deleted, added and/or inserted is not particularly limited where the DNA encoding the amino acid sequence has the desired insect resistance, but is preferably nine or less, more preferably four or less.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0102">If it is in the ranges, the insect resistance is not eliminated surely.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0103">Further, the above insect-resistant protein includes, e.g., a mutant, a derivative, an allele, a variant and a homolog which encode a protein constituted of the same amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 or 5 except that one or a plurality of amino acids are substituted, deleted, added and/or inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0104">Methods for preparing DNA in accordance with such an amino acid sequence include, for example, site-directed mutagenesis (Kramer, W. &#x26; Fritz, H.-J. (1987) Oligonucleotide-directed construction of mutagenesis via gapped duplex DNA. Methods in Enzymology, 154:350-367).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0105">The homology of an amino acid sequence can be determined using the BLAST algorithm by Carlin and Altschul (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-2268, 1990, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 5873, 1993). Further, programs referred to as BLASTN and BLASTX based on the BLAST algorithm have been developed (Altschul S F, et al: J Mol Biol 215: 403, 1990).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0106">When an amino acid sequence is analyzed using BLASTX, parameters are set at, for example, score=50 and wordlength=3. When the BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs are used, the default parameters of the respective programs are used. Further, the specific procedures of these analysis methods are well known (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0107">(Synthesis of Insect-Resistant Protein)</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0108">The insect-resistant protein of the present invention can be synthesized by a solid-phase method, a liquid-phase method and biological synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0109">As used herein, the solid-phase method refers to a method comprising: using, as a solid phase, e.g., polystyrene polymer gel beads having a diameter of about 0.1 mm having surfaces modified with an amino group; individually extending amino acid chains therefrom by dehydration reaction; and excising a completed peptide sequence of interest from a solid-phase surface to obtain a substance of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0110">In addition, the liquid-phase method comprises carrying out synthesis in a liquid phase without fixing peptides to be synthesized on a solid phase, wherein purification is carried out whenever one amino acid residue is extended.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0111">The above biological synthesis is a method of constructing artificial DNA, in which coding regions having genetic codes for peptides to be synthesized are coupled, under the control of a promoter suitable for abundant expression, to be synthesized with the cultured cells of <i>E. coli</i>, yeast, insects or vertebrate animals. Further, living cells may not be always used, and a cell-free transcription-translation system using cell extracts containing all factors related to transcription and translation of genes may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0112">(Collection of Insect-Resistant Protein)</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0113">The insect-resistant protein of the present invention is collected as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0114">First, the latex of moraceous plants is extracted and is separated into a supernatant and a particle layer. Separating means therefor is not particularly limited but include centrifugation, filtration, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0115">Where centrifugation is carried out as the separating means, centrifugal force is preferably 15,000-20,000 G and rotation is preferably performed for 1-60 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0116">Therefore, a supernatant containing at least 5% (rate of mass (g) to volume (ml)) of a desired protein is obtained. Further, the obtained supernatant is preferably filtered out through a filter having a bore diameter of 0.1-0.8 &#x3bc;m after the centrifugation. Thereby, impurities such as contaminations can be surely removed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0117">The insect-resistant protein of the present invention is then extracted from the obtained supernatant. Such extraction means include gel filtration chromatography, electrophoresis, ion exchange chromatography, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0118">Of these, electrophoresis is preferred, and electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (native-PAGE) is more preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0119">This case has an advantage of being able to efficiently remove other proteins. Further, the above electrophoresis encompasses carrier-free electrophoresis, paper electrophoresis, gel electrophoresis using agarose or polyacrylamide gel, isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, two-dimensional electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis and pulsed-field electrophoresis.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0120">Here, a case of carrying out polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on nondenaturing conditions is described.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0121">First, a buffer solution adjusted to pH 6.8-8.8 with a buffer such as a TBS buffer, PBS buffer, TE buffer, TAE buffer or TBE buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0122">Polyacrylamide gel is then introduced so that a blending rate is 12.5% (rate of mass (g) to volume (ml)). In addition, the above supernatant is introduced to carry out electrophoresis.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0123">Then, the supernatant is fractionated into several bands. A fraction having a molecular weight of 50-60 kDa is collected therefrom and cultured to obtain the insect-resistant protein of the present invention.</p>
