<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a mount board and an electronic device with electronic components mounted on a circuit board thereof. More specifically, the invention relates to a mount board and an electronic device with a curved circuit board.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, portable devices represented by cellular phones have been thriving. Design of a portable device as well as higher functionality and higher performance of the portable device has been regarded as important. Then, in order to improve usability and appearance, a curved surface is being in heavy usage for the shape of a case of the portable device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a conventional mount board mounted within the case of the portable device, however, electronic components such as a semiconductor package are mounted on a flat board. Thus, it is difficult to efficiently arrange the electronic components within the case formed of various curved surfaces. For this reason, when the design is given priority, there is a problem that the size of the device may increase. Accordingly, it frequently happens that a design compromise must be inevitably made. Thus, it is strongly desired to put into practical use a board having a curved surface in conformity with the curved surface of the case, which is excellent in component arrangement efficiency within the case.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, as a semiconductor package suited to the portable device, for which size reduction is required, a semiconductor package (a semiconductor device) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> may be pointed out. In this semiconductor package, solder balls are arranged on a bottom surface of the package in a lattice form as connecting terminals. Such a package is described in Patent Document 1 and is referred to as a BGA (Ball Grid Array), a CSP (Chip Size Package), or a WL-CSP (Wafer Level Chip Size Package). Such a package is extensively used because more terminals can be arranged on this package with a smaller occupied area.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a method of mounting this semiconductor package on the board, there is adopted the method of printing a cream solder on pads of the board using a metal mask, and melting the solder by reflowing after the semiconductor package has been mounted, thereby obtaining mechanical and electrical connection.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, when the semiconductor package premised on being placed on the flat board is mounted on a board formed of a curved surface, there is a problem that a solder connection failure may occur according to the size of the semiconductor package or a curvature of a curved surface of a circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When mounting onto a board <b>203</b> having a convex curved surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is performed, for example, a distance between a solder ball <b>202</b> and a pad <b>204</b> of the board <b>203</b> increases at an outer peripheral portion of a semiconductor package <b>201</b>. Further, when mounting onto a concave curved surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is performed, a distance between a solder ball <b>202</b> and a board <b>203</b> increases at the central portion of a semiconductor package <b>201</b>. With respect to the boards <b>203</b> each having a curvature in some direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> as well, the larger the curvature of the board <b>203</b> is and the larger the size of the semiconductor package <b>201</b> is, there tends to be a terminal at which the solder ball <b>202</b> does not come into the pad <b>204</b> of the board <b>203</b>. The solder connection failure is thereby brought about.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the conventional semiconductor package is mounted on the curved board as described above, the solder connection failure caused by noncontact between a solder ball of the semiconductor package and a pad of the board may occur. Accordingly, the semiconductor package cannot be mounted on the board formed of the curved surface.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Then, as means for solving the problem of the connection failure that may occur when the semiconductor package as described in Patent Document 1 is mounted, Patent Document 2 proposes a method of curving a chip in accordance with the curvature of a board and then joining the chip to the curved surface of the board with the chip caused to follow the curved surface, thereby preventing occurrence of the connection failure (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, when the chip is curved as described above, a warp may occur on the circuit surface of the chip. Then, a problem arises that a minute circuit formed on the surface of the chip may be thereby broken or electrical characteristics of the minute circuit may change. Electrical characteristics of an analog circuit in particular greatly change even by a minute warp, and this change in the electrical characteristics affects overall system performance. Thus, it is strongly desired to minimize stress that may be applied to the circuit surface of the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, in recent years, a fragile insulating film (such as a low-k film) targeted for a faster operation has been adopted. Then, even in common flat-surface packages, a study of a lower-stress sealant, a lower-stress structure, or the like is made. To find out a way to achieve stress reduction is therefore an important challenge. In a step of mounting a semiconductor package as well, for example, it is necessary to find a way of restraining a warp of the semiconductor package during reflow heating when the semiconductor package is mounted on a board and minimizing stress that may be applied to a chip within the semiconductor package after the mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described above, there is a problem that the method of curving the chip, proposed in Patent Document 2 cannot be applied to the analog circuit of which electrical characteristics may greatly change and for which restraint of stress to be applied to a chip is therefore required, the semiconductor package formed of the fragile insulating film targeted for the faster operation, or the semiconductor chip.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A main challenge of the present invention is to allow stress that may be applied to a semiconductor package to be suppressed, when the semiconductor package is mounted on a curved board.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Means to Solve the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A mount board according to a first aspect of the present invention is the mount board with a semiconductor package mounted on a curved board thereof, the curved board including a curved surface on at least a portion thereof. The curved board includes:</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">a pedestal portion disposed on a region of the curved-surface portion where the semiconductor package is mounted and having an upper surface thereof formed flat, the upper surface being formed of an insulating material; and</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">a plurality of pad portions disposed on the flat surface of the pedestal portion. The semiconductor package is mounted on the pad portions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A mount board according to a second aspect of the present invention is the mount board with a semiconductor package mounted on a curved board thereof, the curved board including a curved surface on at least a portion thereof. The curved board includes:</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">a pedestal portion disposed on a region of the curved-surface portion where the semiconductor package is mounted, the pedestal portion being formed of an insulating material;</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">the pedestal portion being formed by molding an insulating material other than an insulating material of an insulating layer used on the curved board;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">the semiconductor package being disposed inside the pedestal portion;</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">external terminals of the semiconductor package being disposed on an opposite side of the surface of the board and being exposed from the pedestal portion;</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">the mount board comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">a wiring pattern disposed on at least the pedestal portion and the semiconductor package, the wiring pattern electrically connecting a wiring layer of the curved board and the external terminals of the semiconductor package.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A curved board according to a third aspect of the present invention is the curved board including a curved surface on at least a portion thereof. The curved board includes:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">a pedestal portion disposed on a region of the curved-surface portion where a semiconductor package is mounted and having an upper surface thereof formed flat, the pedestal portion being formed of an insulating material; and</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">a plurality of pad portions disposed on the flat surface of the pedestal portion.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">An electronic device according to a fourth aspect of the present invention is configured by including the mount board or the curved board.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Effect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the present invention (claimed in claims <b>1</b> thorough <b>21</b>), the curved board having a locally flat portion is formed. On the locally flat portion, the pad portions on the board to be connected to the semiconductor package are formed to be flat. Accordingly, when the semiconductor package is mounted on the curved board, the semiconductor package can be mounted on pads arranged to be flat, as in the case where the semiconductor package is mounted on a common flat board. For this reason, a solder connection failure that may arise when a conventional common semiconductor package represented by a BGA is mounted on a curved board as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> or <b>19</b> can be suppressed. Further, it is not necessary to curve a semiconductor chip and mount the curved semiconductor chip, either. Mounting of the semiconductor package on the curved board can be realized in which no stress to the semiconductor chip included in the semiconductor chip will arise.</p>

The material of the base member <b>11</b> is not limited to the glass epoxy resin, and an aramid nonwoven cloth may be employed instead of the glass cloth. Further, the base member <b>11</b> may be formed of a material having good curved-surface processability.

<p id="p-0067" num="0114">First, the wiring layer <b>12</b> is formed on the circuit board <b>11</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). Herein, the wiring layer <b>12</b> can be patterned by a subtractive method, an additive method, or a semi-additive method. In the subtractive method, a wiring pattern is formed by etching a surplus portion of copper foil or copper plating formed on the circuit board <b>11</b>. In the additive or semi-additive method, the wiring layer <b>12</b> is formed by plating, after a portion except a wiring formation region has been masked by an insulating resin.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0116">Next, molding of the pedestal portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the insulating layer <b>13</b> and molding of the curved surface of the board are simultaneously performed by press processing (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). When the moldings and curing are performed in this step, the insulating layer <b>13</b> is heated and pressurized by press molds <b>40</b> each processed into a desired shape. The insulating layer <b>13</b> is thereby softened and flows inside the press molds <b>40</b>. Then, the insulating layer <b>13</b> is cured into the shape defined by the press molds after having being filled into the shape defined by the press molds. By this heating and pressurization, the base member <b>11</b> is also softened and deformed. The curved surface of a desired shape can be thereby obtained. At the same time, the insulating layer <b>13</b> is cured, and the pedestal portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>that has the locally flat surface is thereby formed. A heating temperature in this case needs to be not less than a temperature at which the insulating layer <b>13</b> can be cured. Herein, a temperature of 120&#xb0; C. or higher, which is a requirement for the prepreg to be cured, is applied. However, an optimum temperature differs depending on the material of the prepreg. Thus, the heating temperature is conditioned to accommodate the material of the prepreg. Further, in terms of a molding property in the mold, or in order for the resin material in the prepreg to flow and be uniformly filled into the mold, it is preferable that a high fluidity material be selected as the resin material of the prepreg.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0117">Next, the via holes are formed in the insulating layer <b>13</b>, and then, the vias <b>14</b> and the wiring layer <b>15</b> are formed (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>). Herein, the via holes are formed by opening the cured insulating layer <b>13</b> by a laser or an etching method until the insulating layer <b>12</b> appears. The thicker the insulating layer <b>13</b> is, the more processability of the via holes is reduced. Accordingly, it is desirable that the insulating layer <b>13</b> be formed to be thin within a range that electrical characteristics thereof are not affected. Formation of the vias <b>14</b> and the wiring layer <b>15</b> is performed for an upper portion of the insulating layer <b>13</b> by patterning using the additive method or semi-additive method. When the vias <b>14</b> and the wiring layer <b>15</b> are formed, copper plating is used, and the plating is filled into the via holes.

On this occasion, it is desirable that the surface of the insulating layer <b>13</b> be roughened by a desmear process or the like in order to improve an adhesion force between the wiring layers <b>15</b> and <b>13</b>. Further, it is desirable that the surface of a location of the wiring layer <b>12</b> to which the plating will be applied is roughened, as in the insulating layer <b>13</b>, in order to improve an adhesion force between each of vias <b>14</b> and the insulating layer <b>12</b>.

The facilities for forming the vias <b>14</b> are the facilities associated with the steps of the present invention such as an exposure machine for wiring, a photomask for wiring, a laser device for drilling the vias, and an etching layer for forming interconnects, for example. On the other hand, when the step of forming the prepreg and the step of curving the entire board are separated, the facilities related to formation of the wiring layer <b>15</b> and the vias <b>14</b> should only accommodate the curvature that defines a mounting range of the semiconductor package alone.
