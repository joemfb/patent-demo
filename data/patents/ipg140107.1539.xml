<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This non-provisional patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) from Patent Application No. 200810141851.2 filed in The People's Republic of China on Sep. 3, 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a fuel pump for an internal combustion engine and in particular to a fuel pump driven by a brushless direct current (BLDC) motor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fuel pumps are used in motor vehicles to transfer liquid fuel, typically gasoline or diesel from a fuel tank to an internal combustion engine. The pump is driven by a small DC motor and to minimize fuel leakage through bearing seals etc, the fuel passes through the interior of the motor. This works very well even with motors having commutators, with the fuel cooling the motor and eliminating sparking between the brushes and the commutator. However, with the advent of high alcohol fuels, chemical reactions between the commutator and the fuel has become problematic leading to the use of graphite commutators and renewed interest in brushless motors to drive the fuel pumps. There are many advantages of brushless motors, especially in automobile applications, such as longer life by eliminating the use of brushes and a commutator.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One problem with the use of BLDC motors in fuel pumps is that the fuel has a very restricted pathway through the motor which causes a severe restriction to the free flow of fuel. One reason for this is that BLDC motors have a wound stator and due to the aggressive nature of the fuel it is desirable to protect the stator windings. This is usually done by over moulding the stator, core and windings, with over mould material such as a plastics material or a resinous material, preferably using an insert moulding technique. This technique, unfortunately, transforms the stator into a solid mass, closing off the various gaps between the stator core and the windings. As the stator core is usually pressed into the pump housing, the only remaining pathway for the fuel is through the small gap between the stator and the rotor. However, this gap is intentionally made as small as possible to increase the efficiency of the motor. Fuel in this small gap is caught between the rotating rotor on one side and the stationary stator on the other side causing frictional heating of the fuel as well as causing considerable drag on the rotor, resulting in a significant lowering of the motor efficiency. This problem does not exist in the PMDC motors having a stator formed with segment magnets due to the channels existing between the individual magnets.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The term brushless direct current motor is used in this specification is used in its widest sense and is intended to include those special BLDC motors known as BLAC motors which have a similar physical structure but are designed to operate with sinusoidal power signals from the motor controller.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hence there is a desire for a BLDC motor driven fuel pump which does not restrict the flow of fuel passed the motor while maintaining the efficiency of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This is achieved in the present invention by fuel passageways between the motor stator and the fuel pump housing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, in one aspect thereof, the present invention provides a fuel pump for an internal combustion engine, comprising: a housing; a pump accommodated within the housing; a motor accommodated within the housing, the motor having a wound stator having a plurality of inwardly directed teeth about which a stator winding is wound, and an outer surface in contact with an inner surface of the housing; and at least one pathway formed between the inner surface of the housing and the outer surface of the stator, for the flow of fuel there through.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the or each pathway is formed by an axially extending trough formed in the outer surface of the stator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the or each trough is aligned with a selected tooth of the stator.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the or each selected tooth of the stator is unwound.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the stator is over molded with material to protect the winding from chemical reaction with the fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the motor is a brushless direct current motor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the stator of the motor is encased in a plastics or resin material.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, there are three pathways and the motor has four rotor poles and nine stator poles.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a complete fuel pump <b>40</b> in sectional view. The fuel pump has a housing <b>42</b> of cylindrical form with two open ends which are sealed by end caps <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> which connect the fuel pump to the fuel lines. The housing has a pump section <b>46</b> and a motor section <b>50</b> accommodating a motor. The pump section <b>46</b> includes an impeller <b>47</b> arranged to be rotated by the motor within a volute <b>48</b> to draw fuel into the pump section from a fuel inlet <b>49</b> in the first end cap <b>44</b> and force the fuel through the motor section <b>50</b> and out a fuel outlet <b>51</b> in the second end cap <b>45</b>. The motor section <b>50</b> houses the motor which includes a stator <b>12</b> which is pressed into the housing <b>42</b>, and the rotor <b>16</b> with the rotor core <b>17</b> located within the stator <b>12</b> and a rotor shaft <b>19</b> which is journalled in bearings in the pump volute <b>48</b> at one end and in the second end cap <b>45</b> at the other end. The stator <b>12</b> supports a stator winding <b>20</b> and is over molded with material, such as a plastics material or a resin material, to protect the winding from chemical reaction with the fuel being pumped. The second end cap is shown being of two parts, a first part sealing the housing <b>42</b> and forming the fuel outlet <b>51</b> and the connector for the electrical power to operate the motor, and a second part supporting the bearing for the rotor shaft. The second end cap <b>45</b> may include an electronics module to accommodate the electronics for operating the BLDC motor. However, in this embodiment the electronics module is provided outside of the fuel pump.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fuel flow path through the fuel pump is: in through the inlet <b>49</b> in the first end cap <b>44</b>; into the pump volute <b>48</b>, where it is forced out by the impeller <b>47</b> into the interior of the housing <b>42</b>; passed the motor by passing through the fuel pathways <b>52</b> between the stator core <b>13</b> and the housing <b>42</b> (although some fuel may still pass between the rotor core <b>17</b> and the stator core <b>13</b>); into the second end cap <b>45</b>; and out of the pump though the fuel outlet <b>51</b> of the second end cap <b>45</b>, as illustrated by block arrows <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a transverse sectional view through the fuel pump, viewed along section lines A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the fuel pathways <b>52</b> between the stator <b>12</b> and the housing <b>42</b>. Three fuel pathways <b>52</b> are provided in the preferred embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows how the gaps <b>130</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in the stator have been filled by the over mould material such that the end face of the stator presents as a solid wall.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The stator <b>12</b> and rotor <b>16</b> set is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. After the stator winding is formed on the stator core <b>13</b>, the stator <b>12</b> is over molded with a plastics material or resin material <b>30</b>, preferably by an insert molding operation. Preferably, the pole faces <b>18</b> and the radially outer surface <b>34</b> of the stator core <b>13</b> are not covered with the over mould material. This ensures a good transfer of magnetic flux between the pole faces <b>18</b> of the stator and the rotor and also allows a good fit with the motor housing in which the stator core is preferably a press fit.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The stator winding may be connected to stator terminals for connection to a controller or directly to motor terminals and where used the terminals would also have exposed parts (not shown) not covered by the over molding for making further electrical connections. The rotor core <b>17</b> is also shown as being over molded to protect the rotor core from the fuel and to assist retention of the magnets on the rotor. The over mould material also helps the efficiency of the fuel pump by making a smooth path for the flow of the fuel and by smoothing the outer surface of the rotor to reduce windage, the resistance created by rotating body.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic winding diagram for a 3-phase BLDC motor for a first preferred embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also illustrates the configuration of the stator core of the preferred embodiment. The stator <b>12</b> has a stator core <b>13</b> with six teeth <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> forming the stator poles as will be described later. The winding <b>20</b> has only three coils <b>22</b> formed about alternate teeth <b>14</b>. The winding <b>20</b> is a 3-phase Delta winding having three legs, one leg for each phase, with each end of each leg being connected to two of the three stator terminals A,B,C, with each terminal being connected to two of the legs, such that the ends of each leg is electrically connected to the other two legs. Thus each leg has only one coil <b>22</b>. However, the wound teeth <b>14</b> have a larger circumferential extent than the unwound teeth <b>15</b> and have a deep groove <b>26</b> in the pole face which extends axially for the length of the tooth <b>14</b> and radially outwardly into the tooth, dividing the pole face into two, preferably equal, portions. The groove <b>26</b> has the effect of dividing the tooth <b>14</b> into two stator poles and forming a dummy slot. Thus the stator effectively has 9 slots or 9 stator poles. The grooves <b>26</b> are referred to as dummy slots as no coils are wound into the dummy slots, giving the stator a simple winding.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Indeed, a Delta winding configuration does offer some advantages by simplifying the winding connections as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As shown, in the Delta configuration of a three phase winding, each phase winding is connected to the other two phase windings. Thus, during winding the wire is connected to a first stator terminal A, wrapped about a first stator tooth to form the first phase winding, connected to a second stator terminal B, wrapped about a second stator tooth to form the second phase winding, connected to a third stator terminal C, wound about a third stator tooth to form the third phase winding and finally connected back to the first stator terminal A. The wire is only cut after being connected to the first stator terminal for the second time, simplifying the winding by eliminating the common Star connection point.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows the shape of the stator core. The stator core <b>13</b> has a circular construction to mate with the inner surface of the housing <b>42</b> of the fuel pump, with the exception that the radially outer surface <b>34</b> of the stator core <b>13</b> has a number of axially extending recesses <b>28</b>. Recesses <b>28</b> form fuel pathways between the stator core <b>13</b> and the housing <b>42</b> allowing the fuel to flow through passed the motor. The recesses <b>28</b> are shown aligned with the non-wound teeth <b>15</b>. This is thought to have no negative impact on the magnetic circuit of the stator while allowing maximum space for the coils <b>22</b> formed on the wound teeth <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The stator core <b>13</b> is a laminated structure formed by stamping and stacking a plurality of steel laminations. The laminations may be held together by suitable means such as interlocking or welding. In the preferred embodiment the laminations are welded together. This is preferably done by using a laser welder to weld together a small nub <b>32</b> formed on each lamination for this purpose in a cut-out <b>33</b> in the outer surface <b>34</b> of the stator core aligned with the wound teeth <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. During over molding, this cut-out <b>33</b> is filled with mould material to protect the weld. This over mould material forms the strip <b>31</b>, which can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> on the outer surface <b>34</b> of the stator core connecting the ends of the stator.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thus the present invention provides a novel construction for a fuel pump. This structure is well suited to use of a BLDC motor in the pump for driving the pump. For the fuel pump, the provision of fuel pathways between the stator and the housing is considered an advantage. The use of a BLDC motor, especially a BLDC motor with reduced cogging torque is an added advantage. Certain embodiments are ideally suited to mass production.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the housing of the fuel pump has been described as &#x2018;cylindrical&#x2019; and the example shown is a right circular cylinder, it is intended that this term is not limited to a cylinder with a right circular cross-section but covers any tubular structure having a constant cross-section, with ends which may or may not be formed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although the invention is described with reference to one or more preferred embodiments, it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications are possible. Therefore, the scope of the invention is to be determined by reference to the claims that follow.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the description and claims of the present application, each of the verbs &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;include&#x201d;, &#x201c;contain&#x201d; and &#x201c;have&#x201d;, and variations thereof, are used in an inclusive sense, to specify the presence of the stated item but not to exclude the presence of additional items.</p>
