<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The description below concerns several embodiments of the invention. The discussion references the illustrated preferred embodiment. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited to either the illustrated embodiment, nor is it limited to those discussed, to the contrary, the scope should be interpreted as broadly as possible based on the language of the Claims section of this document.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This disclosure provides several embodiments of the present invention. It is contemplated that any features from any embodiment can be combined with any features from any other embodiment. In this fashion, hybrid configurations of the illustrated embodiments are well within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-D</figref> illustrate one embodiment of a headset cord holder <b>100</b> having a groove <b>120</b> molded into the body <b>110</b> of a shirt button in accordance with the principles of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-D</figref> show a side view, front view, plan view, and perspective view of the cord holder <b>100</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The body <b>110</b> is configured to be coupled to a shirt, or another item of clothing, in the place of a standard button. In some embodiments, one or more apertures <b>115</b> are formed in the body <b>110</b> and used to sew, or otherwise affix, the body <b>110</b> of the cord holder <b>100</b> to an item of clothing.
