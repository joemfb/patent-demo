<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a fabrication method of light emitting diode and a laser lift-off apparatus for manufacturing the light emitting diode and, is more particularly, to a method for fabricating a light emitting diode using a laser lift-off apparatus including a heater.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, good thermal stability and direct transition type energy band of group III-based nitrides, such as gallium nitride GaN, and aluminum nitride AN have been adopted as one of the group III-based nitride material for manufacturing light emitting diodes in the range of visible light and UV light. Typically, InGaN-based blue and green light emitting diodes have been utilized for various types of applications such as large natural color flat display panels, traffic signals, interior lightings, high density light sources, high resolution output systems, and optical communication systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A group III-based nitride semiconductor layer is grown on a heterogeneous substrate having a similar crystal structure to the semiconductor layer by using a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) or a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) due to difficulty in growing a homogeneous substrate that permits growth of the semiconductor layer thereon. For example, a sapphire substrate with the hexagonal structure is generally used as the heterogeneous substrate. However, since sapphire is an electrical insulator, the using of the sapphire can cause to limit a structure of light emitting diodes. Thus, recent studies have focused on to grow epitaxial layers including nitride semiconductor layers on a heterogeneous substrate such as a sapphire substrate, followed by a process of lifting-off the heterogeneous substrate from the epitaxial layers in which a vertical structure type light emitting diode can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As for an approach of lifting-off the heterogeneous substrate, a laser lift-off technique is generally applied. According to a conventional lift-off technique, if a second substrate is a homogeneous substrate to the sapphire substrate or has a similar coefficient of thermal expansion to that of the sapphire substrate, the conventional lift-off technique, irradiating the sapphire substrate by laser beam, can be performed without significant problems. However, if the second substrate has a different coefficient of thermal expansion from that of the sapphire substrate, the conventional lift-off technique often causes cracking or fracture of epitaxial layers during separation of the sapphire substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the difference in thermal coefficient between the second substrate and the sapphire substrate often causes bowing of the sapphire substrate after the second substrate is bonded to the epitaxial layers. The bowing of the sapphire substrate causes the laser beam to be out of focus thereby making it difficult to accurately transfer energy of the laser beam to an interface between the sapphire substrate and the epitaxial layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there is a need for an approach to prevent the epitaxial layers from cracking, fracturing and bending during a process associated with a lift-off technique.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other needs are addressed by the present invention, in which exemplary embodiments provide a method for fabricating a light emitting diode capable of prevent cracking or fracture of epitaxial layers during separation of a substrate using a laser lift-off technique.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A method for fabricating a light emitting diode and a laser lift-off apparatus are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrate respective processes in a method of fabricating a light emitting diode using a laser lift-off apparatus in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, epitaxial layers <b>26</b> may include a first conductive-type compound semiconductor layer <b>21</b>, an active layer <b>23</b> and a second conductive-type compound semiconductor layer <b>25</b> that may be formed on a first substrate <b>10</b>. The first substrate <b>10</b> may be a growth substrate, for example, a sapphire substrate, on which the epitaxial layers <b>16</b> can be grown.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The epitaxial layers <b>26</b> may be gallium nitride-based compound semiconductors grown on the first substrate <b>10</b> by a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) or a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In some examples, the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> may include a buffer layer (not shown) provided to relieve lattice mismatch between the first substrate <b>10</b> and the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> grown thereon. Further, the active layer <b>23</b> may have a single or multi-quantum well structure. The first and second conductive-type compound semiconductors may be n-type and p-type semiconductors or p-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The epitaxial layers <b>26</b> may be formed to have a total thickness less than approximately 10 &#x3bc;m. The total thickness of the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> may relatively smaller than the thickness of the first substrate <b>10</b> that can be used as the growth substrate. For example, since the first substrate <b>10</b> may have a thickness of approximately 100 &#x3bc;m or more, the thickness of the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> may not exceed about 1/10th of the thickness of the first substrate <b>10</b>. As such, the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> may be formed to have a total thickness less than approximately 10 &#x3bc;m, thereby relatively may reduce a stress applied from the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> to the first substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The epitaxial layers <b>26</b> may be grown in a vacuum chamber. After the growth of the epitaxial layers <b>26</b>, the first substrate <b>10</b> having the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> thereon may be taken out of the chamber for a subsequent process.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a second substrate <b>30</b> may be bonded to the uppermost layer of the epitaxial layers <b>26</b>, for example, the second conductive-type compound semiconductor layer <b>25</b>. The second substrate <b>30</b>, variously being selected based on the characteristic of using thereof in consideration of such as a heat conduction and an electric conduction, may be a silicon substrate or a metal substrate as an example. In some examples, when fabricating a vertical light emitting diode, the second substrate <b>30</b> may be a conductive substrate. The second substrate <b>30</b> generally may have a different coefficient of thermal expansion than that of the first substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The second substrate <b>30</b> may be bonded to the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> by eutectic bonding of a bonding metal <b>31</b>. The bonding metal <b>31</b> may be AuSn, which may have a melting point of about 330&#xb0; C. A bonding metal having a higher melting point than that of AuSn may also be used. After the bonding metal <b>31</b> is formed on one side of the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> and on the opposite side of the second substrate <b>30</b>, the bonding metal <b>31</b> may be heated to, for example, about 300&#xb0; C. to cause eutectic bonding such that the second substrate <b>30</b> can be bonded to the epitaxial layers <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Before forming the bonding metal <b>31</b>, a reflective layer <b>27</b> and a diffusion barrier layer <b>29</b> may be formed on the epitaxial layers <b>26</b>. The reflective layer <b>27</b> may enhance light output by reflecting light that can be generated from the active layer <b>23</b> and may travel toward the second substrate <b>30</b>. The reflective layer <b>27</b> may be in ohmic contact with the second conductive-type semiconductor layer <b>25</b>. The reflective layer <b>27</b> may be formed one of the group of Al, Ag, Ni, Ph, Pd, Pt, or Ru and a combination alloy based on the group. The diffusion barrier layer <b>29</b> may prevent deterioration of reflectivity of the reflective layer <b>27</b>, which can be caused by diffusion of the bonding metal <b>31</b> into the reflective layer <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, subsequent to bonding process of the second substrate <b>30</b>, the first substrate <b>10</b> and the second substrate <b>30</b> may be cooled to room temperature. Then, the first substrate <b>10</b> may be placed in a laser lift-off apparatus to separate the first substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Prior to laser irradiation, the first substrate <b>10</b> may be heated above room temperature. In this example, considering the melting point of the bonding metal, the temperature of the first substrate <b>10</b>, that is, the second temperature, may not exceed the first temperature, that is, the eutectic temperature. If the second temperature exceeds the first temperature, the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> can be fractured due to an excessive thermal expansion of the bonding metal. Therefore, if the bonding metal <b>31</b> is, for example, AuSn, the first substrate <b>10</b> may be heated to a temperature of about 300&#xb0; C. or less, preferably in the range of about 200&#x2dc;300&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first substrate <b>10</b> may be heated in a laser lift-off apparatus capable of providing a heating means, that is, a heater, as described below. Alternatively, after being heated outside a laser lift-off apparatus, the first substrate <b>10</b> may be shifted into the laser lift-off apparatus prior to being cooled to a room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a laser beam can be irradiated through the first substrate <b>10</b> to separate the first substrate <b>10</b> from the epitaxial layers <b>26</b>. In this example, the temperature of the first substrate <b>10</b> may higher than a room temperature and may not exceed the first temperature. Accordingly, a stress applied to the first substrate <b>10</b> or second substrate <b>30</b> due to the difference in coefficient of a thermal expansion between the first and second substrates <b>10</b>, <b>30</b> may be relieved or minimized. As a result, bowing (e.g., bending) of the first substrate <b>10</b> can be relieved that allows to facilitate focusing of the laser beam, and the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> can be prevented from cracking or fracturing suffered during partial separation process of the first substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, subsequent to separation process of the first substrate <b>10</b>, an electrode pad <b>33</b> may be formed on an exposed surface of the first conductive-type compound semiconductor layer <b>21</b>, and an electrode pad <b>35</b> may be formed on the second substrate <b>30</b>. Then, the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> including the second substrate <b>30</b> can be divided into individual light emitting diodes to fabricate vertical structure type light emitting diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, the first substrate <b>10</b> can be described as being heated prior to the laser irradiation. Alternatively, subsequent to the second substrate <b>30</b> bonding to the epitaxial layers <b>26</b>, the first substrate <b>10</b> may be shifted into the laser lift-off apparatus while being cooled, and may then be separated from the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> by irradiating the laser beam thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, although the second substrate <b>30</b> may be described as being bonded to the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> via the bonding metal <b>31</b>, the second substrate <b>30</b> may also be bonded thereto by other techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph depicting measured bowing of the second substrate <b>30</b> based on a heating temperature subsequent to the second substrate <b>30</b> bonding to the epitaxial layers <b>26</b>. In this example, the first substrate <b>10</b> may be an approximately <b>2</b>-inch sapphire substrate and the second substrate <b>30</b> may be a silicon substrate and may be bonded to the epitaxial layers <b>26</b> at approximately 300&#xb0; C. by AuSn-eutectic bonding. For example, a degree of bowing can be an average value obtained by measuring the height of respective edges of the second substrate <b>30</b> with a wafer placed on a flat surface to allow the second substrate <b>30</b> to contact the flat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, subsequent to the second substrate <b>30</b> bonding to the epitaxial layers, the degree of bowing reaches about 3.2 mm at a room temperature. As the wafer is heated, the degree of bowing can be lowered. At approximately 200&#xb0; C., the degree of bowing can be lowered below approximately &#xbd; of the bowing degree at a room temperature, and at approximately 250&#xb0; C., the degree of bowing can be lowered to approximately 0.5 mm or less and may not further significantly be lowered even by an additional heating.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Accordingly, it can be seen that subsequent to the second substrate <b>30</b> bonding to the epitaxial layers, the bowing of the first substrate <b>10</b> can be relieved by heating the first substrate <b>10</b>. The above example can be obtained using the approximately 2-inch sapphire substrate, and the degree of bowing can be expected to linearly increase in proportion to the size of the sapphire substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is contemplated that, when the 2-inch sapphire substrate is used as the first substrate <b>10</b>, the first substrate <b>10</b> may be heated to a temperature at which the degree of bowing becomes at least approximately 3 mm or less, preferably approximately 1.5 mm or less.</p>
