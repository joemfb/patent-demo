<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrophotographic image forming apparatus for forming an image on a recording material, wherein cartridge is dismountably mounted to a main assembly of the apparatus. Here, the electrophotographic image forming apparatus forms a color image on the recording material using an electrophotographic image forming process. The examples of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus include an electrophotographic copying machine, an electrophotographic printer (a laser beam printer, an LED printer, for example), a facsimile device, and a word processor. The image is formed by the image forming apparatus on a recording material, and the recording material is paper, an OHP sheet, for example. The cartridge is a process cartridge, a developing cartridge or the like and contributes to an image forming process for forming the image on the recording material in the state that it is mounted to the main assembly of the image forming apparatus. Here, the process cartridge contains at least one of the charging means, developing means, cleaning means as process means, and the electrophotographic photosensitive drum (drum) as a unit integrally, and it is dismountably mountable to the main assembly. The process cartridge may contain the developing means as the process means and the electrophotographic photosensitive drum as a unit, and it is dismountably mounted to the main assembly of the electrophotographic image forming apparatus. The process cartridge may contain the charging means, the developing means, or the cleaning means as the process means and the drum as a unit, and it is dismountably mounted to the main assembly. The process cartridge which is provided integrally with the drum and the developing means is called an integral-type process cartridge. The process cartridge which is provided integrally with the drum and the process means other than the developing means is called a discrete type process cartridge. In this case, the developing means is provided in a developing unit unintegral with the process cartridge, and the discrete type process cartridge forms the image using the combination with such a developing unit. The mounting and demounting of the process cartridge can be carried out relative to the main assembly by a user. For this reason, the maintenance of the apparatus is easy. The process means is actable on the electrophotographic photosensitive drum. The developing cartridge has the developing roller, contains the powdery developer toner having developed the electrostatic latent image formed on the drum by the developing roller used, and is mounted to the apparatus main assembly dismountably. In the case of the developing cartridge, the drum is mounted to a main assembly or a cartridge supporting member. Or, the drum is provided in a so-called discrete type process cartridge In this case, the process cartridge is not provided with the developing means. The developing cartridge can also carry out the mounting and demounting relative to said main assembly by the user. For this reason, the maintenance of the apparatus is easy. Therefore, the cartridge in this invention includes the process cartridges of a so-called the integral type or a so-called discrete type. The cartridge includes a combination of the so-called process cartridge of the discrete type and the developing cartridge. In another example of the cartridge, the drum is mounted fixedly to the main assembly or the cartridge supporting member, and the detachably mountable developing cartridge acts on the electrophotographic photosensitive drum. As has been described hereinbefore, the image forming apparatus for forming the image on the recording material using the image forming process is known. In this image forming apparatus, the process cartridge type described above is known. In addition, the developing cartridge type which comprises only the developing unit unintegral with the drum is known. In the present invention, the process cartridge type and the developing cartridge type are usable. The process cartridge and the developing cartridge are provided with a developer accommodating portion which contains the developer (toner) for developing the electrostatic latent image.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Here, an image forming apparatus capable of forming color images is known. A known image forming apparatus employs a cartridge tray as a drawer member which carries a plurality of cartridge, and the cartridge tray is drawn in the direction in which the cartridges are juxtaposed, by which an exchanging operation of the cartridge is made easy (Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2006-184901).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the image forming apparatus, a developing device for containing the developer is mounted in the member in the form of the drawer. When the developer in the developing device is exhausted, the drawer-like member is drawn out and the developing device is exchanged. Furthermore, a cleaning device for scraping off and accommodating the residual developer which remains on the transportation belt and so on is mounted to the different the member in the form of the drawer called a belt holder from the drawer-like member described above. When the cleaning device is full of the residual developer, the belt holder is drawn, and the cleaning device is exchanged with a new cleaning device. As to devices exchanged at a relatively high frequency such as the developing device and cleaning device, a user handles the different units (drawer-like member and belt holder). An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, wherein the exchanging operation for the cartridge which contains the developer and for the residual developer container which contains the residual developer is improved. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, wherein when an image forming unit is in a mounting and dismounting position, the residual developer container is detachably mountable relative to the image forming unit, by which the operativity in the exchanging operation for the residual developer container is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the present invention, the exchanging operation of the cartridge which contains the developer, and the residual developer container which contains the residual developer, can be improved. In the present invention, when the image forming unit is in the mounting and dismounting position, the residual developer container is detachably mountable relative to the image forming unit, and therefore, the operativity in the exchanging operation for the residual developer container is improved.</p>

An electric power supply system (unshown) provided in the main assembly (<b>100</b>A) is electrically connected to an electrical contact (unshown) of each unit <b>32</b> and cartridge <b>33</b>. Here, the driving system and the bias voltage application type described above can employ the structure similar to the case of the normal image forming apparatus, although not shown in the Figure for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The operation for forming a full-color image will be described. Referring to (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is rotationally driven in the counter-clockwise direction of the arrow at a predetermined speed. The charging roller <b>32</b><i>b </i>is rotated by the rotation of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The transfer member <b>34</b> is rotationally driven at the speed corresponding to the speed of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>in the clockwise direction (codirectional with the rotation of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>) of the arrow. The developing roller <b>33</b><i>b </i>and the supplying roller <b>33</b><i>d </i>are rotationally driven at the predetermined speeds in the clockwise directions of the arrows, respectively. The scanner unit <b>11</b> is driven. In synchronism with this drive, a predetermined charging bias voltage is applied to each charging roller <b>32</b><i>b </i>at predetermined control timing. By this, the surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is uniformly charged by the charging roller <b>32</b><i>b </i>to the predetermined polarity and predetermined potential. The surface of each drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is scanningly exposed to the laser beams L (Y, M, C and K) modulated in accordance with the color image signals corresponding to Y, M, C and K. By this, the electrostatic latent image corresponding to the correspondence color image signals is formed on the surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>of each cartridge P. The electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of each drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is developed into the developer image by the developing roller <b>33</b><i>b </i>of the corresponding cartridge <b>33</b>. The developing roller <b>33</b><i>b </i>is supplied with a predetermined developing bias voltage at the predetermined controlled timing. Through the above-described electrophotographic image forming process operation, a Y color developer image corresponding to a yellow component of the full-color image is formed on the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>opposed by a cartridge <b>33</b>Y. The developer image is transferred (primary transfer) onto the transfer member <b>34</b> in a primary transfer nip which is the contact portion between the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the intermediary transfer member <b>34</b>. An M color developer image corresponding to a magenta component of the full-color image is formed on the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>opposed by a cartridge <b>33</b>M. The developer image is transferred (primary transfer) onto the transfer member <b>34</b> in a primary transfer nip which is the contact portion between the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the transfer member <b>34</b> superimposedly on the already transferred Y color developer image. A C color developer image corresponding to a cyan component of the full-color image is formed on the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>opposed by a cartridge <b>33</b>C. The developer image is transferred (primary transfer) onto the transfer member <b>34</b> in the primary transfer nip which is the contact portion between the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the transfer member <b>34</b> superimposedly on the already transferred Y color+M color developer image. A K color developer image corresponding to a black component of the full-color image is formed on the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>which the cartridge <b>33</b>K opposed. The developer image is transferred (primary transfer) onto the transfer member <b>34</b> in the primary transfer nip which is the contact portion between the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the transfer member <b>34</b> superimposedly on the already transferred Y color+M color+C color developer images. In this way, a full-color developer image of the Y color+M color+C color+K color is synthetically formed on the transfer member <b>34</b>. An order of the colors of the developer images transferred is not limited to the above described order. In each drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>, the untransferred developer which remains on the drum surface after the primary transfer of the developer image is removed by a blade <b>32</b><i>c</i>, and is fed into the container <b>40</b> ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) through the screw <b>32</b><i>e</i>. On the other hand, the feeding roller <b>20</b> is driven at the predetermined controlled timing. In this manner, by a cooperation of the feeding roller <b>20</b> and the separation pad <b>21</b>, the separation and feeding of the sheet-like recording materials S stacked in the cassette <b>19</b> is carried out one by one. The recording material S is introduced into the secondary transfer nip which is the contact portion between the transfer member <b>34</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>22</b>, at the predetermined controlled timing by the registration roller couple <b>18</b><i>a</i>. The transfer roller <b>22</b> is supplied with the secondary transfer bias voltage of the predetermined potential having the polarity opposite to that of the charge polarity of the developer at the predetermined controlled timing. By this, while the recording material S is nipped and fed by the transfer nip, the developer image on the intermediary transfer member <b>34</b> on which it is superimposed is sequentially transferred (secondary transfer) onto the surface of recording material S. The recording material S passed through the secondary transfer nip is separated from the surface of the transfer member <b>34</b> and is introduced into the fixing device <b>23</b> where it is heated and pressed by a fixing nip. By this, the color developer images are mixed and fixed on recording material S. The recording material S is discharged out of the fixing device <b>23</b>, and is discharged on the cover <b>10</b> which functions as a discharging tray by discharging roller pair <b>24</b> as a full-color print. The toner remaining after the secondary transfer remaining on the surface of the transfer member <b>34</b> after the separation of the recording material S from the transfer member <b>34</b> is removed. In the case of this embodiment, the toner is electrostatically deposited onto the surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>in the primary transfer nip <b>34</b><i>b </i>in the unit <b>32</b>Y between the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the transfer member <b>34</b>, and, and then it is removed by the cleaning blade <b>32</b><i>c</i>. The transfer member <b>34</b> is the rotatable member of a drum configuration. The different color developer images formed on the drums <b>32</b><i>a </i>is superimposedly transferred onto the transfer member <b>34</b>. The developer images transferred superimposedly is transferred all together onto the recording material S from the transfer member <b>34</b>. By this, the color image is formed on the recording material S. In the case where a monochromatic image is to be formed, the color developer image K formed on the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>to which the cartridge <b>33</b>K is opposed is transferred onto the transfer member <b>34</b>. The transferred black developer image is transferred onto recording material S from the transfer member <b>34</b>. By which a K color image is formed on the recording material S. In this embodiment, the secondary transfer roller <b>22</b> is movable between a first position in which it contacts to the transfer member <b>34</b> and forms the secondary transfer nip and a second position spaced from the transfer member <b>34</b> by a shifting mechanism (unshown). At the time of an image forming operation of the apparatus <b>100</b>, the secondary transfer roller <b>22</b> is moved to the first position, and at the time of then on-image formation, it is moved to the second position. The transfer roller <b>22</b> may normally be contacted with the intermediary transfer member <b>34</b>.</p>

The cover <b>10</b> is movable between the closing position G for closing the opening portion <b>100</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) of the top surface of the main assembly <b>100</b>A and the open position H for opening the opening portion <b>100</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The cover <b>10</b> is an opening and closing member for opening and closing the opening <b>100</b>B in the upper portion of the main assembly <b>100</b>A about the shaft <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The closed state (closing position) of the cover <b>10</b> is maintained by the engagement (latch engagement) between a locking claw portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>provided on a maintenance button (<b>36</b>) provided on a front side of the main assembly <b>100</b>A and the locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>provided on the cover <b>10</b>, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The locking claw portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>is the main assembly side locking portion, and the locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>is an opening and closing member side locking portion. The closure releasing of the cover <b>10</b> is carried out by pushing a button <b>36</b>. When the button <b>36</b> is pushed rearwardly against the return spring (unshown), a claw portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>on the side of the button (<b>36</b>) escapes from a locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the cover <b>10</b> rearwardly, as shown by a chain line, so that the latching engagement is released. By this, the cover <b>10</b> is rotated to the open position H about the shaft <b>10</b><i>a </i>to open the opening portion <b>100</b>B greatly. In this embodiment, the locking claw portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>and the locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>are elastically locked with each other releasably. However, this embodiment is not limited to this example. For example, the claw (locking portion) provided on one side maybe elastically and releasably locked with the hole (locking portion) provided in another side. As shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for the mounting of the unit <b>200</b> into the main assembly <b>100</b>A, the user rotates the cover <b>10</b> to the open position H to greatly open the opening portion <b>100</b>B. The user inserts the unit <b>200</b> into the main assembly <b>100</b>A from the opening portion <b>100</b>B. The left and right shaft portions <b>45</b>L, <b>45</b>R of the unit <b>200</b> is engaged with the guide portions <b>80</b><i>b </i>opposed to the left and right guiding plates <b>80</b>L, <b>80</b>R of the main assembly (<b>100</b>A), and the unit <b>200</b> is mounted into the main assembly <b>100</b>A. Thereafter, the shaft portions <b>45</b>L, <b>45</b>R are contacted to the positioning portion <b>80</b><i>a </i>provided on an extension of the guide portion <b>80</b><i>b </i>((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). At this time, the gear <b>34</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) provided at the one-end portion of the transfer member <b>34</b> engages with a driving gear (unshown) provided in the main assembly <b>100</b>A. Thereafter, the user rotates the unit <b>200</b> in the direction of the arrow X<b>2</b> shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, while griping the grip <b>31</b><i>m</i>. The lower portion of the main assembly, <b>100</b>A with respect to the direction of the arrow X<b>2</b> is provided with a spring <b>48</b> on the top surface of a lower stay <b>110</b><i>c </i>of the main frame <b>110</b>. When the unit <b>200</b> rotates, a spring member <b>48</b> is contacted to a lower surface of the frame <b>31</b> of the unit <b>200</b>, and eases an impact caused by a rotational operation of the unit <b>200</b>. The unit <b>200</b> rotated in the direction of the arrow X<b>2</b> is stopped, in the state that it is urged upwardly by the spring member <b>48</b>. Thereafter, the cover <b>10</b> is rotated to the closing position G to complete the mounting of the unit <b>200</b> into the main assembly <b>100</b>A. More particularly, the unit <b>200</b> is rotatable about the shaft portions <b>45</b>L and <b>45</b>R, i.e., a rotational center <b>34</b><i>a </i>of the transfer member <b>34</b>, between the left and right guiding plates <b>80</b>L and <b>80</b>R in the main assembly <b>100</b>A. By this, the unit <b>200</b> is movable between the image forming position A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for carrying out the image forming operation and the mounting and dismounting position B for mounting and demounting the cartridge <b>33</b> ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). This will be described hereinafter.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> is a right-hand side perspective view of the residual developer container <b>40</b>, (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a left-hand side perspective view, and (b) is a sectional view taken along a line (<b>12</b>)-(<b>12</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. As has been described in the foregoing, in each unit <b>32</b> (Y, M, C and K), the developer which remains on the surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is removed by a blade (cleaning member) <b>32</b><i>c</i>, and thereafter, it is fed by a screw (feeding member) <b>32</b><i>e </i>in the feeding direction. The fed residual developer is contained in the container, <b>40</b> provided at the left-hand end portion of the unit <b>200</b> which is in the downstream side with respect to the feeding direction of the screw <b>32</b><i>e</i>. The container <b>40</b> comprises an accommodating container <b>41</b> and a cover <b>42</b>, which are unified by the welding and so on. The accommodating container <b>41</b> is provided with a residual developer receiving opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the unit <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment, a plurality of drums <b>32</b><i>a </i>are disposed with the gaps along the peripheral surface of the transfer member <b>34</b>. The reception side openings (openings) <b>41</b><i>a </i>are correspondingly disposed with the deviation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> (a) s). Each opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is placed in the recess <b>41</b><i>b </i>provided in the accommodating container <b>41</b> and the recess <b>41</b> b has sufficient size permitting the passage of the discharging portion <b>32</b><i>f </i>of the unit <b>32</b>. The circumference of each opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is provided with a sealing member <b>43</b> for preventing the developer from outwardly scattering by contacting the discharging portion <b>32</b><i>f</i>. The sealing member <b>43</b> is fixed by double coated tape or the like to the accommodating container <b>41</b>. The sealing member <b>43</b> is provided with the opening having substantially the same size as that of the opening <b>41</b><i>a</i>. An accommodating portion <b>41</b><i>c </i>is provided below the opening <b>41</b><i>a</i>, and it contains the residual developer received through the opening <b>41</b><i>a</i>. In more detail, the accommodating portions <b>41</b><i>c </i>are connected with each other inside in order to accumulate the residual developers supplied from the openings <b>41</b><i>a </i>together. Therefore, a space efficiency is good, as compared with the case in which the accommodating portions are provided for the respective opening portions. A right side of the accommodating container <b>41</b> is provided with a portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>d</i>-<b>41</b> <i>f </i>for facilitating mounting the container <b>40</b> to the unit <b>200</b>. The container <b>40</b> is mounted and positioned to the unit <b>200</b> through the portions-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>d</i>-<b>41</b><i>f</i>. The cover <b>42</b> is provided with the grip <b>42</b><i>a </i>for mounting and demounting the container <b>40</b> relative to the unit <b>200</b>. The grip <b>42</b><i>a </i>is provided by forming the recess in the cover <b>42</b>. When an amount of the residual developer more than a predetermined amount is contained in the container <b>40</b>, the user grips the grip <b>42</b><i>a </i>and dismounts the container <b>40</b> from the unit <b>200</b> to exchange it with a new container. Or, after the residual developer in the container <b>40</b> is discarded, the container <b>40</b> thereof may be re-used.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">(Mounting, to Image Forming Unit, of Residual Developer Container)</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The container <b>40</b> is mounted and demounted in the direction (the direction perpendicular to the axis of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>) of the arrow X<b>3</b> in the state that the unit <b>200</b> is placed in the mounting and dismounting position B ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). As shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, or (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the outside surface of the left side plate <b>31</b>L of the frame <b>31</b> is provided with guide portions <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>1</b>-<b>31</b><i>m</i><b>3</b>. The portions-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>d</i>-<b>41</b><i>f </i>provided in the container <b>40</b> is inserted in the direction of the arrow X<b>3</b> into the guide portions <b>31</b><i>m </i>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>), respectively. In the guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b>, the urging member <b>49</b> in the form of the leaf spring is provided, and the portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>e </i>is urged in the arrow X<b>4</b> after receiving the portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>e</i>. By urging to the urging member <b>49</b>, the portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>e </i>contacts the portion to be positioned (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) <b>41</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> thereof to a positioning portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>4</b> provided at a trailing end of a guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> to accomplish positioning in the front-rear direction. The width (up-down direction) of the portion-to-be-guided <b>41</b><i>e </i>is substantially the same as that of the width (up-down direction) of the guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b>, and therefore, the positioning in the up-down direction is simultaneously carried out. Furthermore, the urging member <b>49</b> regulates the movement in the direction opposite the direction of the arrow X<b>3</b>, and therefore, disengagement is prevented, during the rotational operation of the unit <b>200</b>. Here, the urging member <b>49</b> functions as a locking portion <b>49</b> of the container <b>40</b> relative to the unit <b>200</b>, and the guide portion <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> functions as the portion-to-be-locked <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> locked with the locking member <b>49</b>. As has been described in the foregoing, the container <b>40</b> is mounted and demounted relative to the unit <b>200</b> ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). By a series of mounting operations, the shutter <b>32</b><i>g </i>provided in each unit <b>32</b> is moved to the open position by an actuator (unshown). When the mounting is completed, a reception side opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>provided in the container <b>40</b> opposes to the supplying side opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> provided in the unit <b>32</b>, and can receive the residual developer fed by the screw <b>32</b><i>e</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the state that the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>and an opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> are in engagement with each other. Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a general arrangement, and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a detailed view. The size H<b>2</b> of the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is larger than the size H<b>1</b> of the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>. By this, even if the difference of the position between the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>and the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> varies due to the individual difference, the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b> can overlap the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>assuredly, and the supplied residual developer does not outwardly leak. In this embodiment, the openings <b>41</b><i>a </i>is deviated due to the disposition of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>, and therefore, the positional accuracy between the openings tends to deteriorate. As has been described in the foregoing, the size H<b>2</b> of the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is larger than the size H<b>1</b> of the opening <b>32</b><i>g</i><b>1</b>, and therefore, the variation in the positional accuracy is accommodated to collect the residual developer assuredly. It is preferable to change a difference between H<b>1</b> and H<b>2</b> in accordance with the settings (tolerances) of respective types. Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the state that the container <b>40</b> is mounted to the unit <b>200</b>, and part (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a perspective view illustrating the state that the container <b>40</b> is taken out of the unit <b>200</b>. The container <b>40</b> is provided adjacent to each other along the direction (arrow X<b>20</b>) in which a plurality of cartridges <b>33</b> <b>33</b>Y, (<b>33</b>M, <b>33</b>C, <b>33</b>K) are arranged adjacent to each other. In more detail, as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the container <b>40</b> is provided over the cartridges <b>33</b> so that parts of the containers <b>40</b> may overlap with the cartridge <b>33</b>, as seen in the axial direction of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the container <b>40</b> can be provided in the form with which the enlargement of the space in the direction of the arrow X<b>21</b> perpendicular to the direction of the arrow X<b>20</b> is suppressed as much as possible. In more detail, the cartridges <b>33</b> are arranged adjacent to each other unidirectionally, and the container <b>40</b> is extended along the one direction. In exchanging the container <b>40</b>, as described above, while the user grips the grip <b>42</b><i>a</i>, the user dismounts the container <b>40</b> from the unit <b>200</b>. In the state where the unit <b>200</b> is placed in the mounting and dismounting position B, the container <b>40</b> can be exchanged in the same position as the mounting and dismounting position B of the cartridge <b>33</b> as will be described hereinafter. In response to the operation which dismounts the container <b>40</b>, an opening of the unit <b>32</b> is shut by a spring member of the shutter <b>32</b><i>g</i>. On the other hand, the member such as a shutter is not provided for the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>of the container <b>40</b> in order to suppress a cost. However, in the movement in a mounting and demounting direction (direction of arrow X<b>3</b> in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and the opposite direction thereto) of the container <b>40</b>, the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>does not face downwardly, and therefore, the leakage of the residual developer is sufficiently suppressed without a shutter and so on. The opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>always faces upwardly, when the unit <b>200</b> rotates from the mounting and dismounting position B to a before-mounting-demounting-position C, or, when it rotates to the image forming position A, also when it rotates in the opposite direction. The container <b>40</b> is provided with the opening for containing the developer removed by the cleaning member in the container, and the opening always faces upwardly at the time of the rotation of the unit <b>200</b>. By this, the residual developer inside the container <b>40</b> can be suppressed from leaking outside. In this embodiment, the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>is not be provided with the shutter and so on, but, even in the case where the shutter for opening and closing the opening <b>41</b><i>a </i>or the like is provided, the leakage of the residual developer to the outside can be minimized. The container <b>40</b> can be mounted and demounted relative to the unit <b>200</b>, and therefore, the user can carry out the exchange of the cartridge <b>33</b> and the exchange of the container <b>40</b> through the same process, and therefore, the usability is improved. The mounting and demounting direction of the container <b>40</b> and the mounting and demounting direction of the cartridge <b>33</b> as will be described hereinafter are the same, and therefore, the user can carry out those operations easily. Here, the same direction is not in the strict sense, but the directions may slightly be deviated, if the mounting and demounting of the container <b>40</b> and the cartridge <b>33</b> can be performed, without changing the position of the unit <b>200</b>. Furthermore, the container <b>40</b> and the cartridge <b>33</b> can be mounted and demounted individually. They are disposed so as n not to overlap as seen in the mounting and demounting direction (the direction of the arrow X<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> (<i>b</i>)). The guide portion <b>31</b><i>m </i>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) of the unit <b>200</b> for mounting the container <b>40</b> is provided on the outside surface of the sub-frame <b>31</b>. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide the accommodating space for accommodating the container <b>40</b> in the frame <b>31</b>, and therefore, the downsizing of a device can be accomplished. The mounting position for the container, <b>40</b> is provided in the non-driving side which is the side opposite from the driving side which is provided with the driving system (driving force transmitting portion) of the drum gear <b>32</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and the feeding gear <b>32</b><i>f </i>or the like with respect to the axial direction of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the latitude in the disposition of the driving system is enhanced, and as a result, the downsizing of the device is accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The mounting and demounting of the cartridges <b>33</b> (Y, M, C and K) relative to the unit <b>200</b> is carried out in the state that the unit <b>200</b> is placed in mounting and dismounting position B ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). First, the cover <b>10</b> is moved to the open position which opens the opening portion <b>100</b>B from the closing position which closes the opening portion <b>100</b>B ((a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Then, while griping the grip <b>31</b><i>m </i>provided by the unit <b>200</b>, the user rotates the unit <b>200</b> to the mounting and dismounting position B ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). When the cover <b>10</b> is rotated by a predetermined angle by the above-described rotational operation, the regulating portion <b>46</b> provided on the main assembly <b>100</b>A engages with the portion-to-be-regulated <b>31</b><i>n </i>provided on the frame <b>31</b>. At this time, the unit <b>200</b> is regulated by the regulating portion <b>46</b> in the mounting and dismounting position B. In other words, the unit <b>200</b> is temporarily fixed in the mounting and dismounting position B, and the movement toward the image forming position A is regulated. Since the unit <b>200</b> is regulated in the mounting and dismounting position B, the user can carry out a mounting and dismounting operation of the cartridge <b>33</b>, while keeping the hand off the grip <b>31</b><i>m</i>, and therefore, the usability is improved. At first, the user grips a first grip <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) provided on the cartridges <b>33</b> <b>33</b>M, (<b>33</b>C and <b>33</b>K) and a part of developing device cases <b>33</b><i>a</i>. With respect to the cartridge <b>33</b>Y, the user grips the grip <b>39</b> and the flat surface portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of a grip <b>38</b>. Or, only the grip <b>38</b> is griped. Each cartridge <b>33</b> is mounted to the corresponding mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l </i>of the unit <b>200</b>. The mounting direction is the direction (mounting direction) perpendicular to a rotational axis direction of a developing roller <b>32</b><i>b</i>. More particularly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, and (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> in the side of the cartridge (<b>33</b>) is inserted into the mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l </i>of a unit (<b>200</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, and (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> show the case of the mounting of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y. In the case of the mounting of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y, it is inserted into a first mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>1</b>. Subsequently, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>2</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>4</b> is inserted. The portion-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>-<b>33</b><i>e</i><b>4</b> is guided by the mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i>, and it is inserted into the inside toward the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> are abutted to the regulating member <b>36</b> provided in the mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i>. The regulating member <b>36</b> in this embodiment is an L-shape member, and the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> are abutted to the L-shape portion. In the free state of the regulating member <b>36</b>, the regulating member <b>36</b> is raised by the urging force of the urging member <b>37</b>, so that an L-shape portion enters the recess <b>32</b><i>la </i>of the mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i>, and abuts to and is stopped by the upper surface <b>321</b><i>a </i>of the ceiling surface. The pushing-up position of the regulating member at this time <b>36</b> is a regulating position D. Furthermore, when the cartridge <b>33</b> is further inserted, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> apply the depression force against the urging force of the urging member <b>37</b> which urges the regulating member <b>36</b>, the L-shaped portion of the regulating member <b>36</b> functioning as an inclined cam surface. By this, the regulating member <b>36</b> is pushed down in the arrow X<b>5</b> away from the recess <b>32</b><i>la </i>of the mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i>, so that the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> enter between the top surface of the regulating member <b>36</b> and the ceiling surface of the recess <b>32</b><i>la </i>((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The push down position of the regulating member at this time <b>36</b> is a permission position E, wherein the mounting and demounting of the cartridge <b>33</b> is permitted. In this manner, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> enters a rear side of the recess <b>32</b><i>la </i>beyond the regulating member <b>36</b>. The portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>2</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>4</b> also enter the recess <b>32</b><i>la </i>of the mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l </i>((c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). By this, the mounting, into the unit <b>200</b>, of the cartridge <b>33</b> is completed. When the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> pass, the regulating member <b>36</b> is again moved in the direction of the arrow X<b>6</b> which is the direction opposite to the direction of the arrow X<b>5</b> by the urging force of the urging member <b>37</b> to return to the regulating position D. The user depresses the regulating member <b>36</b> against the urging force of the urging member <b>37</b>, and the regulating member <b>36</b> further returns to the previous regulating position D, so that the urging force is released, so that moderate mount feeling can be provided. In this state, the portions-to-be-guided, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> are prevented from the movement toward the upstream side with respect to the mounting direction by the regulating member <b>36</b>. Therefore, even if the cartridge <b>33</b> tends to move toward the mounting direction upstream, the regulating member <b>36</b> regulates the movement, and the cartridge is not disengaged away from the unit <b>200</b>. The permitting position E is the position of the regulating member <b>36</b> in which the regulating member <b>36</b> permits the mounting of the cartridge <b>33</b> (the position in which the regulating member <b>36</b> is pushed down in the direction of the arrow X<b>5</b>), and the regulating position D is the position in which the movement of the cartridge <b>33</b> is regulated ((a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The cartridge <b>33</b> is mounted to the unit <b>200</b> in the state that the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> are movable in the recess <b>32</b><i>la</i>. In this manner, when the user mounts the cartridge <b>33</b> into the unit <b>200</b>, the rough mounting is satisfactory. In other words, the cartridge <b>33</b> may not be positioned relative to the unit <b>200</b> in the mounting and dismounting position B, and therefore, the mounting operation is simple. In this embodiment, the regulating member <b>36</b> is provided in the unit <b>200</b>. However, the regulating member may be provided outside the unit <b>200</b>. The regulating member <b>36</b> may be provided in any proper position, if the disengagement of the cartridge <b>33</b> from the unit <b>200</b> can be prevented.</p>

First, the user grips the grip <b>38</b> of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y of the topmost stage of the unit <b>200</b>, or grips the grip provided on the sub-frame <b>31</b> of the unit <b>200</b>, and the user applies the force in the direction of the arrow X<b>8</b> to the unit <b>200</b>. The regulating portion <b>46</b> disengages from the portion-to-be-regulated <b>31</b><i>n</i>, and the unit <b>200</b> becomes rotatable. As shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the regulating portion <b>46</b> and the portion-to-be-regulated <b>31</b><i>n </i>are provided with the surfaces inclined relative to the arrow X<b>8</b> which is the rotational direction of the unit <b>200</b>. As shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, by the rotational operation in the direction of the arrow X<b>8</b> the portion-to-be-regulated <b>31</b><i>n </i>retracts the regulating portion <b>46</b> in the direction of the arrow Y<b>1</b>, so that it the unit <b>200</b> is rotated. The urging member <b>47</b> for urging a regulating member <b>46</b> in the direction of the arrow Y<b>0</b> is provided with an elastic force exceeding a predetermined urging force. By this, the portion-to-be-regulated <b>31</b><i>n </i>does not separate from the regulating portion <b>46</b> in the mounting and demounting operation of the cartridge <b>33</b> in the mounting and dismounting position B of the unit <b>200</b>. On the other hand, the regulation is released by the rotational operation by the user, because of the proper selection of the urging force. The unit <b>200</b> is rotated about the left shaft portion <b>45</b>L and the right shaft portion <b>45</b>R in the state of being supported by the positioning portion <b>80</b><i>a</i>. The user moves the unit <b>200</b> in the arrow X<b>8</b>, while griping the grip <b>38</b> or the grip <b>31</b><i>m</i>. The user may grip whichever of the grip <b>38</b> or the grip <b>31</b><i>m</i>. In this embodiment, the grip <b>38</b> provided in the cartridge <b>33</b>Y is in the outside of the unit <b>200</b>, and therefore, it is easy to grip it and easy to recognize it. In other words, the grip, <b>38</b> is placed in an outside position beyond the grip <b>31</b><i>m </i>with respect to the radial direction of the unit <b>200</b>. The grip <b>38</b> is provided with a recess <b>38</b><i>b </i>into which the user can insert the hand. The recess <b>38</b><i>b </i>is outwardly opened in the radial direction of the unit <b>200</b>, and therefore, it is easy to operate, when the user moves the unit <b>200</b>. The grip <b>38</b> is griped in order to rotate the unit <b>200</b>, from the mounting and dismounting position B to the before-mounting-demounting-position C of (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, or, from the mounting and dismounting position B to the image forming position A. It is griped in order to rotate the unit <b>200</b> which is in the before-mounting-demounting-position C or the image forming position A to the mounting and dismounting position B. The first grip, <b>38</b> is provided on the cartridge <b>33</b>Y in the downstreammost position with respect to the rotational direction (direction of the arrow X<b>9</b>) from the image forming position A toward the mounting and dismounting position B, among the cartridges <b>33</b> (Y, M, C and K). When the cartridge <b>33</b>Y is not mounted, it is preferable to grip the grip <b>31</b><i>m </i>provided on the frame <b>31</b>. When the user operates the unit <b>200</b> while gripping the grip <b>38</b>, the portions-to-be-guided (portions-to-be-regulated) <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> is prevented from the movement by the regulating member <b>36</b> placed in the regulating position D. Therefore, even if the force is somewhat applied to the cartridge <b>33</b>Y in the direction of separating out of the unit <b>200</b> in moving the unit <b>200</b> while griping the grip <b>38</b>, the cartridge <b>33</b> is limited by the regulating member <b>36</b>, and therefore, the it does not disengage outwardly of the unit <b>200</b>. In other words, the regulating member <b>36</b> limits the disengagement of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y, when the unit <b>200</b> is rotated to a before-mounting-demounting-position C from the mounting and dismounting position B, when the unit <b>200</b> rotates to the image forming position A, and when the unit <b>200</b> rotates in the opposite direction. At this time, the regulating member <b>36</b> is placed in the regulating position D. The urging force of the urging member <b>37</b> which urges the regulating member <b>36</b> is set such that the outward movement of the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> is limited, when the user rotates the unit <b>200</b> while griping the grip <b>38</b>. The urging force is set such that in the mounting and dismounting position B, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> move the regulating member <b>36</b> to the permission position E in accordance with the user's mounting and demounting operation, thereby to ride over the regulating member <b>36</b>. Also in the other cartridges <b>33</b>(<b>33</b>M, <b>33</b>C and <b>33</b>K), the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> are regulated by the regulating member <b>36</b>, and therefore, they do not disengage outwardly of the unit <b>200</b>. The upper and lower portions of the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> is regulated also by the mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i>, and therefore, even if the user moves the unit <b>200</b> in the directions of the arrows X<b>8</b>, X<b>9</b>, while griping the grip <b>38</b>, the cartridge <b>33</b>Y does not disengage. In the main assembly <b>100</b>A, the top surface of a lower side stay <b>110</b><i>c </i>of the main frame <b>110</b> is provided with the spring member (urging member) <b>48</b>. When the unit <b>200</b> is rotated from the mounting and dismounting position B of (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> to the image forming position A, the lower surface of the frame <b>31</b> of the unit <b>200</b> contacts to the above described spring member <b>48</b> in a position C before the image forming position A, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> is an enlarged view of the unit <b>200</b> of (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Therefore, even if the user rotates the unit <b>200</b> downwardly with a quite strong force, such a force can be accommodated by the elastic force of the spring member) <b>48</b>. The urging force of the spring member <b>48</b> is sufficiently larger than the force by the weight of the unit <b>200</b>, and therefore, the unit <b>200</b> is rested in the state of receiving the urging force from the spring member <b>48</b>. At this time, a portion-to-be-regulated-in-rotation <b>311</b> ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the unit <b>200</b> is not abutted to the rotation regulating portion <b>80</b><i>c </i>((a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) provided on the guiding plate <b>80</b>R, and therefore, it is in a position before the image forming position A. This position is a before-mounting-demounting-position C. The provision of the spring member <b>48</b> can prevent the breakage of the members in the unit <b>200</b>, the cartridge <b>33</b>, the photosensitive member unit <b>32</b>, and the main assembly <b>100</b>A attributable to the impact and so on, when the user rotates the unit <b>200</b>. The spring <b>48</b> may be provided in the unit <b>200</b>, and what is necessary is just to provide it between the unit <b>200</b> and the main assembly <b>100</b>A. In other words, in moving the unit <b>200</b> from the mounting and dismounting position B to the image forming position A, it may be interposed between the unit <b>200</b> and the main assembly <b>100</b>A. In this embodiment, as the spring member <b>48</b>, the leaf spring member is used, but it may be a coil spring or the like. Depending on the weight of the unit <b>200</b>, the cartridge <b>33</b> and so on inserted there, the spring member <b>48</b> may be omitted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a view in the case of the spring <b>48</b> being omitted. In this case, the lower surface of the sub-frame <b>31</b> is directly received by the top surface of the lower side stay <b>110</b><i>c </i>of the main frame <b>110</b> not through the before-mounting-demounting-position C, so that it is placed in the image forming position A. As shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in the state that the unit <b>200</b> is placed in the before-mounting-demounting-position C, the user stops the gripping of the grip <b>38</b> or the grip <b>31</b><i>m</i>, and moves the cover <b>10</b> from the open position H to the closing position G ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). When the cover <b>10</b> is rotated to the position before the closing position G, the urging spring (urging member) <b>35</b> provided in an inner surface of the cover <b>10</b> contacts to the portion-to-be-urged <b>31</b><i>p </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) provided on the top plate <b>31</b>C of the frame <b>31</b> of the unit <b>200</b> placed in the before-mounting-demounting-position C. Also thereafter, the cover <b>10</b> is rotated in the closing direction against the urging forces of the spring <b>35</b> and the spring member <b>48</b>. Since the urging force of the urging spring <b>35</b> is larger than the urging force of the spring member <b>48</b>, the unit <b>200</b> abuts the shaft portions <b>45</b>L, <b>45</b>R to the positioning portion <b>80</b><i>a </i>against the urging force of the spring member <b>48</b>. Furthermore, the portion-to-be-regulated-in-rotation <b>311</b> is contacted to the rotation regulating portion <b>80</b><i>c </i>provided on the guiding plate <b>80</b>R. By this, the unit <b>200</b> is positioned in the image forming position A relative to the main assembly <b>100</b>A. As shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>provided in the cover (<b>10</b>) side corresponds to a locking claw portion <b>136</b><i>a </i>provided in the button (<b>136</b>) side. When the cover <b>10</b> sufficiently moves to the closing position G by the further rotation of the cover <b>10</b> in the closing direction, then the cover <b>10</b> side locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>latches with the locking claw portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the button <b>36</b> side, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. By this, the cover <b>10</b> is locked with the closing position G. The cover <b>10</b> is urged in the open direction by a compressive reaction forces (elastic forces) of the spring <b>35</b> and the spring member <b>48</b>, but, the locking claw portions <b>10</b><i>b</i>, <b>36</b><i>a </i>fix to the main assembly <b>100</b>A, as has been described in the foregoing. For this reason, the unit <b>200</b> rest in the image forming position A by being pressed to the main assembly <b>100</b>A by the spring <b>35</b> ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). More particularly, the unit <b>200</b> is locked with the image forming position A by the cooperation of the cover <b>10</b>, the cover side locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the button (<b>136</b>) side locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the spring <b>35</b>, the portion-to-be-regulated-in-rotation <b>311</b>, and the rotation regulating portion <b>80</b><i>c</i>. In this embodiment, the spring <b>35</b> is mounted to the cover <b>10</b>. However, the urging spring may be provided in the unit <b>200</b>, wherein a part of cover <b>10</b> is contacted to the urging spring. In other words, the structure may be such that it is interposed and contacted between the unit <b>200</b> and the cover <b>10</b> in interrelation with the closing operation of the cover <b>10</b>. The main assembly <b>100</b>A is provided with a cartridge urging member <b>51</b> (<b>51</b><i>a</i>-<b>51</b><i>d</i>) for urging each cartridge <b>33</b> toward the associated photosensitive member unit <b>32</b> in the state that the unit <b>200</b> is placed in the image forming position A. The urging member <b>51</b><i>a</i>-<b>51</b><i>d </i>is provided at the longitudinal opposite end portions of the cartridge <b>33</b>, and each cartridge <b>33</b> is provided with the two urging members. The urging members <b>51</b><i>a</i>-<b>51</b><i>d </i>are sequentially contacted to the rear end portions of the cartridges <b>33</b> in accordance with the rotational operation of the unit <b>200</b> toward the image forming position A. The urging members <b>51</b><i>a</i>-<b>51</b><i>d </i>sequentially contact to the cartridge <b>33</b>, and therefore, the mounting property can be improved. In other words, as compared with the type in which all the urging members <b>51</b> are contacted at once, the load applied by the urging members <b>51</b> can be dispersed, so that the load required for the operation is reduced. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, when the unit <b>200</b> is placed in the image forming position A, the cartridge <b>33</b> is urged in the direction of the arrow Y<b>2</b> by the urging member <b>51</b>. The developing roller <b>33</b><i>b </i>in the cartridge <b>33</b> is contacted by the constant urging force to the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>by contacting the regulation rollers <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) provided at the opposite ends thereof to the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The urging force by the urging member <b>51</b> can satisfactorily maintain the contact state (or spacing state) between the developing roller <b>33</b><i>b </i>and a drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. When the unit <b>200</b> which mounts the cartridge <b>33</b> is placed in the image forming position A, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> provided in the cartridge <b>33</b>, are in the positions free of the urging force by the regulating member <b>36</b>, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In other words, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> are in the position of not contacting to the regulating member <b>36</b>. At this time, gap g is provided between the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> and the regulating member <b>36</b>. Therefore, the urging force of the urging member <b>37</b> which urges the regulating member <b>36</b> is not influential to the urging force of the cartridge <b>33</b> relative to the unit <b>32</b>. Therefore, the urging force of the cartridge <b>33</b> can be maintained with high precision. It is satisfactory that the gap g is such that, when the cartridge <b>33</b> moves from the mounting and dismounting position B to the image forming position A, (or the opposite direction), it does not contact to the member of the main assembly <b>100</b>A and so on (except for the cartridge urging members <b>51</b><i>a</i>-<b>51</b><i>d</i>). By doing so, the accuracy of the urging force of the cartridge <b>33</b> relative to the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is enhanced, and the operation of the stabilized unit <b>200</b> is accomplished. By the above-described operation, the device <b>100</b> becomes in the state that an image forming operation (print operation) can be carried out, and the image forming operation described above is carried out on the basis of an image formation start signal (print start signal). The drive outputting portion (unshown) of the main assembly (<b>100</b>A) side is coupled with the gear <b>34</b><i>b </i>of the drive inputting portion of the transfer member <b>34</b> of the unit <b>200</b> placed in the image forming position A. The drum gear <b>32</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of each photosensitive member unit <b>32</b> couples with the gear <b>34</b><i>b</i>. The gear <b>50</b> of the developing roller <b>33</b><i>b </i>of each cartridge <b>33</b> is coupled therewith. The electric power supply system of the main assembly side is electrically connected to the electrical contacts of the photosensitive member units <b>32</b> and the cartridges <b>33</b>. By this, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is capable of carrying out the image forming operation. In this embodiment, the scanner unit <b>11</b>, the cartridge <b>33</b>, the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>, the transfer member <b>34</b>, and the feeding path Z for the recording material S are disposed substantially in parallel with the installation surface F, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In the upper portion of the device <b>100</b>, the cover <b>10</b> functioning also as the discharging tray is provided, and the cassette <b>19</b> is disposed at the lower portion of the device <b>100</b>. The laser beams L from the unit <b>11</b> (Y, M, C and K) is projected with the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>from behind the cartridge <b>33</b>. The color developer image transferred onto the transfer member <b>34</b> from each drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is transferred onto recording material S in the opposite side from each drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>with respect to the transfer member <b>34</b>. Furthermore, according to this embodiment, the unit <b>200</b> can be rotated between the image forming position A and the mounting and dismounting position B in the state that the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is mounted to the unit <b>200</b>, and the cartridge <b>33</b> is dismountably mounted to the unit <b>200</b> (mounting portion <b>31</b><i>c</i>). By rotating the unit <b>200</b> from the image forming position A to the mounting and dismounting position B, the cartridge <b>33</b> is mounted and demounted relative to the unit <b>200</b>. By such a structure, the device <b>100</b> can be downsized.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(Exchange of Cartridge and Residual Developer Container)</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In each of the cartridges <b>33</b>, the developer contained in the developer accommodating portion <b>33</b><i>c </i>of the cartridge <b>33</b> is consumed as it is used for the image formation. In view of this, means (unshown) for detecting a developer remainder of each cartridge <b>33</b>, for example, is provided, and the control circuit portion <b>300</b> compares a detected remaining amount value with the threshold for a cartridge lifetime forenotice or a lifetime warning set beforehand. As for the cartridge <b>33</b> exhibiting less detected remaining amount value than the threshold, the lifetime forenotice or the lifetime warning of such a cartridge <b>33</b> is displayed on the display portion <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) provided in an operating portion <b>101</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. Or, the lifetime forenotice or the lifetime warning about the cartridge <b>33</b> thereof is displayed on the display portion (unshown) of the external host device <b>400</b>. By this, a preparation of the cartridge <b>33</b> for the exchange is prompted, or, the exchange of the cartridge is prompted for the user, to maintain the quality of the output image. Also with respect to the container <b>40</b>, it is detected that the inside of the container contains the residual developer more than the predetermined level, and the event is displayed on the display portion <b>102</b> and so on to prompt the user to the exchange of the container <b>40</b>. In the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of this embodiment, in an exchange of each cartridge <b>33</b> and the container <b>40</b> mounted to the unit <b>200</b>, the opening <b>100</b>B of the top side of the main assembly <b>100</b>A is opened. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, for the closure releasing of the cover <b>10</b> locked at the closing position G, the user pushes a button <b>36</b> on the front side of the main assembly <b>100</b>A, as shown by the chain lines in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. When the user pushes a button <b>36</b> rearwardly against the spring (unshown), the locking claw portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>on the button (<b>36</b>) side escapes from the locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>on cover (<b>10</b>) side backwardly to release the latch engagement, as indicated by chain lines. In this manner, the cover <b>10</b> is pushed up by the compressive reaction forces (elastic forces) of the spring <b>35</b> and the spring <b>48</b>. The cover <b>10</b> is rotated in an open direction from the main assembly <b>100</b>A by an angle corresponding to an operation distance (restoration length to a free length) of the spring <b>35</b> and spring member <b>48</b> about the hinge shaft <b>10</b><i>a</i>. More particularly, the cover <b>10</b> becomes partly open state automatically by the elastic forces of the spring <b>35</b> and the spring member <b>48</b>. Part (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> show the partly open state of the cover <b>10</b>. Thereafter, when the user lifts the finger from the button <b>36</b>, the force (elastic force) of the urging spring (unshown) restores it to the previous position. At this time, since locking claw portion <b>10</b><i>b </i>is positioned at an upper position by the above described partly opening movement of the cover <b>10</b>, it is not engaged in the restored locking claw portion <b>36</b><i>a </i>((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The user hangs a fingers on a grip portion <b>10</b><i>d </i>of the cover <b>10</b> in the partly open state, and opens the cover <b>10</b> by a manual operation to the open position H, as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The cover <b>10</b> is sufficiently opened to the open position H it so that it is received by a stopper portion of the main assembly side, and thereafter, even if the user moves the hand off, the state is maintained stably. Or, it is locked by a click stop mechanism and a catching mechanism to stably maintain the opening state even if the user moves the hand off since then. By this, the opening portion <b>100</b>B in the upper side of the main assembly <b>100</b>A is sufficiently opened greatly. The unit <b>200</b> is released from the urging force (a pressing) by the urging spring <b>35</b> by the releasing of a locking of the cover <b>10</b> relative to the closing position G. By this, the unit <b>200</b> is moved from the image forming position A to the before-mounting-demounting-position C by the urging force of the spring member <b>48</b>. The unit <b>200</b> moved to the before-mounting-demounting-position C is exposed through the opened opening portion <b>100</b>A. The user can see the unit <b>200</b> moved to the before-mounting-demounting-position C, and the subsequent the direction of the operation of the unit <b>200</b> is suggested. In other words, the user looking in the movement (direction of the arrow X<b>9</b>) toward mounting and dismounting position of the cartridge <b>33</b> mounted to the unit <b>200</b> can feel the next operation, in the direction of the arrow X<b>9</b>, of the unit <b>200</b> intuitively, and therefore, it assists the user's operation. The grip <b>38</b> of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y and the grip <b>31</b><i>m </i>of the frame <b>31</b> pop out in the rotational direction (toward the opening <b>100</b>B) of the unit <b>200</b>, and therefore, the user recognizes the grip <b>38</b> and the grip <b>31</b><i>m </i>easily and can carry out the subsequent operation correctly. While the user grips the grip <b>38</b> or the grip <b>31</b><i>m</i>, the user rotates or moves the unit <b>200</b> in the direction of the arrow X<b>9</b> to place the unit <b>200</b> in the mounting and dismounting position B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>). In the case where the spring <b>48</b> is not used (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), the user moves the unit <b>200</b> placed in the image forming position A to the mounting and dismounting position B, while griping the grip <b>38</b> or the grip <b>31</b><i>m</i>. The portion-to-be-regulated <b>31</b><i>n </i>of the unit <b>200</b> placed in the mounting and dismounting position B is engaged with the main assembly <b>100</b>A side regulating portion <b>46</b>, as described above. In this manner, the unit <b>200</b> is temporarily fixed in the mounting and dismounting position B (l, so that n the movement toward the image forming position A is limited. In this state, the cartridge <b>33</b> and the container <b>40</b> or the cartridge <b>33</b> or the container <b>40</b> is dismounted in the opposite direction. In other words, when the unit <b>200</b> is placed in the mounting and dismounting position B, the cartridge <b>33</b> and the container <b>40</b> is detachably mountable relative to the unit <b>200</b>. In the container <b>40</b>, the portion-to-be-locked (guide portion) <b>31</b><i>m</i><b>2</b> separates from the locking portion (urging member) <b>49</b> in interrelation with the dismounting operation from the unit <b>200</b>. In this manner, the container <b>40</b> can be taken out to an outside of the unit <b>200</b>. The container <b>40</b> is provided with discrimination means which shows that it is not a cartridge <b>33</b>. Therefore, the cartridge <b>33</b> and the container <b>40</b> carried on the same unit <b>200</b> are not mixed up, when the user exchanges them. The discrimination means is sufficed if the user can discriminate visually, and in an example, the container <b>40</b> and the cartridge <b>33</b> are provided with the different labels. In another example, the outer appearance of the container <b>40</b> is different from that of the cartridge <b>33</b>. The container <b>40</b> may be a transparent container, and in this case, the user can recognize easily that the residual developer is contained in the inside. When these examples are combined together, the assured discrimination is accomplished. In this embodiment, the image forming apparatus is a color image forming apparatus which is provided with a plurality of cartridge, but it may be a monochromatic image forming apparatus which is provided with a single cartridge. In this case, the inside of the unit demountably carries the single cartridge and the single residual developer containing container. Here, as for the cartridge, <b>33</b>Y placed in the downstreammost side with respect to the rotational direction X<b>9</b> from the image forming position A to the mounting and dismounting position B, the mounting and dismounting operation is capable also in the before-mounting-demounting-position C. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, this will be described. As described above, the mounting portion <b>32</b><i>lh </i>of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y is divided into the first mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>1</b> and second mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>2</b>. The first mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>1</b> is used in the mounting and dismounting position B, and therefore, the cartridge <b>33</b>Y is detachably mountable relative to the unit <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). In the before-mounting-demounting-position C (or mounting and dismounting position B), the first mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>1</b> or the second mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>2</b> is used, and therefore, the cartridge <b>33</b>Y is detachably mountable relative to the unit <b>200</b>. As indicated by a chain line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, the cartridge <b>33</b>Y is detachably mountable relative to the unit <b>200</b> in the direction of the arrow Y<b>3</b>, and the direction of the arrow Y<b>4</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, when the spring member <b>48</b> is omitted, the mounting and demounting of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y is possible in the image forming position A. More specifically, in the mounting of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> of the cartridge <b>33</b>Y are placed correspondingly to second mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>2</b> in the upper portion of the first and second mounting portions <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>1</b> and <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>2</b>. The portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>2</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>4</b> are placed correspondingly to first mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>1</b> ((a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). The cartridge <b>33</b>Y is moved in the direction of the arrow Y<b>3</b>. By this, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> enter the recess <b>32</b><i>la </i>of the second mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>2</b> (recess <b>32</b><i>la </i>rearward beyond position of regulating member <b>36</b>). The portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>2</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>4</b> enters the recess <b>32</b><i>la </i>in front of the position of the regulating member <b>36</b> ((b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). Furthermore, the cartridge, <b>33</b>Y is moved downstream with respect to the mounting direction of the arrow Y<b>6</b>. By this, the cartridge <b>33</b>Y is mounted to the unit <b>200</b> ((c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). When dismounting the cartridge <b>33</b>Y from the unit <b>200</b> on the contrary, in the before-mounting-demounting-position B (or image forming position A), the user moves the cartridge <b>33</b>Y to the method improvement style side of the mounting of the arrow Y<b>5</b> while gripping the first grip <b>38</b>. Thereafter, by raising a cartridge <b>33</b>Y in the direction of the arrow Y<b>4</b>, the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>3</b> separate from the second mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i>, and the portions-to-be-guided <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>2</b>, <b>33</b><i>e</i><b>4</b> separate from the first mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>1</b>. By this, the cartridge <b>33</b>Y is dismounted from the unit <b>200</b>. It crosses in the course of the paths of the first mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>1</b> and the second mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>2</b>, and therefore, cartridge <b>33</b>Y can mount and demount in two different directions. The sub-frame <b>31</b> of the unit <b>200</b> is provided with a cut-away portion <b>31</b><i>q </i>for the cartridge <b>33</b>Y, and therefore, the cartridge <b>33</b>Y can be dismounted upwardly using the second mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>2</b>. The cartridge <b>33</b>Y can be mounted downwardly using the second mounting portion <b>32</b><i>l</i><b>2</b>. The notch <b>31</b><i>q </i>has the concave shape constituted by side plates <b>31</b>L, <b>31</b>R and the top plate <b>31</b>C. With the structure as described above, the cartridge <b>33</b>Y can be mounted and demounted without moving the unit <b>200</b> to the mounting and dismounting position B, and therefore, the operativity for the user is improved. With the structure of the above-described image forming apparatus, the exchange of the cartridge <b>33</b> is possible, without retracting a scanner unit (image exposure device) <b>11</b>. By this, the user can exchange the cartridge <b>33</b> easily. The transfer member <b>34</b> is in the form of a drum, and the unit <b>200</b> is rotatable about the center axis of the transfer member <b>34</b>. By this, it is not necessary to greatly retract the member in the main assembly <b>100</b>A in the movement of the unit <b>200</b> between the image forming position A and the mounting and dismounting position B. The internal cartridge <b>33</b> is exchangeable without drawing the unit <b>200</b> out of the main assembly <b>1010</b>A, and therefore, the device <b>100</b> is downsized. In this embodiment, the transfer member is the transfer member <b>34</b> for transferring the image indirectly onto the recording material S from the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. However, this is not inevitable, and it may be of the type of transferring the image directly onto the recording material S from the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. At this time, the transfer member <b>34</b> transfers the developed image directly from the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>onto the recording material S. In this embodiment, the cartridge which is to be exchanged is the developing cartridge <b>33</b> used for the process cartridge of the discrete type. However, this is not restrictive, and the cartridge which is to be exchanged may be the process cartridge which unifies the unit <b>32</b> and the cartridge <b>33</b>. The structure of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of the above-described Embodiment 2 is summarized as follows.

The unit <b>200</b> is movable between the image forming position A for carrying out the image formation and the mounting and dismounting position B away from the position A where the cartridge is mountable and demountable relative to the main assembly <b>100</b>A of the device <b>100</b> in the state that the cartridge <b>33</b> is mounted. It is provided with a cleaning member <b>32</b><i>c </i>for removing the developer which remains on the surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>. It is provided with a residual developer container <b>40</b> which contains the developer removed by the cleaning member <b>32</b><i>c </i>and is and which mounted to the unit <b>200</b>. The container <b>40</b> is detachably mountable relative to the unit <b>200</b>, when the unit <b>200</b> is placed in a position B. It is provided with the feeding member, <b>32</b><i>e </i>for feeding the developer removed by the cleaning member <b>32</b><i>c </i>in the axial direction of the drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>, and the container <b>40</b> is provided in the downstream side with respect to the feeding direction of the feeding member <b>32</b><i>e</i>. The drum <b>32</b><i>a</i>, the cleaning member <b>32</b><i>c</i>, and the feeding member <b>32</b><i>e </i>are contained in the inside of a photosensitive member unit <b>32</b><i>d</i>, and the unit <b>32</b><i>d </i>is mounted to the unit <b>200</b>. The mounting and demounting direction of the container <b>40</b> is the same as the mounting and demounting direction of the cartridge <b>33</b>. The container <b>40</b> is provided with the grip <b>42</b><i>a </i>for mounting and demounting it relative to the unit <b>200</b>. The unit <b>200</b> is provided with a guide portion <b>31</b><i>m </i>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>) for mounting and demounting the container <b>40</b> relative to the unit <b>200</b>, and the container <b>40</b> is provided with the portions-to-be-guided <b>41</b> (<i>d, e, f</i>) guided by a guide portion <b>31</b><i>m </i>(<b>1</b>-<b>3</b>).

<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Embodiment 2</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A second embodiment of the present invention will be described. Significantly different points from Embodiment 1 will be described. The residual developer container <b>40</b> for containing the developer which remains on the surface of the drum <b>32</b><i>a </i>is employed in Embodiment 1. In this embodiment, the residual developer container for accommodating the developer which remains on the transfer member directly is used.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">(General Arrangement of the Image Forming Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a vertical section left side view of an image forming apparatus <b>300</b> of this embodiment, and (b) is an illustration of the mounting and demounting process of a cartridge Q and a residual developer container <b>340</b>. The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is a laser printer of a full-color (four color) type which uses an electrophotographic process, similarly to Embodiment 1. The device <b>300</b> comprises a main assembly <b>300</b>A, in which the four electrophotographic photosensitive drums <b>301</b> are horizontally juxtaposed and shafts thereof are extended in the front-rear direction. Around each drum <b>301</b>, there are provided charging means (charging roller) <b>302</b> for charging the surface of the drum <b>301</b> uniformly, a scanner unit for projecting the laser beam on the basis of the image information and forming an electrostatic latent image on the drum <b>301</b> <b>303</b> in the order named in a rotational direction of the arrow. Furthermore, there are provided a developing roller for developing the electrostatic latent image using the toner <b>304</b>, and the intermediary transfer member for transferring a toner image (developer image) onto the recording material S from the drum <b>301</b> (transfer member) <b>305</b> which opposes the drum <b>301</b>. In addition, the cleaning means <b>306</b> for removing the developer which remains on a drum <b>301</b> surface after the transferring of the image is provided. Here, the drum <b>301</b>, the charging means <b>302</b>, the developing roller <b>304</b>, and the cleaning means <b>306</b> constitutes an integral cartridge (process cartridge) (Y, M, C and K) Q. As for the description of the cartridge Q, a first cartridge QY will be described. A cartridge QY accommodates a yellow (Y) developer, and forms a Y color developer image on the surface of the drum <b>301</b>. A second cartridge QM accommodates a magenta (M) developer, and forms an M color developer image on the surface of the drum <b>301</b>. A third cartridge QC accommodates a cyan (C) developer, and forms a C color developer image on the surface of the drum <b>301</b>. A fourth cartridge <b>33</b>K accommodates a black (K) developer, and forms a K color developer image on the surface of the drum <b>301</b>. In a position adjacent to the first cartridge QY, a cleaning member <b>341</b> for removing the residual toner deposited on the transfer member <b>305</b> and the residual developer container <b>340</b> for containing the residual developer removed by the cleaning member <b>341</b> are provided. Each cartridge Q can be exchanged, when the toner is used up by the image formation. The container <b>340</b> can be exchanged, when it contains the residual developer more than a predetermined amount. Furthermore, the container <b>340</b> is provided with the discrimination means for showing that it is not a cartridge Q. Therefore, they are carried on a common supporting member <b>345</b>, but the user does not mix up at the time of exchange. The discrimination means suffices if the user can discriminate visually, and in an example, the container <b>40</b> and the cartridge <b>33</b> are provided with different labels. In another example, the outer appearance of the container <b>40</b> is different from that of the cartridge <b>33</b>. The container <b>40</b> may be a transparent container, and in such a case, the user can recognize easily that the residual developer is contained in the inside. The combination of these examples accomplishes the assured discrimination. The operation for forming a full-color image will be described. The drum <b>301</b> of each cartridge Q is rotationally driven at a predetermined controlled speed in a counterclockwise direction indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>. A roller <b>302</b> is rotated by the drum <b>301</b>. The transfer member <b>305</b> is rotationally driven at the speed corresponding to the speed of the drum <b>301</b> in the clockwise direction (codirectional with the rotation of the drum <b>301</b>) of the arrow. The transfer member <b>305</b> is an endless belt of the dielectric member which has flexibility, and is extended and stretched around a driving roller <b>305</b><i>a</i>, the secondary transfer opposing roller <b>305</b><i>b</i>, and a tension roller <b>305</b><i>c</i>. The developing roller <b>304</b> and a supplying roller <b>307</b> are rotationally driven at the predetermined controlled speeds. The scanner unit <b>303</b> is driven. In synchronism with this drive, a predetermined charging bias voltage is applied to the charging roller <b>302</b> at the predetermined controlled timing in each cartridge Q. By this, the surface of the drum <b>301</b> is uniformly charged by the charging roller <b>302</b> to the predetermined polarity and predetermined potential. The scanner unit <b>303</b> scanningly exposes the surface of each drum <b>301</b> to the laser beams L (LY, LM, LC and LK) modulated in accordance with the corresponding Y, M, C and K image signals. By this, the electrostatic latent image corresponding to the correspondence color image signals is formed on the surface of the drum <b>301</b> of each cartridge Q. In each cartridge Q, the electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the drum <b>301</b> is developed into a developer image by the developing roller <b>304</b>. The developing roller <b>304</b> is supplied with a predetermined developing bias voltage at the predetermined controlled timing in each cartridge Q. Through the above-described electrophotographic image forming process operation, a Y color developer image corresponding to a yellow component of the full-color image is formed on the drum <b>301</b> of the cartridge QY. The developer image is transferred (primary transfer) onto the transfer member <b>305</b> in a primary transfer nip which is the contact portion between the drum <b>301</b> and the intermediary transfer member <b>305</b>. Designated by <b>309</b> is a primary transfer roller, and is press-contacted to the drum <b>301</b> interposing the transfer member <b>305</b>. By this, the primary transfer nip is formed. Hereinafter, similarly, the Y color developer image is transferred (primary transfer) onto the transfer member <b>305</b> through the drum <b>301</b> in a cartridge QM Y, and the C color developer image is transferred (primary transfer) in a cartridge QC C, and the K color developer image is transferred (primary transfer) in a cartridge QK K. In this way, a full-color developer image of the Y color+M color+C color+K color is synthetically formed on the transfer member <b>305</b>. The order of the colors of the developer images sequentially superimposedly transferred onto the transfer member <b>305</b> is not limited to the above described order. In each cartridge Q, the untransferred developer which remains on the drum surface after the primary transfer of the developer image onto the transfer member <b>305</b> is removed by the blade (cleaning means) <b>306</b>, and is fed to a cleaning container <b>308</b>. On the other hand, the feeding roller <b>320</b> is driven at the predetermined controlled timing. By this, the sheet-like recording material S stacked in the feeding cassette <b>319</b> is fed. The recording material S is introduced into the secondary transfer nip which is the contact portion between the transfer member <b>305</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>322</b>, at the predetermined controlled timing by the registration roller couple <b>318</b>. The secondary transfer roller <b>322</b> is supplied with the secondary transfer bias voltage of the predetermined potential having the polarity opposite to that of the charge polarity of the developer at the predetermined controlled timing. By this, while the recording material S is nipped and fed by the transfer nip, the developer image on the intermediary transfer member <b>305</b> on which it is superimposed is sequentially transferred (secondary transfer) onto the surface of recording material S. The recording material S passed through the secondary transfer nip is separated from the surface of the transfer member <b>305</b> and is introduced into the fixing device <b>323</b>, where it is heated and pressed by a fixing nip. By this, the color developer images are mixed and fixed on recording material S. The recording material S is discharged out of the fixing device <b>323</b>, and is discharged on the discharge tray <b>310</b> which functions as a discharging tray by discharging roller pair <b>324</b> as a full-color print. In this embodiment, the roller <b>322</b> is movable between a first position in which it contacts to the transfer member <b>305</b> and forms the secondary transfer nip and a second position spaced from the transfer member <b>305</b> by a shifting mechanism (unshown). At the time of an image forming operation of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, the roller <b>322</b> is moved to the first position, and at the time of then no-image formation, it is moved to the second position. The roller <b>322</b> may normally be contacted with the intermediary transfer member <b>305</b>. After the recording material S is separated from the surface of the transfer member <b>305</b>, the toner remaining after the secondary transfer on the surface of the transfer member <b>305</b> is electrostatically deposited onto the surface of a cleaning roller <b>342</b> as the cleaning member <b>341</b>. The deposited toners are scraped by a cleaning blade <b>343</b> contacted to the roller <b>342</b>, and is accommodated into the container <b>340</b>. Here, the combination of the cleaning roller <b>342</b> and the cleaning blade <b>343</b> is called the cleaning member <b>341</b>. The cleaning blade <b>343</b> may directly be contacted to the surface of the transfer member <b>305</b>, without using the cleaning roller <b>342</b>. In the device <b>100</b> of this embodiment, the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are carried on the supporting member <b>345</b> which is the frame member of the drawer type, wherein the exchange of the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> is carried out with a front access type. The supporting member <b>345</b> supports the cartridges Q (Y, M, C, and K) arranged in one direction. The container <b>340</b> is provided adjacent to the cartridge s Q with respect to the direction. When the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are mounted and demounted relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A, the supporting member <b>345</b> is drawn to the mounting and dismounting position B of the outside of the main assembly <b>300</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>. In the mounting and dismounting position B, the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are dismountable. The cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are mounted and demounted relative to a cartridge mounting portion <b>345</b><i>c </i>and a container mounting portion <b>345</b><i>d </i>of the supporting member <b>345</b> in the state of being drawn to the position B, respectively. The supporting member <b>345</b> which mounts the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> is pushed into the position A in the main assembly <b>300</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>. In this manner, the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> is moved to the image forming position for carrying out the image formation and the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are mounted to the inside of the main assembly <b>100</b>A. Therefore, the mounting and dismounting operativity of the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A can be improved. The front side of the main assembly <b>300</b>A is provided with a front opening <b>300</b>B. The opening portion <b>300</b>B passes the supporting member <b>345</b> supporting the cartridge and the container <b>340</b>, when the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are pushed into the main assembly <b>300</b>A, or when the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are drawn from the main assembly <b>300</b>A. The front side of the main assembly <b>300</b>A is provided with a rotatable door <b>330</b>. The door <b>330</b> is movable between the closed position for closing the opening portion <b>300</b>B and the open position for opening the opening portion <b>300</b>B (opening and closing member). In this embodiment, the door <b>330</b> is rotatable relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A about a hinge portion <b>330</b><i>a </i>placed in the lower side of the door. In more detail, the door <b>330</b> can close the opening portion <b>300</b>B by rotating upwardly about the hinge portion <b>330</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>. The door <b>330</b> can open the opening portion <b>300</b>B by rotating downwardly about the hinge portion <b>330</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>. In more detail, the supporting member <b>345</b> is movable between the position A in the main assembly <b>300</b>A for dismountably supporting the cartridges Q, and the container <b>340</b> and the position B outside of the main assembly <b>300</b>A. The supporting member <b>345</b> is moved to the front-rear direction along guiding means through the opening portion <b>300</b>B in the state that the door <b>330</b> is opened. In this embodiment, the guiding means comprises the guiding grooves <b>300</b>C which oppose to the insides of the left and right side walls of the main assembly <b>300</b>A and which are substantially horizontally extended, and a portion-to-be-guided <b>345</b><i>a </i>which is provided in each of the left and right sides of the supporting member <b>345</b> and which is slidably engaged with the guiding groove <b>300</b>C. In more detail, the supporting member <b>345</b> is movable relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A in the direction of the arrow D<b>1</b> which is a substantially horizontal direction (the pushing-in direction and the rearward direction) and in the opposite D<b>2</b> direction (drawing direction and frontward direction). Each cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are arranged so that in the state that those longitudinal directions are adjacent to each other in the movement direction (arrows D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>) of the supporting member <b>345</b>, and it is mounted and supported by the associated mounting portions <b>345</b><i>c</i>, <b>345</b><i>d </i>of the supporting member <b>345</b>. The longitudinal direction of the cartridge Q is parallel with the axial direction of the drum <b>301</b>, and the longitudinal direction of the container <b>340</b> is parallel with the axial direction of the roller <b>304</b>. In more detail, the supporting member <b>345</b> supports the cartridges Q (Y, M, C, and K) and the container <b>340</b> adjacent to each other. The supporting member <b>345</b> supports the cartridges Q and the container <b>340</b>, so that n the longitudinal directions thereof are the direction crossing with the D<b>1</b> direction (D<b>2</b> direction) (substantially orthogonal direction). Therefore, the user can carry out the exchange of the container <b>340</b> and the exchange of the cartridge Q similarly, and therefore, the usability is excellent. The supporting member <b>345</b> can move the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> between the image forming position A in the main assembly <b>300</b>A and the mounting and dismounting position B in the state that the door <b>330</b> is opened. In the position B, the supporting member <b>345</b> is drawn from the position A, and the cartridges Q and the container <b>340</b> can be mounted and demounted. In the position A, the supporting member <b>345</b> supports the cartridges Q and the container <b>340</b>, and the electrostatic latent image can be formed on the drum <b>301</b> inside the main assembly <b>300</b>A. In more detail, each cartridge Q is in the regular mount position relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A. Each drum <b>301</b> contacts to the transfer member <b>305</b>, and the developer image can be transferred onto the transfer member <b>305</b> from the drum <b>301</b>. In the position A, each cartridge Q is pushed by the urging member to be fixed to the predetermined positioning portion (unshown). In this state, the drive outputting portion (unshown) provided in the main assembly <b>300</b>A is in engagement with the drive inputting portion (unshown) of each cartridge Q. An electric power supply system (unshown) provided in the main assembly (<b>300</b>A) is electrically connected to an electrical contact (unshown) of each cartridge Q. The cleaning roller <b>342</b> of the container <b>340</b> contacts to the transfer member <b>305</b>, and the toner remaining after the secondary transfer can be caught from the transfer member <b>305</b>. When the door <b>330</b> is opened, the opening portion <b>300</b>B is opened. By this, the grip portion <b>345</b><i>b </i>provided on the front side of a front frame of the supporting member <b>345</b> is exposed. By an interrelating mechanism (unshown) in interrelation with the opening rotation operation of the door <b>330</b>, a driving roller (<b>305</b><i>a</i>) of the transfer member <b>305</b> lowers to the predetermined position about a rotational axis of the transferring opposing roller <b>305</b><i>b</i>. By this, the transfer member <b>305</b> is spaced from the lower surfaces of the drum <b>301</b> of each cartridge Q and the cleaning roller <b>342</b> of the container <b>340</b>. In more detail, a contact of the transfer member <b>305</b> to the drum <b>301</b> and the roller <b>342</b> is released. The connection of the drive outputting portion of the main assembly (<b>300</b>A) side with the drive inputting portions of each cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> is released (drive releasing). The pressing of the urging member which positions and fixes each cartridge Q is released (pressing releasing). The electrical connection to the electric power supply system of the main assembly (<b>300</b>A) side to the electrical contact of each cartridge Q is released (electric power supply releasing). The positioning and fixing by the moving and positioning means of the supporting member <b>345</b> relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A is released. In view of this, while griping the grip portion <b>345</b><i>b</i>, the user horizontally slides the supporting member <b>345</b> in the frontward direction which is the drawing direction D<b>2</b> from the main assembly <b>300</b>A. The user sufficiently draws the supporting member <b>345</b> to the position B outside of the main assembly <b>300</b>A through the opening portion <b>300</b>B. In more detail, the supporting member <b>345</b> is sufficiently drawn to the outermost side position B. At this time a stopper member (unshown) prevents the further drawer movement. At the time of the drawing movement of this supporting member <b>345</b>, the drum <b>301</b> of each cartridge Q and the roller <b>342</b> of the container <b>340</b> are spaced from the transfer member <b>305</b>. Therefore, the rubbing therebetween does not occur. The each cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are supported by moving to the supporting member <b>345</b> downwardly, and they can be taken out upwardly. In view of this, the user raises and removes the used cartridge Q from the supporting member <b>345</b> (arrow of (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> C<b>2</b>). Then, the user drops a new cartridge Q on the supporting member <b>345</b> (down-arrow C<b>2</b>). In this manner, the cartridge Q is supported by the supporting member <b>345</b>. In the state that the supporting member <b>345</b> is placed in the position B, the user can mount and demount the container <b>340</b> in the direction of the arrow C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> from the supporting member <b>345</b>. In more detail, the cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b> are mounted and demounted relative to the supporting member (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>) <b>345</b> in the substantially vertical direction. When the user finishes an exchanging operation of the cartridge Q and/or the container <b>340</b>, the supporting member <b>345</b> is horizontally slid in the rearward direction which is the pushing-in direction D<b>1</b> opposite to the drawing direction D<b>2</b> relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A. The user sufficiently pushes it into the main assembly <b>300</b>A from the position B. Then, the stopper member (unshown) prohibits the further insertion. At the time of the pushing-in movement of the supporting member <b>345</b>, the drum <b>301</b> of each cartridge Q and the cleaning roller <b>342</b> of the container <b>340</b> are spaced from the transfer member <b>305</b>, and therefore, the rubbing therebetween does not occur. The user closes the door <b>330</b>, after inwardly pushing the supporting member <b>345</b> in sufficiently. The opening portion <b>300</b>B and the opening portion <b>300</b>B are closed by the closing operation of the door <b>330</b>. By the interrelating mechanism in interrelation with the closing operation of the door <b>330</b>, the supporting member <b>345</b> is positioned and fixed by the moving and positioning means relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A. Each cartridge Q is pushed by the urging member (unshown), and is fixed to the predetermined positioning portion. The drive outputting portion of the main assembly (<b>300</b>A) side connects with the drive inputting portion of each cartridge Q and the container <b>340</b>. The electrical contacts of each cartridge Q are electrically connected to the electric power supply system in the main assembly (<b>300</b>A) side. The roller (<b>305</b><i>a</i>) side of the transfer member <b>305</b> rises to the predetermined position about the rotational axis of the roller <b>305</b><i>b</i>. By this, the transfer member <b>305</b> contacts to the lower surfaces of the drum <b>301</b> of each cartridge Q and the roller <b>342</b> of the container <b>340</b>. In this state, the apparatus <b>300</b> can carry out the image forming operation. As has been described in the foregoing, in the state of being supported by the supporting member <b>345</b>, the cartridges Q and the container <b>340</b> enter the main assembly <b>300</b>A with the supporting member <b>345</b>. Therefore, the user makes the supporting member <b>345</b> enter the main assembly <b>300</b>A, and the door <b>330</b> is closed. By this, the cartridges Q and the container <b>340</b> can be assuredly mounted relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A. For this reason, the mounting and dismounting operativity is improved, as compared with the structure in which the user mounts the cartridges Q and the container <b>340</b> to the main assembly <b>300</b>A individually. The container <b>340</b> is pressed toward the transfer member <b>305</b> by the urging member (unshown) in the position A. Therefore, the cleaning member <b>341</b> can collect the residual developer on the transfer member <b>305</b> assuredly. On the other hand, the pressing of the urging member is released in interrelation with the opening operation of the door <b>310</b>, and the container <b>340</b> can be moved to the position B with the supporting member <b>345</b>. Here, the container <b>340</b> is movable between a cleaning position contacting to the transfer member <b>305</b> to effect the cleaning operation and a spaced position where it is spaced from the transfer member <b>305</b> and it does not effect the cleaning operation, by the spacing mechanism (unshown). The container <b>340</b> is moved to the cleaning position, when the residual developer on the transfer member <b>305</b> is removed, and it is moved to the spaced position, when the removing operation is not carried out. However, the container <b>340</b> may normally be contacted to the transfer member <b>305</b>. Only the cleaning member <b>341</b> may be moved between the cleaning position and the spaced position. As has been described in the foregoing, the container <b>340</b> is detachably mountable relative to the supporting member <b>345</b>, and therefore, the user can carry out the exchange of the cartridge Q and the exchange of the container <b>340</b> through the same method, and therefore, it excels in the usability. The mounting and demounting direction of the container <b>340</b> and the mounting and demounting direction of the cartridge Q are the same, and therefore, the user can carry out those operations easily. Here, the same direction is not in the strict sense, but the directions may slightly be deviated, if the mounting and demounting of the container <b>340</b> and the cartridge Q can be performed, without changing the position of the supporting member <b>345</b>. The container, <b>340</b> is disposed at the upstreammost side with respect to the direction (direction of the arrow D<b>2</b>) toward the position B from the position A of the supporting member <b>345</b>. Generally, the container <b>340</b> is low in the exchange frequency as compared with the cartridge Q. Therefore, the container <b>340</b> which has the lowest exchange frequency is disposed in the main assembly (<b>300</b>A) side, and therefore, the user can exchange the cartridge Q which has the relatively high exchange frequency easily. In other words, since the user can exchange the cartridge Q without drawing the supporting member <b>345</b> to a front side so much, the usability is high. In this embodiment, the transfer member <b>305</b> transfers (primary transfer) the developed image from the drum <b>301</b>, and transfers it (secondary transfer) onto the recording material S. However, the developed image may be directly transferred from the drum onto the surface of the recording material S by the transfer member. The substantially horizontality means substantial horizontality relative to the installation surface F of the apparatus <b>300</b>. However, the supporting member <b>345</b> receives in the installation surface and may be horizontal movement toughness linearly F, and it may move linearly angularly upwardly or angularly downwardly relative to the installation surface F, for example. In this embodiment, the color image forming apparatus which includes a plurality of cartridge is exemplified, but the present invention is applicable to the monochromatic image forming apparatus which includes the single cartridge, similarly to Embodiment 2. The structure of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of the above-described Embodiment 2 is summarized as follows. The apparatus is an electrophotographic color image forming apparatus <b>300</b> for forming a color image on recording material S. It is provided with a plurality of cartridges Q (Y, M, C, and K) which contain the developers. It is provided with a transfer member <b>305</b>, which opposes to the electrophotographic photosensitive drum <b>301</b>, and which transfers the developer image formed on the drum <b>301</b> onto the recording material S. It is provided with the supporting member <b>345</b>, which is movable between the position A for carrying out the image formation and the position B for permitting the dismounting of the cartridge away from the position A relative to the main assembly <b>300</b>A of the apparatus <b>300</b> in the state that the cartridge Q is mounted. It is provided with a cleaning member <b>341</b> for removing the developer which remains on the surface of the transfer member <b>305</b>, and it is provided with a container <b>340</b> for containing the developer removed by the cleaning member <b>341</b>, which is a residual developer container <b>340</b> mounted to the supporting member <b>345</b>. The container <b>340</b> is detachably mountable relative to the supporting member <b>345</b>, when the supporting member <b>345</b> is placed in the position B.</p>
