<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, the transfer device <b>20</b> will be described. The transfer device <b>20</b> has a transfer drum <b>21</b> that transfers the toner image on the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> onto the sheet S. The transfer device <b>20</b> also includes a leading edge gripper <b>23</b> that grips a leading edge portion of the sheet S on the transfer drum <b>21</b> and a trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> that holds a trailing edge portion of the sheet S on the transfer drum <b>21</b>. Further, the transfer device <b>20</b> includes a sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b> that detects passage of the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The transfer drum <b>21</b>, which is an example of a transfer member, is arranged to face the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> and to be rotatable around a rotational axis <b>21</b>D. The transfer device <b>20</b> is detachably attached to the housing <b>2</b>. Further, the transfer drum <b>21</b> includes a drum-shaped base portion <b>21</b>A and an elastic layer <b>21</b>B formed on an outer circumferential surface of the base portion <b>21</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The elastic layer <b>21</b>B is provided along the outer circumference of the drum-shaped base portion <b>21</b>A from a leading edge of the elastic layer <b>21</b>BL (a leading edge of the outer circumferential surface of the transfer member), which is a leading edge in the transport direction of the sheet S, to a trailing edge of the elastic layer <b>21</b>BT, which is a trailing edge in the transport direction of the sheet S. Further, the elastic layer <b>21</b>B has a clearance between the trailing edge of the elastic layer <b>21</b>BT and the leading edge of the elastic layer <b>21</b>BL, which serves as an exposure portion (a cutout portion) <b>21</b>C where the base portion <b>21</b>A is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The transfer drum <b>21</b> forms a nip portion (a transfer location Tr, which will be described later) with the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> by contacting the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> and causing the elastic layer <b>21</b>B to be elastically deformed. The transfer drum <b>21</b> is provided to rotate in the direction of arrow B. Here, each of a rotational axis (not shown) of the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> and the rotational axis <b>21</b>D of the transfer drum <b>21</b> is secured to the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>. In other words, the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> and the transfer drum <b>21</b> are arranged so that a distance between the rotational axes of the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> and the transfer drum <b>21</b> is maintained. Further, the exposure portion <b>21</b>C of the transfer drum <b>21</b> does not contact the photoconductive drum <b>11</b>. Moreover, the outer diameter of the transfer drum <b>21</b> is larger than that of the photoconductive drum <b>11</b>, which is 120 mm, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The base portion <b>21</b>A in the exemplary embodiment is a hollow tube having conductivity and is made of metal, for example. On the other hand, the elastic layer <b>21</b>B is an elastic member having semi-conductivity and is made of rubber such as polyurethane, chlororprene, EPDM (ethylene propylene rubber) and NBR (nitrile-butadiene rubber), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Here, a dielectric material such as a dielectric sheet is not provided on an outer circumferential surface of the elastic layer <b>21</b>B. Further, the transfer drum <b>21</b> is not provided with a charger such as a corotron for performing electrostatic absorption of the sheet S. That is to say, the transfer drum <b>21</b> does not utilize so-called electrostatic absorption to hold the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, the circumferential length of the transfer drum <b>21</b> (more specifically, the circumferential length of the elastic layer <b>21</b>B) is longer than the maximum length of the image formed on the sheet S by the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> in the transport direction of the sheet S (maximum printing length).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A transfer bias, which is a voltage having an opposite polarity to toner, is applied from a high-voltage power supply (not shown) to the base portion <b>21</b>A. This is a configuration in which toner constituting the toner image on the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> is transferred onto the sheet S on the elastic layer <b>21</b>B at the transfer location Tr.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It should be noted that the transfer location Tr refers to a region where the toner image on the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> is transferred onto the sheet S on the elastic layer <b>21</b>B, and a region where the elastic layer <b>21</b>B (or the sheet S on the elastic layer <b>21</b>B) contacts the transfer drum <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the transfer location Tr is a range from a contact starting point Pe to a contact finishing point Pf via a maximum compressing point Pm. In other words, if a specific point on the elastic layer <b>21</b>B of the transfer drum <b>21</b> is assumed, as the transfer drum <b>21</b> rotates, the point starts to contact the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> at the contact starting point Pe and finishes the contact with the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> at the contact finishing point Pf. Further, when the specific point is on the maximum compressing point Pm, the elastic layer <b>21</b>B is compressed by the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> to have a minimum thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a position facing a standby position where the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is on standby (later described) is supposed to be a position Pc. Moreover, a position where the exposure device <b>13</b> performs exposure is supposed to be a position Pd.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Then, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the distance on the outer circumference of the transfer drum <b>21</b> from the position Pc to the contact starting point Pe (in the direction of arrow B) is shorter than the distance on the outer circumference of the transfer drum <b>21</b> from the position Pd to the contact starting point Pe (in the direction of arrow A).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The standby position of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> in the exemplary embodiment exists on the outer circumference of the transfer drum <b>21</b> and between a sheet supply position Pa and the transfer location Tr. As the standby position of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> comes closer to the transfer location Tr, misregistration of the image is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Returning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each configuration of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> will be described.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b> is arranged to face a supply path <b>51</b> (later described) and detects passage of the sheet S transported on the supply path <b>51</b>. More specifically, the sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b> emits near infrared light toward the supply path <b>51</b>. Then the sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b> receives reflected light (near infrared light) from the sheet S transported on the supply path <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b> detects a mark (not shown) provided on the transfer drum <b>21</b>, thus measuring a phase of the rotating transfer drum <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The fixing device <b>30</b> includes a heat roll <b>31</b> that has a heat source (not shown) and is rotatably arranged and a pressure roll <b>32</b> that is brought into pressure contact with the heat roll <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The sheet supply unit <b>40</b> includes: a sheet container <b>41</b> that is provided at a lower part in the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>, specifically, below the transfer drum <b>21</b>, and contains sheets S inside thereof; a sheet size sensor (not shown) that is provided in the feed roll <b>42</b> and detects the size of the sheet S contained in the sheet container <b>41</b>; the feed roll <b>42</b> that draws out the sheet S from the sheet container <b>41</b>; a retard roll <b>43</b> that separates sheets S that are in intimate contact with each other; and transport rolls <b>44</b> that transport the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The controller <b>100</b> receives an input of a signal via a user interface (not shown) that receives instructions from a user. The controller <b>100</b> also receives an input of an image signal from an image output instruction unit (not shown) provided inside or outside of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b>. Further, the controller <b>100</b> receives an input of a signal indicating passage of the sheet S and a phase signal of the transfer drum <b>21</b> that are transmitted from the sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The controller <b>100</b> is configured to output a control signal to each of the following components.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, the opened state of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. In this state, the operating piece <b>27</b><i>c </i>is pressed toward the inside of the transfer drum <b>21</b> (refer to arrow E<b>2</b>) by the claw unit <b>49</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Then, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>connected to the inside end portion <b>27</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> of the pressed operating piece <b>27</b><i>c </i>receives a compressing force in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Upon receiving the compressing force, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>is put into a state of bending in a direction away from the elastic layer <b>21</b>B due to the resiliency of the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a</i>. At this time, the gap between the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the elastic layer <b>21</b>B is large. Further, in the state where the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is opened, the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> holding the sheet S is able to pass through the gap between the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the elastic layer <b>21</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Here, in the longitudinal direction of the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a</i>, the length of the part of the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>within a region where the elastic layer <b>21</b>B exists (the length of the part of the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>that exists above the elastic layer <b>21</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, refer to L and L&#x2032; in the figures) will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, in the closed trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>is in the state of being pulled, whereas, in the opened trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>is in the state of bending. Consequently, the length L&#x2032; of the part of the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>within the region where the elastic layer <b>21</b>B exists in the state where the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is opened is longer than the length L of the part of the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>within the region where the elastic layer <b>21</b>B exists in the state where the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the exemplary embodiment, the member that moves in the direction of the diameter (the vertical direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>) of the transfer drum <b>21</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) along with opening or closing of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>alone. To be described further, even though the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is opened or closed, the position of the end portion of the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>is not changed in the direction of the diameter of the transfer drum <b>21</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>A to <b>7</b>D, operation of the entire image forming apparatus <b>1</b> will be described. It should be noted that the case where an image of plural colors is formed on the sheet S by the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> will be described here. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a timing chart in a recorded image forming operation, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref> are diagrams for illustrating an operation in which the sheet S is wrapped around the transfer drum <b>21</b> in the exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">First, a coloring material reflective light image of a document read by a document reader (not shown) or coloring material image data formed by a personal computer (not shown) or the like is inputted to an image signal processing device (not shown) as each data of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) color components, for example, to undergo predetermined image processing. The image data subjected to the image processing is converted into coloring material gradation data of four color components of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K), and outputted to the exposure device <b>13</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">With the start of the recorded image forming operation, the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> and the transfer drum <b>21</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) start to rotate in synchronization with each other (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>). At this time, both leading edge gripper <b>23</b> and trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> are opened (refer to arrow a in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">To be further described, at this time, the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> rotates with the transfer drum <b>21</b>, whereas the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is at rest at the standby position (the circumferential speed is zero. Refer to arrow a in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The operating piece <b>27</b><i>c </i>of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is in the state of being pressed toward the inside of the transfer drum <b>21</b> due to the contact with the claw unit <b>49</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>is in the state of bending in the direction away from the elastic layer <b>21</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, after the rotating photoconductive drum <b>11</b> is charged by the charging device <b>12</b>, the electrostatic latent image of the first color (for example, yellow) according to image information is formed by the exposure device <b>13</b> (refer to arrow b in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Further, as the transfer drum <b>21</b> starts to rotate, the sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b> measures the phase of the transfer drum <b>21</b>. The measured phase is transmitted to the controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">On the other hand, in the rotary developing device <b>14</b>, the developing unit containing toner of color component corresponding to the electrostatic latent image formed on the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> is rotated to be arranged at a position facing the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> and is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Then, the electrostatic latent image on the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> is developed by the developing unit <b>14</b>Y, for example, to form the toner image on the photoconductive drum <b>11</b>. With the rotation of the photoconductive drum <b>11</b>, the toner image (here, the yellow toner image) is transported toward the transfer location Tr that faces the transfer device <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In response to the start of the recorded image forming operation, supply of the sheet S is also performed. Specifically, the sheet S is forwarded to the supply path <b>51</b> by use of the feed roll <b>42</b>, the retard roll <b>43</b> and the transport rolls <b>44</b>. Then the sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b> detects the passage of the leading edge in the transport direction of the sheet S (refer to arrow c in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and transmits a detection signal to the controller <b>100</b>. Upon receiving the detection signal, the controller <b>100</b> controls the transport such that the sheet S reaches a sheet supply position Pa in step with the arrival of the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> at the sheet supply position Pa. It should be noted that, on the occasion of supplying the sheet S, the size of the sheet S that is detected by the sheet size sensor (not shown) is transmitted to the controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In step with the arrival of the end portion of the sheet S on the leading edge side in the transport direction at the sheet supply position Pa, the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> shifts from the opened state to the closed state (refer to arrow d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). As a consequence of this, the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> grips the leading edge in the transport direction of the sheet S (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). It should be noted that the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is at rest at the standby position with its opened state (refer to arrow d in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Thereafter, the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> gripping the sheet S passes between the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> at rest and the center of the rotation of the transfer drum <b>21</b> (passes the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> at rest). The leading edge gripper <b>23</b> having passed between the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> and the elastic layer <b>21</b>B (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) further passes through the transfer location Tr while gripping the sheet S.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The sheet S, which has passed through the transfer location Tr with being gripped by the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> (refer to allow f in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), comes to the state of wrapping around the transfer drum <b>21</b> while being gripped by the leading edge gripper <b>23</b>, and is transported on the rotation path <b>53</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Then, after the electrostatic latent image of the first color (for example, yellow) according to the image information is formed by the exposure device <b>13</b>, passage of the trailing edge in the transport direction of the sheet S is detected by the sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b> (refer to arrow e in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Upon receiving a signal from the sheet detecting sensor <b>25</b>, the controller <b>100</b> provides instructions to the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b>. When the instructions are received, the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> starts to rotate in synchronization with the transfer drum <b>21</b> and shifts from the opened state to the closed state (refer to arrow g in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Here, the operation in which the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> shifts from the opened state to the closed state will be specifically described. First, with the start to rotate, the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> moves away from the claw unit <b>49</b>. Then the operating piece <b>27</b><i>c </i>moves toward the outside of the transfer drum <b>21</b> (refer to arrow E<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) since pressing by the claw unit <b>49</b> is canceled. With the movement of the operating piece <b>27</b><i>c</i>, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>approaches the outer circumferential surface of the transfer drum <b>21</b> (refer to arrow D<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Accordingly, the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is closed to hold the trailing edge portion in the transport direction of the sheet S (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Further, when the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is closed, the exposure device <b>13</b> has completed forming the electrostatic latent image of the first color (for example, yellow) and has not started yet to form the electrostatic latent image of the second color (for example, magenta). In short, when the electrostatic latent image is written (during exposure), operation of opening or closing of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is not performed. Accordingly, disturbance of the electrostatic latent image due to opening or closing of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is not caused.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The trailing edge gripper <b>27</b>, which has started to rotate, rotates with the transfer drum <b>21</b> while holding the edge portion of the trailing edge side in the transport direction of the sheet S wrapped around the transfer drum <b>21</b>. In other words, the sheet S rotates with the transfer drum <b>21</b> while the edge portion of the leading edge side in the transport direction thereof being gripped by the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> and the edge portion of the trailing edge side in the transport direction thereof being held by the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">It should be noted that, when passing through the transfer location Tr, the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> holding the sheet S contacts the photoconductive drum <b>11</b>, whereas the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> gripping the sheet S does not contact the photoconductive drum <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The toner image of the first color (for example, yellow) formed on the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> is transferred onto the sheet S on the transfer drum <b>21</b> at the transfer location Tr where the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> and the transfer drum <b>21</b> face each other. It should be noted that the toner remaining on the photoconductive drum <b>11</b> after transfer is removed by the cleaning device <b>15</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Then, the electrostatic latent image formation, development and transfer of the second color to the color (for example, magenta or cyan) preceding the final color (for example, black) are similarly repeated according to the above-described procedures. When the toner image of each color is formed, the rotary developing device <b>14</b> rotates to arrange the corresponding developing unit <b>14</b>M or <b>14</b>C at the stop position.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the meantime, the sheet S is rotated and transported in the state of being wrapped around the transfer drum <b>21</b> by the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> and the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b>, and the toner images of the second and subsequent colors are sequentially transferred to be superimposed each time the sheet S passes through the transfer location Tr. As a result, in the formation of a full-color image, for example, each of the toner images of yellow (Y), magenta (M) and cyan (C), except black (K), is multiply-transferred onto the sheet S on the transfer drum <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Then, in the case where the toner image of the final color is transferred, different from the case of transferring the toner image of any color preceding the final color (for example, black), the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> disengages (releases) gripping of the sheet S. That is to say, the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> shifts from the closed state to the opened state (refer to arrow h in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Further, the sheet S, which has been released from gripping by the leading edge gripper <b>23</b>, having a full-color image formed thereon is peeled from the transfer drum <b>21</b> at the leading edge in the transport direction thereof due to a nip between the elastic layer <b>21</b>B and the photoconductive drum <b>11</b>, thereby entering into the exit path <b>52</b> at a sheet exit position Pb.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Thereafter, as the sheet S is transported, the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> holding the trailing edge in the transport direction of the sheet S arrives at the above-described standby position. At the standby position, the claw unit <b>49</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) contacts and presses the operating piece <b>27</b><i>c</i>, and thereby the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> shifts from the closed state to the opened state (refer to arrow D<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). Further, the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> in the opened state is at rest at the standby position. That is, the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> in the opened state does not rotate with the transfer drum <b>21</b>, and the circumferential speed thereof becomes zero (refer to arrow i in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">It should be noted that, when the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> shifts from the closed state to the opened state, the electrostatic latent image of the final color (for example, black) according to the image information has already been formed by the exposure device <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The trailing edge in the transport direction of the sheet S, which has been released from holding by the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b>, is peeled from the transfer drum <b>21</b> and enters into the exit path <b>52</b> at the sheet exit position Pb.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The sheet S having entered into the exit path <b>52</b> is forwarded to the fixing device <b>30</b>, and the toner image on the sheet S is fixed. The sheet S on which fixing has been finished is outputted to the outside of the image forming apparatus <b>1</b> by the transport rolls <b>44</b> and stacked in the output sheet stacking unit <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">&#x3c;Modified Example&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Here, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>, a modified example of the exemplary embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref> are schematic configuration diagrams showing a push-up unit <b>28</b> according to the modified example of the exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>, the push-up unit <b>28</b>, which is an example of a pressing unit, is a rectangular elastic member. The push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided on an outer circumferential surface of the base portion <b>21</b>A in the transfer drum <b>21</b>, and pushes up the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>in the direction away from the outer circumferential surface of the transfer drum <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided so that the longitudinal direction thereof is along the circumferential direction of the transfer drum <b>21</b>. In the modified example, the push-up unit <b>28</b> is arranged in a part in the circumferential direction of the transfer drum <b>21</b> where the exposure portion <b>21</b>C exists.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Further, the push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided to sandwich the elastic layer <b>21</b>B at both ends thereof in the axial direction of the transfer drum <b>21</b>. More specifically, the push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided outside the elastic layer <b>21</b>B and inside the rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b </i>in the axial direction of the transfer drum <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Moreover, the push-up unit <b>28</b> is higher than the elastic layer <b>21</b>B in the height from the base portion <b>21</b>A toward the outer circumferential surface. For example, the push-up unit <b>28</b> is 1 mm to 2 mm higher than the elastic layer <b>21</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The push-up unit <b>28</b> is made of rubber such as polyurethane, chlororprene, EPDM (ethylene propylene rubber) and NBR (nitrile-butadiene rubber), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">When the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> arrives at the push-up unit <b>28</b> with the rotation around the transfer drum <b>21</b>, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> runs on an outer circumferential surface of the push-up unit <b>28</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). In other words, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>comes to a state of being supported by the push-up unit <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">If the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is opened in the state where the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>is running on the outer circumferential surface of the push-up unit <b>28</b>, the push-up unit <b>28</b> pushes up the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a</i>. That is, the push-up unit <b>28</b> holds the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>so that the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>bends in the direction away from the elastic layer <b>21</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">On the other hand, if the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is closed in the state where the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>is running on the outer circumferential surface of the push-up unit <b>28</b>, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>comes to a state of receiving a tension without bending, thereby compressing the push-up unit <b>28</b>. Consequently, though in the state where the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is running on the push-up unit <b>28</b>, the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is closed to hold the sheet S with the elastic layer <b>21</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In other words, the push-up unit <b>28</b> has elasticity to the extent that the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is closed to hold the sheet S with the elastic layer <b>21</b>B though in the state where the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is running on the push-up unit <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The push-up unit <b>28</b> pushes up the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>in the direction away from the elastic layer <b>21</b>B, thereby suppressing bending of the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>in the direction approaching the elastic layer <b>21</b>B when the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is opened. This suppresses damage to the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>due to the contact with the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>by the leading edge gripper <b>23</b> and the elastic layer <b>21</b>B which move with the rotation of the transfer drum <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Here, in the modified example, there has been description that the push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided on both sides of the elastic layer <b>21</b>B in the axial direction of the transfer drum <b>21</b> to sandwich the elastic layer <b>21</b>B, but is not limited thereto. For example, the push-up unit <b>28</b> may be configured to be provided only on one side of the elastic layer <b>21</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Further, there has also been description that the push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided in the part in the circumferential direction of the transfer drum <b>21</b> where the exposure portion <b>21</b>C exists, but is not limited thereto. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, a push-up unit <b>281</b> may be configured to be provided all around the base portion <b>21</b>A of the transfer drum <b>21</b>.</p>

<p id="h-0020" num="0000">&#x3c;Trailing Edge Gripper Holding Member <b>282</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As a modified example of the exemplary embodiment, the configuration in which the push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided has been described. Here, if the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> is configured to pass over the push-up unit <b>28</b>, friction occurs between the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> and the push-up unit <b>28</b>. On the other hand, occurrence of the friction between the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> and the push-up unit <b>28</b> may be avoided by operating the push-up unit <b>28</b> together with the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b>. Hereinafter, a configuration example for achieving this will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a trailing edge gripper holding member <b>282</b> is a cylindrical member that is provided to an inner circumference of the rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b </i>(the first rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and the second rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>) and rotates around the transfer drum <b>21</b> with the rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b</i>. In this modified example, the push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided on an outer circumferential surface of the trailing edge gripper holding member <b>282</b>. Consequently, the push-up unit <b>28</b> rotates around the transfer drum <b>21</b> with the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Here, description will be given to a case where the push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided on the base portion <b>21</b>A of the transfer drum <b>21</b>, which is different from this modified example. In this case, if one of the transfer drum <b>21</b> and the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> stops and the other rotates, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> and the push-up unit <b>28</b> contact each other each time the one makes a single rotation. When the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>and the push-up unit <b>28</b> are brought into contact, a load applied to the trailing edge gripper driving unit (not shown) that rotationally drives the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> or the transfer drum driving unit (not shown) that rotationally drives the transfer drum <b>21</b> fluctuates (increases).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Next, description will be given to a case where the push-up unit <b>28</b> is configured to be provided to the trailing edge gripper holding member <b>282</b> to rotate around the transfer drum <b>21</b> with the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b>, as in this modified example. In this case, the state of contact between the push-up unit <b>28</b> and the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>does not change (the state where the push-up unit <b>28</b> and the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>are in contact with each other is maintained) though one of the transfer drum <b>21</b> and the trailing edge gripper <b>27</b> stops and the other rotates. Accordingly, fluctuation in the load applied to the trailing edge gripper driving unit (not shown) or the transfer drum driving unit (not shown) is reduced compared to the case where the push-up unit <b>28</b> is provided to the base portion <b>21</b>A of the transfer drum <b>21</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the exemplary embodiment, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>is configured to be bent by the movement of the operating piece <b>27</b><i>c </i>along the axial direction of the transfer drum <b>21</b>, but is not limited thereto. For example, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>may be configured to be bent by moving forward or backward any one of the first rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and the second rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b</i><b>2</b> with respect to the other so as to increase or decrease the distance between the first rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and the second rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>, without providing the operating piece <b>27</b><i>c</i>. Or, the sheet restriction unit <b>27</b><i>a </i>may be configured to be bent by moving forward or backward both of the first rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and the second rotating unit <b>27</b><i>b</i><b>2</b>.</p>
