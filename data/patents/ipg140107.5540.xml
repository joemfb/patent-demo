<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system and method of providing a collateralized loan utilizing a clearing counterparty is disclosed. The system includes a match engine module to receive an order for a bundled box spread future representative of the collateralized loan via an options box spread. The order specifies an interest rate associated with the collateralized loan as the price of the futures contract. A trade database identifies a bundled box spread future associated with the received order and interest rate and an order book module identifies a standing order that is compatible with the received order. A clearing module credits an account with a loan amount based on the identified bundled option box future. A risk management module credits a margin amount to reflect the collateralized loan and associated collateral assets.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of, and claims the benefit of priority to, U.S. Pat. No. 8,374,953 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/911,516, filed Oct. 25, 2010), issued Feb. 12, 2013, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A box spread is a known tool in option trading. A box spread is a combination of four distinct option positions having a common expiration date. This combination of four option positions will dictate that, at the expiration, the seller of the box spread shall return a fixed sum of money to the buyer of the box spread, regardless of what the price of the underlying asset is at that point in time. The initial price of the box is thus the net present value, at the time of the box spread trade, of the fixed sum to be repaid by the seller to the buyer of the box spread at the expiration. Typically, the initial price of the box spread is below that of the sum to be prepaid on the expiration date, tantamount to applying a positive interest rate for the determination of the net present value.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, with an option box spread traded based on options listed at an exchange, the positions are novated to the clearing house associated with the exchange. The trade is guaranteed by the clearing house by the process of novation, i.e. substitution of the clearing house as the counterparty of the trade for both the buyer and the seller. As such, the buyer and seller of the options box spread will no longer be exposed to the credit risk of the original counterparty. The clearing house, in turn, manages risk by requiring the market participants to transfer sufficient collateral to guarantee the performance of each counterparty. In the case of an option box spread trade, the buyer posts cash dictated by the price of the box spread, while the seller of the box spread posts sufficient collateral, typically securities with a liquid market, to guarantee the repayment amount at the expiration of the options. As such, the arrangement is tantamount to a loan from the buyer of the box spread to the seller of the box spread, with the exchange clearing house standing in the middle to serve as a custodian and manager of the collateral posted by the seller of the box spread.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Given that the option box spread is equivalent to a collateralized borrowing/lending transaction, the most relevant basis for trade negotiation would be the interest rate for the loan. With the interest rate embedded in the discounted value, the fluctuation of the interest rate becomes obscured by the passage of time, for example. It would be desirable to provide a system and method to facilitate listing, quoting and trading box spreads in the most appropriate quoting convention, as well as to provide a facility to trade the box spread on a forward basis.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">I. Box Spread Mechanics</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As previously discussed, a box spread entails the simultaneous purchase and sale of four options with the same expiration. There are typically two strike prices involved. The higher of the two strike prices may be identified as the high strike, and remaining strike price may be identified as the low strike. The buyer of the options box spread may, for example, buy a call with the low strike, sell a put at the low strike, sell a call with the high strike and buy a put at the high strike. For example, standard Mar-09 S&#x26;P 500 futures may have settled at 1,061.70 on Feb. 4, 2010. There were 133 days until the Jun. 17, 2010 expiration of the Mar-09 S&#x26;P 500 options. At the time, a trader may have bought an exemplary box spread by buying the 1,050 Mar-09 call, selling the 1,050 Mar-09 put, selling the 1,080 Mar-09 call and buying the 1,080 Mar-09 put. Table 1 illustrates this exemplary box spread as:</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The exemplary box spread illustrated in Table 1 may have been purchased for an initial net debit of $7,475 ($250.times.29.90). But at expiration, the box spread will be valued at the difference in strike prices or $7,500 ($250.times.30 index points) in any circumstance.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Return on Box=Difference in Strikes&#x2212;Initial Net Payment<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">If, in one scenario, the market trades to the lower of the two strike prices by the common expiration date, the 1,050 struck options are at-the-money and worthless. The 1,080 call falls out-of-the-money and similarly expires worthless. The holder or owner of the box spread may, in turn, exercise the 1,080 put and recover the intrinsic value of $7,500 less the initial net debit of $7,475 for a profit of $25.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If, in another scenario, the market trades to the upper strike price by the common expiration date, the 1,080 options are at-the-money and worthless. The 1,050 put falls out-of-the-money and similarly expires worthless. The 1,050 call may be exercised to recover the intrinsic value of $7,500. The box generates a profit of $7,500 less the initial net debit of $7,475, for a profit of $25.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, the buyer of the box spread shown in Table 1 will always generate $25 in profit while the seller of the box will always generate a $25 loss. The initial net debit of $7,475 for the buyer of the box spread represents a credit of $7,475 for the seller of the box and may be considered a loan secured by the CME Group Clearing House via the financial safeguards offered therethrough. Translated into borrowing/lending terms, the interest on the original $7,475 loan amount is $25. Alternatively, the eventual repayment of $7,500 was discounted to $7,475 at the time of the box spread trade, with $25 difference being the discount interest.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A. Calculating the Loan Rate</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the embodiment shown in Table 1, the difference between the payment or loan of $7,475 at the initiation of the box spread and the receipt of $7,500 on the common expiration date implies a return of $25. In order to determine the effective interest rate associated with the return, the following formula may be applied:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Implicit Rate=(360/days)&#xd7;(Return on Box/Diff in Strikes)=(360/133)&#xd7;($25/$7,500)=0.902%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this embodiment, the $25 return represents interest accrued while the face value of the loan may be represented as the difference in strike prices or $7,500. The loan term is 133 days. Based on these known values, the effective interest rate may be calculated as 0.902%. The box spreads may, in turn, be priced to reflect the discounted present value of the difference in strike prices.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">B. Discount Loan Structure</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Returning to the example shown in Table 1, the interval between strike prices of the options that comprised the box spread is 30 index points (1080&#x2212;1050=30). The known contract multiplier for standard S&#x26;P 500 options is $250.times. which, in turn, implies that $7,500 ($250.times.30 index points) may be from box seller to buyer at the common expiration date. The effective loan principal is, in this exemplary embodiment, equal to the combined difference in strike prices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates loans that may be transacted by utilizing options at different strike prices.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Box spreads constructed in this manner provide for a loan structure similar to a Treasury bill in that both are &#x201c;discount&#x201d; instruments that are purchased at a value less than the stated face value. Upon maturity, bills call for the return of the stated face value. For example, a Treasury bill may be purchases for $995,000 and redeemed for a $1 million after a 90-day period. Utilizing the implicit rate formula provided above, the rate on this transaction may be calculated as 2%. The effective rate on an exemplary box spread represents a &#x201c;discount yield&#x201d; (DY) similar to a quoted T-bill rate. The yield on a discount instrument such as a Treasury bill or a box spread may not be directly comparable to the quoted yield associated with an &#x201c;add-on&#x201d; instrument such as Eurodollars which are quoted as a &#x201c;money market yield&#x201d; (MMY). The discount yield may be reconciled with a money market yield per the following formula.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>MMY=DY&#xd7;(Diff in Strikes/Diff in Strikers&#x2212;Return on Box)=0.902%&#xd7;($7,500/$7,500&#x2212;$25)=0.905%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Thus, the discount yield of 0.902% associated with the exemplary box spread discussed above may equate to a money market yield of 0.905%</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">C. Quote Convention</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Box spreads may be quoted in terms of option ticks noting that the minimum tick size in standard S&#x26;P 500 options is equal to 0.10 index points or $25 ($250.times.0.10 index points). However, quoting box spreads in terms of ticks is often difficult and/or confusing when the transaction is the basis for a collateralized loan. Loans are typically quoted in terms an interest rate. Further, the typical tick size of extant option contracts is so large that the minimum amount by which the implicit interest rate may be adjusted may be extremely large. Loan instruments, by way of comparison, are typically quoted in terms of an interest rate, often in minimum increments of perhaps 0.01% (one basis point) or 0.005% (one-half basis point) or even 0.0025% (one-quarter basis point).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, returning to the box spread discussed above, assume that the value of the illustrated box spread changed by one minimum price fluctuation of $25. The return on the box spread increases from $25 to $50 and the initial net payment decreases from $7,475 to $7,450. The implicit interest rate on the exemplary box spread, as shown below, may be calculated to equal 1.804%.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Implicit Rate=(360/133)&#xd7;($50/$7,500)=1.804%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Stated another way, the implicit rate increases from 0.902% to 1.804% (a change of +0.902%) given a one-tick fluctuation in the value of the box. For example, the implicit tick size of the box spread quoted in an interest rate equals 90.2 basis points. The implicit minimum tick size of the loan is a function of the strike price interval (which further defines the face value of the loan) and the days until loan maturity. A generalized formula for the implicit minimum tick may be expressed as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Implicit Trick=(360/days)&#xd7;(Tick Value/Diff in Strikes)=(360/60)&#xd7;($25/$25,000)=60 basis points<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates that the implicit minimum tick, quoted in basis points on an annualized basis, of the exemplary box spread with strikes that are 100 index points apart (a $25,000 loan=$250.times.100) with 60 days until term equals 60 basis points. The implicit minimum tick of a box with strikes that are 2,000 index points apart (a $500,000 loan=$250.times.100) with 180 days until term equals 1 basis point. Typically, the implicit minimum ticks associated with box spreads are too imprecise to provide for a competitive and precise lending situation. Moreover, in normal lending situations, the loan is quoted in successively finer increments as the term declines while the implicit tick associated with boxes increases as the loan term declines.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">II. Bundled Option Box Futures</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In order to address the shortcomings of known box spreads, bundled option box spreads have been developed. A bundled option box spread is a futures contract, hereafter referred to as box spread futures, that calls for the delivery of options on futures. In an exemplary bundled option box future, strike prices may be fixed at a 2,000 index point interval with a specific option expiration from the expiration of the box spread futures, e.g., 30-days, 60-days, 90-days. In order to provide for a $1,000,000 face value loan, bundled option box spread futures may call for the delivery of two (2) option box spreads, assuming that the standard S&#x26;P 500 index futures have multiplier of $250 per index point. The contract may be quoted in yields in minimum tick sizes of &#xbc;th of one basis point (0.0025%) to facilitate the use of option boxes as loan instruments with a suitably calibrated tick size.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the exchange may list a box spread futures contract that calls for the delivery of eight options. This exemplary futures contract may settle on Nov. 17, 2010 so that there is 30 days until the Dec. 17, 2010 expiration of the eight (8) European-style flex options that are delivered. Buying the exemplary bundled box futures contract, results in the purchase of two (2) long Dec-10 calls struck at 50; two (2) short Dec-10 calls at 50; two (2) short Dec-10 calls at 2,050; and, two (2) long Dec-10 calls at 2,050. This implies a net debit of nearly $1 million. Thus, buying the bundled box represents a loan of cash. Conversely, selling the exemplary bundled box futures contract, results in the sale of the opposite positions. This implies a credit of $1 million. Thus, selling the bundled box represents borrowed cash.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A. Quoting Bundled Box Futures</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">An exemplary bundled futures contract is quoted using the IMM Index convention, i.e., at 100 less an interest rate. The minimum increment or tick size shall be &#xbc; of one basis point (0.0025%). Based upon a $1 million face value 30-day loan, the tick equates to a value of $2.0833. Similarly, the tick value of a 60-day bundled box futures contract equals $4.166 while a 90-day bundled box contract has a tick value of $6.25. For purposes of a daily mark-to-market, the tick is rounded to the nearest penny.

</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Assume that the contract is quoted at a value of 99.1225. This implies a discount yield (DY) of 0.8775% or 87.75 basis points (=100&#x2212;99.1225). Thus, the initial net debit (credit) upon purchase (sale) of the bundled box spread equals $999,268.75. The interest associated with the loan equals $731.25 ($1,000,000&#x2212;$999,268.75).

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As previously discussed, a box spread future may be defined such that difference in strike prices may be fixed, an interest rate or cost of the loan is known and a specific option expiration from the expiration of the box spread futures, e.g., 30-days, 60-days, 90-days, is defined. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an exemplary order process <b>700</b> by which an order and delivery process for an exemplary bundled box spread future may be processed by, for example, the trade database <b>108</b>, the match engine module <b>106</b> and/or the order book module <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At step <b>702</b>, an order for a bundled box spread future may be received and matched to a complimentary order resting in the order book module <b>110</b> and/or received by the match engine module <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At step <b>704</b>, the order book module <b>110</b> and/or the match engine module <b>106</b> may execute the order for the box spread future based on the received terms.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At step <b>706</b>, following the expiration of the bundled box spread futures, the clearinghouse may utilize the order book module <b>110</b> and one or more algorithms implemented by the match engine <b>106</b> may be identified and retrieved by the long and short open interests. The final settlement price of the futures contract will imply an interest rate for the period or term of the box spread. The interest rate may be expressed, for example, using the IMM Index convention described above.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The match engine module <b>106</b> may cooperate with, for example, the trade database <b>108</b>, order book module <b>110</b> and market data module <b>112</b> to specify (a) the four options that form the options box spread; (b) the price of the four options based on the input from trade database <b>108</b>, order book module <b>110</b>, and market data module <b>112</b>, along with a pricing algorithm or module configured to use the current market quotes from the futures and options of the underlying index futures market input to determine the individual price of the options in the options box spread to be delivered; and amend one or more of the four option prices to ensure that the resultant four options prices would imply an interest rate identical to that implied by the final settlement price of the box spread futures. For example, three of the four option prices may be determined using known option pricing formulas and the fourth may be determined as a function of the net present value of the box spread based on the box spread futures final settlement price. The net present value, in this example, is the net present value of the strike differential of the box spread based on the final settlement price of the box spread futures. Table 2 provides an example of legs that may be identified and selected to form the options box spread associated with the now-expired bundled box spread future.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At step <b>708</b>, the trade database <b>108</b>, order book module <b>110</b> and market data module <b>112</b> may cooperate with the match engine module <b>106</b> to allocate a long position to each short position in the expired bundled box spread futures as buyer and seller of the options box spread, and enter the purchase and sale of the box spread between the buyer and the seller of the box spread paired up by the module, at the options prices determined in step <b>704</b>. These options position will be commingled with other positions in the buyer's or seller's respective options (and futures) positions that are residing in, for example, the order book module <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At step <b>710</b>, once the long and short positions have been allocated, the account data module <b>104</b> issues instructions to other modules such as, for example, the order processor module <b>136</b> and the clearing module <b>180</b>, in the exchange computer system <b>100</b> that calls for the collection of the options premium from the buyer of the box spread, and the release of the options premium to the seller of the box spread, due to step <b>708</b>. The positions will be relayed to risk management module <b>134</b> of the clearinghouse to determine the incremental impact for performance bond requirement. For example, the sale of the box spread may increase the margin requirement for the seller of the box spread. With the posting of non-cash collateral, the option premium released in step <b>710</b> may be allowed to be withdrawn by the seller.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">C. Other Operational Considerations</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Prior to the expiration of the box spread futures, the futures positions are subject to marked-to-market daily and subject to normal initial, maintenance and variation margin requirements in a normal futures market. Upon expiration of the box spread futures, the buyer of the box spread futures shall pay in cash the option premium implied by the final settlement price of the box spread futures. In exchange, the buyer of the box spread futures shall receive the corresponding options positions in his/her account. Conversely, the seller of the box spread futures shall receive in cash the option premium implied by the final settlement price of the box spread futures. In return, the seller of the box spread futures will also receive the corresponding options positions in his/her account. In effect, the buyer and the seller of the box spread futures execute an options box spread trade at the expiration of the box spread futures based on the final settlement price of the box spread futures. The resulting option box spread position will then be subject to the normal collateralization requirement imposed by the clearing house. Bundled box futures enjoy all the benefits inferred by a multi-lateral clearing system which includes a daily mark-to-market process administered through standard futures accounting systems and held in segregated futures accounts. This further includes all the protections of the CME Clearing House financial safeguards package. Once the option box (a functional loan instrument) is delivered, it continues to be carried by the CME Clearing House in segregated accounts, likewise enjoying all the benefits and financial sureties implied thereby. These sureties are particularly important in the wake of the so-called subprime mortgage crisis where counterparty credit risks have arisen as a significant issue. Further note that the functional loan is carried within CME clearing systems where the funds may be used to meet the financial obligations associated with carrying positions in other CME Group products on an automated basis. Bundled box futures may additionally be quoted in terms of a rate in minimum increments or ticks that are compatible with typical loan instruments, as well as being traded on a forward basis, i.e. in advance of the actual collateralized lending/borrowing.</p>
