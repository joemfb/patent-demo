<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to semiconductor devices having isolation circuitry.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Integrated circuit (IC) manufacturers produce die on substrates referred to as wafers. A wafer may contain hundreds of individual die which are often rectangular or square in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Die on a wafer, or unsingulated die, are tested to determine good from bad, e.g., defective or nonfunctional, before the die are singulated and packaged. The earlier a defective die is detected, the fewer subsequent processing steps are performed on the defective die, which results in a reduction of costs associated with individual wafer processing. For instance, often only good die are singulated and packaged into ICs. The cost of packaging die is expensive and therefore the packaging of bad die into ICs increases the manufacturing cost of the IC vendor and can result in a higher cost to the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it is beneficial in semiconductor processing to detect and screen out defective die as early as possible in the manufacturing process. The defects may be introduced at various levels of production. For example, some defects are manifest immediately, while other defects are manifest only after the die has been operated for some period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reliability curves such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be used to express a hazard rate or die failure rate f(t) over time t, and often have a &#x201c;bath tub&#x201d; shape. The reliability curve illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be divided into three regions as shown: (1) an infant mortality region, (2) a random failures region, and (3) a wearout region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The infant mortality region begins at time t<b>0</b>, which occurs upon completion of the manufacturing process and an initial electrical test. Some die, of course, fail the initial electrical test. Inherent manufacturing defects are generally expected in a small percentage of die, even though the die are functional at time t<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The relatively flat, bottom portion of the bathtub curve, referred to as the random failure region, represents stable field-failure rates which occur after the die failures due to infant mortalities have been removed and before wearout occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Eventually, as wearout occurs, the failure rate of the die begins to increase rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To discover those circuits that are susceptible to infant mortality, manufacturing processes have included high temperature testing of die for extended periods of time before shipping products to a customer. Such testing, known as &#x201c;burn-in,&#x201d; refers to the process of accelerating failures that occur during the infant mortality phase of component life in order to remove the inherently weaker die. Burn-in can occur before or after a die is packaged. Testing of unsingulated die, e.g., die not individually separated from the wafer, can be referred to as wafer-level burn-in (WLB) or wafer-level testing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">During wafer-level testing and/or burn-in, it can be beneficial to isolate defective die, e.g., shorted die, which may draw excessive current. The current drawn by the defective die can result in a reduced supply voltage level and/or current applied to functional die which may share the power supply. Such a reduced supply voltage level can result in reduced voltage uniformity across a wafer and may prevent functional die from being adequately or reliably tested.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Some wafer-level testing methods include using fuses associated with individual dies or groups of die to attempt to isolate defective die. In such methods, the fuse is blown if a die draws an excessive current. Other die isolation testing methods include using an external resistor, e.g., a resistor located off-die, to limit the current drawn by a die to a predetermined value. However, such methods may limit various testing modes by not allowing for multiple different current values used for various different testing modes. Examples of such testing modes may include native testing, built-in self test (BIST), built-in self stress (BISS), design for test (DFT), among other testing modes.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure describes various method, device, and system embodiments for isolation circuits. The isolation circuits can be used in various applications including the testing of integrated circuit (IC) die.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One isolation circuit embodiment according to the present disclosure includes a first transistor having a source connected to a first terminal, wherein the first terminal connects a supply voltage to the source of the first transistor. A register is connected to the drain of the first transistor. In this embodiment, a second transistor is in parallel with a resistor, a gate of the second transistor is connected to an output of the register and a source of the second transistor is connected to the first terminal. The drain of the second transistor is connected to a second terminal, and the second transistor has a state that depends on whether the register is loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another isolation circuit embodiment according to the present disclosure includes an on-die resistor stack having an input connected to a first voltage supply pad of a semiconductor die and an output signal connected to a second voltage supply pad of the semiconductor die. The first supply pad is connected to an external power supply. In various embodiments, the resistor stack includes a number of levels including a first level having a first resistor connected to a source of a first transistor, a gate of the first transistor being connected to a first enable input, and a second level having a second resistor connected to a source of a second transistor, a gate of the second transistor being connected to a second enable input. In various embodiments, the first and second enable inputs are controlled to set a resistance value of the resistor stack in order to limit a current value drawn by the die through the resistor stack during a testing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a block diagram of a prior art technique for testing an unsingulated semiconductor die <b>210</b> of a wafer <b>205</b>. The testing apparatus <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> includes a power supply <b>202</b> and a signal sense circuit <b>206</b>. The power supply <b>202</b> can produce test signals that may be modified by a driver (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). For example, a driver may be used to amplify a test signal such that the amplified test signal has a larger voltage and/or current than the test signal.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The test signal is delivered to the die <b>210</b> via a wafer-level contactor, e.g., a probe, <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> that may automatically engage with and disengage from portions of die <b>210</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the wafer-level contactor <b>208</b>-<b>1</b> engages with terminal <b>212</b>-<b>1</b> such that the test signal from the power supply <b>202</b> (or driver) can be delivered to electronic circuit portion <b>214</b> and quality assurance tests can be performed.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The signal sense circuit <b>206</b> can function to monitor the voltage and/or current of signals provided to die <b>210</b> during a testing operation to determine whether a die is defective, e.g., nonfunctional.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The testing apparatus <b>201</b> includes a power supply <b>202</b>, a driver <b>203</b>, and a signal sense circuit <b>206</b> similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The apparatus <b>201</b> also includes a number of external isolation resistors <b>207</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>207</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>207</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , <b>207</b>-T. The external isolation resistors can produce respective signals on a plurality of wafer-level contactors <b>208</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>208</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>208</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , <b>208</b>-T, which engage respective terminals, e.g., terminals <b>212</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>212</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . , <b>212</b>-N as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, of the dies <b>210</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>210</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . , <b>210</b>-T.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A short circuit existing in a given die, e.g., <b>210</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>210</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . , <b>210</b>-T, may tend to draw significant current from the driver <b>203</b>, which may be applying test signals to hundreds of die. The current would flow through an isolation resistor, e.g., <b>207</b>-<b>1</b>, through the short circuit of a die, e.g., <b>210</b>-<b>1</b>, and into ground (assuming driver <b>203</b> produced a test signal having a voltage potential higher than ground). The external isolation resistors <b>207</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>207</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . , <b>207</b>-T can reduce the likelihood of a defect, e.g., a short circuit. In one of the die adversely affecting the testing of other die. That is, the external isolation resistors can reduce the current drawn by a shorted die, which can reduce the degradation of the test signals from the driver and/or power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, such resistor isolation schemes such as that described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> may not adequately isolate defective, e.g., shorted, die. For instance, external resistors in such isolation schemes may limit current drawn by a shorted die, but may not adequately protect against cratering of a shared power supply, which can adversely affect the quality of test signals to other die. Also, various prior art isolation schemes may not account for variations in current consumption by die during different testing modes. That is, a single isolation resistance value is used for several testing modes. Such schemes may require physically changing or replacing the resistor to account for different modes. Furthermore, prior art isolation schemes may not include isolation circuits that are self-monitoring/self-controlling.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an isolation circuit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the isolation circuit <b>320</b> is an on-die isolation circuit, i.e., it is located on semiconductor die <b>310</b>. The isolation circuit <b>320</b> includes a number of resistors <b>333</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>333</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>333</b>-<b>3</b> connected to respective transistors <b>335</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>335</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>335</b>-<b>3</b>. The resistors <b>333</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>333</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>333</b>-<b>3</b> have respective resistance values of R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, and R<b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The transistors can be p-channel, e.g., PMOS, transistors as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or n-channel, e.g., NMOS, transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The respective resistor/transistor pairs (e.g., <b>333</b>-<b>1</b>/<b>335</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>333</b>-<b>2</b>/<b>335</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>333</b>-<b>3</b>/<b>335</b>-<b>3</b>) form a resistor stack having a number of levels. In this embodiment, the resistor stack is shown as having three levels. Embodiments are not limited to this example. While three resistor/transistor pairs are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, more or fewer can be used according to various embodiments. The first level includes resistor <b>333</b>-<b>1</b> connected to the source of transistor <b>335</b>-<b>1</b>, the second level includes resistor <b>332</b>-<b>2</b> connected to the source of transistor <b>335</b>-<b>2</b>, and the third level includes resistor <b>333</b>-<b>3</b> connected to the source of transistor <b>335</b>-<b>3</b>. Example suitable resistance values R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, and R<b>3</b> of resistors <b>331</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>331</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>331</b>-<b>3</b> include, but are not limited to, 1 ohm, 2 ohms, or 4 ohms, etc. Also, one or more of resistors <b>331</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>331</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>331</b>-<b>3</b> may or may not have the same resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, the resistor/transistor pair of each level is connected in series and the levels are connected in parallel with each other. However, embodiments of the present disclosure are not so limited to the resistor stack configuration shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For instance, embodiments may include resistor stacks having a number of levels including more or fewer than three levels. In some embodiments, not all of the resistor/transistor pairs are connected in series and/or not all of the levels are connected in parallel with other levels.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In various embodiments, the resistance value of the resistor stack is variable and can be set in order to control an amount of current drawn by a die during a testing operation, e.g., a burn-in operation or other testing operation. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the resistance value of the resistor stack can be set by controlling, e.g., turning on/off, enable inputs <b>331</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>331</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>331</b>-<b>3</b> which are connected to the gates of respective transistors <b>335</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>335</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>335</b>-<b>3</b>. The enable inputs <b>331</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>331</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>331</b>-<b>3</b> can be connected to, and controlled by, registers (not shown) which can be programmed in order to set the resistance value of the resistor stack to an appropriate value. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate manners in which registers can be programmed in order to control inputs such as enable inputs <b>331</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>331</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>331</b>-<b>3</b>. The resistance value of the stack can be set to various values that may range from below one ohm to several ohms or more.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The resistance value of the resistor stack can be set based on a desired voltage and/or current to be delivered to a die, which may depend on a type and/or mode of testing operation to be performed on the die. For instance, current consumption can vary under different modes, e.g., a native mode or an all rows high (ARH) mode, during a burn-in operation, e.g., a wafer-level burn-in (WLB) operation or a built in self-stress (BISS) operation, among other testing operations. Therefore, isolation circuit embodiments of the present disclosure having a variable resistance value, e.g., isolation circuit <b>320</b>, can accommodate multiple current consumption modes. That is, the current drawn by a given die, through the resistor stack, can be limited to a predetermined value, e.g., by varying the resistance value of the resistor stack, based on a current mode or testing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In various embodiments of the present disclosure, the resistor stack can be connected to one or more die terminals, or pads. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an input <b>330</b> of the resistor stack is connected to a first voltage supply terminal, e.g., VCCx pad <b>312</b>-<b>1</b>, which can receive signals from external test circuitry that can include an external driver or power supply, e.g., power supply <b>302</b>. An output <b>337</b> of the resistor stack is connected to a second voltage supply terminal, e.g., BISS VCC pad <b>312</b>-<b>2</b> or other burn-in pad. The BISS VCC pad <b>312</b>-<b>2</b> can supply signals to BISS circuitry (not shown) during a BISS testing operation. The BISS circuitry may be located on or off die <b>310</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that die <b>310</b> can include various other pads such as a ground pad (e.g., Vss) and/or one or more I/O pads, among other pads for connecting electrical signals to/from one or more dies, e.g., die <b>310</b>, and/or circuitry thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Various isolation circuit embodiments of the present disclosure, e.g., isolation circuit <b>320</b>, can allow for the simultaneous burn-in of all or substantially all of the unsingulated die on a fully contacted wafer, regardless of whether some of the dies are defective, e.g., whether the die input pad <b>312</b>-<b>1</b> (VCCx) is shorted to another pad such as a ground pad (Vss). In some embodiments, the shorted die, e.g., high current die, of the wafer can be determined prior to executing a WLB or BISS. For instance a pre-burn-in test, e.g., a probe test or other wafer level test, can be performed on the die of the wafer or a voltage differential self detecting circuitry (not shown) can be used to determine the shorted die prior to the burn-in. As such, in various embodiments, the resistance value of the resistance stack can be set, as described above, by controlling, e.g., turning on/of, the transistors <b>335</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>335</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>335</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Therefore, the resistance stack value on shorted die can be set to a first value in order to limit or restrict current to the shorted die as much as possible. Also, the resistance stack value on unshorted die can be set to a second value, e.g., a lower value than the first, in order to provide a desired voltage and/or current to the unshorted die during a burn-in operation. In this manner, the shorted die can be isolated such that they do not significantly affect the voltage supplied to unshorted die during testing operations such as burn-in. As mentioned above, the resistance value of the resistor stack can be varied based on a particular testing mode, e.g., a native mode or ARH mode, among other testing modes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of an isolation circuit according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the isolation circuit <b>420</b> includes a first transistor <b>472</b> having its source <b>473</b> connected to a first input or terminal <b>412</b>-<b>1</b>, e.g., a supply voltage pad of a semiconductor die such as a VCCx pad as shown. The pad <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> is adapted to connect a supply voltage, e.g., power supply <b>402</b>, to a source <b>473</b> of transistor <b>472</b>. The isolation circuit <b>420</b> includes a register <b>476</b> which is powered by power supply <b>402</b> and is connected to a drain <b>475</b> of resistor <b>472</b>. A gate <b>479</b> of transistor <b>472</b> is connected to and controlled by an enable input <b>470</b> (shown as BISS_KILL in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), which can be used in conjunction with BISS circuitry or other testing circuitry. Embodiments are not limited to a BISS_KILL enable input. In this embodiment, the isolation circuit <b>420</b> includes a power output <b>474</b>, e.g., BISS_POWER, which is connected between the resistor <b>472</b> and a register <b>476</b>. As will be discussed below, output <b>474</b> can be used to power testing circuitry to load register <b>476</b> when input terminal <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> is not shorted.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a second transistor <b>464</b> in parallel with a resistor <b>462</b>, a gate <b>479</b> of transistor <b>464</b> being connected to an output of register <b>476</b>. The first and/or second transistors <b>472</b> and <b>464</b> can be p-channel, e.g., PMOS, transistors as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, or n-channel, e.g., NMOS, transistors according to various design implementations. In various embodiments, and as described below, the output of the register controls the state, e.g., on/off, of transistor <b>464</b>. For example, the state of transistor <b>464</b> can depend on whether register is loaded. That is, whether register is sufficiently powered via terminal <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> to be loaded. In some embodiments, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, transistor <b>464</b> can be connected to an output <b>477</b> of register <b>476</b> via an inverter <b>466</b>. That is, the transistor <b>464</b> can be indirectly and/or directly connected to the output of register <b>476</b> dependent on various design implementations. The inverter <b>466</b> can be powered by power supply <b>402</b>, e.g., VCCx.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the output of register <b>476</b> is connected to the input of inverter <b>466</b>, and the output of the inverter <b>466</b> is connected to the gate <b>479</b> of transistor <b>464</b>. The source <b>473</b> of the second transistor <b>464</b> is connected to the first terminal, e.g., VCCx pad <b>412</b>-<b>1</b>. The drain <b>475</b> of transistor <b>464</b> is connected to a second terminal, e.g., pad <b>412</b>-<b>2</b> (BISS VCC). Although illustrated as PMOS transistors, transistors <b>464</b> and/or <b>472</b> can be NMOS transistors or other transistors according to various design implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The second terminal <b>412</b>-<b>2</b> can be a burn-in pad and can be connected to burn-in circuitry, e.g., BISS and/or BIST circuitry, to perform burn-in testing operations on a die. In various embodiments, the burn-in circuitry can be located on or off a semiconductor die. As will be further discussed below, the state of transistor <b>464</b> can depend on whether a short exists at the first terminal, e.g., VCCx pad <b>412</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, the transistor <b>464</b> can be in an off state when a short exists at terminal <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> and can be in an on state when terminal <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> is unshorted.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Various isolation circuit embodiments of the present disclosure, e.g., isolation circuit <b>420</b>, can be used in burn-in test applications to test unsingulated semiconductor dies at the wafer level, e.g., when contacting a full wafer. Such embodiments can reduce the current drawn by defective, e.g., short circuited, die to a predetermined value which can reduce or prevent a power supply, e.g., power supply <b>402</b>, from cratering, e.g., from experiencing a potential level drop that could prevent reliably stressing/testing some of the dies on the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Isolation circuit embodiments can limit current drawn by defective die on a die-by die basis, which can reduce the number of power supplies and/or drivers used to perform various wafer level tests. For example, in various embodiments, each die of a wafer can have a corresponding isolation circuit, e.g., isolation circuit <b>420</b>, which may be physically located on each unsingulated die. In such embodiments, current can be limited to each individual die that includes an isolation circuit thereon, rather than being limited to a group, e.g., a row or column, of dies as in some parallel and/or other shared resource testing environments such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described previously, in some such testing environments, limiting the current to a shorted die in a row of dies connected to a shared driver can reduce and/or prevent the ability to adequately test and/or determine whether other dies in the particular row are defective. For example, some parallel testing schemes include interconnecting dies via shared buses or traces. In some such schemes, the shorting of one die in the row during testing can prevent an adequate voltage and/or current from being supplied to one or more other dies connected thereto. Such testing environments may also require several power supplies and/or drivers, e.g., a separate driver for each row, column, or group of die on a wafer. Providing many separate power sources increases the number of testing components which can increase costs and/or testing complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Various isolation circuit embodiments of the present disclosure include a current limiting resistor, e.g., <b>462</b>, connected to a VCC input, e.g., <b>412</b>-<b>1</b>, of each die on a wafer. In such embodiments, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the limiting resistor can be connected in parallel to a transistor, e.g., <b>464</b>. The transistor/resistor (<b>464</b>/<b>462</b>) combination can be controlled such that the transistor is off for defective die, e.g., die that draw current above a certain level such as shorted die, and is on for good die. That is, the state of transistor <b>464</b> can determine whether a current drawn by a die is limited predominantly and/or solely by resistor <b>462</b>, e.g., current does not flow through transistor <b>464</b> when in an off state, or whether the current drawn by the die is not limited predominantly and/or solely by resistor <b>462</b>, e.g., current flows through the transistor/resistor <b>464</b>/<b>462</b> combination when transistor <b>464</b> is in an on state. In some embodiments, the effective resistance of the transistor/resistor <b>464</b>/<b>462</b> combination is below one ohm when transistor <b>464</b> is on, e.g., when the die is a good/non-defective die.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Isolation circuit embodiments such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be used to concurrently isolate all or substantially all die on a wafer during a full wafer contact by limiting current solely with a resistor, such as resistor <b>462</b> on each die for shorted die and limiting current with a lesser resistance value, such as the resistor/transistor <b>462</b>/<b>464</b> combination on each die for unshorted die. In various embodiments, dies that include an isolation circuit, e.g., isolation circuit <b>420</b>, thereon, can be considered self-isolating and/or self-controlling dies. For instance, when circuit <b>420</b> is on a die, each isolation circuit can limit the current to shorted die internally, e.g., without the use of external processes or intervention by a controller of a testing system. In other words, the isolation circuit is self-monitoring.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As mentioned above and as shown in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, various isolation circuit embodiments include a register <b>476</b> whose output can control the state of transistor <b>464</b>, e.g., whether the effective resistance of the transistor/resistor <b>464</b>/<b>462</b> combination is the value of resistor <b>462</b> (shown as R) or whether the effective resistance is a lesser value than R. That is, whether transistor <b>464</b> is off or on, respectively. In various embodiments, the register is powered by the die VCC, e.g., power supply <b>402</b> via a VCCx input pad <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The register <b>476</b> can be loaded via an input/output (I/O) signal <b>471</b>. The I/O signal <b>471</b> can be connected to testing circuitry, e.g., BISS circuitry, which can be powered by output <b>474</b>. In various embodiments, the register is not loaded if output <b>474</b> is insufficient to power the testing circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Suitable resistance values of resistor <b>462</b> include 3 ohms, 5 ohms, and 7 ohms, among various other values. The value of resistor <b>462</b> can be a value such that the voltage level drop experienced by a good die, e.g., an unshorted die, during non-testing operations remains above a level that allows register <b>476</b> to be powered e.g., loaded so as to turn on transistor <b>464</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, a short circuit existing at the VCCx input <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> can prevent the register <b>476</b> from being powered up, which can prevent the register <b>476</b> from being loaded such that transistor <b>464</b> is off. If register <b>476</b> is sufficiently powered to be loaded via I/O signal <b>471</b>, e.g., input <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> is not shorted, then the register output signal <b>477</b> is high, e.g., a binary 1, such that the transistor <b>464</b> is turned on. That is, in this embodiment, the high output signal <b>477</b> is inverted via inverter <b>466</b> such that the inverter output signal <b>467</b> is low, which turns on p-channel transistor <b>464</b>, in this example. It is noted that it is desirable for the transistor <b>464</b> to be turned on in cases in which the input <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> is not shorted such that the current drawn by the die, e.g., from pad <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> to pad <b>412</b>-<b>2</b>, is limited by the effective resistance of the transistor/resistor <b>464</b>/<b>462</b> combination and not solely by the larger effective resistance <b>462</b>, shown as R.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the other hand, if register <b>476</b> is not sufficiently powered to be loaded via I/O signal <b>471</b>, e.g., VCCx input <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> is shorted, then it can be desirable for the transistor <b>464</b> to be turned off such that the current drawn by the die, e.g., from pad <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> to pad <b>412</b>-<b>2</b>, is limited solely by the resistor <b>462</b> and not by the lesser effective resistance of the transistor/resistor <b>464</b>/<b>462</b> combination. When the register <b>476</b> is not sufficiently powered, the output <b>477</b> signal may be floating.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The isolation circuit <b>420</b> of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is configured to prevent the inverter output signal <b>467</b> from going low when the register <b>476</b> is not sufficiently powered to be loaded, e.g., when the output <b>477</b> may be floating. For instance, in this embodiment, the isolation circuit <b>420</b> includes an always on weak pull down transistor <b>478</b> which is connected between the output signal <b>477</b> and the inverter <b>466</b>. When the output signal <b>477</b> is floating, e.g., when a short exists at the input <b>412</b>-<b>1</b>, the pull down transistor <b>478</b> can pull the floating output signal sufficiently low such that the output signal <b>467</b> of inverter <b>466</b> is high, such that the transistor <b>464</b> is in an off state. In this manner, a short at the VCCx input <b>412</b>-<b>1</b> prevents the register <b>476</b> from being loaded such that the transistor <b>464</b> is in an off state and the current drawn to the die is limited solely by resistor <b>462</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Isolation circuit embodiments according to the present disclosure can decrease the components and/or steps used for various testing operations such as a wafer level test or burn-in and/or other operations in which a full wafer contact may be used.

That is, the isolation circuits <b>420</b> can prevent shorted dies and/or dies which become shorted during testing, from drawing excessive current such that the single power supply can maintain a sufficient voltage to adequately and reliably test the unshorted die on the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Various isolation circuit embodiments, e.g., isolation circuit <b>420</b>, can be used after wafer level testing and/or for purposes other than testing and/or burn-in. For example, isolation circuit <b>420</b> can be used to limit current drawn by dies which become defective upon being singulated and/or packaged. Isolation circuit embodiments such as circuit <b>420</b> can also be used for end use applications such as when a die is implemented in an electronic device or system, e.g., a computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a digital camera, or various other electronic devices or systems. For instance, dies which become defective, e.g., short circuit or draw excessive current, can cause damage to electronic components such as another die that shares a bus with the defective die, a processor, or other electronic system component. In such cases, isolation circuits according to embodiments of the present disclosure can act as circuit breakers by shutting down, e.g., limiting the current to the die such that the die is not powered up, an individual die which can reduce and/or prevent harm to other system components.</p>

Components <b>650</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>650</b>-N can also be conductive plane layers that can be similar in size to wafers <b>605</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>605</b>-N and can contact the die pads to provide test signals thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The testing system <b>600</b> can be a full wafer contact system in which each individual die <b>610</b> can be simultaneously tested and/or burned-in. Suitable fall wafer contact methods include, but are not limited to, a probe-per-pad method, a sacrificial method, and a built-in test/burn-in method. The probe-per pad method can include using probes to contact many or all of the pads (not shown) of each individual die <b>610</b>. The sacrificial method can include depositing a thin layer of metal over the wafers <b>605</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>605</b>-N in patterns that connect together the equivalent bond pads of groups of die on the wafer, so that a reduced number of probe needles may be used to test/stress all the die on the wafer. The built-in test/burn-in method can involve incorporation of an on-die circuit, e.g., circuit <b>525</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, that can facilitate self-testing and/or self-burn-in using a relatively smaller number of probes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, various isolation circuit embodiments of the present disclosure can reduce adverse effects caused by defective dies during wafer level testing and/or burn-in operations. Various isolation circuit embodiments can be provided on-die. Some such embodiments, e.g., isolation circuit <b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, can include a resistor stack having a variable resistance value that can be set to control an amount of current drawn by a die during a testing operation. In such embodiments, the variable resistance value of the resistance stack can be varied to accommodate current consumption variations under different testing modes.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Various isolation circuit embodiments, e.g., isolation circuit <b>420</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, can be self-isolating, e.g., each isolation circuit can limit the current drawn by an individual defective die. That is, each isolation circuit can automatically prevent an individual die from being powered up without limiting the current and/or voltage applied to other dies being tested and/or burned-in. Such isolation circuit embodiments can be more efficient and/or effective than other external isolation schemes, e.g., parallel testing and/or shared resource schemes. In such schemes, a die that shorts during testing or burn-in may adversely affect the ability to reliably test and/or determine other dies in a row or group of dies which are connected via a parallel bus structure and/or share a common power source/driver.</p>
