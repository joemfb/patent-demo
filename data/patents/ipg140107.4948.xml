<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-064590 filed with the Japan Patent Office on Mar. 19, 2010, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a fixing device for fixing a toner image formed on a recording medium, and an image forming apparatus including the fixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, a photoconductor drum is charged almost uniformly and is then exposed, for example, by a laser scanning unit to form an electrostatic latent image in accordance with an image signal. Thereafter, toner charged by a developing unit is supplied to the photoconductor drum to form a visual image. The resultant toner image is transferred to a recording medium such as transfer paper. Since the toner image transferred on the recording medium is only carried on the recording medium and has not yet been fixed, the toner image is heated and pressed by a fixing device included in the image forming apparatus, and thus thermally fused and fixed. Accordingly, an image fixed on the recording medium is formed. In such a fixing device, a toner image on a recording medium is fixed on a heating roller.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A variety of techniques have been disclosed for reducing energy consumption in a fixing device by reducing energy required to heat a heating roller.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, Document 1 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 05-188805), Document 2 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 09-101700), and Document 3 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2007-086452) disclose a fixing device including a heating roller in a resin housing, in which a heat reflecting plate for bringing more heat from the heating roller back to the heating roller is provided between the resin housing and the heating roller.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Document 4 (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2004-287318) discloses a fixing device including, in addition to a heat reflecting plate as described above, a cleaner for cleaning a surface of a heating roller to prevent reduction of durability of the heating roller. According to those techniques, heat radiated from a heating roller is returned to the heating roller by a heat reflecting plate, so that energy required to heat the heating roller can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, as the conventional fixing device as disclosed in Documents 1 to 3 is used over time, toner or wax contained in toner and paper dust adhere to the surface of the heat reflecting plate to reduce heat reflecting efficiency. When a cleaner is provided in a fixing device as disclosed in Document 4, the complicated structure increases the cost of the fixing device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention has been conceived in view of those situations. An object of the present invention is to provide a fixing device in which energy required to heat a heating roller is reduced while its production costs are kept low.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A fixing device in accordance with the present invention fixes a toner image on a recording medium. The fixing device includes a heating unit for heating a recording medium, a pressing unit for pressing a recording medium in pressure contact with the heating unit, a casing for accommodating the heating unit and the pressing unit, a first heat reflecting unit provided between the heating unit and the casing, and a first intermediate member provided between the heating unit and the first heat reflecting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention forms an image on a recording medium and includes the fixing device as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

It should be noted that the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention may be a monochrome printer or any other printer as long as it includes a fixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">[1. Overall Structure of Image Forming Apparatus]</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a structure of an image forming apparatus including a fixing device in accordance with the present embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an image forming apparatus <b>100</b> includes an outer cover <b>101</b> so as to cover the apparatus as a whole.

Fixing device <b>110</b> includes a discharge port <b>24</b> on the upper side of casing <b>28</b> (the downstream side along the direction in which a recording medium (paper) is transported), and a receiving port <b>26</b> on the opposite, lower side (the upstream side along the direction in which a recording medium is transported).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Receiving port <b>26</b> is provided with a guide member <b>42</b>. If guide member <b>42</b> is structured to be driven by a driving mechanism, it may also function as a shutter for opening/closing receiving port <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In casing <b>28</b>, provided are a heating roller (heating unit) <b>22</b> containing a halogen heater <b>313</b>, and a pressing roller (pressing unit) <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The recording medium transported from receiving port <b>26</b> on the lower side of casing <b>28</b> is heated by heating roller <b>22</b> and pressed by pressing roller <b>20</b>. Thus, a toner image on the recording medium is fixed on the recording medium. The recording medium is thereafter sent from discharge port <b>24</b> to the outside of fixing device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In fixing device <b>110</b>, the recording medium is in pressure contact with heating roller <b>22</b> and pressing roller <b>20</b> such that a nip region is formed. The nip region is formed such that no gap is produced in a region other than where the recording medium passes through.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, fixing device <b>110</b> includes a not-shown temperature sensor (included in a variety of sensors <b>315</b>) for detecting a surface temperature of heating roller <b>22</b>. Fixing device control unit <b>310</b> controls the on/off of halogen heater <b>313</b> based on the temperature detected by the temperature sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Fixing device control unit <b>310</b> also controls driving of a not-shown motor (included in a variety of motors <b>314</b>), which allows heating roller <b>22</b> and pressing roller <b>20</b> to rotate in accordance with a timing at which a recording medium is introduced into fixing device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Fixing device <b>110</b> includes a heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> between heating roller <b>22</b> and casing <b>28</b>. Heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> is formed of a material (for example, aluminum) that reflects radiation heat from heating roller <b>22</b>. It is noted that at least that surface of heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> which is opposed to heating roller <b>22</b> (with an intermediate member <b>22</b>A being interposed, as described later) is formed of the above-noted material. In other words, heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> is formed of a member having an aluminum coating on the above-noted surface.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Fixing device <b>110</b> also includes intermediate member <b>22</b>A between heating roller <b>22</b> and heat reflecting plate <b>200</b>. Examples of materials of intermediate member <b>22</b>A are aluminum, silver, and stainless steel, which have a relatively low emissivity. The entire intermediate member <b>22</b>A may be formed of such a material. At least the surface that is opposed to heating roller <b>22</b> is coated with such a material.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferably, at least that surface of intermediate member <b>22</b>A which is opposed to heating roller <b>22</b> is formed of a material having light reflecting performance for light of wavelengths corresponding to heat wave at the temperature (for example, 150&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C.) at which heating roller <b>22</b> is heated in the fixing operation. Specifically, the material preferably has light reflecting performance for light of infrared wavelengths, for example, 2 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m. For example, the material may be aluminum, silver, or stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Intermediate member <b>22</b>A is preferably shaped like a plate which separates heating roller <b>22</b> from heat reflecting plate <b>200</b>. Intermediate member <b>22</b>A is provided, at least, so as to avoid scattering of toner, wax, or paper piece onto heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> from a recording medium passing over heating roller <b>22</b>. In order to reliably avoid scattering of toner, etc. onto heat reflecting plate <b>200</b>, intermediate member <b>22</b>A preferably covers the entire area in the longitudinal direction (the direction shown by the double-headed arrow LA in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of heating roller <b>22</b> as well as the entire area of heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> that is opposed to heating roller <b>22</b> in the circumferential direction of heating roller <b>22</b>, so that it entirely shields heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> from heating roller <b>22</b>. However, intermediate member <b>22</b>A can achieve the effect of preventing scattering of toner, etc. onto heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> as long as it covers at least part of heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> from heating roller <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">[3. Action of Intermediate Member]</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The action of intermediate member <b>22</b>A in fixing device <b>110</b> in the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a state in which toner, wax, and paper pieces as noted above adhere to intermediate member <b>22</b>A. Such adherents are shown as an adherent layer <b>22</b>X. On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a state in which such toner, wax, and paper pieces have not yet adhered to intermediate member <b>22</b>A, for example, at the beginning of use of fixing device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in fixing device <b>110</b>, heat is radiated from the surface of heating roller <b>22</b> toward intermediate member <b>22</b>A as shown by arrow A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, at least that surface of intermediate member <b>22</b>A which is opposed to heating roller <b>22</b> is formed of a material having a relatively low emissivity. Accordingly, although part of the heat emitted from heating roller <b>22</b> is radiated toward heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> through intermediate member <b>22</b>A as shown by arrow A<b>3</b>, most of the heat emitted from heating roller <b>22</b> is reflected by intermediate member <b>22</b>A and returned to heating roller <b>22</b> as shown by arrow A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">On the other hand, the heat radiated toward heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> is reflected by heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> and returned as shown by arrow A<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, when toner, etc. adheres to intermediate member <b>22</b>A, the heat reflecting efficiency is reduced on the surface that is opposed to heating roller <b>22</b>. Therefore, when heat is received from the surface of heating roller <b>22</b> as shown by arrow A<b>1</b>, the amount of heat reflected toward heating roller <b>22</b> is reduced as compared with when toner is not adhered (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). However, since at least the surface of intermediate member <b>22</b>A that is opposed to heating roller <b>22</b> is formed of a material having a relatively low emissivity, the amount of heat radiated toward heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> is increased as compared with when toner is not adhered (arrow A<b>6</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the present embodiment, the provision of intermediate member <b>22</b>A avoids adhesion of toner, etc. to heat reflecting plate <b>200</b>, as compared with when intermediate member <b>22</b>A is not provided. Accordingly, even when toner, etc. adheres to intermediate member <b>22</b>A as image forming apparatus <b>100</b> form images, the efficiency of reflecting heat radiated from intermediate member <b>22</b>A is not reduced in heat reflecting plate <b>200</b>. Therefore, the heat radiated from intermediate member <b>22</b>A shown by arrow A<b>6</b> is efficiently reflected toward intermediate member <b>22</b>A (arrow A<b>7</b>) and is thereafter emitted toward heating roller <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the heat radiated from intermediate member <b>22</b>A toward heating roller <b>22</b> is shown by arrow A<b>5</b>. As described above, in the present embodiment, the heat radiated from intermediate member <b>22</b>A toward heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> is reflected on the surface of heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> at a high efficiency and then returned toward intermediate member <b>22</b>A. Accordingly, the heat radiated from heating roller <b>22</b> as shown by arrow A<b>1</b> is returned from intermediate member <b>22</b>A toward heating roller <b>22</b> at a relatively high probability, as shown by arrow A<b>5</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In Table 1, the examples in the case where intermediate member <b>22</b>A is not provided are denoted with &#x201c;without intermediate member,&#x201d; and the examples in the case where intermediate member <b>22</b>A is provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> are denoted with &#x201c;with intermediate member.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, &#x201c;initial&#x201d; means the initial stage of image forming apparatus <b>100</b> as described above (a state in which image formation has not yet been carried out), and &#x201c;after endurance&#x201d; means a state in which image formation on recording mediums is carried out so sufficiently that toner, etc. adheres to intermediate member <b>22</b>A and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore, &#x201c;power consumption&#x201d; represents power consumed to stabilize halogen heater <b>313</b> at a temperature suitable for fixing images. For each of the case &#x201c;without intermediate member&#x201d; and the case &#x201c;with intermediate member,&#x201d; power consumption at the stage &#x201c;after endurance&#x201d; is shown, given that power consumption at the &#x201c;initial&#x201d; stage is 100%. Power feed to halogen heater <b>313</b> is controlled by fixing device control unit <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The housing temperature refers to an internal temperature of casing <b>28</b> and shows, for example, a temperature detected by a temperature sensor <b>900</b> provided on the outside of heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> as shown by the broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In Table 1, the values for the cases &#x201c;without intermediate member&#x201d; and &#x201c;with intermediate member&#x201d; are measured for the image forming apparatus placed in a room at the same temperature. In both cases, &#x201c;after endurance&#x201d; shows a state after images are formed on the same number of recording mediums, starting from an &#x201c;initial&#x201d; stage.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As can be understood from Table 1, for the case &#x201c;without intermediate member,&#x201d; the housing temperature, which is 70&#xb0; C. at the &#x201c;initial&#x201d; stage, rises to 80&#xb0; C. &#x201c;after endurance.&#x201d; On the other hand, for the case &#x201c;with intermediate member,&#x201d; the housing temperature &#x201c;after endurance&#x201d; is 75&#xb0; C. This means that the provision of intermediate member <b>22</b>A suppresses an increase in housing temperature. Such a difference of housing temperature arises presumably because the proportion of heat returned toward heating roller <b>22</b>, of the heat radiated from heating roller <b>22</b>, is smaller when intermediate member <b>22</b>A is not provided than when it is provided. In other words, when intermediate member <b>22</b>A is not provided, the adhesion of toner, etc. to the surface of heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> reduces the heat reflecting efficiency on the surface of heat reflecting plate <b>200</b>, thereby increasing the housing temperature as compared with when intermediate member <b>22</b>A is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, as can be understood from Table 1, power consumption &#x201c;after endurance&#x201d; is &#x201c;125%&#x201d; for the case &#x201c;without intermediate member,&#x201d; whereas power consumption &#x201c;after endurance&#x201d; is limited to &#x201c;108%&#x201d; for the case &#x201c;with intermediate member.&#x201d; The reason can be explained as follows. A larger proportion of heat radiated from heating roller <b>22</b> is returned to heating roller <b>22</b> when intermediate member <b>22</b>A is provided than when it is not provided. Accordingly, the heat insulation efficiency in casing <b>28</b> is improved, so that the surface temperature of heating roller <b>22</b> is maintained at the same level with less power supplied to halogen heater <b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In fixing device <b>110</b>, the provision of intermediate member <b>22</b>A between heating roller <b>22</b> and heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> improves the heat retention performance in casing <b>28</b> and maintains the heat reflecting efficiency of heat reflecting plate <b>200</b>. Accordingly, power required by halogen heater <b>313</b> for heating can be reduced. Preferably, at least part of intermediate member <b>22</b>A is arranged at a distance from heating roller <b>22</b> and heat reflecting plate <b>200</b>. This is to prevent heat loss by heat conduction from intermediate member <b>22</b>A to heating roller <b>22</b> or heat reflecting plate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In accordance with the present embodiment, when toner, wax, etc. is scattered from a recording medium in pressure contact with the heating unit, the intermediate member provided on the side of the heating unit intercepts the toner, wax, etc. from the heat reflecting unit and prevents them from adhering to the heat reflecting unit. Therefore, a reduction of the heat reflecting efficiency can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition, in accordance with the present embodiment, the provision of the intermediate member, rather than the provision of a cleaner with a complicated structure, prevents adhesion of toner, etc. to the heat reflecting unit, so that a reduction of the heat reflecting efficiency can be avoided while the production costs of the fixing device are kept low.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">[4. Modification]</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a modification of the fixing device in accordance with the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">A fixing device <b>110</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> differs from fixing device <b>110</b> illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, etc. in that it additionally includes an intermediate member <b>20</b>A and a heat reflecting plate <b>201</b> on the outside of pressing roller <b>20</b> in casing <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The materials and structures of intermediate member <b>20</b>A and heat reflecting plate <b>201</b> provided for pressing roller <b>20</b> can be similar to the materials and structures of intermediate member <b>22</b>A and heat reflecting plate <b>200</b> provided for heating roller <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The modified embodiment not only prevents a reduction in temperature of heating roller <b>22</b> but also prevents a reduction in temperature of pressing roller <b>20</b> in abutment (directly or with a recording medium interposed) with heating roller <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the heat retention efficiency in casing <b>28</b> can be improved, so that power consumption of fixing device <b>110</b>A can be reduced more reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the modified embodiment, heat reflecting plate <b>201</b> is not simply provided alone, but heat reflecting plate <b>201</b> is provided together with intermediate member <b>20</b>A, so that a reduction in temperature of pressing roller <b>20</b> can be avoided while the adhesion of toner, etc. to heat reflecting plate <b>201</b> is avoided. Accordingly, a reduction in temperature of pressing roller <b>20</b> can be avoided for a longer time.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the scope of the present invention being interpreted by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
