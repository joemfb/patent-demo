<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and techniques relating to processing multiple data streams transmitted over a wireless channel are described. A described technique includes obtaining data streams to be transmitted over a wireless channel using spatially diverse transmission; and applying rotations to the data streams in connection with interleaving the data streams. Applying the rotations can include using rotation values with respective data streams, the rotation values forming a sequence such that the rotation values plotted against stream indices oscillate in relative value within the sequence when a number of the data streams to be transmitted is greater than two. The rotations can include frequency rotations. The interleaving can include performing permutations, the permutations including a first permutation and a second permutation.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure describes systems and techniques relating to processing information before spatially diverse transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mobile phones, laptops, personal digital assistants (PDAs), base stations and other systems and devices can wirelessly transmit and receive data. Such systems and devices have used orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission schemes, such as those defined in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802 wireless communications standards. The IEEE 802 standards include IEEE 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.16, and 802.20. In an OFDM system, in particular, a data stream is split into multiple substreams, each of which is sent over a different subcarrier frequency (also referred to as a tone or frequency tone).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some wireless communication systems use a single-in-single-out (SISO) transmission approach, where both the transmitter and the receiver use a single antenna. Other wireless communication systems use a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) transmission approach, where multiple spatially separated transmit antennas and multiple spatially separated receive antennas are used to improve data rates, link quality or both. This is known as antenna diversity, spatial diversity or spatially diverse transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to spatial diversity, many wireless communication systems also use time diversity and frequency diversity to improve system performance. Data streams can be encoded using channel encoders of different rates and with different amounts of redundancies, and the encoded data streams can be interleaved to separate adjacent coded bits. At the receiver, bit-streams that have been corrupted during transmission over the wireless channel are combined using error correction techniques to reconstruct the original information in the data bit-streams.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">OFDM systems can be implemented as SISO or MIMO communication systems and can provide various advantages, including a relatively simple receiver architecture and potential performance improvements through appropriate coding across OFDM tones. For example, OFDM MIMO systems have been designed to interleave encoded bits using a separate block interleaver for each spatial stream, with a block size corresponding to the number of coded bits in a single OFDM symbol. Each interleaver effects a two-step permutation, where the first permutation ensures that adjacent coded bits are mapped onto nonadjacent subcarriers, and the second permutation ensures that coded bits are mapped alternately onto less and more significant bits of the constellation, thereby avoiding long runs of low reliability bits. In addition, various proposed interleavers can apply different data rotations to each spatial stream, before mapping to the subcarriers of an OFDM symbol, to improve the transmission.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure includes systems and techniques relating to processing multiple data streams transmitted over a wireless channel. According to an aspect of the described systems and techniques, a method includes obtaining multiple data streams to be transmitted over a wireless channel using spatially diverse transmission; and applying data rotations to respective data streams, in connection with interleaving the multiple data streams, where the applying includes using data rotation values with respective data streams such that the data rotation values plotted against stream indices correspond to a non-monotonic function. The data rotation values can be independent of a total number of the multiple data streams to be transmitted, the total number being selected from a set of integers including two, three and four. Moreover, the data rotation values can be fixed constants.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The spatially diverse transmission can occur in a frequency band selected from at least two frequency bands, and the applying can include using same data rotation values with respective data streams irrespective of the selected frequency band. The data rotations can include subcarrier rotations, the interleaving can include performing a first permutation and performing a second permutation, and the applying can include applying the subcarrier rotations to respective data streams. Applying the subcarrier rotations can occur after performing the first permutation and before performing the second permutation. Applying the subcarrier rotations can occur after performing the second permutation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The data rotations can include column rotations, and the interleaving can include performing a first permutation and performing a second permutation, where performing the first permutation includes applying the column rotations to respective data streams. The method can further include selecting a number of the multiple data streams based at least in part on a condition of the wireless channel; and the obtaining the multiple data streams can include generating the multiple data streams from a source data stream based on the selected number. The method can further include preparing the multiple data streams for transmission in compliance with an IEEE 802.11n wireless communication standard. Moreover, the method can further include preparing the multiple data streams for transmission as high-throughput, orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another aspect of the described systems and techniques, an apparatus includes an input configured to receive data to be transmitted over a wireless channel using antenna diversity; and an interleaver section responsive to multiple data streams corresponding to the received data and configured to apply data rotations to respective data streams, where data rotation values used with respective data streams are such that the data rotation values plotted against stream indices correspond to a non-monotonic function. The data rotation values can be independent of a total number of the multiple data streams to be transmitted, the total number being selected from a set of integers including two, three and four. Moreover, the interleaver section can be further configured to use same data rotation values with respective data streams irrespective of a frequency band selected for transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The data rotations can include subcarrier rotations. The data rotations can include column rotations. The apparatus can further include a transmit front end, a parser, a subcarrier mapping section, and a transmit backend.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the described systems and techniques, a system includes a first device including a first wireless transceiver and multiple antennas; and a second device including a second wireless transceiver and multiple antennas, the second device being a mobile device operable to communicate with the first device over a wireless channel.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The systems and techniques described herein can be implemented as one or more devices, such as one or more integrated circuit (IC) devices, in a wireless communication device. For example, the systems and techniques disclosed can be implemented in a wireless local area network (WLAN) transceiver device (e.g., a WLAN chipset) suitable for use in an OFDM MIMO system.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a communication system <b>100</b> that can employ data stream interleaving with non-monotonically arranged data rotations applied to respective data streams before spatially diverse transmission over a wireless channel <b>130</b>. The communication system <b>100</b> is a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) system. A first transceiver <b>110</b> has multiple antennas <b>112</b>, and a second transceiver <b>120</b> has multiple antennas <b>122</b>. In at least one implementation, the system <b>100</b> can dynamically change the number of data streams transmitted over the spatially separated antennas <b>112</b> to alter transmission robustness and transmission data rate as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The transceiver <b>110</b> includes a transmit section <b>114</b> and a receive section <b>116</b>, and the transceiver <b>120</b> includes a transmit section <b>124</b> and a receive section <b>126</b>. The transceivers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are sometimes referred to as transmitters and receivers for convenience, with the understanding that the systems and techniques described are applicable to wireless systems that use dedicated transmitters and receivers as well as transceivers generally. Moreover, a wireless transceiver employing the systems and techniques described can be included in any communication device, regardless of whether that device is a fixed device (e.g., a base station or a personal desktop computer) or a mobile device (e.g., a mobile phone or PDA).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Packetized information transmission involves the transmission of information over the wireless channel <b>130</b> in the form of discrete sections of information <b>135</b>, often referred to as packets or frames. The wireless channel <b>130</b> can be a radio frequency (RF) channel, and the transceivers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> can be implemented to comply with one or more of the IEEE 802 wireless standards (including IEEE 802.11, 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n, 802.16, and 802.20).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In general, wireless channels are typically affected by two dominant phenomena (among others) known as fading and multipath effects. These two effects are typically random and time varying, and determine the receiver-signal-to-noise ratio (Rx-SNR). Signal processing techniques for recovering transmitted signals in light of these effects are well known. For example, in 802.11a/g wireless systems, the OFDM modulation mechanism is used, and predefined training symbols are included in the preambles of data frames for use in estimating characteristics of the wireless channel in order to equalize the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an OFDM modulation approach, the channel bandwidth is divided into narrow slices called tones, and symbols from a constellation (e.g., from a quadrature-amplitude modulated (QAM) constellation) are transmitted over the tones. In a high-throughput MIMO OFDM system (e.g., an IEEE 802.11n system), a different data stream can be sent on each transmit antenna. The separate bit streams handled by the different transmit antennas can be obtained by parsing a source bit stream, either bit-by-bit or by groups of bits, and each bit stream can be permuted by a frequency interleaver. To make the system <b>100</b> backward compatible (e.g., compatible with prior IEEE 802.11a/g systems) and to minimize hardware complexity, a modified version of a traditional frequency interleaver can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing a mobile device communication system <b>200</b> that can employ data stream interleaving with non-monotonically arranged data rotations applied to respective data streams before spatially diverse transmission over a wireless network <b>220</b>. The system <b>200</b> includes multiple mobile devices <b>210</b> operable to communicate with each other over the wireless network <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A mobile device <b>210</b> includes an RF-baseband transceiver <b>230</b> and a baseband processor <b>240</b>. The transmit section and the receive section of the mobile device <b>210</b> can be spread across the RF-baseband transceiver <b>230</b> and the baseband processor <b>240</b>. Moreover, the RF-baseband transceiver <b>230</b> and the baseband processor <b>240</b> can be two integrated circuit devices in a WLAN chipset configured for use in the mobile device <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram showing an example transmitter <b>300</b> as can be used in a wireless communication system. The transmitter <b>300</b> includes a transmitter front end <b>310</b>, which can include, among other components, a convolutional encoder, which encodes an incoming data stream, and a puncturer, which punctures the bits of the data stream to different rates as needed (e.g., depending on rate 2/3 or rate 3/4 or rate 5/6).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The transmitter <b>300</b> can include a parser <b>320</b> that splits the convolutional encoded bitstream, either bit-by-bit or by groups of bits, into multiple streams, which are sent through an interleaver section <b>330</b>, a subcarrier mapping section <b>340</b>, and a transmitter back end <b>350</b> (e.g., to perform modulation, scaling, filtering, and so on, as appropriate for the implementation). The multiple bit streams are then transmitted over multiple respective antennas <b>360</b>. The interleaver section <b>330</b> can include four interleavers <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>338</b>, and the subcarrier mapping section <b>340</b> can include four subcarrier mapping components <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>, <b>346</b>, <b>348</b>, corresponding to four antennas <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The total number of data streams to be transmitted (and thus the number of antennas <b>360</b> being used for a particular transmission) can be a dynamically controllable parameter. For example, the transmitter <b>300</b> may be operable in a SISO mode, where only the first antenna <b>360</b> and the corresponding interleaver <b>332</b> are used. Interleaver <b>332</b> can be designed to be backward compatible with prior SISO systems. For example, interleaver <b>332</b> can implement two permutations, the first of which being defined by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>i=N</i><sub>row</sub>&#xd7;(<i>k </i>mod <i>N</i><sub>column</sub>)+floor(<i>k/N</i><sub>column</sub>)<i>k=</i>0,1<i>, . . . ,N</i><sub>CBPS</sub>&#x2212;1&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where the basic interleaver array has N<sub>row </sub>rows and N<sub>column </sub>columns, and N<sub>CBPS </sub>is the number of coded bits in a single OFDM symbol.
</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The variable k denotes the index of the coded bit before the first permutation, and i denotes the index after the first and before the second permutation, which can be defined by:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>j=s</i>&#xd7;floor(<i>i/s</i>)+(<i>i+N</i><sub>CBPS</sub>&#x2212;floor(<i>N</i><sub>column</sub><i>&#xd7;i/N</i><sub>CBPS</sub>))mod <i>s</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where i=0, 1, . . . , N<sub>CBPS</sub>&#x2212;1, s=max(N<sub>BPSC</sub>/2,1), and N<sub>BPSC </sub>is the number of coded bits per subcarrier. The variable j denotes the index after the second permutation and before modulation mapping.
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram showing an example interleaver <b>400</b> as can be used in a transmitter. The first and second permutations described above can be implemented in first and second permutation devices <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>. These devices <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> can be integrated circuitry configured to perform the defined permutations. Moreover, the integrated circuitry can have two or more discrete sections as shown, or this circuitry can be a unitary section of circuitry that effects the permutations described.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The remaining interleavers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>338</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can also be implemented in this fashion, however, when the transmitter <b>300</b> is operated in a MIMO mode, the interleavers <b>334</b>, <b>336</b>, <b>338</b> can include some form of data rotation to effect bit separation in the wireless channel across the spatially diverse transmission. The decoder at the receiving end of the transmission (e.g., a Viterbi detector) may have difficulty with consecutive bit errors without the proposed bit separation. Separating bits in the channel can prevent the bits from being subject to the same channel state, and thus, appropriate selection of the data rotations applied during interleaving of the data streams can introduce additional spatial and time diversity in the transmission, thereby improving performance.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, one proposal for performing data rotations uses a modified IEEE 802.11a/g interleaver to permute the bits in each stream. This proposed interleaver performs two permutation steps to interleave the bits, where the second permutation remains the same as in the conventional SISO interleaver, and the first permutation equation is modified to interleave the data according to:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>i=N</i><sub>row</sub>&#xd7;(((<i>k </i>mod <i>N</i><sub>column</sub>)+<i>i</i><sub>SS</sub>)mod <i>N</i><sub>column</sub>)+floor(<i>k/N</i><sub>column</sub>)<i>k=</i>0,1<i>, . . . ,N</i><sub>CBPS</sub>&#x2212;1&#x2003;&#x2003;(3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where i<sub>SS </sub>is the stream index (i<sub>SS</sub>=0, 1, . . . , N<sub>SS</sub>&#x2212;1), and N<sub>SS </sub>is the total number of data streams to be transmitted (e.g., if only two streams are transmitted, N<sub>SS </sub>is 2, and i<sub>SS </sub>can have the values 0 or 1). Thus, the term i<sub>SS </sub>is added to the first permutation equation of the conventional interleaver. Since the first data stream has i<sub>SS</sub>=0, the interleaver applies the conventional permutation to the first stream (stream index zero). The second stream has i<sub>SS</sub>=1, and thus a column rotation of one is applied to the second stream. The third stream has i<sub>SS</sub>=2, and thus a column rotation of two is applied to the third stream. The fourth stream has i<sub>SS</sub>=3, and thus a column rotation of three is applied to the fourth stream.
</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph illustrating conventional data rotation values <b>500</b> used in an interleaver section of a transmitter. In the proposal mentioned above, the data rotations <b>500</b> are equal to the stream index (SI): R=SI. Thus, a corresponding function <b>510</b> is a linear, monotonic function. The term &#x201c;monotonic&#x201d; means that successive members of a sequence (the sequence of R values plotted against SI) either consistently increase or decrease but do not oscillate in relative value.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Various other proposals have been made in order to improve performance. These other proposals have included providing an explicit subcarrier rotation at the output of the second permutation, rather than providing a column rotation; an explicit subcarrier mapping rotation is performed using 5&#xd7;i<sub>SS</sub>&#xd7;N<sub>BPSC </sub>for stream i<sub>SS</sub>. In this scheme, the rotation amount is dependent on the stream index and the modulation scheme used for the current transmission. Moreover, the corresponding function is still monotonic with stream index.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The column rotation scheme mentioned above provides an implicit frequency subcarrier rotation without having to explicitly calculate this value depending on the modulation scheme. Other column rotation proposals have suggested making the rotation value dependent not only on stream index, i<sub>SS</sub>, but also on the total number of streams, N<sub>SS</sub>. For example, one proposal involves modifying the first permutation equation to interleave the data according to:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>i=N</i><sub>row</sub>&#xd7;(((<i>k </i>mod <i>N</i><sub>column</sub>)+<i>i</i><sub>SS</sub>floor(<i>N</i><sub>column</sub><i>/N</i><sub>SS</sub>))mod <i>N</i><sub>column</sub>)+floor(<i>k/N</i><sub>column</sub>)&#x2003;&#x2003;(4)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Thus, the second stream is rotated by a different amount depending on how many total streams are to be transmitted. Other proposals include performing an explicit frequency subcarrier rotation, known as cyclic rotation, between permutation one and permutation two of the interleaver. These proposals also result in a corresponding monotonic function.
</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In contrast, the new proposals described herein involve judicious choices of the rotating parameters, which can result in a significant reduction in interleaver complexity and improved performance. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph showing non-monotonically arranged data rotation values <b>600</b>, <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b> used in an interleaver section of a transmitter. As shown, when the number of data streams is greater than two, the rotation values <b>600</b>, <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b> plotted against stream indices correspond to a non-monotonic function <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A non-monotonic arrangement of rotation values can result in improved performance while at the same time making the rotation values independent of the total number of the data streams in the current transmission, which can result in reduced complexity. For example, when the transmission has two streams, the rotation value <b>602</b> for the second stream can be large enough to maximize the rotation distance between the two streams. When a third stream is added to the transmission, the rotation value <b>602</b> can stay the same for the second stream, and a rotation value <b>604</b> for the third stream can be placed between the rotation values <b>600</b>, <b>602</b>. Likewise, when a fourth stream is added to the transmission, the rotation values <b>602</b>, <b>604</b> can stay the same, and a rotation value <b>606</b> can be added.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The rotation value for each stream can be a fixed constant, regardless of the N<sub>SS </sub>value for the current transmission. The data rotations can be column rotations, row rotations, explicit frequency subcarrier rotations, or a combination of these. The rotations can be performed between the first permutation <b>410</b> and the second permutation <b>420</b> or after the second permutation <b>420</b> (which can still be considered applying the rotations within the interleaver section, even if not implemented within an interleaver <b>400</b>). Moreover, the same frequency subcarrier rotation values, the same column rotation values and the same row rotation values can be used irrespective of a selected frequency band (e.g., the same rotation values can be used for both 20 MHz and 40 MHz transmissions in IEEE 802.11n systems, even when different numbers of subcarriers are used).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the case of column rotation, the first permutation can interleave the data according to:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>i=N</i><sub>row</sub>&#xd7;(((<i>k </i>mod <i>N</i><sub>column</sub>)+<i>R</i>)mod <i>N</i><sub>column</sub>)+floor(<i>k/N</i><sub>column</sub>)&#x2003;&#x2003;(5)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where R denotes predetermined column rotation values. For example, R can be predetermined to be 0, 9, 5 and 13 for streams one, two, three and four (corresponding to i<sub>SS</sub>=0, 1, 2, 3) respectively, regardless of the actual number of streams used in the current transmission. Note that the rotation value chosen for the second stream is larger than that for the third stream so that when there are only two streams to be transmitted, consecutive bits coming out the convolutional encoder are placed farther apart in the frequency domain to improve diversity and performance.
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Where explicit frequency subcarrier rotation values are chosen, the rotation values can be 0, 25, 14 and 36 for streams one (i<sub>SS</sub>=0), two (i<sub>SS</sub>=1), three (i<sub>SS</sub>=2) and four (i<sub>SS</sub>=3) respectively. As another example, the rotation values for explicit frequency subcarrier rotation can be 0, 22, 11 and 33 for streams one (i<sub>SS</sub>=0), two (i<sub>SS</sub>=1), three (i<sub>SS</sub>=2) and four (i<sub>SS</sub>=3) respectively. These types of non-monotonic data rotation rules can result in better performance and reduced implementation complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart showing example data processing, including interleaving with non-monotonically arranged data rotations applied to respective data streams, before wireless transmission. The number of data streams to transmit can be selected, based at least in part on a condition of the wireless channel, at <b>710</b>. Various channel condition information and desired data rate information can be used in deciding how many data streams to transmit. The operations underlying this decision on the number of streams to transmit can be implemented in a physical layer interface (PHY) component of a transceiver, a medium access control (MAC) component of a transceiver, or both. For example, the transmit streams decision can be made by an RF-Baseband transceiver and a baseband processor based on received input and estimation of channel conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Multiple streams can be used to improve throughput, range or both. Transmitting non-identical values in multiple streams, if channel conditions allow, can increase throughput. Transmitting the same data in multiple streams (using spatial coding) can result in a better signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and a better signal range.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In general, the number of data streams selected depends on how the multiple transmit antennas are to be used in a given situation, and the number of data streams transmitted, N<sub>SS</sub>, is a programmable parameter that can change dynamically from packet to packet. Additionally, selection of transmission parameters can also include selection of a frequency band (e.g., a 20 MHz band or a 40 MHz band in an IEEE 802.11n high-throughput MIMO OFDM system) for the spatially diverse transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The data streams to be transmitted over a wireless channel using spatially diverse transmission are obtained at <b>720</b>. This obtaining can involve receiving the multiple data streams from another component or generating the multiple data streams from a source data stream based on the selected number of streams to transmit. Such generation of the streams can be implemented by a signal splitter or a parser component. When non-identical values are to be transmitted in the multiple streams, stream generation can involve bit-by-bit parsing or bit-groups parsing.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The multiple data streams are interleaved at <b>730</b>, and in connection with this, data rotations are applied to respective data streams at <b>740</b> to effect bit separation in the wireless channel across the spatially diverse transmission. The application of the data rotations can be an integral part of the interleaving (e.g., column rotations being performed as part of performing the first of two permutations of the interleaving), or the data rotations can be applied separately from the interleaving (e.g., subcarrier rotations applied after the first and second permutations of the interleaving). In either case, the data rotations can be implemented along with the interleaving in an interleaver section of a transceiver. Moreover, in the case of frequency band selection, the same data rotation values can be used with respective data streams irrespective of the selected frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The data rotation values used with respective data streams are such that the data rotation values plotted against stream indices correspond to a non-monotonic function. These data rotation values can have some dependence on other factors, or they can be fixed constants. In any event, the data rotation values can be independent of a total number of the multiple data streams to be transmitted (i.e., the data rotation values do not change with changes in N<sub>SS </sub>alone).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">After interleaving and data rotations, the multiple data streams can be prepared for transmission at <b>750</b>. This can involve preparing the multiple data streams for transmission as high-throughput, orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) signals. Moreover, this can involve preparing the multiple data streams for transmission in compliance with an IEEE 802.11n wireless communication standard. Such preparation can be implemented in the subcarrier mapping section <b>340</b> and the back end <b>350</b> of a transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram showing an example receiver <b>800</b> as can be used in a wireless communication system. The receiver <b>800</b> includes a receiver front end <b>810</b>, a subcarrier de-mapping section <b>820</b>, a de-interleaver section <b>830</b>, and a receiver back end <b>840</b>. Data that has been transmitted over a wireless channel using antenna diversity can be received and processed in compliance with an IEEE 802.11n wireless communication standard.
