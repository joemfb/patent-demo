<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an optoelectronic device and, more particularly, to an optoelectronic device having photocatalytic units.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Green plants, cyanobacteria and photosynthetic bacteria capture and utilize sunlight by means of reaction centers embedded in their membranes. In oxygenic plants and cyanobacteria, photon capture and conversion of light energy into chemical energy take place in specialized membranes called thylakoids. The thylakoids are located in chloroplasts in higher plants or consists of foldings of the cytoplasmic membrane in cyanobacteria. The thylakoids, consisting of stacked membrane disks (called grana) and unstacked membrane disks (called stroma). The thylakoid membrane contains two key photosynthetic components, photosystem I and photosystem II, designated PS I and PS II, respectively. Photosynthesis requires PSII and PSI working in sequence, using water as the source of electrons and CO<sub>2 </sub>as the terminal electron acceptor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">PS I is a transmembrane multisubunit protein-chlorophyll complex that mediates vectorial light-induced electron transfer from plastocyanin or cytochrome C<sub>553 </sub>to ferredoxin. The nano-size dimension, the energy yield of approximately 58% and the quantum efficiency of almost 1 makes the reaction center a promising unit for applications in molecular nano-electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The crystalline structures of PS I in <i>Synechococus elongatus </i>and plant chloroplast have been resolved. In cyanobacteria, the complex consists of 12 polypeptides, some of which bind 96 light-harvesting chlorophyll and 22 carotenoid pigment molecules. The electron transport chain in PS I contains a special pair of chlorophyll (P700) that transfer electrons following photo excitation in 1 picoseconds (ps) to a monomeric chlorophyll a (Chl), through two intermediate phylloquinones (PQ) and three [4Fe-4S] iron sulfur centers (FeS), the final acceptors that are reduced in 0.2 &#x25a1;.</p>

Solid state energy levels and NHE redox levels are plotted on a vertical axis. The decrease in surface photovoltage (SPV), which is the difference in contact potential difference between the surface and a prob in the dark and the light, occurs due to both electron transfer from the PS I monolayer to n-type GaAs and hole transfer from n-type GaAs to the PS I monolayer. In the case of p-type GaAs, the increase in SPV results from a light-induced reduction of the FeS.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The present embodiments comprise a modified photocatalytic unit which can be covalently attached to a semiconductor substrate and maintain activity. Specifically, the present embodiments can be used as electronic components in a variety of optoelectronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Photosynthesis is the biological process that converts electromagnetic energy into chemical energy through light and dark reactions. In oxygenic plants and cyanobacteria, photon capture and conversion of light energy into chemical energy take place in specialized membranes called thylakoids. The thylakoids are located in chloroplast in higher plants or consists of foldings of the cytoplasmic membrane in cyanobacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">PS I is a transmembrane multisubunit protein-chlorophyll complex that mediates vectorial light-induced electron transfer from plastocyanin or cytochrome C<sub>553 </sub>to ferredoxin. The nano-size dimension, an energy yield of approximately 58% and the high quantum efficiency make the reaction center into a promising unit for applications in molecular nano-electronics. However, in order to incorporate PS I reaction centers into molecular devices, it is essential to immobilize the PS I reaction centers onto a substrate without their denaturation. It is oftentimes desirable to immobilize the PS I reaction centers onto the substrate in oriented manner. An oriented attachment of the PS I reaction centers is advantageous so as to reduce or eliminate cancellation of induced electrical charges. It is oftentimes desirable to immobilize the PS I reaction centers onto the substrate such as to maintain the attachment and their catalytic activity in dry environment.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Polypeptides in photocatalytic units may be genetically modified, according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention such that they comprise functional groups for covalent binding to a semiconductor substrate whilst still retaining activity. As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, amino acids in the Psa B polypeptide and Psa C polypeptide of the PS I in the extra membrane loops facing the cytoplasmic side of the bacterial membrane to cysteines were mutated to ensure formation of covalent bonds (between the PS I unit and a semiconductor substrate).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In various exemplary embodiments of the invention, photocatalytic unit are employed in an optoelectronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;photocatalytic unit&#x201d; refers to a complex of at least one polypeptide and other small molecules (e.g. chlorophyll and pigment molecules), which when integrated together work as a functional unit converting light energy to chemical energy. As mentioned herein above, the photocatalytic units of the present invention are present in photosynthetic organisms (i.e. organisms that convert light energy into chemical energy). Examples of photosynthetic organisms include, but are not limited to green plants, cyanobacteria, red algae, purple and green bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, examples of photocatalytic units which can be used in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention include biological photocatalytic units such as PS I and PS II, bacterial light-sensitive proteins, bacterial light-sensitive proteins, bacteriorhodopsin, photocatalytic microorganisms, pigments (e.g., proflavine and rhodopsin), organic dyes and algae. Preferably, the photocatalytic unit of the present invention is photosystem I (PS I).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">PS I is a protein-chlorophyll complex, present in green plants and cyanobacteria, that is part of the photosynthetic machinery within the thylakoid membrane. It is ellipsoidal in shape and has dimensions of about 9 by 15 nanometers.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As used herein the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; refers to &#xb1;10%.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The PS I complex typically comprises chlorophyll molecules which serve as antennae which absorb photons and transfer the photon energy to P700, where this energy is captured and utilized to drive photochemical reactions. In addition to the P700 and the antenna chlorophylls, the PSI complex contains a number of electron acceptors. An electron released from P700 is transferred to a terminal acceptor at the reducing end of PSI through intermediate acceptors, and the electron is transported across the thylakoid membrane. Examples of PS I polypeptides are listed in Appendix 1 together with their source organisms.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the PS I is derived from cyanobacteria and more specifically from <i>Synechosystis </i>sp. PCC 6803.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In cyanobacteria, the PS I complex consists of 12 polypeptides, some of which bind 96 light-harvesting chlorophyll and 22 beta carotenoid molecules. The electron transport chain contain P700, A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>X</sub>, F<sub>A </sub>and F<sub>B </sub>representing a chlorophyll a dimmer, a monomeric chlorophyll a, two phylloquinones and three [4Fe-4S] iron sulfur centers, respectively. The reaction center core complex is made up of the heterodimeric PsaA and PsaB subunits, containing the primary electron donor, P700, which undergoes light-induced charge separation and transfers an electron through the sequential carriers A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1 </sub>and F<sub>X</sub>. The final acceptors F<sub>A </sub>and F<sub>B </sub>are located on another subunit, PsaC.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">PS Is derived from cyanobacteria are more structurally stable than those derived from plant and bacterial reaction centers. This is due to the fact that all chlorophyll molecules and carotenoids are integrated into the core subunit complexes in cyanobacteria while in plant and other bacterial reaction centers the antenna chlorophylls are bound to chlorophyll-protein complexes that are attached to the core subunits. Thus, unlike PS Is derived from other organisms such as plants and other bacteria, those derived from cyanobacteria do not require peptide surfactants for stabilization [R. Das et al., <i>Nano Letters </i>2004, 4 1079-1083] during attachment to a solid surface under dry environment.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As used herein, the term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; refers to the modified photocatalytic polypeptide that has been at least partially removed from its natural site of synthesis (e.g., photosynthetic organism). Typically, the photocatalytic polypeptide is not isolated from other members of the photocatalytic unit (i.e. chlorophyll and pigment) so that the photocatalytic unit remains functional. Preferably the polypeptide is substantially free from other substances (e.g., other cells, proteins, nucleic acids, etc.) that are present in its in-vivo location. The activity of the photocatalytic units of the present embodiments may be tested following the isolation.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As mentioned, the photocatalytic unit of this aspect of the present invention comprises the modified polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; as used herein refers to a polypeptide which may be synthesized by recombinant DNA technology.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As used herein in the specification and in the claims section below the term &#x201c;amino acid&#x201d; or &#x201c;amino acids&#x201d; is understood to include the 20 naturally occurring amino acids; those amino acids often modified post-translationally in vivo, including, for example, hydroxyproline, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine; and other unusual amino acids including, but not limited to, 2-aminoadipic acid, hydroxylysine, isodesmosine, nor-valine, nor-leucine and ornithine. Furthermore, the term &#x201c;amino acid&#x201d; includes both D- and L-amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;modified polypeptide&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide comprising a modification as compared to the wild-type polypeptide. Typically, the modification is an amino acid modification. Any modification to the sequence is envisaged according to this aspect of the present invention so long as the polypeptide is capable of covalent attachment to a solid surface and retains a photocatalytic activity. Examples of modifications include a deletion, an insertion, a substitution and a biologically active polypeptide fragment thereof. Insertions or deletions are typically in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The site of modification is selected according to the suggested 3D structure of the photocatalytic unit. Evidence relating to the 3D structure of photocatalytic units may be derived from X-ray crystallography studies or using protein modeling software. The crystalline structure of PS I from <i>Synechococus elongatus </i>and from plants chloroplast has been resolved to 2.5 &#x212b; at 4.4 &#x212b;, respectively [P. Jordan, et al., <i>Nature </i>2001, 411 909-917; A. Ben Shem, F. Frolow, N. Nelson, <i>Nature </i>2003, 426 630-635].</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The amino acid to be replaced or the site of insertion is typically on the external surface of the photocatalytic unit (e.g. on an extra membrane loop). Preferably, the amino acids to be replaced or the site of insertion is in a position which does not cause steric hindrance. Also it is preferred that the mutations are positioned near the P700 of the photocatalytic unit to secure close proximity between the reaction center and the solid surface in order to facilitate an efficient electric junction.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the modification is a substitution (i.e. replacement) comprising a functional group side chain which is capable of mediating-binding to the solid surface. Particularly preferred coordinates for mutation of PS I from <i>Synechocystis </i>sp. PCC 6803 in PsaB include single mutations D235C, S246C, D479C, S499C, S599C and Y634C or double mutations D235C/Y634C and S246C/Y634C. In PsaC, a particularly preferred site for a mutation is W31C. In addition, a triple mutation may be generated in the photocatalytic units (e.g. PsaC//PsaB W31C//D235C/634C).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Preferably, the wild type amino acid which is substituted is not essential for the activity of the photocatalytic unit. Guidance in determining which amino acids are functionally redundant may be found by comparing the sequence of the photocatalytic unit with that of homologous known protein molecules and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one embodiment, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted, non-essential amino acid residues. A &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined within the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In another embodiment, non-conservative amino acid substitutions may be made since the mutations are preferably designed to enable oriented covalent attachment of the protein to metal. By selecting mutant cells that can grow photoautotrophically, undamaged PS I cells may be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Preferably, the amino acids at the coordinates described hereinabove are replaced with an amino acid which is capable of binding to a metal surface&#x2014;e.g. amino acids that comprise a thiol group such as cysteine.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Recombinant techniques are preferably used to generate the polypeptides of the present invention since photocatalytic units typically comprise more than one polypeptide and other molecules (e.g. pigment molecules and chlorophyll) integrated into a complex. In addition, these techniques are better suited for generation of relatively long polypeptides (e.g., longer than 20 amino acids) and large amounts thereof. Such recombinant techniques are described by Bitter et al., (1987) Methods in Enzymol. 153:516-544, Studier et al. (1990) Methods in Enzymol. 185:60-89, Brisson et al. (1984) Nature 310:511-514, Takamatsu et al. (1987) EMBO J. 6:307-311, Coruzzi et al. (1984) EMBO J. 3:1671-1680 and Brogli et al., (1984) Science 224:838-843, Gurley et al. (1986) Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:559-565 and Weissbach &#x26; Weissbach, 1988, Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, Academic Press, NY, Section VIII, pp 421-463.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The polypeptides of the present invention may be modified by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis (oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis) and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Thus a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of a photocatalytic unit may be mutated. Following mutagenesis the photocatalytic units can be expressed in an appropriate cell system.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis is a technique which is well known in the art as described by Adelman et al., DNA, 2: 183 (1983). Briefly, a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of a photocatalytic unit (e.g. PsaB gene) is altered by hybridizing an oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation to a polynucleotide template, where the template is the single-stranded form of the plasmid containing the unaltered or native polynucleotide sequence of the polypeptide of the photocatalytic unit. After hybridization, a DNA polymerase (e.g. Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I) is used to synthesize an entire second complementary strand of the template that will thus incorporate the oligonucleotide primer, and will code for the selected alteration in the photocatalytic unit polynucleotide, thus producing a heteroduplex molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">This heteroduplex molecule is then transformed into a suitable host cell, usually a prokaryote such as <i>E. coli </i>JM101. After the cells are grown, they may be plated onto agarose plates and screened identify the bacterial colonies that contain the mutated DNA. The mutated region is then removed and placed in an appropriate vector for protein production, generally an expression vector of the type typically employed for transformation of an appropriate host.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Generally, oligonucleotides of at least 25 nucleotides in length are used. An optimal oligonucleotide will have 12 to 15 nucleotides that are completely complementary to the template on either side of the nucleotide(s) coding for the mutation. This ensures that the oligonucleotide will hybridize properly to the single-stranded polynucleotide template molecule. The oligonucleotides are readily synthesized using techniques known in the art such as that described by Crea et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75: 5765 (1978).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The polynucleotide template can only be generated by those vectors that are either derived from bacteriophage M13 vectors (the commercially available M13 mp18 and M13 mp19 vectors are suitable), or those vectors that contain a single-stranded phage origin of replication as described by Viera et al. Meth. Enzymol., 153: 3 (1987). Thus, the polynucleotide that is to be mutated must be inserted into one of these vectors to generate single-stranded template. Production of the single-stranded template is described in Sections 4.21-4.41 of Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, N.Y. 1989)</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Mutants with more than one amino acid to be substituted may also be generated, using site directed mutagenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis are also techniques that are suitable for modifying polypeptides of photocatalytic units&#x2014;See Sambrook and Russell (2001, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Approach, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) and Ausubel et al. (2002, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, NY).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Suitable hosts for the expression of the mutated photocatalytic sequences include any host that is capable of synthesizing a functional photocatalytic unit. Thus the host must be capable of incorporating pigment, chlorophyll molecules and the like into the unit. Examples of suitable hosts include, but are not limited to green plant cell cultures, green plants and photosynthetic bacteria. In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the present invention, the host is <i>Synechocystis </i>bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the mutated DNA is cloned by insertion into the host genome. This is particularly suitable when the host cell are photosynthetic bacteria. This method is affected by including in the vector a DNA sequence that is complementary to a sequence found in the photosynthetic genomic DNA. Transfection of photosynthetic bacteria with this vector results in homologous recombination with the genome and insertion of the photocatalytic poypeptide DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The phrase &#x201c;an isolated polynucleotide&#x201d; refers to a single or double stranded nucleic acid sequence which is isolated and provided in the form of an RNA sequence, a complementary polynucleotide sequence (cDNA), a genomic polynucleotide sequence and/or a composite polynucleotide sequences (e.g., a combination of the above).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As used herein the phrase &#x201c;complementary polynucleotide sequence&#x201d; refers to a sequence, which results from reverse transcription of messenger RNA using a reverse transcriptase or any other RNA dependent DNA polymerase. Such a sequence can be subsequently amplified in vivo or in vitro using a DNA dependent DNA polymerase.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As used herein the phrase &#x201c;genomic polynucleotide sequence&#x201d; refers to a sequence derived (isolated) from a chromosome and thus it represents a contiguous portion of a chromosome.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As used herein the phrase &#x201c;composite polynucleotide sequence&#x201d; refers to a sequence, which is at least partially complementary and at least partially genomic. A composite sequence can include some exonal sequences required to encode the polypeptide of the present invention, as well as some intronic sequences interposing therebetween. The intronic sequences can be of any source, including of other genes, and typically will include conserved splicing signal sequences. Such intronic sequences may further include cis acting expression regulatory elements.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As mentioned hereinabove, polynucleotide sequences of the present invention may be inserted into expression vectors (i.e., a nucleic acid construct) to enable expression of the recombinant polypeptide. The expression vector of the present invention includes additional sequences which render this vector suitable for replication and integration in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, or preferably both (e.g., shuttle vectors). Typical cloning vectors contain transcription and translation initiation sequences (e.g., promoters, enhances) and transcription and translation terminators (e.g., polyadenylation signals).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors can be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the polypeptide expressed. For example, when large quantities of polypeptides are desired, vectors that direct the expression of high levels of the protein product, possibly as a fusion with a hydrophobic signal sequence, which directs the expressed product into the periplasm of the bacteria or the culture medium where the protein product is readily purified may be desired. Certain fusion protein engineered with a specific cleavage site to aid in recovery of the polypeptide may also be desirable. Such vectors adaptable to such manipulation include, but are not limited to, the pET series of <i>E. coli </i>expression vectors [Studier et al., Methods in Enzymol. 185:60-89 (1990)].</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In cases where plant expression vectors are used, the expression of the polypeptide coding sequence can be driven by a number of promoters. For example, viral promoters such as the 35S RNA and 19S RNA promoters of CaMV [Brisson et al., Nature 310:511-514 (1984)], or the coat protein promoter to TMV [Takamatsu et al., EMBO J. 6:307-311 (1987)] can be used. Alternatively, plant promoters can be used such as, for example, the small subunit of RUBISCO [Coruzzi et al., EMBO J. 3:1671-1680 (1984); and Brogli et al., Science 224:838-843 (1984)] or heat shock promoters, e.g., soybean hsp17.5-E or hsp17.3-B [Gurley et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:559-565 (1986)]. These constructs can be introduced into plant cells using Ti plasmid, Ri plasmid, plant viral vectors, direct DNA transformation, microinjection, electroporation and other techniques well known to the skilled artisan. See, for example, Weissbach &#x26; Weissbach [Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, Academic Press, NY, Section VIII, pp 421-463 (1988)].</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">It will be appreciated that other than containing the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted coding sequence (encoding the polypeptide), the expression construct of the present invention can also include sequences engineered to optimize stability, production, purification, yield or activity of the expressed polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Expression and cloning vectors should contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. This is a gene that encodes a protein necessary for the survival or growth of a host cell transformed with the vector. The presence of this gene ensures that any host cell which deletes the vector will not obtain an advantage in growth or reproduction over transformed hosts. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g. ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Various methods can be used to introduce the expression vector of the present invention into the host cell system. Such methods are generally described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, New York (1989, 1992), in Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Md. (1989), Chang et al., Somatic Gene Therapy, CRC Press, Ann Arbor, Mich. (1995), Vega et al., Gene Targeting, CRC Press, Ann Arbor Mich. (1995), Vectors: A Survey of Molecular Cloning Vectors and Their Uses, Butterworths, Boston Mass. (1988) and Gilboa et al. [Biotechniques 4 (6): 504-512, 1986] and include, for example, stable or transient transfection, lipofection, electroporation and infection with recombinant viral vectors. In addition, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,464,764 and 5,487,992 for positive-negative selection methods.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Transformed cells are cultured under effective conditions, which allow for the expression of high amounts of recombinant polypeptide. Effective culture conditions include, but are not limited to, effective media, bioreactor, temperature, pH and oxygen conditions that permit protein production. An effective medium refers to any medium in which a cell is cultured to produce the recombinant polypeptide of the present invention. Such a medium typically includes an aqueous solution having assimilable carbon, nitrogen and phosphate sources, and appropriate salts, minerals, metals and other nutrients, such as vitamins. Cells of the present invention can be cultured in conventional fermentation bioreactors, shake flasks, test tubes, microtiter dishes and petri plates. Culturing can be carried out at a temperature, pH and oxygen content appropriate for a recombinant cell. Such culturing conditions are within the expertise of one of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Following culturing under suitable conditions, the photocatalytic units are preferably isolated from the cells. An exemplary method for removing photocatalytic units from photosynthetic organisms is described in Example 2 of the Examples section hereinbelow. The present invention also envisages using any other methods of purification and isolation so long as the photocatalytic unit remains functional. The photocatalytic units may be isolated as polymers e.g. trimers or as single monomers. The photocatalytic units may be fully isolated or part of a membrane preparation. Methods of preparing membrane extracts are well known in the art. For example, Qoronfleh et al., [J Biomed Biotechnol. 2003; 2003(4): 249-255] teach a method for selective enrichment of membrane proteins by partition phase separation. Various kits are also commercially available for the preparation of membrane extracts such as from Sigma-Aldrich (ProteoPrep&#x2122; Membrane Extraction Kit).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Preferably, one or more amino acid sequences of a polypeptide of the photocatalytic unit is attached to a semiconductor surface such as to allow charge carrier transfer between the amino acid sequence(s) and the semiconductor surface. The semiconductor surface can comprise GaAs, Si, Ge, GeN, SiGe, AlGaAs, InGaAs, InGaP, AlInP, GaInAsP, GaN, AlGaN, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">GaAs absorbs in the same wavelength region with PS I. This can lead to photon absorption by the underlying GaAs. When it is desired to prevent photon absorption by the semiconductor, the photocatalytic unit and the semiconductor material are preferably selected to have different absorption spectra. For example, a modified PS I can be covalently attached to GaN or AlGaN.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the bandgap as a function of the lattice constant of III-V nitride semiconductors and other III-V semiconductors including GaAs. For AlN, GaN and InGaN a high two dimensional carrier concentration (above 3E13 cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>) can be achieved a few nanometers below the surface. This enables higher sensitivity to charge redistribution at the surface. AlN, GaN and InGaN are also compatible with biological systems. Additionally, blue and UV light emitting diodes can be fabricated on the same chip, permitting integrated source-detection sensing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The polypeptide can be modified to facilitate its attachment (e.g., covalent attachment) to the semiconductor surface.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Attachment of the modified photocatalytic unit to the semiconductor surface can be effected indirectly using a linker molecule. For example, linker molecule can be chemisorbed on the semiconductor surface and the modified photocatalytic unit can be covalently attached to the chemisorbed molecule. When it is desired to attach a plurality of modified photocatalytic unit, the linked molecules can form a monolayer on the semiconductor surface. A representative example for such linked molecules is amino silan linked molecules with a maleimide moiety. This is particularly useful in the embodiments is which the substituting residue is cysteine, because the maleimide can readily attach to the cysteines in the modified photocatalytic unit. It was found by the present inventor that even though the linker molecules are short when compared with the size of the protein, their maleimide moiety can readily react with the cysteines to form a dense monolayer of photocatalytic units under aqueous conditions. It was further found by the present inventors that the short linker molecules ensure close packing of the units on the semiconductor surface. Such monolayer can includes particles of nanometric size. For example, the particles can have a diameter of about 15 nm and 20 nm, which respectively correspond to the size of monomers and trimers of PS I.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The semiconductor surface can be prepared for the attachment of the modified photocatalytic unit using the following procedure which is not intended to be limiting. The semiconductor surface can be cleaned and etched. Following rinsing, the etched semiconductor surface can be immediately immersed in a solution selected to facilitate chemical adsorption. For example, the solution can comprise ECMA, BMPA or the like which can be chemisorbed to the etched surface through their carboxyl end to form a self-assembled monolayer on the surface. An aqueous solution can be used for terminating the chemisoption.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The surface can be hydroxylated and then coated with amino silan using a reagent such as, but not limited to, (3-aminopropyl)-Diethoxymethylsilane or (3-aminopropyl) ethoxydimethylsilane. Linker molecules, e.g., m-Maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester can then be attached to the amino silan.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the modified photocatalytic unit retains photocatalytic activity following attachment to a solid surface.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Herein, the phrase &#x201c;photocatalytic activity&#x201d; refers to the conversion of light energy to chemical energy. Preferably, the modified photocatalytic units retain at least 20%, more preferably at least 30%, more preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, e.g., about 100% the activity of the wild type photocatalytic unit in its in-vivo environment. The present invention also envisages that the photocatalytic unit of the present invention comprises an activity greater than that of wild type photocatalytic unit in its in-vivo environment.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In various exemplary embodiments of the invention the photocatalytic units are attached in an oriented manner so as to prevent them, at least partially, from neutralizing each others charge.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Without being bound to any theory, the present inventors hypothesized that by substituting an identical amino acid for cysteine in a plurality of photocatalytic units, the attachment to a semiconductor surface can be oriented and the photocatalytic units form an oriented monolayer on the surface. The orientation of the photocatalytic units on the surface can be adjusted according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention by judicious selection of the amino acid to be substituted by the cysteine residue.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Also contemplated is an oriented monolayer of photocatalytic units with inverted polarity. Reversing of the polarity of a photo-gate can be used to turn an n channel off or to turn on a p channel. For example, when PS I is employed an inverted polarity can be achieved by binding the reducing end of the PS I to the semiconductor surface. In this embodiment, a modified PS I having unique cysteine on subunit PsaC located on its reducing end can be used. Mutation W31C in PsaC subunit can be induced in native <i>Synechosystis </i>cell using vector p6l-2.4. The isolated PS I complexes from mutant W31C in subunit PsaC in PS I can be used for fabrication of inversely orientated monolayer by attachment of the cysteine to maleimide moiety of linker molecules attached as a monolayer on the semiconductor surface.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic illustration of an optoelectronic device <b>10</b>, according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention.

The frequency of light which induces the electron transfer depends on the photosynthetic organisms from which units <b>14</b> are obtained. For example, when photocatalytic units of green plants or green bacteria are employed, device <b>10</b> is sensitive to green light of wavelength of from about 400 nm to about 730 nm, when photocatalytic units of cyanobacteria are employed, device <b>10</b> is sensitive to light of wavelength of from about 400 nm to about 730 nm, when photocatalytic units of red algae are employed, device <b>10</b> is sensitive to red light of wavelength of from about 650 nm to about 700 nm and when photocatalytic units of purple bacteria are employed, device <b>10</b> is sensitive to purple light of wavelength of from about 400 nm to about 800 nm.</p>

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is a schematic illustration of a photodiode device <b>20</b>, according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that several components appearing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> have been omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> for clarity of presentation. Photodiode device <b>20</b> comprises optoelectric device <b>10</b>, and two electrical contacts <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> being in electrical communication with donor site <b>16</b> and acceptor site <b>18</b>, respectively. Electrical communication with donor site <b>16</b> can be established, for example, by connecting a conducting material to support <b>12</b> or surface <b>13</b>. The acceptor site can be covalently bound by formation of sulfide bond between the modified polypeptide of the present invention (W31C in PsaC subunit of PS I) and the top deposited metal electrode. Platinized photocatalytic units at the acceptor side can make a metal to metal electrical connection with a top electrode deposited by evaporation of thin metal electrode. Deposition of conducting polymer on top of the photocatalytic monolayer or the platinized photocatalytic monolayer can serve as a top electrode. A symbolic illustration of the photodiode is illustrated on the right of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In use, the photocatalytic units are irradiated by light hence being excited to efficient charge separation of high quantum efficiency, which is typically above 95%. Contacts <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> tap off the electrical current caused by the charge separation. Depending on the voltage applied between contacts <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, photodiode device <b>20</b> can be used either as a photovoltaic device, or as a reversed bias photodiode.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Specifically, in the absence of external voltage, photodiode device <b>20</b> enacts a photovoltaic device which produces current when irradiated by light. Such device can serve as a component in, e.g., a solar cell.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">When reverse bias is applied between contacts <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, photodiode device <b>20</b> maintains high resistance to electric current flowing from contact <b>24</b> to contact <b>22</b> as long as photodiode device <b>20</b> is not irradiated by light which excites the photocatalytic units. Upon irradiation by light at the appropriate wavelength, the resistance is significantly reduced. Such device can serve as a component in, e.g., a light detector.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Optoelectronic device <b>10</b> can also serve as a solar cell, when no bias voltage is applied. Upon irradiation of the photocatalytic units, the charge-separated state results in internal voltage between donor site <b>16</b> and acceptor site <b>18</b>. The internal voltage can be tapped off via electrical contacts at donor site <b>16</b> and acceptor site <b>18</b>. If the current circuit is closed externally, the current flow is maintained through repeated light-driven charge separation in the solar cell.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The generated polarized charge-separated state of device <b>10</b> can also be utilized for in a molecular transistor. Specifically, device <b>10</b> can serve as a light-charged capacitor enacting a gate electrode which modifies the density of charge carriers in a channel connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which is a schematic illustration of a phototransistor <b>30</b>, according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Phototransistor <b>30</b> comprises a source electrode <b>32</b>, a drain electrode <b>34</b>, a channel <b>36</b> and a light responsive gate electrode <b>38</b>. Gate electrode <b>38</b> preferably comprises optoelectronic device <b>10</b>. Channel <b>36</b> preferably has semiconducting properties such that the density of charge carriers can be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In the absence of light, channel <b>36</b> does not contain any free charge carriers and is essentially an insulator. Upon exposure to light, the photocatalytic units of device <b>10</b> generate a polarized charge-separated state and the electric field caused thereby attracts electrons (or more generally, charge carriers) from source electrode <b>32</b> and drain electrode <b>34</b>, so that channel <b>36</b> becomes conducting. Thus, phototransistor <b>30</b> serves as an amplifier or a switching device where the light controls the current flowing from source electrode <b>32</b> and drain electrode <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The gate electrode can be formed from the isolated photocatalytic units of the present embodiments as further detailed hereinabove. A symbolic illustration of the phototransistor is illustrated at the right had side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">As will be appreciated by one ordinarily skilled in the art, phototransistor <b>30</b> can operate while gate electrode <b>38</b> is left an open circuit because the gating is induced by photons impinging on electrode <b>38</b>. Phototransistor <b>30</b> can be used as a logical element whereby the phototransistor can be switched to an &#x201c;on&#x201d; state by the incident light. In addition, phototransistor <b>30</b> can be used as the backbone of an image sensor with large patterning possible due to a strong variation of the drain current with the spatial position of the incident light beam. Several phototransistors, each operating at a different wavelength as further detailed hereinabove can be assembled to allow sensitivity of the image sensor to color images. The charge storage capability of the structure with further modifications known to one skilled in the art of conventional semiconductors can be exploited for memory related applications.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Photodiode <b>20</b> and/or phototransistor <b>30</b> can be integrated in many electronic circuitries. In particular, such devices can be used as building blocks which can be assembled on a surface structure to form a composite electronic assembly. For example, two or more photodiodes or phototransistors can be assembled on a surface structure to form a logic gate, a combination of logic gates or a microprocessor.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> which is a simplified illustration of an optocoupler <b>40</b>, according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Optocoupler <b>40</b> is particularly useful for transferring signals from one element to another without establishing a direct electrical contact between the elements, e.g., due to voltage level mismatch. For example, optocoupler <b>40</b> can be used to establish contact free communication between a microprocessor operating at low voltage level and a gated switching device operating at high voltage level.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention optocoupler <b>40</b> comprises an optical transmitter <b>42</b> and an optical receiver <b>44</b>. Transmitter <b>42</b> can be any light source, such as, but not limited to, a light emitting diode (LED). Receiver <b>44</b> preferably comprises optoelectronic device <b>10</b>, and can be, for example, a photodiode (e.g., photodiode <b>20</b>) or a phototransistor (e.g., phototransistor <b>30</b>). Transmitter <b>42</b> is selected such that the radiation emitted thereby is at sufficient energy to induce charge separation between donor site <b>16</b> and acceptor site <b>18</b> of device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Transmitter <b>42</b> and receiver <b>44</b> are kept at optical communication but electrically decoupled. For example, transmitter <b>42</b> and receiver <b>44</b> can be separated by a transparent barrier <b>46</b> which allows the passage of light but prevents any electrical current flow thereacross. Transmitter <b>42</b> and receiver <b>44</b> preferably oppose each other such that the radiation emitted from transmitter <b>42</b> strikes receiver <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Triggered by an electrical signal, transmitter <b>42</b> emits light <b>48</b> which passes through barrier <b>46</b> and strikes receiver <b>44</b>. In turn, receiver <b>44</b> generates an electrical signal which can be tapped off via suitable electrical contacts as further detailed hereinabove. Thus optocoupler <b>40</b> successfully transmits to its output (receiver <b>44</b>) an electrical signal applied at its input (transmitter <b>42</b>), devoid of any electrical contact between the input and the output.</p>

Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a </i>is a FET which comprises one or more layers of the modified photocatalytic units of the present embodiments.

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>d</i>, at zero gate bias (black lines), the semiconductor channel is partially depleted. When a more positive gate bias is applied (read lines), more charges are induced in the channel via capacitive coupling thus resulting in a larger current flowing between the source and drain.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The third terminal of the FET of the present embodiments is preferably modified photocatalytic unit, e.g., a modified PS I. Upon absorbing photons, electrons transfer into semiconductor thus increasing the conductivity of the channel; meanwhile, holes transfer to the modified photocatalytic unit attracting more electrons supplied from the ohmic contacts. Therefore, an open channel results (red lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>c</i>). The induced photocurrent in the FET of the present embodiments is typically proportional to the ratio of the hole lifetime over the electron transit time from the source to the drain, and its switching characteristics depends on the two time constants.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The absorption cross section, total quantum efficiency and the photopotential can be improved using more than one monolayer of photocatalytic units. This can be effected by a method which utilizes metal bonding by photoreducing Pt<sup>4+</sup> ions in solution by the PS I monolayer. Pt<sup>4+</sup> ions can be photoreduced by PS I monolayer at the reducing end of the protein and Pt is deposited. Such monolayer is characterized by metal deposition on top of each of the PS I as the phase angle increases with the stiffness of the substrate (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>showing phase contrast images of PS I, and platinized PS I, respectively). Using such technique, several oriented monolayers can be formed on top of each other, where the Pt&#x2014;S bond connects between adjacent monolayers.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The present embodiments successfully provide a method suitable for fabricating a field effect transistor. The method preferably begin by depositing a first semiconductor layer characterized by a first dopant concentration on a second semiconductor layer characterized by a second dopant concentration which is higher than the first dopant concentration. The two semiconductor layers can be either n-doped or p-doped layers. Optionally and preferably the first semiconductor layer is deposited on a semi-insolating semiconductor layer, such that the first layer is between the semi-insolating layer and the second layer.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The method can continue to a step in which a source ohmic contact layer and a drain ohmic contact layer are deposited on the second semiconductor layer.

<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The robust PS I reaction center from the cyanobacteria <i>Synechosystis </i>sp. PCC 6803 was selected to ascertain whether genetic modifications could assist in attachment of the reaction center to a solid support. The main reason for the structural stability of the PS I is due to the fact that all chlorophyll molecules and carotenoids are integrated into the core subunits complex. Antenna chlorophylls in plant and bacterial reaction centers are bound to chlorophyll-protein complexes attached to the core subunits.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Selection of the amino acids to be modified to cysteines for covalent attachment of the PS I to the GaAs substrate was based on the knowledge of the atomic structure of the PS I. Thus, amino acids in the extra membrane loops facing the cytoplasmic side of the bacterial membrane which do not have stereo hindrance when placed on a solid surface were mutated to cysteines in order to ensure formation of sulfide bonds.</p>

Kelvin mode is based on the two-pass technique. In the first pass the topography is acquired using standard semicontact mode (mechanical excitation of the cantilever). In the second pass this topography is retraced at a set lift height from the sample surface to detect the electric surface potential. The operating frequency was around 300 kHz. CPD is extracted in the conventional way by nullifying the output signal of a lock-in amplifier which measures the electrostatic force at the first resonance frequency. The NTMDT AFM was equipped with a custom-made 1300-nm wavelength feedback laser to prevent any sample-induced photovoltage. Most CPD measurements were conducted in a nitrogen glove box. A comparison with an in-situ peeled pyrolitic graphite standard (OPG) enabled to extract the actual work function of all measured samples.

<p id="p-0177" num="0176">As shown in Tables 1-3, the etching and chemisorption of the EMCA and BMPA monolayers on the GaAs surface caused a 0.1 to 0.17 V increase of the CPD. This effect is assumed to be due to the formation of Ga carboxylate and to the dipole formed by a pair of exposed oxygen atoms at the maleimide ring. Similar changes in the surface energetics of semiconductors are affected by the chemisorption of organic and inorganic molecules and peptides used to modulate photonic crystals band gap energies [Bastide, S. et al. Controlling the work function of GaAs by chemisorption of benzoic acid derivatives. J. Phys. Chem. B 101, 2678-2684 (1997)].</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Decrease in the CPD (without illumination) caused by the bond formation between PS I and the GaAs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>) was 0.05 V, 0.31 V, and 0.67 V for the n-, u- and PS I-p-doped GaAs system, respectively. The difference in CPD between the n- and p-type GaAs can be explained by electron transfer from the PS I to the p-GaAs (see the energy levels diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As shown in the diagram, the P700 ground state energy level is higher than the valence band maximum E<sub>v </sub>of both p- and n-GaAs. An electron, however, is transferred from the P700 level to the p-GaAs valence band but not to the n-GaAs because the latter valence band is fully occupied. Such an oxidation of PSI charges it positively and decreases the CPD in agreement with the experimental data of the present example. Similar results were obtained on the PS I-GaAs system chemisorbed with a monolayer of BMPA. Molecular structure of BMPA comprises one carbon atom less in comparison with EMCA molecular structure. These results demonstrate a direct electron transfer between large proteins, and, the GaAs substrate through the chemisorbed small molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">A very small photovoltage U<sub>L </sub>of &#x2212;0.05, 0.06 and 0.04 V was measured in the EMCA-treated n-, u-, and p-GaAs, respectively. Such small changes are due mainly to the small band bending of the different GaAs surfaces. The chemisorption of the PS I monolayer, however, resulted in a much higher photovoltage U<sub>L </sub>of about 0.265 and 0.295 V for the u- and p-doped GaAs, respectively. Such a positive photovoltage U<sub>L </sub>is due to the light-induced charge separation and consequent electron transfer across the protein, resulting in a dipole formation. Negative charge of this dipole is at the reducing end of the PS I opposite to GaAs surface.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Surprisingly, the PS I monolayer bound to n-GaAs induced a negative photovoltage U<sub>L </sub>of &#x2212;0.47 V. A change in the photovoltage polarity can be explained by comparing the energy of the GaAs bands with the redox potential energy levels of the primary donor and the electron acceptors in the PS I protein, illustrated together in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Difference between Fermi level E<sub>f </sub>and the conduction band minimum E<sub>c </sub>in p- and n-GaAs is about &#x2212;0.8 and &#x2212;0.235 eV, respectively. The energy level E<sub>c </sub>in n-GaAs is 0.5 and 0.24 eV lower relative to the primary (Chl) and the final (FeS) electron acceptor levels in PS I, respectively. Therefore, under illumination conditions, the electrons transfer from the PS I to the n-type GaAs, and the holes move from the semiconductor to the PS I; this effect charges positively the PS I, and decreases the surface potential.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The experimental data of photovoltage formation-decay dynamics are revealed a reversible, light-induced change in the GaAs-PS I monolayer. The onset of steady state was more rapid than the shutter functioning time of 0.7 ms (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>f</i>, graph lines 1 and 3). The rate of the major component (about 96%) of the total decay of the steady-state photovoltage had a t<sub>1/2 </sub>of unresolved, due to a charge recombination in the PS I attached to the GaAs. As further detailed in the Experimental Procedure section that follows, only about 4% of the decay of the CPD was due to charge recombination in GaAs, with t<sub>1/2 </sub>of 1.5 s (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>f</i>, curves 2 and 4). Remarkably, the observation that the decay rate of the light-induced steady state CPD in the dry PS I is faster than 0.7 ms which is known to be in the range of the charge recombination rate between P700<sup>+</sup> and the reduced iron-sulfur cluster (the final acceptor, FeS) in PS I in aqueous solution. This effect is assumed to be due permanence of behavior of PS I chemisorbed to GaAs in a dry environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">CONCLUSIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The above examples demonstrate that selection of a robust reaction center PS I from cyanobacteria alongside with a rational design of mutations based on the crystallographic structure enables the fabrication of oriented monolayers on the GaAs semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Binding of the protein complex to the semiconductor substrate through formation of covalent bond between unique cysteines induced by mutation and a monolayer of connecting small molecules absorbed to the semiconductor surface secures a stable and efficient electronic junction. The dry membrane protein in the monolayer retains its capacity to generate photo-potential of approximately 0.5V. High quantum efficiency makes reaction centers intriguing nano-technological devices for applications in molecular electronics and biotechnology. Formation of oriented multilayers can increase the light absorption cross section and the selectivity of the device to light.</p>
