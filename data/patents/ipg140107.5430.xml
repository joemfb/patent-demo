<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/869,983, filed Aug. 27, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to a system and method for refilling prescription medications using a camera in a web enabled device to scan a barcode and decode a prescription number.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While some medications prescribed to patients may be taken only for a brief period of time, other medications may be taken for extended periods of time. For convenience, when a doctor prescribes a medication that will be taken over an extended period, the doctor may write the prescription such that a pharmacy can refill the prescription one or more times without requiring renewed authorization from the doctor (i.e., without requiring a new prescription). When a patient runs out of the prescribed medication (or slightly before), the patient may contact the pharmacy at which the prescription was originally filled and request a refill, if there are any refills remaining.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the past, a patient (or customer) wishing to order a refill of a prescription medication called the pharmacy or visited the pharmacy to ask for the refill in person. In some instances, a patient could request a refill of a prescription medication by mail or by facsimile. More recently, pharmacies have implemented internet-based interfaces (i.e., web sites) through which a patient could request a refill. To access the web pages through which prescription refills may be requested, a patient must be logged into a user profile. Generally, though not always, the user profile is associated with only one person, and the user can order refills only of the prescriptions associated with his profile. Some systems allow for a profile to be associated with multiple people (e.g., family members, patients in the charge of a caregiver, etc.), but this requires additional configuration steps, such as sending and responding to requests for permission, that often must be coordinated between multiple people.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In any event, the systems currently in place require a user who wishes to order a prescription refill to log into the system. This requires the patient to input a user name or email address and a password. For some patients, remembering the user name or password may be difficult and, if the patient does not have access to the information, the login requirement may prevent access to the system entirely. Even in cases where the patient knows (or has access to) the user name and password, entering the log-in information may be an impediment, especially for users attempting to order refills through a mobile device, many of which have input mechanisms that are difficult or, at least, inconvenient to use. Further, to order refills of prescriptions related to multiple patients, the systems often require a customer to have access to multiple profiles, require the customer to contact the pharmacy by alternate means, or to log into multiple profiles using an associated user name and password for each.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate various aspects of an exemplary architecture implementing an express refill system <b>100</b>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a block diagram of the exemplary express refill system <b>100</b>. The high-level architecture includes both hardware and software applications, as well as various data communications channels for communicating data between the various hardware and software components. The express refill system <b>100</b> may be roughly divided into front-end components <b>102</b> and back-end components <b>104</b>. The front-end components <b>102</b> are primarily disposed within a retail network <b>110</b> including one or more pharmacies <b>112</b>. The pharmacies <b>112</b> may be located, by way of example rather than limitation, in separate geographic locations from each other, including different areas of the same city, different cities, or even different states. The front-end components <b>102</b> comprise a number of pharmacy workstations <b>128</b>. The pharmacy workstations <b>128</b> are local computers located in the various pharmacies <b>112</b> throughout the retail network <b>110</b> and executing various pharmacy management-related applications. Pharmacists, technicians, and other pharmacy personnel, referred to collectively herein simply as &#x201c;pharmacists&#x201d; (not shown), use the pharmacy workstations <b>128</b> to access customer information, enter new prescriptions, access insurance and payment information and so forth. Each of the pharmacies <b>112</b> may be, for example, an in-store retail pharmacy, an on-line pharmacy, a mail-order pharmacy, a long-term care pharmacy, a workplace/on-site pharmacy, or a specialty pharmacy. Retail network <b>110</b> may also include one or more warehouses or central-filling facilities <b>118</b>. The warehouses or central-filling facilities <b>118</b> may distribute medications to the various retail pharmacies <b>112</b> in the retail network <b>110</b>, or may distribute medications directly to customers. Web-enabled devices <b>114</b> (e.g., personal computers, cellular phones, smart phones, web-enabled televisions, etc.) may be communicatively connected to pharmacies <b>112</b> and the system <b>140</b> through a digital network <b>130</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Returning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the front-end components <b>102</b> could also comprise a plurality of facility servers <b>126</b> disposed at the plurality of pharmacies <b>112</b> instead of, or in addition to, a plurality of pharmacy workstations <b>128</b>. Each of the pharmacies <b>112</b> may include one or more facility servers <b>126</b> that may facilitate communications between the web-enabled devices <b>114</b> and the back-end components <b>104</b> via a digital network <b>130</b>, described below, and between the terminals <b>128</b>, <b>128</b>A of the pharmacies <b>112</b> via the digital network <b>129</b>, and may store information for a plurality of customers/employees/accounts/etc. associated with each facility. Of course, a local digital network <b>184</b> may also operatively connect each of the workstations <b>128</b> to the facility server <b>126</b>. Unless otherwise indicated, any discussion of the workstations <b>128</b> also refers to the facility servers <b>126</b>, and vice versa. Moreover, environments other than the pharmacies <b>112</b>, such as the kiosks, call centers, and Internet interface terminals may employ the workstations <b>128</b>, the web-enabled devices <b>114</b>, and the servers <b>126</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmacy&#x201d; refers to any of these points of contact (e.g., call centers, kiosks, Internet interface terminals, etc.) in addition to the retail pharmacies <b>112</b>, etc. described above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The front-end components <b>102</b> communicate with the back-end components <b>104</b> via the digital network <b>130</b>. One or more of the front-end components <b>102</b> may be excluded from communication with the back-end components <b>104</b> by configuration or by limiting access due to security concerns. For example, the web enabled devices <b>114</b> may be excluded from direct access to the back-end components <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the pharmacies <b>112</b> may communicate with the back-end components via the digital network <b>130</b>. In other embodiments, the pharmacies <b>112</b> and web-enabled devices <b>114</b> may communicate with the back-end components <b>104</b> via the same digital network <b>130</b>, but digital access rights, IP masking, and other network configurations may deny access of the web-enabled devices <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The digital network <b>130</b> may be a proprietary network, a secure public Internet, a virtual private network or some other type of network, such as dedicated access lines, plain ordinary telephone lines, satellite links, combinations of these, etc. Where the digital network <b>130</b> comprises the Internet, data communication may take place over the digital network <b>130</b> via an Internet communication protocol. In addition to one or more web servers <b>202</b> (described below), the back-end components <b>104</b> include a central processing system <b>140</b> within a central processing facility, such as, for example, the central processing facility described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/271,686 entitled &#x201c;DISTRIBUTED PHARMACY PRESCRIPTION PROCESSING SYSTEM&#x201d; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Of course, the pharmacies <b>112</b> may be communicatively connected to different back-end components <b>104</b> having one or more functions or capabilities that are similar to the central processing system <b>140</b> (e.g., a processing system <b>141</b>, <b>142</b>). The central processing system <b>140</b> may include one or more computer processors <b>162</b> adapted and configured to execute various software applications and components of the express refill system <b>100</b>, in addition to other software applications, such as a medication management system. The central processing system <b>140</b> further includes a database <b>146</b>. The database <b>146</b> is adapted to store data related to the operation of the express refill system <b>100</b> (e.g., patient profile data including diagnoses, past healthcare product and medication purchases, prescription histories, etc.) The central processing system <b>140</b> may access data stored in the database <b>146</b> when executing various functions and tasks associated with the operation of the express refill system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although the express refill system <b>100</b> is shown to include a central processing system <b>140</b> in communication with three pharmacies <b>112</b>, and various web-enabled devices <b>114</b> it should be understood that different numbers of processing systems, pharmacies, and devices may be utilized. For example, the digital network <b>130</b> (or other digital networks, not shown) may interconnect the system <b>100</b> to a plurality of included central processing systems <b>140</b>, hundreds of pharmacies <b>112</b>, and thousands of web-enabled devices <b>114</b>. According to the disclosed example, this configuration may provide several advantages, such as, for example, enabling near real-time uploads and downloads of information as well as periodic uploads and downloads of information. This provides for a primary backup of all the information generated in the express refill process. Alternatively, some of the pharmacies <b>112</b> may store data locally on the facility server <b>126</b> and/or the workstations <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> also depicts one possible embodiment of the central processing system <b>140</b>. The central processing system <b>140</b> may have a controller <b>155</b> operatively connected to the database <b>146</b> via a link <b>156</b> connected to an input/output (I/O) circuit <b>166</b>. It should be noted that, while not shown, additional databases may be linked to the controller <b>155</b> in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The controller <b>155</b> includes a program memory <b>160</b>, the processor <b>162</b> (may be called a microcontroller or a microprocessor), a random-access memory (RAM) <b>164</b>, and the input/output (I/O) circuit <b>166</b>, all of which are interconnected via an address/data bus <b>165</b>. It should be appreciated that although only one microprocessor <b>162</b> is shown, the controller <b>155</b> may include multiple microprocessors <b>162</b>. Similarly, the memory of the controller <b>155</b> may include multiple RAMs <b>164</b> and multiple program memories <b>160</b>. Although the I/O circuit <b>166</b> is shown as a single block, it should be appreciated that the I/O circuit <b>166</b> may include a number of different types of I/O circuits. The RAM(s) <b>164</b> and the program memories <b>160</b> may be implemented as semiconductor memories, magnetically readable memories, and/or optically readable memories, for example. A link <b>135</b> may operatively connect the controller <b>155</b> to the digital network <b>130</b> through the I/O circuit <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> depicts one possible embodiment of the front-end components <b>102</b> located in one or more of the pharmacies <b>112</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Although the following description addresses the design of the pharmacies <b>112</b>, it should be understood that the design of one or more of the pharmacies <b>112</b> may be different from the design of others of the pharmacies <b>112</b>. Also, each of the pharmacies <b>112</b> may have various different structures and methods of operation. It should also be understood that while the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates some of the components and data connections that may be present in a pharmacy <b>112</b>, it does not illustrate all of the data connections that may be present in a pharmacy <b>112</b>. For exemplary purposes, one design of a pharmacy is described below, but it should be understood that numerous other designs may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each of the pharmacies <b>112</b> has one or more pharmacy workstations <b>128</b> and/or a facility server <b>126</b>. The digital network <b>184</b> operatively connects the facility server <b>126</b> to the plurality of workstations <b>128</b> and/or to the web-enabled devices <b>114</b>. The digital network <b>184</b> may be a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), or any other type of digital network readily known to those persons skilled in the art. The digital network <b>130</b> may operatively connect the facility server <b>126</b>, the workstations <b>128</b>, and/or the web-enabled devices <b>114</b> to the central processing system <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Each workstation <b>128</b>, client device terminal <b>128</b>A, or facility server <b>126</b> includes a controller <b>170</b>. Similar to the controller <b>155</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the controller <b>170</b> includes a program memory <b>172</b>, a microcontroller or a microprocessor (MP) <b>174</b>, a random-access memory (RAM) <b>176</b>, and an input/output (I/O) circuit <b>180</b>, all of which are interconnected via an address/data bus <b>178</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>170</b> may also include, or otherwise be communicatively connected to, a database <b>182</b>. The database <b>182</b> (and/or the database <b>146</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) includes data such as customer records, insurer information records, and other rules and miscellaneous information. As discussed with reference to the controller <b>155</b>, it should be appreciated that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> depicts only one microprocessor <b>174</b>, the controller <b>170</b> may include multiple microprocessors <b>174</b>. Similarly, the memory of the controller <b>170</b> may include multiple RAMs <b>176</b> and multiple program memories <b>172</b>. Although the FIG. depicts the I/O circuit <b>180</b> as a single block, the I/O circuit <b>180</b> may include a number of different types of I/O circuits. The controller <b>170</b> may implement the RAM(s) <b>176</b> and the program memories <b>172</b> as semiconductor memories, magnetically readable memories, and/or optically readable memories, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Either or both of the program memories <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A) and 172</figref> may also contain machine-readable instructions (i.e., software) <b>171</b>, for execution within the processors <b>162</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A) and 174</figref>, respectively. The software <b>171</b> may perform the various tasks associated with operation of the pharmacy or pharmacies, and may be a single module <b>171</b> or a plurality of modules <b>171</b>A, <b>171</b>B. While the software <b>171</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> as including two modules, <b>171</b>A and <b>171</b>B, the software <b>171</b> may include any number of modules accomplishing tasks related to pharmacy operation including, for example, receiving prescription orders, managing prescription workflow, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition to the controller <b>170</b>, the workstations <b>128</b> and the web-enabled devices <b>114</b> may further include a display <b>186</b> and a keyboard <b>190</b> as well as a variety of other input/output devices (not shown) such as a scanner, printer, mouse, touch screen, track pad, track ball, isopoint, voice recognition system, digital camera, bar code scanner, RFID reader, etc. A pharmacy employee may sign on and occupy each workstation <b>128</b> or client device terminal <b>128</b>A to assist the pharmacy employee in performing his or her duties. Pharmacy employees may sign onto the workstation <b>128</b> or the client device terminal <b>128</b>A using any available technique, such as entering a user name and password. If a pharmacy employee signs on to the system using a client device terminal <b>128</b>A, the network <b>184</b> communicates this information to the facility server <b>126</b>, so that the controller <b>170</b> may identify which pharmacy employees are signed onto the system <b>100</b> and which workstation <b>128</b> or client device terminal <b>128</b>A the employee is signed onto. This may be useful for record keeping and/or monitoring the pharmacy employees' productivity as well as in record-keeping or routing prescription transfers to pharmacists who are authorized to accept controlled prescriptions, or other transfer tasks requiring various levels of authority or access corresponding to a login identification or other information.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Various software applications resident in the front-end components <b>102</b> and the back-end components <b>104</b> implement functions related to pharmacy operation, and provide various user interface means to allow users (i.e., pharmacists and/or customers) to access the system <b>100</b>. One or more of the front-end components <b>102</b> and/or the back-end components <b>104</b> may include a user-interface application <b>111</b> for allowing a user, such as the patient, the pharmacist, or a customer service representative, to input and view data associated with the system <b>100</b>, and to interact with the express refill system described below. In one embodiment, the user interface application <b>111</b> is a web browser client, and the facility server <b>126</b> or the central processing system <b>140</b> implements a server application <b>113</b> for providing data to the user interface application <b>111</b>. However, the user interface application <b>111</b> may be any type of interface, including a proprietary interface, and may communicate with the facility server <b>126</b> or the central processing system <b>140</b> using any type of protocol including, but not limited to, file transfer protocol (FTP), telnet, hypertext-transfer protocol (HTTP), etc. Moreover, some embodiments may include the user interface application <b>111</b> running on one of the web-enabled devices <b>114</b> (as when a patient is accessing the system), while other embodiments may include the application <b>111</b> running on one of the workstations <b>128</b> in a pharmacy <b>112</b>. The information sent to the workstations <b>128</b> and to the web-enabled devices <b>114</b> from the facility server <b>126</b> and/or the central processing system <b>140</b> includes data retrieved from the database <b>146</b> and/or the database <b>182</b>. The central processing system <b>140</b> and/or the facility server <b>126</b> may implement any known protocol compatible with the user-interface application <b>111</b> running on the workstations <b>128</b> and the web-enabled devices <b>114</b> and adapted to the purpose of receiving and providing the necessary patient/customer information during the express refill process.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For purposes of implementing the express refill system <b>100</b>, the customer interacts with pharmacy systems (e.g., the central processing system <b>140</b>) via a plurality of web pages. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts a web server <b>202</b> connected via the network <b>130</b> to a plurality of web-enabled devices through which a user <b>204</b> may initiate and interact with the express refill system <b>100</b>. The web enabled devices may include, by way of example, a smart-phone <b>206</b>, a web-enabled cell phone <b>208</b>, a tablet computer <b>210</b>, a personal digital assistant (PDA) <b>212</b>, a laptop computer <b>214</b>, a desktop computer <b>216</b>, a portable media player (not shown), etc. Of course, any web-enabled device appropriately configured may interact with the express refill system <b>100</b>. The web-enabled devices <b>206</b>-<b>216</b> need not necessarily communicate with the network <b>130</b> via a wired connection. In some instances, the web enabled devices <b>206</b>-<b>216</b> may communicate with the network <b>130</b> via wireless signals <b>220</b> and, in some instances, may communicate with the network <b>130</b> via an intervening wireless or wired device <b>118</b>, which may be a wireless router, a wireless repeater, a base transceiver station of a mobile telephony provider, etc. Each of the web-enabled devices <b>206</b>-<b>216</b> may interact with the web server <b>202</b> to receive web pages, such as the web page <b>222</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, for display on a display associated with the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>. It will be appreciated that although only one web server <b>202</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, multiple web servers <b>202</b> may be provided for the purpose of distributing server load, serving different web pages, implementing different portions of the pharmacy web interface, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the web server <b>202</b>, like the facility server <b>126</b>, includes a controller <b>234</b>. Similar to the controllers <b>155</b> and <b>170</b>, the controller <b>234</b> includes a program memory <b>226</b>, a microcontroller or a microprocessor (MP) <b>228</b>, a random-access memory (RAM) <b>230</b>, and an input/output (I/O) circuit <b>234</b>, all of which are interconnected via an address/data bus <b>232</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>234</b> may also include, or otherwise be communicatively connected to, a database <b>240</b> or other data storage mechanism (e.g., one or more hard disk drives, optical storage drives, solid state storage devices, etc.). The database <b>240</b> may include data such as customer web profiles, product data, web page templates and/or web pages, and other data necessary to interact with the user <b>204</b> through the network <b>130</b>. As discussed with reference to the controllers <b>155</b> and <b>170</b>, it should be appreciated that although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> depicts only one microprocessor <b>228</b>, the controller <b>224</b> may include multiple microprocessors <b>228</b>. Similarly, the memory of the controller <b>224</b> may include multiple RAMs <b>230</b> and multiple program memories <b>226</b>. Although the FIG. depicts the I/O circuit <b>234</b> as a single block, the I/O circuit <b>234</b> may include a number of different types of I/O circuits. The controller <b>224</b> may implement the RAM(s) <b>230</b> and the program memories <b>226</b> as semiconductor memories, magnetically readable memories, and/or optically readable memories, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition to being connected through the network <b>130</b> to the user devices <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> illustrates that the web server <b>202</b> may also be connected through the network <b>130</b> to the central processing system <b>140</b> and/or one or more facility servers <b>126</b>. As described below, connection to the central processing system <b>140</b> and/or to the one or more facility servers <b>126</b> facilitates both the express refill ordering process and the subsequent process of forwarding the order so that it can be filled for pickup by the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The program memory <b>226</b> and/or the RAM <b>230</b> may store various applications for execution by the microprocessor <b>228</b>. For example, an application <b>236</b> may provide a user interface to the server, which user interface may, for example, allow a network administrator to configure, troubleshoot, or test various aspects of the server's operation, or otherwise to access information thereon. A server application <b>238</b> operates to populate and transmit web pages to the web-enabled devices <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, receive information from the user <b>204</b> transmitted back to the server <b>202</b>, and forward appropriate data to the central processing system <b>140</b> and the facility servers <b>126</b>, as described below. Like the software <b>171</b>, the server application <b>238</b> may be a single module <b>238</b> or a plurality of modules <b>238</b>A, <b>238</b>B. While the server application <b>238</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> as including two modules, <b>238</b>A and <b>238</b>B, the server application <b>238</b> may include any number of modules accomplishing tasks related to implantation of the web server <b>202</b>. By way of example, the module <b>238</b>A may populate and transmit the web pages and/or may receive and evaluate inputs from the user <b>204</b> to receive an express refill order, while the module <b>238</b>B may communicate with one or more of the back end components <b>104</b> to fulfill the express refill order.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Typically, a patient or customer may launch or instantiate a user interface application (e.g., a web browser or other client application) from a web-enabled device, such as the web-enabled devices <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, to access the web server <b>202</b> cooperating with the system <b>140</b> to implement the express refill system <b>100</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;customer&#x201d; may be, by way of example, a patient (i.e., the person named on the prescription), a guardian (e.g., the parent of a child named on the prescription), a care-giver (i.e., anyone who takes care of a patient or picks up the medication on the patient's behalf), etc. Moreover, the term &#x201c;customer&#x201d; is not limited to a single person, but may instead be any person or persons having a reason or desire to refill one or more prescriptions, whether the prescriptions are related to a single patient or multiple patients. For example, a customer could be a caregiver responsible for patients with a specific disease that progresses in a known manner. The caregiver customer might greatly benefit from gaining information related to various medications and health products to assist in his or her caregiver responsibilities. In any event, while the term &#x201c;customer&#x201d; is used interchangeably with the term &#x201c;patient,&#x201d; in this specification the term &#x201c;customer&#x201d; is used primarily so as to avoid confusion. Generally, the term &#x201c;user&#x201d; is used when referring to a person who is operating one of the web-enabled devices <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, as mentioned above, the pharmacy <b>112</b> may be any of the channels through which the entity implementing the express refill system <b>100</b> serves its pharmacy customers. Thus, the pharmacy <b>112</b> may be a retail pharmacy <b>112</b> in the customer's neighborhood (or any other drug store in a drug store chain), an on-line pharmacy or an on-line interface to a pharmacy <b>112</b> or to a retail network <b>110</b> (where the customer uses a web-browser to communicate with the server application <b>238</b>, a phone/touch-tone interface to a pharmacy <b>112</b> or to a retail network <b>110</b> (where the customer uses a phone service to communicate with the server application <b>238</b>), a mail-order pharmacy, a central-filling facility, a specialty pharmacy, or any other type of pharmacy affiliated with the entity implementing the express refill system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, a pharmacist, other pharmacy staff, or a customer service representative (all referred to herein simply as &#x201c;the pharmacist&#x201d;) invokes the express refill system <b>100</b> while interacting with a customer at a pharmacy <b>112</b> or over the telephone (e.g., from a retail pharmacy <b>112</b>, or a call center). The pharmacist will have access to one of the pharmacy workstations <b>128</b> or to one of the web-enabled devices <b>114</b> and may invoke the express refill system <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, the customer invokes the express refill system <b>100</b> (e.g., at a kiosk, via an Internet interface terminal at the pharmacy, etc.) by accessing the express refill system while physically present in a pharmacy <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, one or both of the databases <b>146</b> and <b>182</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, respectively, include various information about the pharmacy's customers and the prescriptions filled by the pharmacy, as well as various business information including, but not limited to, information associated with third-party payors (e.g., insurance companies), employee information, and the like. Customer records are among the exemplary data that the system <b>100</b> may store on the databases <b>146</b> and <b>182</b>. A customer record contains important information about the customer and the various pharmacy services that have been invoked by, or on behalf of, the customer in a customer profile. The customer profile includes basic biographical information about the customer, such as a customer name, a customer address, a customer phone number, an insurance carrier associated with the customer, an insurance group number for the customer, an insurance ID number for the customer, a customer birth date, a health history or condition, customer purchase history, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The purchase history may include data related to purchases the customer routinely makes or has made at the pharmacies <b>110</b>. For example, a customer may make purchases of several healthcare products such as OTC cold and flu symptom relievers, or may purchase or rent rehabilitative products such as crutches, a cane, a heating pad, bandages, etc. The purchase history data may include any product sold by the pharmacies <b>110</b> and purchased by a customer, whether in person or online. Where purchases are made by the customer in the store, the purchase data made be linked to the customer record though credit card, an in-store savings card, or other type of point-of-sale identification. Where the purchases are made by the customer over the network <b>130</b> or on-line, the purchases may be linked to the customer record through a web-based profile that is accessible by the customer through the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, as herein described.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Additionally, the customer profile may include other information such as credit card information or other payment information, one or more customer e-mail addresses, user name and/or password information, online security question/answer information, etc. Of course, the customer record may also include other, more or less information than that described above.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The customer record also includes prescription data for each prescription filled by the pharmacy for the customer. The prescription data generally include, but are not limited to: a name of the medication; an indication whether a generic may be substituted; a dose (i.e., pills per day) of the medication; a number of days of medication to be dispensed (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;day supply&#x201d; or a &#x201c;prescribed day supply&#x201d;); a number of refills prescribed; a number of refills remaining; a prescription date; a prescribing physician; a phone number for the prescribing physician; a date on which the prescription was most recently adjudicated; a calculated date on which the prescription may next be adjudicated for the prescription; a remaining day supply for the prescription; a percent-consumption period indicating the number of days it would take to consume the required minimum percent-fill consumed of the fill for the prescription); and a prescription number. Of course, the prescription data need not include all of the information above, such as when the system <b>100</b> determines some information (e.g., the next adjudication date) but does not store it, or stores it some place other than with the prescription data in the database <b>146</b> or the database <b>182</b>. Moreover, the prescription data may include additional information not mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, to access the express refill system <b>100</b> the customer <b>204</b> executes a client application on the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b> (e.g., by opening a web browser). Using the client application the user <b>204</b> may request and navigate a series of web pages transmitted, preferably in a secure manner (e.g., using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, known as &#x201c;HTTPS&#x201d;), by the web server <b>202</b> to the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> and <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>F depict web pages that the web server <b>202</b> may transmit in various embodiments of the express refill system <b>100</b>. Some of the web pages share common elements. With reference to a &#x201c;landing&#x201d; web page <b>250</b> (i.e., the web page at which users &#x201c;land&#x201d; when they enter the pharmacy's domain name into their browser) depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref> includes a store logo <b>252</b>, a store locator link <b>254</b>, a log in block <b>256</b>, a navigation banner <b>258</b>, a search bar <b>260</b>, a shopping list link <b>262</b>, and a shopping cart link <b>264</b>. The navigation banner <b>258</b> allows users to navigate to different product areas (e.g., beauty, health &#x26; well being, home medical, etc.) of the virtual store and to access the store's various services (e.g., photo services, pharmacy services, clinic services, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It should be understood that it may be desirable for some or all of the data transmitted from the web server <b>202</b> to the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, or vice versa, to be encrypted and/or otherwise transmitted in a secure manner.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The landing web page <b>250</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes several links related to the store's pharmacy services. In addition to a &#x201c;pharmacy&#x201d; link <b>266</b> in the navigation banner <b>258</b>, the landing web page <b>250</b> also includes an &#x201c;Order Prescriptions&#x201d; area <b>268</b> highlighting and providing direct access to specific pharmacy services. By clicking on one of links <b>270</b>, <b>272</b>, and <b>274</b>, for example, users may access prescription refill services, prescription transfer services, and new prescription services, respectively. In some embodiments, accessing one or more of the refill, transfer, or new prescription services requires the user to register with and/or log into the web site by, for example, clicking on the &#x201c;register&#x201d; link in the log in block <b>256</b> or entering a username and password in the log in block <b>256</b> if the user is already registered.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, the landing web page <b>250</b> also includes an express refill area <b>276</b> that provides one or both of a link <b>278</b> to an express refill web page and an express refill field <b>280</b> that allows a user to enter a prescription number and, by clicking on a &#x201c;refill&#x201d; button <b>282</b>, to place a prescription order through the express refill system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a pharmacy web page <b>290</b> that the web server <b>202</b> may transmit to a web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b> in response to the user <b>204</b> clicking on the pharmacy link <b>266</b>. The pharmacy web page <b>290</b> includes links to pharmacy-related information, such as drug information, drug interactions, and health-related news and products, and to pharmacy services such as ordering prescriptions, viewing prescription records, and various convenience services such as setting up auto refills, electronic mail reminders, and the like. The pharmacy web page <b>290</b> also includes the Order Prescriptions area <b>268</b> and/or the express refill area <b>276</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When a user clicks on the express refill link <b>278</b> illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the web server <b>202</b> receives the request and, in response, transmits an express refill web page <b>300</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The express refill web page <b>300</b> includes a prescription number entry section <b>302</b> providing one or more fields <b>304</b> into which a user may enter prescription numbers for express refill. In the event that the fields <b>304</b> that are initially displayed on the express refill web page <b>300</b> are insufficient for the user, the user <b>204</b> may click an &#x201c;add more prescriptions&#x201d; link <b>306</b> to increase the number of fields <b>304</b> displayed. The number of fields <b>304</b> initially displayed, as well as the number of fields added in response to a user clicking the add more prescriptions link <b>306</b> and the maximum number of prescriptions that a user may enter at one time are selectable at the time that the web page <b>300</b> and the system <b>100</b> are programmed. However, in some embodiments, there are between one and five fields <b>304</b> provided initially, and the link <b>306</b> adds an additional one to five fields <b>304</b>. Depending on the arrangement of the fields <b>304</b>, it may be preferable in some embodiments to select the number of fields <b>304</b> such that all relevant information on the express refill web page <b>300</b> is displayed without requiring the user <b>204</b> to scroll the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, an electronic mail address field <b>308</b> is also provided so that a user may enter an electronic mail address to which notifications regarding the prescriptions may be sent. The electronic mail address field <b>308</b> may be a required field or an optional field, depending on the proprietor's preference. If a user provides an electronic mail address, the express refill system may use the electronic mail address to notify the user that requested prescriptions are ready for pick up, that the pharmacy was unable to refill a prescription, and/or that the order was successfully placed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A button <b>310</b>, which may be labeled &#x201c;continue&#x201d; or &#x201c;submit,&#x201d; for example, transmits the information entered into the fields <b>304</b> and the field <b>308</b> to the web server <b>202</b>. The fields <b>304</b> into which prescription numbers are entered, in many embodiments, may accept prescription numbers related to a single patient or to multiple patients. By way of example, this flexibility allows a caregiver to refill prescriptions for multiple patients in the caregiver's charge or a family member to refill prescriptions for multiple family members.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some instances, a user viewing the web pages <b>250</b> or <b>290</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, respectively, may enter a prescription number into the express refill field <b>280</b> and click on the refill button <b>282</b>, instead of clicking on express refills link <b>278</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts the pharmacy web page <b>290</b> having a prescription number <b>312</b> entered into the express refill field <b>280</b>. In some embodiments in which the user enters a prescription number into the express refill field <b>280</b>, the web server <b>202</b> responds to a click on the refill button <b>282</b> in the same manner in which it would respond to a click on the continue button <b>310</b> on the express refill web page <b>300</b> (i.e., by proceeding with the express refill order, as described below). In other embodiments, however, the web server <b>202</b> responds to a click on the refill button <b>282</b> by transmitting the express refill web page <b>300</b> to the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, and automatically entering the prescription number <b>312</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) into one of the fields <b>304</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In any event, when the web server <b>202</b> receives the prescription numbers <b>312</b> entered by the user into the field or fields <b>304</b>, the web server may issue a query to a database having a plurality of records corresponding to prescription numbers. The query may, in various implementations, be directed to the database <b>146</b>, the database <b>182</b>, or the database <b>240</b>. In response to the query, the database may return results providing to the web server <b>202</b> information regarding whether each received prescription number is valid, the patient associated with the prescription, whether the prescription associated with each of the received prescription numbers has remaining refills, the store at which the prescription was last filled, the medication name, the medication strength, the drug quantity and/or day supply, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the web server <b>202</b>, after receiving a query response from the database may transmit an order review web page <b>320</b> to the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>. The order review web page <b>320</b> includes a prescription information area <b>322</b> listing, for each prescription number received, the prescription number <b>324</b> and may also include information about the corresponding prescription medication such as the quantity, the medication name, the medication strength, the patient name, and the date on which the prescription was last filled. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the prescription information area <b>322</b> includes the prescription number <b>324</b> and the corresponding drug name and strength <b>326</b>. To protect patient privacy, some or all of certain fields may be masked. For example, the drug name and strength <b>326</b> may be masked but for a numerical portion of medication strength (i.e., &#x201c;500&#x201d;), as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, or a patient name (e.g., &#x201c;Joe Smith&#x201d;) may be masked but for one or two characters (e.g., Jxx Sxxxx). A &#x201c;remove&#x201d; link <b>328</b> next to each received prescription number <b>324</b> may allow the user to remove the prescription from the list of prescriptions requested for express refill.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The order review web page <b>320</b> may also include a pick up details area <b>330</b> that displays a pick up time <b>332</b> and a pickup store <b>334</b>. A link <b>336</b> may allow the user to request additional details about the store, such as directions to the store, a map of the store location, store hours, store services, etc. Links <b>338</b> and <b>340</b>, respectively, may allow the user to view a web page or a pop-up window (not shown) for changing the pickup time <b>332</b> and/or the pickup store <b>334</b>. A submit button <b>342</b> allows the customer to finalize the order.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The express refill system <b>100</b> may determine the pickup store by any of several methods. Where the user submits only a single prescription number to the express refill system <b>100</b>, the pickup store <b>334</b> may default to the store at which that prescription was last filled. The store at which the prescription was last filled may be determinable from the prescription number itself, for example, where some portion of the prescription specifies the store number. In the depicted embodiments, the prescription number (e.g., the store numbers <b>312</b>, <b>324</b>) specifies the store number <b>334</b> as the last 5 digits of the prescription number (i.e., &#x201c;XXXXXXX-12345&#x201d;) or by a portion of the prescription number that falls after a delimiter (e.g., the portion after &#x201c;-&#x201d;). However, in other embodiments, the store number is determined according to information about the prescription number that is stored in one of the databases <b>146</b>, <b>182</b>, or <b>240</b>. In the latter embodiments, the pickup store <b>334</b> may alternatively default to the last store at which any prescription associated with the patient was last filled. That is, the express refill system <b>100</b> could determine the patient associated with the received prescription number, and find the last store at which the patient picked up any of his medications.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In any event, in embodiments in which a user may submit multiple prescription numbers at a time, the possibility exists that two or more of the prescriptions may have been filled most recently at different stores. In these instances, the pickup store <b>334</b> may similarly default to the store at which the most recently filled of the associated prescriptions was filled or the pickup store <b>334</b> may default to the store at which the most recently filled prescription associated with the patient or patients was filled. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the two or more stores associated with the prescription numbers received by the express refill system <b>100</b> may be displayed to the user and the user asked to specify a pickup store <b>334</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an exemplary store selection web page <b>350</b>. The store selection web page <b>350</b> displays two or more store areas <b>352</b>, each of which may display information about the store such as a store number, a store address, a store phone number, cross streets for the store, store hours, pharmacy hours, etc. Each store area <b>352</b> may have a button <b>354</b>, labeled &#x201c;choose this store,&#x201d; for example, by which the user may select a store at which to pick up the multiple prescriptions associated with the prescription numbers the user submitted. The store selection web page <b>350</b> may also include a link <b>356</b> to allow the user to find another store at which to pick up the multiple prescriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Once a user has reviewed the order review web page <b>320</b> and is satisfied with the selected prescription numbers, the pickup time <b>332</b>, and the pickup store <b>334</b>, the user may click on the submit button <b>342</b>. Upon receiving an indication that the user has clicked on the submit button <b>342</b>, the web server <b>202</b> transmits an order summary web page, such as the exemplary order summary web page <b>360</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Like the order review web page <b>320</b>, the order summary web page <b>360</b> includes a prescription information area <b>362</b> and a pickup details area <b>364</b>. A button <b>366</b> may allow the user to print the order summary web page <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts an overview <b>370</b> of an express refill method performed by the express refill system <b>100</b>. Generally speaking, the express refill method begins by transmitting (from the web server <b>202</b>) a web page (e.g., web pages <b>250</b>, <b>290</b>, <b>300</b>) including at least one prescription number entry field (e.g., the fields <b>280</b>, <b>304</b>) (block <b>372</b>). After a user enters one or more prescription numbers (e.g., the prescription number <b>312</b>) into the prescription number entry field(s), and clicks on a button (e.g., buttons <b>282</b>, <b>310</b>) to submit the one or more prescription numbers, the express refill system <b>100</b> and, in particular, the web server <b>202</b>, receives the prescription numbers (block <b>374</b>). In some embodiments, the express refill system <b>100</b> validates the prescription numbers received (step <b>376</b>), as described in more detail below. Thereafter, the express refill system <b>100</b> determines a refill retail location (i.e., a pickup store) (block <b>378</b>). The web server <b>202</b> then transmits an order review web page (e.g., the web page <b>320</b>) (block <b>380</b>) and waits until it receives an indication that the customer has confirmed the order (block <b>382</b>). Having received the order confirmation, the web server <b>202</b> may transmit an order summary web page (e.g., the web page <b>350</b>) (block <b>384</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The method <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> provides additional detail about the method executed by the express refill system <b>100</b>. In one of the various manners described above, a customer may enter the express refill system <b>100</b> by, for example, entering the pharmacy domain name into a web browser and clicking on the express refills link <b>278</b> on the landing web page <b>250</b>. Of course, the user could alternatively enter the express refill system <b>100</b> by navigating from the landing web page <b>250</b> to the pharmacy web page <b>290</b> (e.g., by clicking on the pharmacy link <b>266</b>), and then clicking on the express refills link <b>278</b> on the pharmacy web page <b>290</b>, or by entering a prescription number <b>312</b> into the express refill field <b>280</b> on either the landing web page <b>250</b> or the pharmacy web page <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In any event, upon receiving a request for the express refill web page <b>300</b> (block <b>402</b>), the web server <b>202</b> transmits the express refill web page <b>300</b> over the network <b>130</b> for display on the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b> (block <b>404</b>). If the user clicks the &#x201c;add more prescriptions&#x201d; button <b>306</b> (block <b>406</b>), the web server <b>202</b> may retransmit the express refill web page <b>300</b> with additional fields <b>304</b>, and may optionally include any prescription numbers <b>312</b> already entered into the fields <b>304</b>. When the user clicks on the continue button <b>310</b> (presumably after the user is finished entering prescription numbers <b>312</b> into the fields <b>304</b>) the prescription numbers <b>312</b> are transmitted to the web server <b>202</b>. If the user has entered an electronic mail address into the field <b>308</b>, the electronic mail address is also captured and transmitted to the web server <b>202</b>. Of course, because some embodiments of the express refill system <b>100</b> do not require the user to log into the system, the electronic mail address may be stored with the order so that the user can be notified when the order is ready.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Having received the prescription numbers <b>312</b> and, optionally, the electronic mail address (block <b>410</b>), the web server <b>202</b> may proceed to validate the received prescription numbers <b>312</b> and electronic mail address (block <b>412</b>). Validation of the prescription numbers <b>312</b> may include one process or multiple steps. In various embodiments, the web server <b>202</b> may check the length of each prescription number <b>312</b> (e.g., to determine whether it is the right length), determine whether the prescription number <b>312</b> includes any unacceptable characters (e.g., special characters, non-numeric characters, etc.), determine whether each prescription number <b>312</b> includes a delimiter (e.g., a hyphen or a space), and/or determine whether the prescription number <b>312</b> indicates a pickup store <b>334</b> and, if so, if the indicated pickup store <b>334</b> is valid. Whether an indicated pickup store is valid may be based on the type of store indicated in some embodiments (e.g., in some instances mail order stores may not be valid) or whether the prescription in question has been previously filled at the indicated store. Of course, while some embodiments may validate the received prescription numbers <b>312</b> in each of these manners, other embodiments may skip the validation step entirely, may perform validation later in the express refill process, or validate the prescription numbers <b>312</b> according to some combination of these manners. While the validation process is described as performed by the web server <b>202</b>, it should be understood that one or more portions of the validation process may occur in the web-enabled user device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, such as when computer-executable instructions (e.g, JAVA, JAVAscript, etc.) are transmitted as part of the web page <b>300</b>. Further, in some embodiments, the web server <b>202</b> (or the computer-executable instructions transmitted as part of the web page <b>300</b>) may perform validation on an electronic mail address if the user enters an electronic mail address into the field <b>308</b> (e.g., to verify that it includes at least &#x2018;@&#x2019; and &#x2018;.&#x2019; characters.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Validation of the received prescription numbers <b>312</b> (block <b>412</b>) may also include validating each prescription number <b>312</b> against a database of prescription numbers (e.g., in one of the databases <b>146</b>, <b>182</b>, or <b>240</b>). If the express refill system <b>100</b> determines that one or more of the received prescription numbers <b>312</b> are invalid (block <b>414</b>) (e.g., wrong format, not enough characters, invalid prescription number, etc.), the web server <b>202</b> may retransmit the express refill web page <b>300</b> with an error message included (block <b>416</b>), and the web server <b>202</b> may again wait to receive prescription numbers (block <b>410</b>). If, instead, the system <b>100</b> determines that all of the received prescription numbers <b>312</b> are valid, the system <b>100</b> proceeds to determine whether the received prescription numbers <b>312</b> indicate (or are associated with) multiple stores (block <b>418</b>). Of course, if the web server <b>202</b> receives only one prescription number, only one store will be indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">If, on the other hand, the web server <b>202</b> received multiple prescription numbers <b>312</b> from the user, and if the multiple prescription numbers <b>312</b> indicate (or are associated with) multiple stores, the web server <b>202</b> may transmit a store selection web page (e.g., the web page <b>350</b>) or, in some embodiments, may assume or default to one of the indicated (or associated) stores, or even a different store, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">If the web server <b>202</b> transmits the store selection web page <b>350</b> (block <b>420</b>), the next input the web server <b>202</b> receives from the user may be an indication that the user clicked on the &#x201c;find another store&#x201d; link <b>356</b> (block <b>422</b>), in response to which the web server <b>202</b> may transmit a &#x201c;find a store&#x201d; web page (block <b>424</b>), allowing the user to input an address or zip code and to find stores in a given vicinity. Alternatively, if the user clicks on one of the &#x201c;choose this store&#x201d; links <b>354</b>, the web server <b>202</b> may receive a pickup store selection (block <b>426</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Upon receiving the pickup store selection (block <b>426</b>) or determining that only a single store was indicated (block <b>418</b>), the web server <b>202</b> may, in some embodiments, contact a server at the selected store (e.g., the facility server <b>126</b>) to verify that the store can refill the prescription (block <b>427</b>), considering current inventory, regulatory issues, pharmacy load, and/or any other factor that could prevent the prescription from being filled at that location. Of course, if the selected store cannot fill the prescription, the web server <b>202</b> may transmit an error message to that effect and may return the user to the find store web page. Otherwise, the web server <b>202</b> may transmit an order review web page (block <b>428</b>), such as the order review web page <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described above, the order review web page <b>320</b> may include links including a change store link <b>340</b>, a change pickup time link <b>338</b>, and a submit button <b>342</b>. The web server <b>202</b> will respond according to the inputs received from the user. For example, if the user clicks on the &#x201c;change store&#x201d; link <b>340</b> (block <b>430</b>), the web server <b>202</b> may transmit the &#x201c;find a store&#x201d; web page (block <b>424</b>). Alternatively, if the user clicks on the &#x201c;change pickup time&#x201d; link <b>338</b> (block <b>432</b>), the web server <b>202</b> may transmit a pickup time selection web page (block <b>434</b>) and, in response to which the user may select a new pickup time (block <b>436</b>). In any event, if the user opts to change the pickup store (block <b>430</b>) or to change the pickup time (block <b>432</b>), the method returns the user to the order review web page <b>320</b> (block <b>428</b>) after the web server <b>202</b> receives the corresponding input (i.e., a store selection and/or a pickup time selection) from the user.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Once the user clicks on the submit button <b>342</b> (block <b>438</b>) the web server <b>202</b> may, depending on the particular implementation of the system, perform one or more of several steps. In the implementation depicted by the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the web server <b>202</b>, upon receiving an indication that the user has clicked the submit button <b>342</b> (block <b>438</b>), may create an order for the patient (block <b>440</b>). As described above, in some embodiments, the express refill system <b>100</b> may receive prescription numbers <b>312</b> associated with more than a single patient. For example, a person may submit refills for a spouse and/or children through the express refill system <b>100</b>. In such embodiments, the web server <b>202</b> may create a single order or may create one order for each patient associated with a received prescription. In any event, the web server <b>202</b> may then submit the order or orders (block <b>442</b>) created to the designated pickup store <b>334</b>, to a central database handling prescription processing, to prescription handling routine, to a prescription processing system, or to any routine or system otherwise appropriately routing the prescription orders. The web server <b>202</b> may then transmit an order summary web page for display to the user (block <b>444</b>) such as the order summary web page <b>360</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Of course, various embodiments of the express refill system <b>100</b> may include or omit one or more of the web pages <b>250</b>, <b>290</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>350</b>, and <b>360</b>, according to the specific preferences of the proprietor. Likewise, various elements of the methods <b>370</b> and <b>400</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> may be executed at different times, and some elements may be omitted entirely. Additionally, it should be understood that each of the actions and/or decisions depicted as included in the methods <b>370</b> and <b>400</b> may include a corresponding action in another device. For example, each transmission of information is, presumably, accompanied by a corresponding receipt of that information at another device, and vice versa. It should also be understood that the for each step performed by the web-enabled devices <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, the web server <b>202</b>, or any other device in the express refill system <b>100</b>, (e.g., for any transmission step, receipt step, display step, storage step, decision step, determination step, etc.,) corresponding machine-readable instructions are stored in a memory for execution by a processor to perform the step.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">When the prescription order has been filled, and is ready at the designated pickup store <b>334</b>, the pharmacy (or a system operated by the pharmacy) may transmit a notification to the customer to inform the customer that the prescription order is ready for pickup. The notification may be by telephone, by short message service (SMS), by electronic mail, or by some combination of the above. In instances where the customer provided an electronic mail address in the electronic mail address field <b>308</b>, a notification may be generated and transmitted to the electronic mail address received by the web server <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, a notification may be transmitted for each order. For example, if prescriptions numbers for three patients are received, the system <b>100</b> groups them into three orders and sends three notifications. In instances where the customer did not provide an electronic mail address in the electronic mail address field <b>308</b>, a similar notification or notifications may be transmitted to the electronic mail address (or addresses) associated with patient profiles corresponding to the received prescription numbers <b>312</b>. If the customer did not provide an electronic mail address in the electronic mail address field <b>308</b> and no electronic mail address is associated with a profile corresponding to a particular patient, no notification will be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It should be appreciated that the methods <b>370</b> and <b>400</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, respectively, do not include any mention of the user logging into the system <b>100</b>. In contrast to other prescription services that may be provided by the pharmacy <b>112</b>, such as refilling prescriptions by selecting from a history of prescriptions, or adding or transferring a prescription, the express refill system <b>100</b> does not require access to a user profile and, therefore, the user is freed from the necessity of inputting and submitting a username and password. For users who are not yet registered with the online store, and do not have a user profile, the users are freed from having to complete the registration and profile creation processes prior to refilling one or more prescriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">While the description above relates primarily to embodiments in which the customer will pick up the prescriptions ordered via the express refill system <b>100</b>, other embodiments are contemplated in which the express refill system <b>100</b> may also interoperate with a prescription mail delivery system and/or a prescription mail delivery service, which may be associated with the retail network <b>110</b> or may operate as a separate service. For example a store number embedded in the prescription number or otherwise associated with a prescription number may indicate that the prescription was last filled by mail order, and the express refill system <b>100</b> may treat the prescription accordingly. In some embodiments, the express refill system <b>100</b> may confirm a recipient address instead of a pickup store, and may prevent the customer from changing the pickup address from that currently associated with the prescription. Of course, where multiple prescription numbers <b>312</b> are received and multiple addresses are associated with the prescription numbers, the express refill system <b>100</b> may decline to process the order and instead require the customer to log into the store web site or place the order in person or by phone.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The ease with which a customer can place orders to refill prescriptions through the express refill system <b>100</b> described herein makes it particularly suitable for mobile customers. In fact, the minimal input required by the customer makes the express refill system <b>100</b> extremely versatile. Embodiments of the systems and methods described above are contemplated in which the express refill system <b>100</b> is implemented in a minimalistic interface suited for a web-enabled mobile phone, smart phone, personal digital assistant, etc., or in an application for execution on such a device. For example, an application for a mobile device (e.g., the web-enabled devices <b>206</b>-<b>212</b>) may be developed for a mobile platform such as the Android&#x2122;, Palm&#xae; webOS, or iOS&#xae; mobile technology platforms, developed by Google Inc., Palm, Inc. (now Hewlett-Packard Company), and Apple, respectively. Accordingly, the application may interact with the express refill web server <b>202</b> described above. Additionally or alternatively, the application may interact with a server specially implemented and/or designated to provide the express refill service in cooperation with the application. Moreover, an application designed specifically to interact with the express refill system <b>100</b> may provide the field <b>308</b> for entering an email address (e.g., as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>) or, alternatively, may transmit to the web server <b>202</b> (or other server) a stored email address that the user has associated with the mobile device. As another option, the application could transmit a phone number associated with the device, an application ID specific to the application instance operating on the mobile device, or other data (e.g., an internet protocol (&#x201c;IP&#x201d;) address or a media access control (&#x201c;MAC&#x201d;) address) associated specifically with the mobile device. Accordingly, the express refill system <b>100</b> may send one or more notification messages when the prescription or prescriptions are ready to be picked up. The notification may be transmitted to the email address entered by the user, to the email address transmitted automatically from the mobile device, to the mobile device as a text message, to the application as a notification or message displayed within the application, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12F</figref> depict various displays associated with an embodiment of the express refill system <b>100</b> implemented with a minimalistic interface such as, for example, a mobile-specific web site or a mobile device application. Mobile-specific web sites may used pared-down versions of HTML web pages, or may implement other &#x201c;lightweight&#x201d; web pages written in languages including Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) or Wireless Markup Language (WML). The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12F</figref> include many of the same elements as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> and, just as described above, a customer using the interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12F</figref> can complete an order to refill a prescription with as little as three inputs into two web pages. That is, if the customer navigates directly to a page having a prescription number field the customer may (1) enter a prescription number, (2) click the continue button, and (3) click the submit button after reviewing the order.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In embodiments implementing a mobile device application, the mobile device includes a processor and a memory. The application may be implemented as a series of machine-readable instructions for performing the various tasks associated with receiving information at, displaying information on, and transmitting information from the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>212</b>. Of course, the application itself may, at various times, be stored on the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>212</b>, a server (not shown) from which users download the application to a mobile device, a compact disc, a DVD, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments of the express refill system <b>100</b> implementing the mobile device application on a mobile device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, the mobile device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b> includes an image capture device (not shown). The image capture device may be used by the application to capture an image of a barcode. Throughout this application the use of the word &#x201c;barcode&#x201d; is intended to be generic and inclusive of all types of barcodes. Barcodes could be, for example, the conventional rectangular segment barcodes as well as two dimensional QR codes or matrix barcodes. Most QR codes have black modules arranged in a square pattern on a white background. Smaller versions may be referred to as micro QR codes and design QR codes include a picture or logo to enhance conversion rates. In some embodiments, the mobile device application may interpret the captured barcode image to generate prescription data (such as a prescription number) and transmit the prescription data to the server <b>202</b>. In other embodiments, the mobile device application may transmit the barcode image to the server <b>202</b>, which may interpret the barcode image to obtain prescription data. In still other embodiments, the mobile device application may transmit the barcode image to a third-party server (not shown) which may interpret the barcode image to obtain prescription data and transmit the obtained prescription data to the server <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts an exemplary process flow <b>370</b> of an implementation of a mobile device application implementing the express refill system <b>100</b>. A user <b>372</b> executes the application on the mobile device <b>374</b> to display a home screen of the application. The user selects to refill a prescription and the application displays a prescription scanning screen and activates an image capture device (i.e., a camera). The user <b>372</b> scans a barcode (<b>376</b>) to determine the prescription number by aligning the camera with a barcode on a receipt or container associated with a previously filled prescription, so that the barcode appears in an area of the screen. The mobile device application, in some embodiments, may automatically recognize that a barcode is present in the view of the image capture device, and may act automatically to capture and/or interpret the barcode. In other embodiments, the mobile device may require the user <b>372</b> to cause the image capture device to capture an image, before the mobile application interprets or otherwise uses the barcode image.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In any event, assuming that the barcode is captured successfully <b>380</b>, the mobile device application may transmit the prescription number associated with the barcode to a server <b>384</b>. In alternate embodiments, the mobile device application may transmit the captured barcode image to the server <b>384</b> and the server <b>384</b> may interpret the barcode image. In still other embodiments, the mobile device application may transmit the captured barcode image to a third-party server (not shown) and the third party server may interpret the barcode image and transmit a prescription number to the server <b>384</b> or back to the mobile device application for transmission to the server <b>384</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The server <b>384</b> may also retrieve records associated with the prescription number encoded by the barcode, including, by way of example and not limitation, a store at which a prescription associated with the prescription number was last filled, and a default time and date at which the user may pick up the refilled prescription. In the event that the barcode is not scanned successfully or the prescription is invalid or not available using express refill, an appropriate error message <b>382</b> may be displayed to the user <b>372</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Once the server <b>384</b> has determined the necessary information (prescription number, pickup store, default time and date, etc.) associated with the barcode, the mobile device application displays (<b>386</b>) the default pickup store, and the default time and date of pickup, on the device <b>374</b>. The user <b>372</b> may select from a plurality of controls <b>390</b>, including a control <b>390</b>A to edit the store, a control <b>390</b>B to edit the pickup time, and a control <b>390</b>C to edit the pickup date. If the user <b>372</b> selects the edit store control <b>390</b>A, the application may execute a store locator service <b>392</b> which may cooperate with a store location database <b>394</b> to allow the user <b>372</b> to select a pickup store. If the user <b>372</b> accepts (<b>388</b>) the information displayed at <b>386</b> (e.g., by selecting a &#x201c;submit&#x201d; button), the mobile device application displays a confirmation message <b>396</b>, and returns the user to the home screen.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The various screens of the mobile device application, referred to above, are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-K</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> depicts an image capture screen <b>400</b> that may be displayed by the mobile device application. The image capture screen <b>400</b> may include an information button <b>402</b> that causes the mobile device application to display instructions associated with the express refill system <b>100</b>, or causes a web browser of the mobile device to navigate to a web page containing such instructions. A home button <b>404</b> may cause the mobile device application to return to a home screen (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The image capture screen <b>400</b> also includes an image capture area <b>406</b>, which may include an image capture frame indicated by marks <b>407</b> on the display. Aligning the prescription barcode within the marks <b>407</b> indicating the image capture frame may cause the application to capture and/or interpret the barcode. Alternatively, a button (not shown), when activated by a user, may cause the image capture device to capture the barcode image. A button <b>408</b> allows the user to input a prescription number manually, instead of capturing an associated barcode. If the barcode is captured successfully, the mobile device application may display a screen <b>410</b> with a success message <b>412</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Having transmitted the prescription number (or image) to the server, the mobile device application receives information back from the server indicating the default pickup store and default pickup time and date. This information may be displayed by the mobile device application in an order review screen <b>414</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> illustrates, the order review screen <b>414</b> may display the prescription number <b>416</b> and order information <b>418</b>. The order information <b>418</b> may include the pickup store <b>420</b>, the pickup date <b>422</b>, and the pickup time <b>424</b>. Each of the pickup store <b>420</b>, the pickup date <b>422</b>, and the pickup time <b>424</b> may have an associated control <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>, and <b>430</b>, respectively, that allows the user to change the corresponding item, as described below. A cancel button <b>432</b> may allow the user to cancel the process and return to the home screen, while a submit button <b>434</b> allows the user to submit the prescription refill order.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some embodiments, the control <b>426</b> that allows the user to change the selected store may activate&#x2014;or give the user an option to activate&#x2014;a geolocation device (e.g., a global positioning system (GPS) device) in the web-enabled device <b>206</b>-<b>216</b>, particularly if the device is a mobile device (e.g., the devices <b>206</b>-<b>214</b>). The geolocation device may, by itself or cooperating with another application or an online service, provide the mobile device application with an indication of the mobile web-enabled device's current position, which the mobile device application may use to determine the closest store at which the requested prescriptions can be filled.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">If the user activates the submit button <b>434</b>, the mobile device application may display an order confirmation screen <b>436</b>, such as that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>. The order confirmation screen <b>436</b> may include an order confirmation message <b>438</b>. Buttons <b>440</b> and <b>442</b> may, respectively, allow the user to return to the home screen or to scan another barcode. An additional button (not shown) may cause a calendar entry or other reminder to be stored in another application (e.g., a calendar application) on the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref> depicts an error message <b>446</b> that the mobile device application may display on an error screen <b>444</b>. A button <b>447</b> allows a user to dismiss the message.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</figref> depicts a second embodiment of an error message displayed by the mobile device application. Specifically, an error screen <b>448</b> depicts an error message <b>450</b> directing the user to order the requested prescription by phone. A button <b>452</b> may cause the mobile device, if it is a mobile telephone, to dial the number displayed. A button <b>454</b> may allow the user to dismiss the error message.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">If the user activates the control <b>424</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>), the mobile device application may display a screen <b>456</b> to allow the user to select and/or request a new pickup time. The screen <b>456</b> may include a pick list <b>458</b> from which the user may select a time <b>460</b> to pick up the refilled prescription. Of course, other input means may be used, such as numeric entry fields, radio buttons, etc. When the user has made a selection, the user may activate a button <b>462</b> to accept the choice and return to the order review screen <b>414</b>. Alternatively, the user may activate a cancel button <b>464</b> to cancel the request to change the pickup time and return to the order review screen <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Similarly, if the user activates the control <b>422</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>), the mobile device application may display a screen <b>466</b> to allow the user to select and/or request a new pickup date. The screen <b>466</b> may include a pick list <b>468</b> from which the user may select a date <b>470</b> on which to pick up the refilled prescription. Of course, other input means may be used, such as numeric entry fields, radio buttons, etc. When the user has made a selection, the user may activate a button <b>472</b> to accept the choice and return to the order review screen <b>414</b>. Alternatively, the user may activate a cancel button <b>474</b> to cancel the request to change the pickup time and return to the order review screen <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">A screen <b>476</b>, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14I</figref>, may allow a user to manually input a prescription number to submit to the express refill service if the user activates the button <b>408</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. The screen <b>476</b> may include a numeric (or alphanumeric) keypad <b>478</b> to allow the user to enter a prescription number into a prescription number field <b>480</b>. A backspace key <b>482</b> may allow the user to delete one or more improperly entered characters, while a button <b>484</b> may allow the user to submit the entered prescription number.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The mobile device application may display error message screens <b>486</b>, <b>492</b> (depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14J</figref>, <b>14</b>K, respectively) if the user activated the button <b>484</b> while the prescription number field <b>480</b> in empty (i.e., null) (e.g., error message <b>488</b>) or if the prescription number entered by the user in the field <b>480</b> is not a valid prescription number (e.g., error message <b>494</b>). Buttons <b>490</b>, <b>496</b> may allow the user to dismiss the respective error messages and return to the manual entry screen <b>476</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> depicts a method <b>500</b> for implementing the express refill service using a mobile device application. The user executes the application (block <b>502</b>) on the mobile device, causing the mobile device application to display a home screen (block <b>504</b>). From the home screen, the user may select to refill a prescription using the express refill service or, alternatively, the application may assume the express refill functionality as the home screen. In any event, activation of the express refill service triggers the image capture device (block <b>506</b>). The mobile device application may automatically detect the barcode (block <b>508</b>) when the barcode is within the view of the image capture device. The mobile device application thereafter captures and/or interprets the barcode image (block <b>510</b>) and transmits prescription data&#x2014;which may be a prescription number or the barcode image&#x2014;to the server (block <b>512</b>). The server may interpret the prescription data and send a response to the mobile device application (block <b>514</b>). If the response indicates that the prescription data is invalid, the mobile device application may display an error (block <b>518</b>) and return to the home screen (block <b>504</b>). If the prescription data is valid, the mobile device application may display a confirmation message (block <b>520</b>), such as the order review screen <b>414</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>. The user may edit the time and/or date at which the prescription will be ready to be picked up, and/or may edit the location at which the prescription will be refilled (block <b>522</b>). Once the user has done so, or if the user does not do so, the mobile device application receives a &#x201c;submit&#x201d; input (block <b>524</b>), which causes the mobile device application to transmit the &#x201c;submit&#x201d; input to the server (block <b>526</b>). When the refill order has been placed, the mobile device application receives and displays confirmation information from the server (block <b>528</b>), for example, in the screen <b>436</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>. The mobile device application may also store the selected pickup time, date, and location (block <b>530</b>), before returning the user to the home screen (block <b>504</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> depicts a method corresponding to the blocks <b>520</b>-<b>522</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. As described the mobile device application displays the default time, date, and location of pickup (block <b>520</b>). If the user selects to edit the time (block <b>532</b>), the mobile device application displays a pick list of times (block <b>534</b>) and then receives the time selection input from the user (block <b>536</b>) before returning the display to the time, date, and location of pickup (block <b>520</b>) (though no longer the default time). Similarly, if the user selects to edit the date (block <b>538</b>), the mobile device application displays a pick list of dates (block <b>540</b>) and then receives the date selection input from the user (block <b>542</b>) before returning the display to the time, date, and location of pickup (block <b>520</b>). Lastly, if the user selects to edit the pickup store (block <b>544</b>), the mobile device application may transmit a request to a store finder service/routine (block <b>546</b>) which may run on a server. The mobile device application may receive a response from the service/routine (block <b>548</b>). After receiving a pickup location selection input from the user (block <b>550</b>), the mobile device application may return the user to the time, date, and location screen (block <b>520</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">It should be recognized that different mobile devices may implement different mechanisms for user input. In the examples described above, the mobile phone is assumed to have a touch sensitive display screen. Accordingly, &#x201c;buttons&#x201d; which are displayed on the screen and are not physical buttons, are &#x201c;pressed&#x201d; by touching the screen in the area of the button. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that such user interface controls may be accomplished in other manners, such as using soft-keys, navigating controls using navigation buttons on a keyboard or using a roller ball, selecting numbers corresponding to different controls, entering information on a keyboard, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">This detailed description is to be construed as exemplary only and does not describe every possible embodiment, as describing every possible embodiment would be impractical, if not impossible. One could implement numerous alternate embodiments, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing date of this application.</p>
