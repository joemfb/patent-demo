<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a method for reading at least one attribute from an ID token, to a computer program product, to an ID token and to a computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The prior art discloses various methods for managing what is known as the digital identity of a user:</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Microsoft Windows CardSpace is a client-based digital identity system which is intended to allow Internet users to communicate their digital identity to online services. One drawback in this context, inter alia, is that the user can manipulate his digital identity.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">By contrast, OPENID is a server-based system. What is known as an identity server stores a database with the digital identities of the registered users. One drawback of this, inter alia, is inadequate data protection, since the digital identities of the users are stored centrally and the user behavior can be recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">US 2007/0294431 A1 discloses a further method for managing the digital identities which likewise requires user registration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">From the patent application DE 102008000067.1 &#x201c;Method for reading attributes from an ID token&#x201d; of the same applicant which was unpublished at the filing date of this application, a method is known, which allows an ID provider computer system to read one or more attributes from an ID token of a user in order to forward these to a service computer system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">By contrast, the invention is based on the object of providing an improved method for reading at least one attribute, and also an appropriate computer program product, an ID token and a computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The objects on which the invention is based are respectively achieved by means of the features of one or more embodiments disclosed and/or described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to embodiments of the invention a method is provided for reading at least one attribute stored in an ID token, wherein the ID token is associated with a user. The method comprises the following steps: the user is authenticated to the ID token; a first computer system is authenticated to the ID token; following successful authentication of the user and the first computer system to the ID token, the first computer system effects read access to the at least one attribute stored in the ID token in order to transmit the at least one attribute to a second computer system, wherein the authentication of the first computer system to the ID token is performed based on a specification of an attribute, which is received by the first computer system from a third computer system (<b>136</b>). This allows a &#x201c;confidence anchor&#x201d; to be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention allows one or more of the attributes stored in an ID token to be read by the first computer system, wherein the connection between the ID token and the first computer system can be set up via a network, particularly the Internet. The at least one attribute may be an indication of the identity of the user associated with the ID token, particularly of the user's &#x201c;digital identity&#x201d;. By way of example, the first computer system reads the attributes surname, first name, address, in order to forward these attributes to a second computer system, for example an online service.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, by way of example, it is also possible for just a single attribute to be read which is used not to establish the identity of the user but rather, by way of example, to check the authorization of the user to use a particular online service, such as the age of the user where the user wishes to use an online service which is reserved for a particular age group, or another attribute which documents the user's association with a particular group which is authorized to use the online service.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The ID token may be a portable electronic appliance, such as what is known as a USB stick, or may be a document, particularly a value document or security document.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In line with the invention, a &#x201c;document&#x201d; is understood to mean paper-based and/or plastic-based documents, such as identification documents, particularly passports, identification cards, visas and driver's licenses, vehicle registration certificates, vehicle registration documents, corporate identification cards, health cards or other ID documents and also chip cards, payment means, particularly bankers' cards and credit cards, waybills or other credentials, which incorporate a data memory for storing the at least one attribute.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the invention are thus particularly advantageous, since the at least one attribute is read from a particularly trustworthy document, for example an official document. It is also of particular advantage that central storage of the attributes is not necessary. The invention thus allows a particularly high level of trustworthiness for the communication of the attributes associated with a digital identity, accompanied by optimum data protection with extremely convenient handling.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to embodiments of the invention first and second sets of ID provider computer systems are defined, which can be made up in principle in the same way but come with different rights: the first set of the ID provider computer systems is defined as trustworthy for the second computer system but has no rights for reading at least one attribute of the ID token. The second computer system may for example be a service computer system, which serves for providing a service for users.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The second set of ID provider computer systems is defined as trustworthy concerning the ID token and/or the fourth computer system, i.e. the user computer system, which means that it has reading rights for the at least one attribute of the ID token. The so called authentication domain is defined herein by the first and the second set of ID provider computer systems. For example the service computer system and the third computer system belong to the same authentication domain, meanwhile the fourth computer system, i.e. the user computer system and the first computer system belong to another differing authentication domain.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">At least a subset of the second set of ID provider computer systems is defined as trustworthy for at least a subset of the first set of ID provider computer systems, wherein the subsets are not equal to the null set.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Hence, when a specification of an attribute is received by the user computer system from the service computer system, the user computer system forwards the specification of the attribute to an ID provider computer system of the subset of the first set. This ID provider computer system of the subset of the first set forwards the specification of the attribute to an ID provider computer system of the subset of the second set, which is defined as trustworthy by the ID provider computer system of the subset of the first set.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The ID provider computer system of the subset of the second set then reads the at least one attribute from the ID token of the user after a previous authentication. The at least one attribute is sent to the ID provider computer system of the subset of the first set by this ID provider computer system of the subset of the second set, from where the at least one attribute is forwarded to the service computer system. Optionally the at least one attribute of the ID provider computer system of the subset of the first set is forwarded firstly to the user computer system, from where the at least one attribute is then forwarded to the service computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the at least one attribute of the ID provider computer system of the subset of the second set is sent to the ID provider computer system of the subset of the first set in form of a signed message. The ID provider computer system of the subset of the first set is adapted to check the signature. If the signature is valid and identified as an ID provider computer system belonging to the subset of the second set, the ID provider computer system of the subset of the first set signs the at least one attribute on its part and forwards a corresponding message to the service computer system. The service computer system can check the validity of the signature and can trust the authenticity of the at least one attribute, because the signature has been generated by the ID provider computer system of the subset of the first set, which has been defined as trustworthy.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of the invention are especially advantageous, because they allow legally compliant electronic legal relations without changing media beyond frontiers.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of the invention are further especially advantageous, because a registration of the user for using the service computer system of the provided service is not mandatory. Because of the &#x201c;statusless&#x201d; character of the ID confirmation performance performed by the ID provider computer system, i.e. reading the at least one attribute it is not necessary that the user has been previously authenticated by one of the ID provider computer systems. Further it is particularly advantageous that no user-related data is stored in the ID provider computer systems.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one embodiment of the invention, the first computer system has at least one certificate which is used for authenticating the first computer system to the ID token. The certificate contains an indication of those attributes for which the first computer system has read authorization. The ID token uses said certificate to check whether the first computer system has the necessary read authorization for read access to the attribute before such read access can be performed by the first computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one embodiment of the invention, the first computer system sends the at least one attribute read from the ID token directly to a second computer system. By way of example, the second computer system may be a server for providing an online service or another service, such as a banking service, or for ordering a product. By way of example, the user can open an account online, to which end attributes which contain the identity of the user are transmitted from the first computer system to the second computer system of a bank.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to one embodiment of the invention, the attributes read from the ID token are transmitted from the first computer system to a fourth computer system of the user first of all. By way of example, the fourth computer system has an ordinary Internet browser which the user can use to open a web page on the second computer system. The user can input into the web page a request or order for a service or a product.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The second computer system then specifies those attributes, for example of the user or of his ID token, which it requires in order to provide the service or to take the order. The corresponding attribute specification, which contains the specification of these attributes, is then sent from the second computer system to the first computer system. This can be done with or without interposition of the fourth computer system. In the latter case, the user can specify the desired first computer system to the second computer system, for example by inputting the URL of the first computer system into a web page on the second computer system from the fourth computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to one embodiment of the invention, the service request from the user to the second computer system contains the indication of an identifier, wherein the identifier identifies the first computer system. By way of example, the identifier is a link, for example a URL on the first computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to one embodiment of the invention, the attribute specification is sent not directly from the second computer system to the first computer system but rather from the second computer system to the fourth computer system first of all. The fourth computer system has a plurality of predefined configuration data records, wherein the third computer has a plurality of predefined configuration data records, wherein each of the configuration data records specifies a subset of the attributes, at least one data source and a first computer system from a set of first computer systems, wherein the attribute specification is transmitted from the second computer system to the fourth computer system first of all, so that the fourth computer system is used to select at least one of the configuration data records which specifies a subset of the attributes which contains the at least one attribute specified in the attribute specification, and wherein the fourth computer forwards the attribute specification to the first computer system, and the connection to the ID token specified by the indication of the data source in the selected configuration data record is set up.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one embodiment of the invention, the attributes read from the ID token are signed by the first computer system and are then transmitted to the third computer system. The attributes are forwarded then to the fourth computer system. The user of the fourth computer system can thus read the attributes but without being able to alter them. Only after release by the user are the attributes forwarded from the fourth computer system to the second computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to one embodiment of the invention, the user can add further data to the attributes before they are forwarded.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to one embodiment of the invention, the first computer system has a plurality of certificates with different read rights. On the basis of the receipt of the attribute specification, the first computer system selects one or more of these certificates in order to read the relevant attributes from the ID token or a plurality of different ID tokens.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to one embodiment of the invention, the fourth computer system has at least one configuration data record which specifies an external data source for requesting a further attribute from the fourth computer system via the network.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to one embodiment of the invention, the further attribute is requested after the at least one attribute has been read from the ID token, and after the fourth computer system has received the at least one attribute from the first computer system, wherein the request contains the at least one attribute.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a further aspect, the invention relates to a computer program product, particularly a digital storage medium, with executable program instructions for performing a method according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further aspect, the invention relates to an ID token with a protected memory area for storing at least one attribute, with means for authenticating a user, associated with the ID token, to the ID token, means for authenticating a first computer system to the ID token, means for setting up a protected connection to the first computer system which the first computer system can use to read the at least one attribute, wherein a necessary prerequisite for the reading of the at least one attribute from the ID token by the first computer system is the successful authentication of the user and of the first computer system to the ID token.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to embodiments of the invention the second set of ID provider computer systems is defined by the identifier or by the identifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition to the authentication of the first computer system to the ID token, as is known per se as &#x201c;Extended Access Control&#x201d;, for example, for machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) and is specified by the international aviation authority ICAO, the user thus has to authenticate himself to the ID token. By way of example, successful authentication of the user to the ID token unlocks the latter, so that the further steps, namely the authentication of the first computer system to the ID token and/or the setup of a protected connection for reading the attributes, can take place.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to one embodiment of the invention, the ID token has means for end-to-end encryption. This allows the connection between the ID token and the first computer system to be set up via a third computer system of the user, since the user cannot make any changes to the data transmitted via the connection on account of the end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a further aspect, the invention relates to a first computer system with a computer system having means for receiving an attribute specification via a network of a non-authorized computer system (<b>136</b>), wherein the attribute specification specifies at least one attribute, means for authenticating to an ID token, means for reading at least one attribute from the ID token via a protected connection, wherein a prerequisite for the reading of the at least one attribute is that a user associated with the ID token has authenticated himself to the ID token, and means for forwarding the at least one attribute to the non-authorized computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to embodiments of the invention the non-authorized computer system is an ID provider computer system of the first set, in particular the third computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to one embodiment of the invention, the first computer system may contain means for generating a request to the user. When the first computer system has received the attribute specification from the second computer system via the third computer system, for example, it then sends a request to the fourth computer system of the user, so that the user is asked to authenticate himself to the ID token. When the authentication of the user to the ID token has been performed successfully, the first computer system receives confirmation from the fourth computer system. The first computer system then authenticates itself to the ID token and a secure connection is set up between the ID token and the first computer system using end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to one embodiment of the invention, the first computer system has a plurality of certificates which respectively specify different read rights. Following receipt of the attribute specification, the first computer system chooses at least one of said certificates with the read rights which are sufficient for reading the specified attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Embodiments of the first computer system according to the invention are particularly advantageous, since they form a confidence anchor for the unfalsified digital identity of the user in combination with the need for authentication of the user to the ID token. A particular advantage in this context is that this does not require prior registration of the user with the computer system or central storage of the attributes of the users which form the digital identities.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to one embodiment of the invention, the first computer system receives an identifier for the second computer system together with the attribute specification. Using the identifier, the computer system identifies the second computer system, which wishes to use the identification services, in order to charge the second computer system for this service. Alternatively or additionally the first computer system receives together with the specification of the attribute an identifier of the third computer system. Via the identifier the computer system identifies the third computer system, which would like to utilize the identification services for charging these services to the third computer system. The third computer system can further charge these charges to the second computer system, i.e. the provider of the service.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According one embodiment of the invention, the computer system is an officially certified trust center, particularly a trust center which is compliant with the signature act.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ID token <b>106</b> has an electronic memory <b>118</b> with protected memory areas <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>. The protected memory area <b>120</b> is used for storing a reference value which is required for authenticating the user <b>102</b> to the ID token <b>106</b>. Said reference value is an identifier, for example, particularly what is known as a personal identification number (PIN), or is reference data for a biometric feature of the user <b>102</b> which can be used for authenticating the user to the ID token <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The protected area <b>122</b> is used for storing a private key and the protected memory area <b>124</b> is used for storing attributes, for example of the user <b>102</b>, such as his name, place of residence, date of birth, sex, and/or attributes which relate to the ID token itself, such as the institution which produced or issued the ID token, the validity period of the ID token, or an identifier for the ID token, such as a passport number or a credit card number.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electronic memory <b>118</b> may also have a memory area <b>126</b> for storing a certificate. The certificate contains a public key which is associated with the private key stored in the protected memory area <b>122</b>. The certificate may have been produced on the basis of a public key infrastructure (PKI) standard, for example on the basis of the X.509 standard.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The certificate does not necessarily have to be stored in the electronic memory <b>118</b> of the ID token <b>106</b>. Alternatively or in addition, the certificate may also be stored in a public directory server.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The ID token <b>106</b> has a processor <b>128</b>. The processor <b>128</b> is used for executing program instructions <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> and <b>134</b>. The program instructions <b>130</b> are used for user authentication, i.e. for authenticating the user <b>102</b> to the ID token.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The ID token can further comprise a storage portion (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which services for storing at least one identifier for identifying an ID provider computer system of the second set. At least one subset of the second set of the ID provider computer systems is defined as not trustworthy concerning the service computer system <b>150</b>, but the subset has rights for reading at least one of the attributes of the ID token <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In an embodiment using PINs, the user <b>102</b> inputs his PIN, in order to authenticate himself, into the ID token <b>106</b>, for example via the user computer system <b>100</b>. Execution of the program instructions <b>130</b> then accesses the protected memory area <b>120</b> in order to compare the input PIN with the reference value stored therein for the PIN. If the input PIN matches the reference value of the PIN, the user <b>102</b> is deemed to have been authenticated.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Alternatively, a biometric feature of the user <b>102</b> is captured. By way of example, the ID token <b>106</b> has a fingerprint sensor for this purpose, or a fingerprint sensor is connected to the user computer system <b>100</b>. The biometric data captured from the user <b>102</b> are compared with the biometric reference data stored in the protected memory area <b>120</b> by executing the program instructions <b>130</b> in this embodiment. If there is a sufficient match between the biometric data captured from the user <b>102</b> and the biometric reference data then the user <b>102</b> is deemed to have been authenticated.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The program instructions <b>134</b> are used for executing the steps of a cryptographic protocol which relate to the ID token <b>106</b> in order to authenticate an ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to the ID token <b>106</b>. The cryptographic protocol may be a challenge/response protocol based on a symmetric key or an asymmetric key pair.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">By way of example, the cryptographic protocol implements an extended access control method, as is specified for machine-readable travel documents (MRTDs) by the international aviation authority (ICAO). Successful execution of the cryptographic protocol authenticates the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to the ID token, thus proving its read authorization for reading the attributes stored in the protected memory area <b>124</b>. The authentication may also be reciprocal, i.e. the ID token <b>106</b> then also needs to authenticate itself to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> on the basis of the same or a different cryptographic protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The program instructions <b>132</b> are used for the end-to-end encryption of data transmitted between the ID token <b>106</b> and the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, but at least of the attributes read by the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> from the protected memory area <b>124</b>. For the end-to-end encryption, it is possible to use a symmetric key which is agreed between the ID token <b>106</b> and the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> when the cryptographic protocol is executed, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As an alternative to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the user computer system <b>100</b> can use its interface <b>104</b> to communicate with the interface <b>108</b> not directly but rather via a reader, connected to the interface <b>104</b>, for the ID token <b>106</b>. This reader, for example what is known as a class 2 chip card terminal, can also be used to input the PIN.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> has a network interface <b>138</b> for communication via the network <b>116</b>. The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> also has a memory <b>140</b> which stores a private key <b>142</b> for the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> and also the appropriate certificate <b>144</b>. This certificate may also be a certificate based on a PKI standard, for example, such as X.509.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> also has at least one processor <b>145</b> for executing program instructions <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>. By executing the program instructions <b>146</b>, the steps of the cryptographic protocol which relate to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> are executed. Overall, the cryptographic protocol is thus implemented through execution of the program instructions <b>134</b> by the processor <b>128</b> of the ID token <b>106</b> and also through execution of the program instructions <b>146</b> by the processor <b>145</b> of the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The program instructions <b>148</b> are used to implement the end-to-end encryption on the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, for example on the basis of the symmetric key which has been agreed between the ID token <b>106</b> and the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> when the cryptographic protocol is executed. In principle, it is possible to use any method for agreeing the symmetric key for the end-to-end encryption which is known per se beforehand, such as a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> is preferably situated in a particularly protected environment, particularly in what is known as a trust center, so that the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> forms the confidence anchor for the authenticity of the attributes read from the ID token <b>106</b> in combination with the need for authentication of the user <b>102</b> to the ID token <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A service computer system <b>150</b> may be designed to take an order or a commission for a service or a product, particularly an online service. By way of example, the user <b>102</b> can open an account at a bank or use another financial or banking service online via the network <b>116</b>. The service computer system <b>150</b> may also be in the form of an online warehouse, so that the user <b>102</b> can purchase a mobile telephone or the like online, for example. In addition, the service computer system <b>150</b> may also be designed to deliver digital content, for example for the download of music data and/or video data.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">To this end, the service computer system <b>150</b> has a network interface <b>152</b> for connection to the network <b>116</b>. In addition, the service computer system <b>150</b> has at least one processor <b>154</b> for executing program instructions <b>156</b>. Execution of the program instructions <b>156</b> generates dynamic HTML pages, for example, which the user <b>102</b> can use to input his commission or his order.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Depending on the nature of the commissioned or ordered product or the service, the service computer system <b>150</b> needs to check one or more attributes of the user <b>102</b> and/or his ID token <b>106</b> using one or more prescribed criteria. Only if this check is passed is the order or the commission from the user <b>102</b> taken and/or performed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">By way of example, opening a bank account or purchasing a mobile telephone with an associated contract requires the user <b>102</b> to disclose his identity to the service computer system <b>150</b> and requires this identity to be checked. In the prior art, the user <b>102</b> must do this by presenting his identification card, for example. This process is replaced by the reading of the digital identity of the user <b>102</b> from his ID token <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Depending on the instance of application, however, the user <b>102</b> does not need to disclose his identity to the service computer system <b>150</b>, but rather it suffices to communicate only one of the attributes, for example. By way of example, the user <b>102</b> can use one of the attributes to provide evidence that he belongs to a particular group of people which is authorized to access data held on the service computer system <b>150</b> for download. By way of example, such a criterion may be a minimum age of the user <b>102</b> or the association of the user <b>102</b> with a group of people which has access authorization for particular confidential data.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To use the service provided by the service computer system <b>150</b>, the procedure is as follows:</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">1. Authentication of the user <b>102</b> to the ID token <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The user <b>102</b> authenticates himself to the ID token <b>106</b>. In an implementation using PINs, the user <b>102</b> does this by inputting his PIN, for example using the user computer system <b>100</b> or a chip card terminal connected thereto. By executing the program instructions <b>130</b>, the ID token <b>106</b> then checks the correctness of the input PIN. If the input PIN matches the PIN's reference value stored in the protected memory area <b>120</b>, the user <b>102</b> is deemed to have been authenticated. The procedure may be similar if a biometric feature of the user <b>102</b> is used to authenticate him, as described above.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">2. Authentication of the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to the ID token <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">To this end, a connection is set up between the ID token <b>106</b> and the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> via the user computer system <b>100</b> and the network <b>116</b>. By way of example, the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> transmits its certificate <b>144</b> via this connection to the ID token <b>106</b>. The program instructions <b>134</b> then generate what is known as a challenge, i.e. a random number, for example. This random number is encrypted using the public key of the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, which is contained in the certificate <b>144</b>. The resulting cipher is sent from the ID token <b>106</b> via the connection to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>. The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> decrypts the cipher using its private key <b>142</b> and in this way obtains the random number. The random number is returned by the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to the ID token <b>106</b> via the connection. By executing the program instructions <b>134</b>, said ID token checks whether the random number received from the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> matches the originally generated random number, i.e. the challenge. If this is the case, the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> is deemed to have been authenticated to the ID token <b>106</b>. The random number can be used as a symmetric key for the end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">3. When the user <b>102</b> has successfully authenticated himself to the ID token <b>106</b>, and when the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> has successfully authenticated itself to the ID token <b>106</b>, the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> is provided with read authorization for reading an attribute, a plurality of attributes or all of the attributes stored in the protected memory area <b>124</b>. On the basis of a relevant read command which the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> sends to the ID token <b>106</b> via the connection, the requested attributes are read from the protected memory area <b>124</b> and they are encrypted by executing the program instructions <b>132</b>. The encrypted attributes are transmitted via the connection to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, where they are decrypted by executing the program instructions <b>148</b>. This provides the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> with knowledge of the attributes read from the ID token <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">These attributes are signed by the ID provider computer system using its certificate <b>144</b> and are transmitted via the user computer system <b>100</b> or directly to the service computer system <b>150</b>. This notifies the service computer system <b>150</b> of the attributes read from the ID token <b>106</b>, so that the service computer system <b>150</b> can check these attributes using the prescribed one or more criteria so as then possibly to provide the service requested by the user <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The need to authenticate the user <b>102</b> to the ID token <b>106</b> and to authenticate the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to the ID token <b>106</b> provides the necessary confidence anchor, so that the service computer system <b>150</b> can be certain that the attributes of the user <b>102</b> which have been communicated to it by the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> are correct and not falsified.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Depending on the embodiment, the order of the authentication may be different. By way of example, provision may be made for the user <b>102</b> to have to authenticate himself to the ID token <b>106</b> first of all, followed by the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>. In principle, however, it is also possible for the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to have to authenticate itself to the ID token <b>106</b> first of all, followed only then by the user <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the first case, the ID token <b>106</b> is designed, by way of example, such that it is unlocked only through input of a correct PIN or a correct biometric feature by the user <b>102</b>. Only this unlocking allows the program instructions <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> to start and hence the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to be authenticated.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the second case, it is also possible to start the program instructions <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> even when the user <b>102</b> has not authenticated himself to the ID token <b>106</b>. In this case, by way of example, the program instructions <b>134</b> are in a form such that the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> cannot perform read access to the protected memory area <b>124</b> for the purpose of reading one or more of the attributes until after the program instructions <b>130</b> have signaled that the user <b>102</b> has also been successfully authenticated.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Of particular advantage is the utilization of the ID token <b>106</b> for e-commerce and e-government applications, for example, specifically without media disruption and legally on the basis of the confidence anchor formed by the need for the user <b>102</b> and the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to be authenticated to the ID token <b>106</b>. Of particular advantage is also the fact that central storage of the attributes of various users <b>102</b> is not necessary, which means that the data protection problems which exist in the prior art are solved hereby. As far as the convenience of the application of the method is concerned, it is of particular advantage that prior registration of the user <b>102</b> in order to use the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> is not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the considered embodiment there is no identifier for the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> stored in the storage of the ID token. Accordingly, the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> also does not have rights for reading the attributes from the ID token. However, an identifier for the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032; is stored in the storage of the ID token (compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), which is in principal made up similar to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> and which has rights for reading the attributes from the ID token.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an embodiment of a method according to the invention. In step <b>200</b>, a service request is sent from the user computer system to the service computer system. By way of example, the user does this by starting an Internet browser on the user computer system and inputting a URL to call a web page on the service computer system. The user then inputs his service request into the called web page, for example in order to order or commission a service or a product.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In step <b>202</b>, the service computer system <b>150</b> then specifies one or more attributes which it requires in order to check the user's authorization for the service request. In particular, the service computer system can specify attributes which determine the digital identity of the user <b>102</b>. This specification of the attributes by the service computer system <b>150</b> may be firmly prescribed or can be determined individually by the service computer system <b>150</b> using prescribed rules, depending on the service request.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In step <b>204</b>, the attribute specification, i.e. the specification performed in step <b>202</b> for the one or more attributes, is transmitted from the service computer system to the ID provider computer system, specifically either directly or via the user computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In order to provide the ID provider computer system with the opportunity to read attributes from his ID token, the user authenticates himself to the ID token in step <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In step <b>208</b>, a connection is set up between the ID token and the ID provider computer system. This is preferably a protected connection, for example on the basis of what is known as a secure messaging method.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In step <b>210</b>, the ID provider computer system is at least authenticated to the ID token via the connection which has been set up in step <b>208</b>. In addition, there may also be provision for the ID token to be authenticated to the ID provider computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When both the user and the ID provider computer system have been successfully authenticated to the ID token, the ID provider computer system is provided with the access authorization for reading the attributes by the ID token. In step <b>212</b>, the ID provider computer system sends one or more read commands for reading the attributes required according to the attribute specification from the ID token. The attributes are then transmitted using end-to-end encryption via the protected connection to the ID provider computer system, where they are decrypted.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The attribute values which have been read are signed by the ID provider computer system in step <b>214</b>. In step <b>216</b>, the ID provider computer system sends the signed attribute values via the network. The signed attribute values reach the service computer system either directly or via the user computer system. In the latter case, the user may have the opportunity to take note of the signed attribute values and/or to add further data to them. Provision may be made for the signed attribute values, possibly with the added data, to be forwarded from the user computer system to the service computer system only following release by the user. This provides the greatest possible transparency for the user in terms of the attributes sent from the ID provider computer system to the service computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">If the ID provider computer system belongs to an intersection of the first and the second set, there is no further action necessary, because such a ID provider computer system belongs to both authentication domains. If this is not the case, the attribute specification is sent in step <b>204</b> to an ID provider computer system of the first set and is then forwarded from there to an ID provider computer system of the second set. Steps <b>208</b> through <b>216</b> are then performed by the ID provider computer system of the second set. Sending the signed attribute values from the ID provider computer system of the second set to the service computer system can be performed via the ID provider computer system of the first set.</p>

By way of example, the integrated electronic circuit may be what is known as a radio tag, which is also called an RFID tag or RFID label. Alternatively, the interface <b>108</b> may be equipped with contacts or be in the form of a dual mode interface.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In particular, the document <b>106</b> may be a value document or security document, such as a machine-readable travel document (MRTD), such as an electronic passport or an electronic identification card, or may be payment means, such as a credit card.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the embodiment under consideration in the present case, the protected memory area <b>124</b> stores the attributes i, wherein 1&#x2266;i&#x2266;n.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">By way of example, the memory <b>140</b> of the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, which is shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b</i>, <b>3</b><i>c</i>, stores a plurality of certificates, such as the certificates <b>144</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>144</b>.<b>2</b> with the respective associated private keys <b>142</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>142</b>.<b>2</b>. In the certificate <b>144</b>.<b>1</b>, read rights for the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> are defined for the attributes i=1 to i=4, whereas in the certificate <b>144</b>.<b>2</b>, read rights are defined for the attributes I to III.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Without loss of generality it is assumed that the ID provider computer systems <b>136</b> belong to the first set, i.e. the set of the ID provider computer systems, which are considered as being trustworthy by the service computer system <b>150</b>, that the ID provider computer systems <b>136</b>&#x2032;, <b>136</b>&#x2033;, . . . do not belong to the first set but only to the second set. The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> belongs to the subset of the first and the second sets.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The first set can for example be defined in a configuration storage of the service computer system <b>150</b> by identifiers of the ID provider computer systems of the first set. These identifiers can be programmed in program <b>156</b>. A further possibility is that the identifiers of the first set of the ID provider computer systems are stored in a directory server, from which the service computer system calls the identifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Accordingly is the situation for the definition of the second set. The second set can be defined directly on the level of the ID tokens by storing the identifiers of the ID provider computer system of the second set there.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">To use a service provided by the service computer system <b>150</b>, the user <b>102</b> first of all makes a user input <b>162</b> into the user computer system <b>100</b>, for example in order to input his request for the desired service into a web page on the service computer system <b>150</b>. Said service request <b>164</b> is transmitted from the user computer system <b>100</b> via the network <b>116</b> to the service computer system <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The service computer system <b>150</b> then responds with an attribute specification <b>166</b>, i.e. by specifying those attributes which the service computer system <b>150</b> requires in order to handle the service request <b>164</b> from the user <b>102</b>. By way of example, the attribute specification can be made in the form of the attribute name, such as &#x201c;surname&#x201d;, &#x201c;first name&#x201d;, &#x201c;address&#x201d;, &#x201c;credit card number&#x201d;. The attribute specification <b>166</b> can comprise a designation of one or more identifiers of the ID provider computer system of the first set.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Subsequently it is assumed without loss of generality that the identifier of the ID provider computer systems <b>138</b> is transmitted with the attribute specification <b>166</b>. Alternatively the identifier can be requested by the user computer system <b>100</b> from the directory server.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The receipt of the attribute specification <b>166</b> is signaled to the user <b>102</b> by the user computer system <b>100</b>. The user <b>102</b> can then select one or, if necessary, a plurality of the configuration data records <b>158</b>, <b>160</b>, . . . which respectively define sets of attributes which contain the attributes according to the attribute specification <b>166</b>, at least as a subset.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">If the attribute specification <b>166</b> merely requires notification of the surname, the first name and the address of the user <b>102</b>, for example, the user <b>102</b> can select the configuration data record <b>158</b>. If, by contrast, the credit card number is additionally specified in the attribute specification <b>166</b>, the user <b>102</b> can additionally select the configuration data record <b>160</b>. This process can also be performed fully automatically by the user computer system <b>100</b>, for example by executing the program instructions <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Subsequently, it is first of all assumed that only one of the configuration data records, such as the configuration data record <b>158</b>, is selected on the basis of the attribute specification <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The user computer system <b>100</b> then sends a request <b>168</b> to the ID provider computer systems indicated in the chosen configuration data record, in the example under consideration to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> of the trust center A. Said request <b>168</b> contains an indication of the attributes, according to the attribute specification <b>166</b>, which need to be read by the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> from the data source indicated in the configuration data record <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> then selects one or more of its certificates which have the read rights required for reading these attributes. If, by way of example, the attributes i=1 to 3 are to be read from the identification card, the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> selects its certificate <b>144</b>.<b>1</b>, which defines the read rights required therefor. This selection of the certificate is performed by executing the program instructions <b>149</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, the execution of the cryptographic protocol is started. By way of example, the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to this end sends a response to the user computer system <b>100</b>. The user computer system <b>100</b> then asks the user <b>102</b> to authenticate himself to the specified data source, i.e. in this case to the identification card.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The user <b>102</b> then brings his identification card, i.e. the ID token <b>106</b>, into the range of the RFID reader <b>104</b>, and inputs his PIN, for example, in order to authenticate himself. The successful authentication of the user <b>102</b> to the ID token <b>106</b> unlocks the latter for performance of the cryptographic protocol, i.e. for performance of the program instructions <b>134</b>. Subsequently, the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> authenticates itself to the ID token <b>106</b> using the selected certificate <b>144</b>.<b>1</b>, for example using a challenge/response method. This authentication may also be reciprocal. Following successful authentication of the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to the ID token <b>106</b>, the ID provider computer system sends a read request for reading the requisite attributes to the user computer system <b>100</b>, and the latter forwards this via the RFID reader <b>104</b> to the ID token <b>106</b>. The ID token <b>106</b> uses the certificate <b>144</b>.<b>1</b> to check whether the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> has the requisite read rights. Herein this is the case, because the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> belongs to the second set, such that the desired attributes are read from the protected memory area <b>124</b> and are transmitted by means of end-to-end encryption to the ID provider computer system via the user computer system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> then sends a response <b>170</b>, which contains the attributes which have been read, via the network <b>116</b> to the service computer system <b>150</b>. The response <b>170</b> is digitally signed with the certificate <b>144</b>.<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Alternatively, the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> sends the response <b>170</b> to the user computer system <b>100</b>. The user <b>102</b> is then provided with the opportunity to read the attributes contained in the response <b>170</b> and to decide whether or not he actually wishes to forward these attributes to the service computer system <b>150</b>. Only when a release command from the user <b>102</b> has been input into the user computer system <b>100</b> is the response <b>170</b> then forwarded to the service computer system <b>150</b>. In this embodiment, it is also possible for the user <b>102</b> to add further data to the response <b>170</b>. The signature of the answer <b>170</b> is checked by the service computer system <b>150</b>. As it originates from the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, which belongs to the first set, the answer <b>170</b> is regarded as trustworthy by the service computer system <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">If in contrast the attribute specification <b>166</b> specifies one or more attributes, which can be read by a data source, to which an ID provider computer system has access that belongs to the second set but not to the first set, it is proceeded as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The user computer system <b>100</b> forwards the attribute specification <b>166</b> in form of the request <b>168</b> to an ID provider computer system of the first set, i.e. in the embodiment considered herein to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>. The request <b>168</b> comprises in addition to attribute specification <b>166</b> a designation of the ID provider computer system of the second set, which has access to the specified attributes. The ID provider computer system of the first set that receives request <b>168</b> forwards this request then as request <b>168</b>&#x2032; to the ID provider computer system of the second set that was designated in request <b>168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">This ID provider computer system of the second set authenticates itself to the data source and reads the at least one attribute according to the attribute specification from the data source as described above for ID provider computer system <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The ID provider computer system of the second set then generates answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; that comprises the attribute. The ID provider computer system of the second set signs answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; and sends the answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; to the ID provider computer system of the first set.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The ID provider computer system of the first set considers the ID provider computer system of the second set as trustworthy. After checking the signature of answer <b>170</b>&#x2032;, which has been received from the ID provider computer system of the second set, the ID provider computer system of the first set signs answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; on its part and sends answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; either to the user computer system <b>100</b> for forwarding it to the service computer system <b>150</b> or directly to the service computer system <b>150</b>. The service computer system <b>150</b> checks then the signature of the ID provider computer system of the first set. As the service computer system <b>150</b> considers the ID provider computer system of the first set as trustworthy it considers the attributes transmitted together with answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; as valid as long as the signature of the ID provider computer system of the first set is valid.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">For example attribute specification <b>166</b> comprises a specification of the attributes I, II and III. After having received these attribute specifications via network <b>116</b> the user computer system <b>100</b> determines that these attributes are stored on the data source credit card, i.e. on the ID token <b>106</b>&#x2032;. For this purpose the ID provider trust centre b, i.e. the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032; of the second set, has reading rights. The ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032; does not belong to the first set, which is considered as trustworthy by the service computer system <b>150</b>. The user computer system <b>100</b> can determine this for example by a request to a public directory server. In the same way the user computer system can determine by a request to a directory service which ID provider computer system/computer systems belong to the first set, i.e. to the set of the ID provider computer systems considering the service computer system <b>150</b> as trustworthy. In this exemplary embodiment this is the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The user computer system <b>100</b> forwards then the attribute specification <b>166</b> in form of request <b>168</b> to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> of the first set, wherein request <b>168</b> comprises an identifier identifying the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032;. The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> forwards request <b>168</b> to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032;, which is specified in request <b>168</b> and which processes request <b>168</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032; also reads attributes I, II, III from ID token <b>106</b>&#x2032; for example according to the steps <b>204</b>-<b>206</b> of the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032; sends answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; which comprises the read attributes I, II, III and has been signed by the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032;, not directly to the service computer system <b>150</b> or to the user computer system <b>100</b>, but the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032; sends the answer to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, from which it has received request <b>168</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> then checks the validity of the signature of the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032;. If the second signature is valid the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> considers the attribute values I, II and III transmitted together with answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; as valid and signs answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; on its own in order to send it to the user computer system <b>100</b> for forwarding it to the service computer system <b>150</b> or in order to send answer <b>170</b>&#x2032; directly to the service computer system <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The attribute specification <b>166</b> can be read by the service computer system <b>150</b> for example as a so called soft token. If necessary the user computer system <b>100</b> adds the designation of an ID provider computer system of the second set, i.e. the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032;, to this soft token, which is then forwarded as request <b>168</b> to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>. A trusted connection exists between service computer system <b>150</b> and ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, which can be designated by the service computer system <b>150</b> in the soft token. A query to a public directory server by the user computer system <b>100</b> is unnecessary in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">If a plurality of ID provider computer systems <b>136</b>, <b>136</b>&#x2032;, . . . are involved, the individual responses from the ID provider computer systems can be combined by the user computer system <b>100</b> in a single response which all of the attributes according to the attribute specification <b>166</b> contain, said response then being sent from the user computer system <b>100</b> to the service computer system <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">According to one embodiment of the invention, the user <b>102</b> can disclose one or more of his attributes to the service computer system <b>150</b> on the occasion of the service request <b>164</b>, for example by transmitting said attributes of the user to the service computer system via the network <b>116</b> as part of the service request <b>164</b>. In particular, the user <b>102</b> can input said attributes into the web page on the service computer system <b>150</b>. The correctness of these attributes is then confirmed by the response <b>170</b>, i.e. the service computer system <b>150</b> can compare the attributes received from the user <b>102</b> with the attributes read from the ID token <b>106</b> by the ID provider computer <b>136</b> and can check them for a match.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">According to a further embodiment of the invention, it is also possible for at least one further attribute to be indicated in the attribute specification <b>166</b>, said attribute not being stored on one of the ID tokens of the user <b>102</b> but rather being able to be requested from an external data source. By way of example, this may involve an attribute relating to the creditworthiness of the user <b>102</b>. To this end, the user computer system <b>100</b> may contain a further configuration data record <b>161</b> which contains the indication of a data source and of an ID provider computer system for the attribute A&#x2014;e.g. creditworthiness. The data source may be an online credit agency, such as a credit bureau, Dun &#x26; Bradstreet or the like. By way of example, the ID provider computer system indicated is a trust center C, as in the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this case, the data source may be located in the trust center C.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In order to request the attribute A, the user computer system <b>100</b> thus sends an appropriate request (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to the trust center C, i.e. the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2033;. The latter then delivers the attribute A, which the user computer system <b>100</b> forwards to the service computer system <b>150</b> together with the further attributes which have been read from the ID token(s) of the user <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Preferably, the attribute A is requested after the attributes relating to the digital identity of the user <b>102</b> have already been requested from one of the ID tokens of the user <b>102</b>, and have been received as a signed response <b>170</b> by the user computer system <b>100</b>, for example. The request for the attribute A from the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2033; by the user computer system <b>100</b> then contains the signed response <b>170</b>, so that the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2033; has reliable information about the identity of the user <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a further embodiment of a method according to the invention. The method involves acknowledgement domains <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, wherein the acknowledgement domain <b>1</b> comprises the service computer system <b>150</b> and the ID provider computer systems of the first set, to which the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> belongs, and wherein the acknowledgement domain <b>2</b> comprises the ID token <b>106</b> of user <b>102</b>, the user computer system <b>100</b> and the ID provider computer systems of the second set, to which the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032; belongs. According to the embodiment considered herein the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032; does not belong to the first set.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">A user input from a user <b>102</b> into a user computer system <b>100</b> is used by the user <b>102</b> to specify a service on a service computer system which he or she wishes to use. By way of example, this is done by calling an Internet page on the service computer system and selecting one of the services provided thereon. The service request from the user <b>102</b> is transmitted from the user computer system <b>100</b> to the service computer system <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The service computer system <b>150</b> responds to the service request with an attribute specification, i.e. for example a list of attribute names. The attribute specification can be sent in form of the soft token. In addition to the attribute specification the soft token can comprise a designation of an ID provider computer system of the first set. According to the embodiment considered herein this is the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>. When the attribute specification has been received, the user computer system <b>100</b> asks the user <b>102</b> to authenticate himself to the ID token <b>106</b>, for example by means of an input request.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The user <b>102</b> then authenticates himself to the ID token <b>106</b>, for example by inputting his PIN. Further the user computer system <b>100</b> determines which ID provider computer system has reading rights for reading the specified attributes from the ID token <b>106</b>. This can be performed by using configuration datasets, by a query to the ID token <b>106</b> or by a query to a directory server. According to the embodiment considered herein it is the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Following successful authentication, the soft token is forwarded from the user computer system <b>100</b> to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, wherein an identifier of the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032; has been added to the soft token. The soft token is forwarded by the ID provider computer system <b>136</b> to the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>&#x2032;. The latter then authenticates itself to the ID token <b>106</b> and sends a read request for reading the attributes according to the attribute specification to the ID token <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Assuming the prior successful authentication of the user <b>102</b> and of the ID provider computer system <b>136</b>, the ID token <b>106</b> responds to the read request with the desired attributes. The ID provider computer system <b>136</b> signs the attributes and sends the signed attributes to the user computer system <b>100</b>. Following release by the user <b>102</b>, the signed attributes are then transmitted to the service computer system <b>150</b>, which can then provide the desired service as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">This has in particular the advantage that electronic legal relations crossing acknowledgement domains can be performed in an efficient and secure manner.</p>
