<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The field of the invention relates generally to systems and methods for processing electronic payments and, more particularly, to network-based systems and methods for processing cross-border transactions denominated in more than one currency.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A global economy requires the movement of funds across borders and across disparate currencies. International suppliers of goods and services often provide invoices to customers for payment. However, incoming payments often do not include an invoice number, requiring the supplier to manually match incoming payments to outstanding invoices, a process that can be inefficient, costly, and cumbersome.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, some known payment systems do not allow the direct transfer of funds from one financial institution to another. A network of financial institutions and correspondent banks exists to forward funds from one institution to another. For example, a single payment being made from a small bank in the United States to a small bank in Germany may be passed from the small U.S. bank to a larger bank in the U.S. that serves as a correspondent bank, then to a German correspondent bank associated with the small German bank, and finally to the small German bank. This complex network is prone to delays and unpredictability. Moreover, each bank involved in the transaction may take a fee from the transferred funds. Foreign exchange rates and fees may also be applied by intermediary banks, adding more costs and unpredictability to the process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, a system is needed that enables cross border payments without the use of correspondent banks. Moreover, a system is needed that adds cost predictability, transaction tracking, and detailed remittance data that can be associated with each transaction to facilitate matching payments with invoices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a computer system for processing electronic cross-border payments is provided. The computer system includes a memory device and a processor. The computer system is coupled to a payment network. The computer system is programmed to receive an identification of a payee, receive a destination currency and a payment amount, determine an exchange rate based on the destination currency and an origination currency, wherein the origination currency is based on a payor bank account, and determine a total transaction cost for converting the payment amount from the origination currency to the destination currency and for transmitting payment data over the payment network, wherein the total transaction cost includes the payment amount. The computer system is also programmed to transmit payment data over the payment network, wherein the transmission of payment data represents the payment amount being transferred from the payor bank account to a payee bank account, wherein the payment amount is converted from the origination currency to the destination currency according to the exchange rate.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present disclosure is directed to processing an electronic payment across national borders and, when applicable, using more than one currency. The process may begin with an enrollment step in which a payee, or biller, enrolls with a payment system. By so doing, a list or directory of payees is created. A payee sends an invoice to a customer, or payor. The invoice requests payment for a certain amount in a specified currency. The payor initiates a payment to the payee by using the payment system to identify the payee from the list of payees. Alternatively, the payor provides information about the payee, such as where the payment should be directed. The payor further identifies a payment amount, a payment currency, and remittance information. Remittance information may include a reference to the invoice, text, data, files, etc. The payment system determines an exchange rate for the transaction based on current rates. The total cost of the transaction, including the payment amount, foreign exchange fees, transaction fees, and any other costs or fees, are determined and presented to the payor in the currency of the payor's bank account. The payment system transfers money from the payor's bank account to the payee's bank account using a payment network. Remittance information is transmitted to the payee, either with the payment or separately. The payment system tracks the progress of the transaction and makes the status available to the payor and payee. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> are used to illustrate the hardware involved in completing these steps.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A technical effect of the systems and processes described herein includes at least one of: (a) enrolling a payee with a payment system; (b) initiating, using the payment system, a payment; (c) receiving, at the payment system, an identification of a payee; (d) receiving, at the payment system, a currency and payment amount; (e) receiving, at the payment system, remittance information; (f) determining an exchange rate based on the received currency; (g) applying the exchange rate and providing a converted currency amount; (h) transferring, using the payment system, money from a payor bank account to a payee bank account; (i) delivering remittance information to the payee; (j) tracking the status of the transaction; and (k) providing the status to the payor and/or payee.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, a computer program is provided, and the program is embodied on a computer readable medium.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The following detailed description illustrates embodiments of the invention by way of example and not by way of limitation. It is contemplated that the invention has general application to processing financial transaction data by a third party in industrial, commercial, and residential applications. As used herein, an element or step recited in the singular and proceeded with the word &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should be understood as not excluding plural elements or steps, unless such exclusion is explicitly recited.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating a conventional system <b>100</b> for making cross-border payments. Conventionally, a payee <b>105</b> transmits an invoice <b>107</b> to a payor <b>110</b> using known methods. Payor <b>110</b> transmits a payment to payee <b>105</b> using system <b>100</b>, which includes a network of banks, explained in more detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, invoice <b>107</b> is for US$4,800. The amounts used herein are merely illustrative of a possible transaction, and other amounts, currencies, fees, and rates may be possible. Payor <b>110</b> initiates payment using a payor's bank <b>115</b>. An amount <b>117</b> of US$4,800 is debited from an account of payor <b>110</b> at payor's bank <b>115</b>. Payor's bank <b>115</b> charges payor <b>110</b> a fee <b>119</b> of US$25 for transmitting the payment. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, payee <b>105</b> does not have an account at payor's bank <b>115</b>. Payee <b>105</b> has an account at payee's bank <b>125</b>, which is located in a different country than payor's bank <b>115</b>. Moreover, payor's bank <b>115</b> is not associated with payee's bank <b>125</b> via a payment network, and therefore cannot directly transfer funds to payee's bank <b>125</b>. Rather, payor's bank <b>115</b> uses a network that includes correspondent banks for forwarding the payment to the payee's bank <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Payor's bank <b>115</b> has a relationship with a payor's bank correspondent <b>130</b> that is located in the same country as payor's bank <b>115</b>. Payor's bank <b>115</b> transfers a payment <b>133</b> of US$4,800 to payor's bank correspondent <b>130</b>. Payor's bank correspondent <b>130</b> deducts a bene deduct fee <b>135</b> of US$25 from payment <b>133</b> and gives a soft dollar rebate <b>137</b> of US$7.50 to payor's bank <b>115</b>. Payment <b>133</b> may be transferred from payor's bank <b>115</b> to payor's bank correspondent using a domestic payment network (not shown), such as Fedwire provided by the United States Federal Reserve Banks and/or the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Payor's bank correspondent <b>130</b> transfers a payment <b>139</b> to a payee's bank correspondent <b>140</b>. Payor's bank correspondent <b>130</b> and payee's bank correspondent <b>140</b> are associated via a payment network (not shown), such as SWIFTNet provided by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Notably, SWIFTNet does not provide funds transfer, and so payment <b>139</b> from payor's bank correspondent <b>130</b> is effectuated using a correspondent account with payee's bank correspondent <b>140</b> in response to payment information sent via SWIFTNet.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Payee's bank correspondent <b>140</b> converts payment <b>139</b>, denominated in US Dollars, to Brazilian real (BRL) and transfers a payment <b>141</b>, denominated in BRL or R$, to payee's bank <b>125</b>. The currency exchange is performed with a 2% spread, which produces an FX fee for payee's bank correspondent <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Finally, payee's bank <b>125</b> credits the account associated with payee <b>105</b> an amount <b>143</b> of R$7,522. Payee's bank <b>125</b> additionally charges payee <b>105</b> a transaction fee <b>145</b> equivalent to US$15. After the deduction of fees for funds transfers and currency exchange, amount <b>143</b> is US$137.30 less than invoice <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While only two correspondent banks (<b>130</b> and <b>140</b>) are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, additional correspondent banks may be used to transfer cross-border payments. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, conventional system <b>100</b> causes multiple fees to be incurred, reducing the final payment amount by an unpredictable amount.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a simplified block diagram of an exemplary payment system <b>200</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. More specifically, in the exemplary embodiment, payment system <b>200</b> includes a server system <b>212</b>, and a plurality of sub-systems, also referred to as client systems <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b> connected to and/or in communication with server system <b>212</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, server system <b>212</b> is also referred to as a central payment processor that processes electronically submitted payment transactions submitted by a consumer after a bill is presented over the system or using other means to the consumer by a biller.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Payees, or billers or suppliers, utilizing payment system <b>200</b> for processing bills for payment are enrolled within payment system <b>200</b>. By enrolling in payment system <b>200</b>, payors, or customers or buyers, are able to submit payments to payees using payment system <b>200</b>. When processing a payment from a payor, payment system <b>200</b> may first verify that the payee identified by the payor is enrolled within payment system <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the exemplary embodiment, client system <b>230</b> is associated with a payor, and therefore is referred to as payor system <b>230</b> or payor <b>230</b>. Client system <b>232</b> is associated with a payor bank, or a bank with which payor <b>230</b> has a relationship, and therefore is referred to as payor bank system <b>232</b> or payor bank <b>232</b>. Client system <b>236</b> is associated with a payee, and therefore is referred to as payee system <b>236</b> or payee <b>236</b>. Client system <b>234</b> is associated with a payee bank, or a bank with which payee has a relationship, and therefore is referred to as payee bank system <b>234</b> or payee bank <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the exemplary embodiment, server system <b>212</b> is communicatively coupled, e.g., networked via WAN, ISDN, frame relay, the Internet, etc., with payor bank system <b>232</b> and payee bank system <b>234</b> to form a payment network <b>240</b>. Payment network <b>240</b>, as described in more detail herein, enables the transfer of money in the form of payments, and of data associated with the payments from a first endpoint, e.g., payor <b>232</b>, of payment network <b>240</b> to a second endpoint, e.g., payee <b>236</b>, of payment network <b>240</b>. Payment network <b>240</b> includes a variety of systems (not all shown), including systems <b>232</b> and <b>234</b>, capable of sending and receiving payments using payment network <b>240</b>. The component systems of payment network <b>240</b> are generally associated with banking institutions located in two or more countries. Accordingly, as described in more detail herein, payment network <b>240</b> enables cross-border payments between and among its constituent banking institutions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, client systems <b>230</b> and <b>236</b> are computers including a web browser, such that client system <b>232</b>, client system <b>234</b>, and server system <b>212</b> are accessible to client systems <b>230</b> and <b>236</b> using the Internet.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Processor <b>505</b> may also be operatively coupled to a storage device <b>334</b>. Storage device <b>334</b> is any computer-operated hardware suitable for storing and/or retrieving data. In some embodiments, storage device <b>334</b> is integrated in server computing device <b>501</b>. For example, server computing device <b>501</b> may include one or more hard disk drives as storage device <b>334</b>. In other embodiments, storage device <b>334</b> is external to server computing device <b>501</b> and may be accessed by a plurality of server computing devices <b>501</b>. For example, storage device <b>334</b> may include multiple storage units such as hard disks or solid state disks in a redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) configuration.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method <b>600</b> of processing an electronic payment by payment system <b>200</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, payment system <b>200</b> achieves the technical effect by implementing method <b>600</b> which includes an enrollment step <b>602</b> wherein a payee <b>236</b> enrolls in a payment processing service provided by the payment network (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) through server system <b>212</b>. After enrollment <b>602</b>, payor <b>230</b> makes a bill payment step <b>604</b> that involves payor <b>230</b> paying a bill generated from payee <b>236</b> for services or goods provided by payee <b>236</b> to payor <b>230</b>. Money to be paid by payor <b>230</b> is converted to the currency requested by payee <b>236</b> in a currency exchange step <b>606</b> if a conversion is required. Money and payment information are delivered <b>608</b> to payee <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a more detailed flowchart illustrating an exemplary method <b>700</b> of enrollment step <b>602</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In an exemplary embodiment, payee <b>236</b> enrolls in a payment service offered by payment network <b>240</b> through server system/central payment processor <b>212</b>. The payment service enables payee <b>236</b> to receive electronic payments from payors who are users of network <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Enrollment of payees facilitates the efficient function of payment system <b>212</b>. Specifically, enrollment of payees enables a payor to select a payee from a pre-determined list or directory of payees. Enrolling payees facilitates greater accuracy in payment transactions by allowing payors to select a payee from a list rather than inputting payee information. However, payors may alternatively provide payee information rather than selecting a payee from a list, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Payee enrollment includes a step <b>704</b> wherein a payee, e.g., payee <b>236</b>, provides identification information to system <b>212</b>. For example, the payee may use a web interface to interact with system <b>212</b> and provide a name and contact information. The identification information provided by payees may be used in the directory of payees from which payors select payees. The payee also provides <b>706</b> bank information, such as a bank name, an account number, and/or bank routing information. Bank information may be used by system <b>212</b> to transfer money to an account associated with payee <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Payee information provided during enrollment <b>602</b> may be stored in a database, e.g., database <b>244</b>. It should be appreciated that payee enrollment may only be required once for each payee and that a payee does not need to complete enrollment step <b>602</b> for each payment transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a more detailed flowchart illustrating an exemplary method <b>800</b> of payment initiation step <b>604</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Payees, which may be suppliers of goods and services to payors, including payor <b>230</b>, may provide an invoice to the payor. In response, the payor may initiate <b>604</b> an electronic payment to the payee, sometimes referred to as a biller.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A payor may use payment system <b>212</b> to send the electronic payment to the payee. The payor may interact directly with payment system <b>212</b> using a web interface. Alternatively, the payor may interact with payor's bank, e.g., payor bank system <b>232</b> using a web interface. Payor bank system <b>232</b> may provide an interface, e.g., via APIs, to payment system <b>212</b>. The steps of identifying and providing, in method <b>800</b>, include identifying and providing data or input to payment system <b>212</b>, whether directly or indirectly (i.e., via payor bank <b>232</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The payor is an authorized user of payment system <b>212</b>. The payor, prior to sending payments via system <b>212</b>, established a payor bank account from which system <b>212</b> may deduct the necessary funds to complete the requested transaction. For example, the payor may have a demand deposit account or credit line at payor bank <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Initially, the payor identifies <b>804</b> an intended payee. The payor may select the intended payee from a list of enrolled payees or the payor may input payee information, including payee identification and payee bank information. System <b>212</b> may verify the validity of the payee selected or input by the payor. For example, system <b>212</b> may verify that the payee bank information is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The payor identifies <b>806</b> the currency for the transaction and the payment amount. The currency type and payment amount may be found on the invoice provided by the payee to the payor. The payor identifies the payment amount in the transaction currency, which may be different than the currency of the payor bank account.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The payor may identify <b>808</b> remittance information associated with the electronic payment. Remittance information may include an invoice number, an order number, a purchase request number, notes, attachments, electronic files, and/or any text or data associated with the invoice and/or the electronic payment. For example, remittance information may include an invoice number and a note that only partial payment is being made because some products included in the invoice were damaged. Remittance information is provided by the payor and is transmitted, as explained herein, to the payee. Accordingly, remittance information may be used by the payee to identify the invoice associated with an incoming electronic payment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a more detailed flowchart illustrating an exemplary method <b>900</b> of currency exchange step <b>606</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). As the payor bank account may be denominated in a currency that is different than the currency of the transaction and/or the currency of the payee bank account, a currency exchange step <b>606</b> may be required. Currency exchange <b>606</b> is provided by system <b>212</b> and/or the operator of network <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A current exchange rate is determined <b>902</b> for the appropriate currency conversion. The current exchange rate may be based on a daily rate, an hourly rate, an instantaneous rate, or any other exchange rate. The determined exchange rate is applied <b>904</b> to the payment amount to determine the equivalent value in the originating currency (i.e., the currency of the payor bank account). The equivalent value, together with the current exchange rate and/or any currency exchange fees, may be presented to the payor for approval. For example, the currency exchange information may be presented to the user via a web interface. If approved, the transaction continues in the approved new currency. Otherwise, the transaction is aborted. Accordingly, a payor may know all fees and costs associated with the electronic payment before conducting the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a more detailed flowchart illustrating an exemplary method <b>1000</b> of money and remittance information transmission step <b>608</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Step <b>608</b> includes the steps of transferring the money <b>1002</b>, posting the money to the payee bank account <b>1004</b>, and delivering remittance information <b>1006</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the exemplary embodiment, transferring <b>1002</b> the money includes debiting the payor bank account. If the payor is using the payor's bank to send the electronic payment, the payor's bank may debit the payor bank account and confirm a successful withdrawal (i.e., if sufficient funds are available) to payment system <b>212</b> and/or a payment network, e.g., payment network <b>240</b>. Money transfers to, within, and from the payment network may be accomplished using a settlement account. For example, each financial institution associated with the payment network may have a settlement account. A transfer of money from a first bank to a second bank using the payment network may be accomplished by debiting the settlement account of the first bank a pre-determined amount and crediting the second bank the pre-determined amount. In the exemplary embodiment, the payor's bank uses a settlement account to transfer funds to the payment network.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, transferring <b>1002</b> the money includes a clearing and a settlement process. Initially, clearing data is sent to the payee's bank, usually in near real-time. Subsequently, settlement data is sent to the payee's bank, e.g., in nightly batches, and the money is debited and credited from appropriate accounts through a net settlement process. This entire process of transferring <b>1002</b> money is faster and more efficient than conventional cross-border payment systems (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), which have multiple &#x201c;hops&#x201d; for data and/or money via a plurality of banks and/or disparate payment networks.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">If the payor is using payment system <b>212</b> directly to send the electronic payment, payment system <b>212</b> may initiate a drawdown debit, ACH payment, wire transfer, or other transfer of funds from payor bank account to payment system <b>212</b> and/or payment network <b>240</b>. Regardless of how the payor's funds are held, the money for the electronic payment, plus any transaction fees, will be deducted from the payor bank account and transferred to the payment network for forwarding to the payee.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some cases, the payee's bank is not directly associated with the payment network, such as payee bank <b>252</b>. In such cases, funds are transferred from the payment network to partner bank <b>254</b> for forwarding to payee bank <b>252</b>. As partner bank <b>254</b> is associated with the payment network, funds may be transferred from the payment network to partner bank <b>254</b> in the same manner than funds are transferred from the payment network to payee bank <b>236</b>. Partner bank <b>254</b> may transfer funds to payee bank <b>252</b> using a local (i.e., intra-nation, and/or intra-region) funds transfer methodology, such as a wire or ACH transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Remittance information may be delivered <b>1006</b> from payment system <b>212</b> to the payee together with the fund transfer. For example, the fund transfer methodology may allow data to be transmitted with the fund transfer. Alternatively, remittance information may be delivered using server system <b>212</b> and/or payee bank system <b>234</b>/<b>252</b>. More specifically, payee may retrieve remittance information from server system <b>212</b>, whether directly or via a &#x201c;white-label&#x201d; interface, using a web interface.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Step <b>608</b> also includes tracking <b>1022</b> the status of the electronic payment and providing <b>1024</b> the current status. System <b>212</b> monitors and records each step in the electronic payment process, from payment initiation <b>604</b> through money transmission <b>608</b> in order to track <b>1022</b> the progress of the transaction. The payor and payee may visit a website provided by server system <b>212</b>, payor bank <b>232</b>, and/or payee bank <b>234</b> to receive the status provided <b>1024</b> by server system <b>212</b>. Providing the current status of the transaction helps the payee and the payor to know where the money is at each stage of the transaction. Alternatively, or additionally, the status may be provided <b>1024</b> by sending alerts or notifications, such as emails, text messages, on-screen alerts, etc., to the payor and/or the payee indicating that additional steps have been taken, problems have been encountered, the money is being delayed, the money is available, remittance information is available, and the like. In addition, the payor and the payee may use server system <b>212</b> to communicate with each other about the electronic payment. Communications between the payor and the payee may be associated with the electronic payment, similar to comments on a blog post.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The systems and processes described herein enable payment system <b>212</b> to facilitate cross border payments using a payment network. By using the payment network, predictability is added to fees and costs, particularly foreign exchange rates, transactions are simplified and accelerated in contrast to existing systems, and detailed remittance data is provided to billers/payees. More particularly, by using the payment network, money can be transferred without the use of intermediary banks. As intermediary banks may impose fees (for transactions, currency exchange, etc.), sometimes without prior notice to the payor, intermediary banks add additional cost and uncertainty to cross-border payments in conventional systems. Accordingly, by eliminating the need for intermediary banks, the systems and processes described herein add predictability to the timing of the payment, the availability of necessary data, and fees.</p>
