<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to display imaging and, in particular, to switchable lens systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Display apparatus are known that are capable of a three-dimensional (3D) imaging mode, in which the display device is arranged to provide one view for one eye of an observer and another view for the other eye. Due to differences between the two views the observer has a perception of three-dimensional viewing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A way to realize such a 3D display device is by using lenticulars in combination with a liquid crystal display (LCD). The principle of this type of 3D display apparatus (also known as Autostereoscopic display apparatus) is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,064,424.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to the 3D mode, such a display apparatus may be capable of producing images in a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; two-dimensional (2D) mode. U.S. Pat. No. 6,069,650 discloses a display apparatus that can produce images in either a 3D or a 2D mode, by using switchable lenses that are capable of switching their optical properties such that images in either 3D or 2D mode can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A 2D/3D switchable display apparatus is typically constructed by a switchable lens system stacked on a display device. The display device is arranged for producing an image, and the lens system is arranged to produce a 2D or 3D view from that image. The display device may be, for example, an LCD, a display based on organic light emitting diodes (LEDs) (OLED), or even a cathode ray tube (CRT) display.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The switchable lens system is positioned in between two transparent substrates. In a surface of one of the two substrates, lenticulars that form a plurality of lenses are provided. The lenticulars comprise liquid crystal material. By applying an electric potential to the liquid material, a change in the effective refractive index of the liquid material can be effectuated which modifies the lens properties of the lenticulars from 3D to 2D mode or vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">During the manufacturing of the above mentioned switchable lens system, the liquid crystal material (having relatively high viscosity) is inserted in a space between two transparent substrates, i.e. into cavities formed by the lenticulars. The filling of the cavities formed by the lenticulars is done similar to a filling process well known for filling standard LCD's. First, a seal line is put around the area of the lenticulars for sealing of the space between the two transparent substrates. Within the seal line, a throughhole is left open. Next, the space between the two transparent substrates is evacuated. After reaching a sufficiently low pressure, the throughhole is immersed into a bath containing liquid crystal material. Then, the pressure surrounding the switchable lens system and the bath with liquid crystal material is increased to a higher pressure (for example, normal pressure) to let the liquid crystal material penetrate and fill the filling space of the display device. After completion of the filling, the throughhole is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Typically, in an LCD the gap of the space between the substrates is homogenous. In the switchable lens system, however, the gap of the space between the substrates varies due to the presence of the lenticular structure on one of the two transparent substrates. In fact, the lenticulars form tunnel-like structures, which substantially extend across the full area of the lens system. The variation of the gap and the tunnel-like shape has an adverse effect on the filling process: the filling process of the switchable lens system is much slower than for an LCD with comparable dimensions. Due to the relatively slow filling process, the throughput time to produce a switchable lens system is relatively long in comparison with production of an LCD, especially for large-sized panels (for example, television panels).</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plan-view of a switchable lens system from the prior art is schematically shown. The switchable lens system <b>1</b> comprises an imaging area <b>10</b>, a seal line <b>20</b> and throughhole <b>30</b>. The imaging area <b>10</b> comprises in between a top and bottom glass plate (not shown here): a lenticular structure. Cavities formed by the lenticular structure are filled with a liquid crystal material. As will be explained in more detail below, between the top glass plate and the lenticular structure a first electrode is located, and between the bottom glass plate and the lenticular structure a second electrode is located.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The switchable lens system <b>1</b> can be mounted on a display device. The display device can produce an image, which is viewable through the switchable lens system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">By applying an electric potential between the first and second electrodes, the liquid crystal material within the lenticulars may change its optical properties in such a way that the optical properties of the lenticulars change. The electric field generated by the first and second electrodes can thus control the optical properties of the lenticulars in such a way that the switchable lens system can produce either a 2D or a 3D view from the image of the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The lenticular structure comprises a plurality of line-shaped lens elements that are adjacent to each other in an horizontal direction X and that extend from one side to another side of the imaging area along the vertical direction Y. The lens elements may be slanted with respect to the vertical direction Y. The imaging area <b>10</b>, in particular the lenticular structure, is surrounded by the seal line <b>20</b>, as will be explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A cross-section of the switchable lens system along line II-II is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the layered construction of the switchable lens system <b>1</b> is shown in more detail. On a first glass plate <b>21</b>, a first electrode layer <b>22</b> is located. On top of the first electrode layer <b>22</b>, a lenticular structure <b>23</b> is located. The lenticular structure <b>23</b> comprises a plurality of concave surface shapes <b>23</b><i>a </i>that form line-shaped cavities, which may act as lens elements. The line-shaped cavities <b>24</b>, that show a resemblance to channels with openings at their longitudinal end(s), are filled by liquid crystal material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In practice, for telecom applications, a line-shaped cavity may have a width of about 200 &#x3bc;m and a maximum depth of about 30-40 &#x3bc;m. For other applications, the width and maximum depth may be different, depending on the size of sub-pixels used in such other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At its periphery, the lenticular structure <b>23</b> is surrounded by the seal line <b>20</b>. On top of the cavities <b>24</b> and the seal line <b>20</b>, a second electrode layer <b>25</b> is located. The second electrode layer <b>25</b> is covered by a second glass plate <b>26</b>. Both the first and second electrode layers <b>22</b>, <b>25</b> comprise a transparent conducting material for example ITO (indium-tin-oxide).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is noted that the first and second electrode layers <b>22</b>, <b>25</b> may be patterned to cover either the full imaging area <b>10</b> or at least a portion of the imaging area <b>10</b> so as to enable switching between 2D and 3D imaging modes in the full imaging area and at least a portion of the imaging area, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the exemplary cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the viewing direction is from top to bottom. The switchable lens system <b>1</b> can be combined with a display device that is mounted on the side of the second glass plate <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, filling the cavities <b>24</b> with liquid crystal material is, due to the shape of the cavities, difficult in comparison to filling of a standard LCD without lenticular structure. That is, the cavities resemble tunnels that are bordered by the shape of the lenticular structure and the second electrode layer <b>25</b> and second glass plate <b>26</b> are extending across the imaging area <b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The method for filling the cavities in a switchable lens system is done in a similar way as for an LCD device. Within the seal line <b>20</b> the throughhole <b>30</b> is left open. The switchable lens system is placed in a vacuum chamber and next, by reducing the pressure in the chamber, the cavities between the two glass plates <b>21</b>, <b>26</b> are evacuated. After reaching a sufficiently low pressure, the throughhole <b>30</b> is immersed into a bath containing liquid crystal material. Then, the pressure surrounding the switchable lens system <b>1</b> and the bath with liquid crystal material is increased to a higher pressure (for example, atmospheric pressure) to let the liquid crystal material penetrate and fill the cavities <b>24</b> of the display device. After completion of the filling, the display device is taken from the bath and the throughhole <b>30</b> is closed.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, entities with the same reference number as shown in the preceding figures refer to the corresponding entities in the preceding figures.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To achieve an improvement of the fill process, a representative embodiment of a switchable lens system <b>100</b> of the present invention comprises a imaging area <b>10</b>, a seal line <b>20</b> and a throughhole <b>30</b>, wherein a filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> is located between the seal line and the periphery of the imaging area <b>10</b>. The filling channel provides a connection from the throughhole to the line-shaped cavities at their longitudinal end(s). Advantageously, during the filling process, the filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> improves the influx of liquid crystal material into the line-shaped cavities <b>24</b> between the lenticular structure <b>23</b> and the second electrode layer <b>25</b>, since the filling channel has a relatively large cross-section and provides connection to each line-shaped cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> may surround the periphery of the imaging area <b>10</b> and provide a connection to the line-shaped cavities on one or more of a first, second, third and fourth side <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> of the rectangular imaging area <b>10</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> is located on only two sides <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> of the imaging area <b>10</b> in an arrangement that provides that each of the line-shaped cavities <b>24</b> has on one longitudinal end a single connection to the filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Due to the slant of the line-shaped cavities (lens elements) with respect to the X and Y directions, the cavities have one connection to the filling channel at their longitudinal end on either the first side <b>31</b> of the imaging area <b>10</b> facing the throughhole <b>30</b> or the second side <b>32</b> of the imaging area <b>10</b> bordering on the first side <b>31</b>. The other longitudinal end of each cavity on either a third side <b>33</b> or a fourth side <b>34</b> of the imaging area <b>10</b> is blocked by the seal line <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">So as to provide a single connection of the filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> to each line-shaped cavity <b>24</b>, the filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> is located on the first side <b>31</b> of the imaging area <b>10</b> facing the throughhole <b>30</b> and on the second side <b>32</b> of the imaging area <b>10</b> bordering on the first side <b>31</b> .</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The preferred embodiment has a further advantage due to the fact that by providing a single opening of the filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> to each line-shaped cavity <b>24</b>, the filling of the cavity will proceed along the full length of the line-shaped cavity <b>24</b> across the imaging area <b>10</b>. Any gas bubble(s) that may form from any residual gas/air will be dragged by the penetrating liquid and collected at the side of the line-shaped cavity that is not connected to the filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Note that in case no slant of the line-shaped cavities is present, at least one filling channel is needed at the first side <b>31</b> of the imaging area <b>10</b> facing the throughhole <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The filling channel may be created by providing a spacing between the one or more sides of the lenticular structure and the seal line. Optionally, the filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> may be prefabricated by means of a channel structure on the lenticular structure <b>23</b> along the one or more sides <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> of the lenticular structure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a further option, the pre-fabricated channel structure of the filling channel may comprise a channel edge structure <b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>a </i>on the lenticular structure <b>23</b> along the one or more sides <b>31</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> of the lenticular structure, such that a position of the seal line is controlled by the channel edge structure during application of the seal line. The seal line is arranged to border on the channel edge structure.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> schematically shows a 2D/3D switchable display apparatus <b>300</b> comprises a switchable lens system <b>100</b> and a display device <b>200</b> for producing an image and an electronic device <b>500</b> employing the disclosed 2D/3D switchable display apparatus <b>300</b>. The electronic device <b>500</b> may be a portable device such as a PDA, digital camera, notebook computer, tablet computer, cellular phone, a display monitor device, or similar. Generally, the electronic device <b>500</b> comprises an input unit <b>400</b> and the 2D/3D switchable display apparatus <b>300</b>. Further, the input unit <b>400</b> is operatively coupled to the 2D/3D switchable display apparatus <b>300</b> and provides input signals (e.g., image signal) to the 2D/3D switchable display apparatus <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention also relates to methods of manufacturing switchable lens systems <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, the lenticular structure is arranged in between the first and second glass plates, which, due to the surface shapes of the lenticular structure <b>23</b>, provides a plurality of parallel line-shaped cavities <b>24</b> in between the lenticular structure and one of the first and second glass plates. Then the seal line is created and surrounds the imaging area at its periphery.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the seal line <b>20</b> a throughhole is provided. A filling channel <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> is provided between at least a portion of the periphery of the imaging area and the seal line as a connection between the throughhole and each of the line-shaped cavities.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is noted that a switchable lens system <b>100</b> may have a rectangular form as illustrated, however, it may have a different form, for example, circular, tapered or hexagonal in which the seal line surrounds the imaging area.
