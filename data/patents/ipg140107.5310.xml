<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/260,198, filed on Nov. 11, 2009. The disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to internal combustion engine systems and more particularly to vehicle drivelines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Internal combustion engines combust an air and fuel mixture within cylinders to drive pistons, which produces drive torque. Air flow into spark-ignition engines is regulated via a throttle. More specifically, the throttle adjusts throttle area, which increases or decreases airflow into the engine. As the throttle area increases, the airflow into the engine increases. A fuel control system adjusts the rate that fuel is injected to provide a desired air/fuel mixture to the cylinders. Increasing the amount of air and fuel provided to the cylinders increases the torque output of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Engine control systems have been developed to control engine output torque to achieve a desired torque. Traditional engine control systems, however, do not control the engine output torque as accurately as desired. Further, traditional engine control systems do not provide a rapid response to control signals or coordinate engine torque control among various devices that affect the engine output torque.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A control system for a vehicle, comprises a torque determination module, a control module, and a transmission control module. The torque determination module determines torque produced by an internal combustion engine. The control module sets a signal to an active state when the torque is greater than a predetermined torque and a slip amount between an engine output speed and a transmission input speed is zero. The predetermined torque corresponds to a potential vibration amount when the slip amount is zero. The transmission control module selectively increases the slip amount above zero in response to the setting of the signal to the active state.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A control method for a vehicle comprises: determining torque produced by an internal combustion engine; setting a signal to an active state when the torque is greater than a predetermined torque and a slip amount between an engine output speed and a transmission input speed is zero, wherein the predetermined torque corresponds to a potential vibration amount when the slip amount is zero; and selectively increasing the slip amount above zero in response to the setting of the signal to the active state.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the phrase at least one of A, B, and C should be construed to mean a logical (A or B or C), using a non-exclusive logical or. It should be understood that steps within a method may be executed in different order without altering the principles of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term module refers to an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An engine combusts a mixture of air and fuel to produce torque. Torque output by the engine may be transferred to a transmission via a torque converter. The torque converter may control torque transfer between the engine and the transmission. More specifically, the torque converter may be controlled to regulate a slip amount. The slip amount may refer to a speed difference between an engine output speed and a transmission input speed.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Generally, the torque converter may be controlled to maintain the slip amount at zero to minimize fuel consumption. Under some circumstances, however, vibration may be experienced while the slip amount is zero. For example only, vibration may be experienced when an engine output torque is greater than a predetermined torque at which vibration may be experienced.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A controller according to the present disclosure estimates the engine output torque and selectively increases the slip amount when the torque exceeds the predetermined torque. In this manner, the controller controls the torque converter to prevent vibration that may otherwise be experienced if the slip amount was zero.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a functional block diagram of an exemplary engine system <b>100</b> is presented. The engine system <b>100</b> includes an engine <b>102</b> that combusts an air/fuel mixture to produce drive torque for a vehicle based on driver input from a driver input module <b>104</b>. Air is drawn into an intake manifold <b>110</b> through a throttle valve <b>112</b>. For example only, the throttle valve <b>112</b> may include a butterfly valve having a rotatable blade. An engine control module (ECM) <b>114</b> controls a throttle actuator module <b>116</b>, which regulates opening of the throttle valve <b>112</b> to control the amount of air drawn into the intake manifold <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Air from the intake manifold <b>110</b> is drawn into cylinders of the engine <b>102</b>. While the engine <b>102</b> may include multiple cylinders, for illustration purposes a single representative cylinder <b>118</b> is shown. For example only, the engine <b>102</b> may include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and/or 12 cylinders. The ECM <b>114</b> may instruct a cylinder actuator module <b>120</b> to selectively deactivate some of the cylinders, which may improve fuel economy under certain engine operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The engine <b>102</b> may operate using a four-stroke cylinder cycle. The four strokes, described below, may be referred to as the intake stroke, the compression stroke, the combustion stroke, and the exhaust stroke. During each revolution of a crankshaft (not shown), two of the four strokes occur within the cylinder <b>118</b>. Therefore, two crankshaft revolutions are necessary for the cylinder <b>118</b> to experience all four of the strokes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">During the intake stroke, air from the intake manifold <b>110</b> is drawn into the cylinder <b>118</b> through an intake valve <b>122</b>. The ECM <b>114</b> controls a fuel actuator module <b>124</b>, which regulates fuel injection to achieve a desired air/fuel ratio. Fuel may be injected into the intake manifold <b>110</b> at a central location or at multiple locations, such as near the intake valve <b>122</b> of each of the cylinders. In various implementations (not shown), fuel may be injected directly into the cylinders or into mixing chambers associated with the cylinders. The fuel actuator module <b>124</b> may halt injection of fuel to cylinders that are deactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The injected fuel mixes with air and creates an air/fuel mixture in the cylinder <b>118</b>. During the compression stroke, a piston (not shown) within the cylinder <b>118</b> compresses the air/fuel mixture. Based on a signal from the ECM <b>114</b>, a spark actuator module <b>126</b> energizes a spark plug <b>128</b> in the cylinder <b>118</b>, which ignites the air/fuel mixture. The timing of the spark may be specified relative to the time when the piston is at its topmost position, referred to as top dead center (TDC).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The spark actuator module <b>126</b> may be controlled by a timing signal specifying how far before or after TDC to generate the spark. Because piston position is directly related to crankshaft rotation, operation of the spark actuator module <b>126</b> may be synchronized with crankshaft angle. In various implementations, the spark actuator module <b>126</b> may halt provision of spark to deactivated cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Generating the spark may be referred to as a firing event. The spark actuator module <b>126</b> may have the ability to vary the timing of the spark for each firing event. In addition, the spark actuator module <b>126</b> may have the ability to vary the timing of the spark for a given firing event even when a change in the timing signal is received after the firing event immediately before the given firing event.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">During the combustion stroke, the combustion of the air/fuel mixture drives the piston down, thereby driving the crankshaft. The combustion stroke may be defined as the time between the piston reaching TDC and the time at which the piston returns to bottom dead center (BDC). During the exhaust stroke, the piston begins moving up from BDC and expels the byproducts of combustion through an exhaust valve <b>130</b>. The byproducts of combustion are exhausted from the vehicle via an exhaust system <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The intake valve <b>122</b> may be controlled by an intake camshaft <b>140</b>, while the exhaust valve <b>130</b> may be controlled by an exhaust camshaft <b>142</b>. In various implementations, multiple intake camshafts (including the intake camshaft <b>140</b>) may control multiple intake valves (including the intake valve <b>122</b>) for the cylinder <b>118</b> and/or may control the intake valves (including the intake valve <b>122</b>) of multiple banks of cylinders (including the cylinder <b>118</b>). Similarly, multiple exhaust camshafts (including the exhaust camshaft <b>142</b>) may control multiple exhaust valves for the cylinder <b>118</b> and/or may control exhaust valves (including the exhaust valve <b>130</b>) for multiple banks of cylinders (including the cylinder <b>118</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The cylinder actuator module <b>120</b> may deactivate the cylinder <b>118</b> by disabling opening of the intake valve <b>122</b> and/or the exhaust valve <b>130</b>. In various other implementations, the intake valve <b>122</b> and/or the exhaust valve <b>130</b> may be controlled by devices other than camshafts, such as electromagnetic actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The time at which the intake valve <b>122</b> is opened may be varied with respect to piston TDC by an intake cam phaser <b>148</b>. The time at which the exhaust valve <b>130</b> is opened may be varied with respect to piston TDC by an exhaust cam phaser <b>150</b>. A phaser actuator module <b>158</b> may control the intake cam phaser <b>148</b> and the exhaust cam phaser <b>150</b> based on signals from the ECM <b>114</b>. When implemented, variable valve actuation (not shown) may also be controlled by the phaser actuator module <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The engine system <b>100</b> may include a boost device that provides pressurized air to the intake manifold <b>110</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a turbocharger including a hot turbine <b>160</b>-<b>1</b> that is powered by hot exhaust gases flowing through the exhaust system <b>134</b>. The turbocharger also includes a cold air compressor <b>160</b>-<b>2</b>, driven by the turbine <b>160</b>-<b>1</b>, that compresses air leading into the throttle valve <b>112</b>.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A wastegate <b>162</b> may allow exhaust to bypass the turbine <b>160</b>-<b>1</b>, thereby reducing the boost (the amount of intake air compression) of the turbocharger. The ECM <b>114</b> may control the turbocharger via a boost actuator module <b>164</b>. The boost actuator module <b>164</b> may modulate the boost of the turbocharger by controlling the position of the wastegate <b>162</b>. In various implementations, multiple turbochargers may be controlled by the boost actuator module <b>164</b>. The turbocharger may have variable geometry, which may be controlled by the boost actuator module <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An intercooler (not shown) may dissipate some of the heat contained in the compressed air charge, which is generated as the air is compressed.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The engine system <b>100</b> may include an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve <b>170</b>, which selectively redirects exhaust gas back to the intake manifold <b>110</b>. The EGR valve <b>170</b> may be located upstream of the turbocharger's turbine <b>160</b>-<b>1</b>. The EGR valve <b>170</b> may be controlled by an EGR actuator module <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The engine system <b>100</b> may measure position of the crankshaft using a crankshaft position sensor <b>178</b>. Temperature of engine oil may be measured using an oil temperature (OT) sensor <b>180</b>. Temperature of engine coolant may be measured using an engine coolant temperature (ECT) sensor <b>182</b>. The ECT sensor <b>182</b> may be located within the engine <b>102</b> or at other locations where the coolant is circulated, such as a radiator (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pressure within the intake manifold <b>110</b> may be measured using a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor <b>184</b>. In various implementations, engine vacuum, which is the difference between ambient air pressure and the pressure within the intake manifold <b>110</b>, may be measured. The mass flow rate of air flowing into the intake manifold <b>110</b> may be measured using a mass air flowrate (MAF) sensor <b>186</b>. In various implementations, the MAF sensor <b>186</b> may be located in a housing that also includes the throttle valve <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The throttle actuator module <b>116</b> may monitor the position of the throttle valve <b>112</b> using one or more throttle position sensors (TPS) <b>190</b>. The ambient temperature of air being drawn into the engine <b>102</b> may be measured using an intake air temperature (IAT) sensor <b>192</b>. The ECM <b>114</b> may use signals from one or more of the sensors to make control decisions for the engine system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ECM <b>114</b> may communicate with a transmission control module <b>194</b> to coordinate shifting gears (and more specifically gear ratio) selected a transmission <b>195</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). For example, the ECM <b>114</b> may reduce engine torque during a gear shift. The ECM <b>114</b> may also communicate with a hybrid control module <b>196</b> to coordinate operation (i.e., torque output production) of the engine <b>102</b> and an electric motor <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The electric motor <b>198</b> may also function as a generator, and may be used to produce electrical energy for use by vehicle electrical systems and/or for storage in an energy storage device (e.g., a battery). The production of electrical energy may be referred to as regenerative braking. The electric motor <b>198</b> may apply a braking (i.e., negative) torque on the engine <b>102</b> to perform regenerative braking. The engine system <b>100</b> may also include one or more additional electric motors. In various implementations, various functions of the ECM <b>114</b>, the transmission control module <b>194</b>, and the hybrid control module <b>196</b> may be integrated into one or more modules.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each system that varies an engine parameter may be referred to as an engine actuator. Each engine actuator receives an associated actuator value. For example, the throttle actuator module <b>116</b> may be referred to as an engine actuator and the throttle opening area may be referred to as the associated actuator value. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the throttle actuator module <b>116</b> achieves the throttle opening area by adjusting an angle of the blade of the throttle valve <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Similarly, the spark actuator module <b>126</b> may be referred to as an engine actuator, while the associated actuator value may be the amount of spark advance relative to cylinder TDC. Other actuators may include the cylinder actuator module <b>120</b>, the fuel actuator module <b>124</b>, the phaser actuator module <b>158</b>, the boost actuator module <b>164</b>, and the EGR actuator module <b>172</b>. For these engine actuators, the associated actuator values may include to number of activated cylinders, fueling rate, intake and exhaust cam phaser angles, boost pressure, and EGR valve opening area, respectively. The ECM <b>114</b> may control actuator values in order to cause the engine <b>102</b> to generate a desired engine output torque.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the engine <b>102</b> may transfer torque to the transmission <b>195</b> via a torque converter <b>197</b>. The torque converter <b>197</b> may include a torque converter clutch (not shown) that may be selectively actuated to couple and de-couple the engine and the transmission <b>195</b>. The torque converter <b>197</b> may be said to be in a locked state when the torque converter clutch is actuated to couple the engine <b>102</b> and the transmission <b>195</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Under some circumstances, the torque converter <b>197</b> may be controlled to create a condition referred to as slip. Slip may be said to occur when an input shaft (not shown) of the transmission <b>195</b> slips (i.e., slows) with respect to an output shaft of the engine <b>102</b> (e.g., the crankshaft). In other words, slip may be said to occur when the torque converter <b>197</b> is controlled to allow a transmission input speed to become slower than an engine output speed. The torque converter <b>197</b> may be said to be in the unlocked state when the slip amount reaches a predetermined maximum slip amount. For example only, the predetermined maximum slip amount may be approximately 1000 rpm. Conversely, the torque converter <b>197</b> may be said to be in the locked state when the slip amount is zero.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The transmission control module <b>194</b> may control actuation of the torque converter <b>197</b>. The transmission control module <b>194</b> may also control the gear ratio that is selected (i.e., engaged) within the transmission <b>195</b> and other parameters. The transmission control module <b>194</b> may selectively communicate data to the ECM <b>114</b>, such as the gear ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Based on the gear ratio selected within the transmission <b>195</b>, torque may be transferred to a driveline <b>199</b>, which selectively transfers torque to one or more wheels of the vehicle. For example only, the driveline <b>199</b> may include one or more axles, one or more differentials, and other suitable components. The transmission control module <b>194</b> and the ECM <b>114</b> may control the engine <b>102</b>, the transmission <b>195</b>, and/or the torque converter <b>197</b> to, among other things, minimize vibration experienced within a passenger cabin of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a functional block diagram of an exemplary engine control system <b>200</b> is presented. An exemplary implementation of the ECM <b>114</b> includes a driver torque module <b>202</b>. The driver torque module <b>202</b> may determine a driver torque request based on driver input(s) from the driver input module <b>104</b>. The driver input may be based on a position of an accelerator pedal. The driver input may also be based on cruise control, which may be an adaptive cruise control system that varies vehicle speed to maintain a predetermined following distance. The driver torque module <b>202</b> may store one or more mappings of accelerator pedal position to driver torque request, and may determine the driver torque request based on a selected one of the mappings.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An axle torque arbitration module <b>204</b> arbitrates between the driver torque request from the driver torque module <b>202</b> and other axle torque requests. Torque requests may include absolute torque requests as well as relative torque requests and ramp requests. For example only, ramp requests may include a request to ramp torque down to a minimum engine off torque or to ramp torque up from the minimum engine off torque. Relative torque requests may include temporary or persistent torque reductions or increases. Each torque request may include data indicating the system or module that generated that torque request (i.e., the requestor).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Axle torque requests may include a torque reduction requested by a traction control system when positive wheel slip is detected. Positive wheel slip occurs when axle torque overcomes friction between the wheels and the road surface, and the wheels begin to slip against the road surface in a forward direction. Axle torque requests may also include a torque increase request to counteract negative wheel slip, where a tire of the vehicle slips in a reverse direction with respect to the road surface because the axle torque is negative.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Axle torque requests may also include brake management requests and vehicle over-speed torque requests. Brake management requests may reduce the engine output torque to ensure that the engine output torque does not exceed the ability of the brakes to hold the vehicle when the vehicle is stopped. Vehicle over-speed torque requests may reduce the engine output torque to prevent the vehicle from exceeding a predetermined speed. Axle torque requests may also be generated by vehicle stability control systems.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The axle torque arbitration module <b>204</b> outputs a predicted torque request and an immediate torque request based on the results of arbitrating between the received torque requests. As described below, the predicted and immediate torque requests from the axle torque arbitration module <b>204</b> may selectively be adjusted by other modules before being used to control actuators of the engine <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In general terms, the immediate torque request is the amount of currently desired engine output torque, while the predicted torque request is the amount of engine output torque that may be needed on short notice. The ECM <b>114</b> therefore controls the engine <b>102</b> to produce an engine output torque equal to the immediate torque request. However, different combinations of actuator values may result in the same engine output torque. The ECM <b>114</b> may therefore control the actuator values to allow a faster transition to the predicted torque request, while still maintaining the engine output torque at the immediate torque request.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In various implementations, the predicted torque request may be based on the driver torque request. The immediate torque request may be less than the predicted torque request, such as when the driver torque request is causing positive wheel slip on an icy (i.e., low coefficient of friction) surface. In such a case, a traction control system (not shown) may request a reduction via the immediate torque request, and the ECM <b>114</b> reduces the torque produced by the engine <b>102</b> to the immediate torque request. However, the ECM <b>114</b> controls the engine actuators so that the engine <b>102</b> can quickly resume producing the predicted torque request once the positive wheel slip stops.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In general terms, the difference between the immediate torque request and the predicted torque request can be referred to as a torque reserve. The torque reserve represents the amount of torque more than the immediate torque request that the engine <b>102</b> can begin to produce with minimal delay. Fast engine actuators are used to increase or decrease the engine output torque. As described in more detail below, fast engine actuators are defined based on their ability to produce a response in the engine output torque relative to slow engine actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In various implementations, fast engine actuators are capable of varying engine output torque within a range, where the range is established by the slow engine actuators. In such implementations, the upper limit of the range is the predicted torque request, while the lower limit of the range is limited by the torque capacity of the fast engine actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example only, fast engine actuators may only be able to reduce engine output torque by a first amount, where the first amount is a measure of the torque capacity of the fast actuators. The first amount may vary based on engine operating conditions set by the slow engine actuators. When the immediate torque request is within the range, fast engine actuators can be set to cause the engine output torque to be equal to the immediate torque request. When the ECM <b>114</b> requests the predicted torque request to be output, the fast engine actuators can be controlled to vary the engine output torque to the upper limit of the range, which is the predicted torque request.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In general terms, fast engine actuators can change the engine output torque more quickly than slow engine actuators can. Slow engine actuators may respond more slowly to changes in their respective actuator values than fast engine actuators do. For example, a slow engine actuator may include mechanical components that require time to move from one position to another in response to a change in the associated actuator value.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A slow engine actuator may also be characterized by the amount of time it takes for the engine output torque to begin to change once the slow engine actuator begins to implement the changed actuator value. Generally, this amount of time will be longer for slow engine actuators than for fast engine actuators. In addition, even after the engine output torque begins to change, the engine output torque may take longer to reach an engine output torque that is expected to result from the changed actuator value.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example only, the ECM <b>114</b> may set actuator values for slow engine actuators to values that would enable the engine <b>102</b> to produce the predicted torque request if the fast engine actuators were set to appropriate values. Meanwhile, the ECM <b>114</b> may set actuator values for fast engine actuators to values that, given the slow actuator values, cause the engine <b>102</b> to produce the immediate torque request instead of the predicted torque request.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The fast actuator values therefore cause the engine <b>102</b> to produce the immediate torque request. When the ECM <b>114</b> decides to transition the engine output torque from the immediate torque request to the predicted torque request, the ECM <b>114</b> changes the actuator values associated with one or more fast engine actuators to values that correspond to the predicted torque request. Because the actuator values associated with the slow engine actuators have already been set based on the predicted torque request, the engine <b>102</b> is able to produce the predicted torque request after only the delay attributable to the fast engine actuators. In other words, the longer delay that would otherwise result from changing engine output torque using slow engine actuators is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example only, when the predicted torque request is equal to the driver torque request, a torque reserve may be created when the immediate torque request is less than the drive torque request due to a temporary torque reduction request. Alternatively, a torque reserve may be created by increasing the predicted torque request above the driver torque request while maintaining the immediate torque request at the driver torque request.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The resulting torque reserve can be used to offset sudden increases in required engine output torque. For example only, sudden loads from an air conditioner or a power steering pump may be offset by increasing the immediate torque request. If the increase in immediate torque request is less than the torque reserve, the increase can be quickly produced by using fast engine actuators. The predicted torque request may then also be increased to re-establish the previous torque reserve.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Another exemplary use of a torque reserve is to reduce fluctuations in slow actuator values. Because of their relatively slow speed, varying slow actuator values may produce control instability. In addition, slow engine actuators may include mechanical parts, which may draw more power and/or wear more quickly when moved frequently.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Creating a sufficient torque reserve allows changes in desired torque to be made by varying fast engine actuators via the immediate torque request while maintaining the values of the slow engine actuators. For example only, to maintain a given idle speed, the immediate torque request may vary within a range. If the predicted torque request is set to a level above this range, variations in the immediate torque request that maintain the idle speed can be made using fast engine actuators without the need to adjust slow engine actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example only, in a spark-ignition engine, spark timing may be a fast actuator value, while throttle opening area may be a slow actuator value. Spark-ignition engines may combust fuels including, for example, gasoline and ethanol, by applying a spark. By contrast, a compression-ignition engine may combust fuels including, for example, diesel, by compressing the fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">After receiving a new actuator value, the spark actuator module <b>126</b> may be able to change spark timing for the following firing event. When the spark timing (also called spark advance) for a firing event is set to a calibrated value, a maximum torque is produced in the combustion stroke immediately following the firing event.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">However, a spark advance deviating from the calibrated value may reduce the amount of torque produced in the combustion stroke. Therefore, the spark actuator module <b>126</b> may be able to vary engine output torque as soon as the next firing event occurs by varying the spark timing. For example only, a table of spark timings corresponding to different engine operating conditions may be determined during a calibration phase of vehicle design, and the calibrated value is selected from the table based on current engine operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">By contrast, changes in throttle opening area take longer to affect the engine output torque. The throttle actuator module <b>116</b> changes the throttle opening area by adjusting the angle of the blade of the throttle valve <b>112</b>. Therefore, once a new actuator value is received, there is a mechanical delay as the throttle valve <b>112</b> moves from its previous position to a new position based on the new actuator value. In addition, airflow changes based on the throttle valve opening are subject to air transport delays in the intake manifold <b>110</b>. Further, increased airflow into the intake manifold <b>110</b> is not realized as an increase in engine output torque until the cylinder <b>118</b> receives additional air in the next intake stroke, compresses the additional air, and commences the combustion stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Using the throttle opening area and the spark timing in an example, a torque reserve can be created by setting the throttle opening area to a value that would allow the engine <b>102</b> to produce a predicted torque request. Meanwhile, the spark timing can be set based on an immediate torque request that is less than the predicted torque request. Although the throttle opening area generates enough airflow for the engine <b>102</b> to produce the predicted torque request, the spark timing is retarded (which reduces the engine output torque) based on the immediate torque request. The engine output torque will therefore be equal to the immediate torque request.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When additional torque is needed, such as when the air conditioning compressor is engaged, or when traction control determines that wheel slip has ended, the spark timing can be set based on the predicted torque request. By the following firing event, the spark actuator module <b>126</b> may return the spark timing to a calibrated value, which allows the engine <b>102</b> to produce the maximum engine output torque. The engine output torque may therefore be quickly increased to the predicted torque request without experiencing delays from changing the throttle opening area.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The axle torque arbitration module <b>204</b> may output the predicted torque request and the immediate torque request to a propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b>. Depending on the type of hybrid vehicle, the axle torque arbitration module <b>204</b> may output the predicted and immediate torque requests to the hybrid control module <b>196</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The predicted and immediate torque requests received by the propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b> are converted from an axle torque domain (torque at the wheels) into a propulsion torque domain (torque at the crankshaft). In some implementations, the predicted and immediate torque requests may be converted into the propulsion torque domain before being provided to the propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b>. In some implementations, the predicted and immediate torque requests in the propulsion torque domain may be provided to the hybrid control module <b>196</b>. The hybrid control module <b>196</b> may control the electric motor <b>198</b> based on one or more of the torque requests and may provide modified predicted and immediate torque requests to the propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b> arbitrates between propulsion torque requests, including the converted predicted and immediate torque requests. The propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b> generates an arbitrated predicted torque request and an arbitrated immediate torque request based on the arbitration. The arbitrated torque requests may be generated by selecting a winning request from among received requests. Alternatively or additionally, the arbitrated torque requests may be generated by modifying one of the received requests based on another one or more of the received requests.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Other propulsion torque requests may include torque reductions for engine over-speed protection, torque increases for stall prevention, and torque reductions requested by the transmission control module <b>194</b> to accommodate gear shifts. The other propulsion torque requests may also include an engine shutoff request, which may be initiated when a critical fault is detected. For example only, critical faults may include detection of vehicle theft, a stuck starter motor, electronic throttle control problems, and unexpected torque increases. In various implementations, when an engine shutoff request is present, arbitration selects the engine shutoff request as the winning request. When the engine shutoff request is present, the propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b> may output zero as the arbitrated torques.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In various implementations, an engine shutoff request may simply shut down the engine <b>102</b> separately from the arbitration process. The propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b> may still receive the engine shutoff request so that, for example, appropriate data can be fed back to other torque requestors. For example, all other requestors may be informed that they have lost arbitration.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A reserves/loads module <b>220</b> receives the arbitrated predicted and immediate torque requests from the propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b>. The reserves/loads module <b>220</b> may adjust the arbitrated predicted and immediate torque requests to create a torque reserve and/or to compensate for one or more loads imposed on the engine <b>102</b>. The reserves/loads module <b>220</b> then outputs the adjusted predicted and immediate torque requests to an actuation module <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The actuation module <b>224</b> receives the predicted and immediate torque requests from the reserves/loads module <b>220</b>. The actuation module <b>224</b> determines how the predicted and immediate torque requests will be achieved. The actuation module <b>224</b> may be engine type specific. For example, the actuation module <b>224</b> may be implemented differently or use different control schemes for spark-ignition engines versus compression-ignition engines.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In various implementations, the actuation module <b>224</b> may define a boundary between modules that are common across all engine types and modules that are engine type specific. For example, engine types may include spark-ignition and compression-ignition. Modules prior to the actuation module <b>224</b>, such as the propulsion torque arbitration module <b>206</b>, may be common across engine types, while the actuation module <b>224</b> and subsequent modules may be engine type specific.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, in a spark-ignition engine, the actuation module <b>224</b> may vary the opening of the throttle valve <b>112</b> as a slow engine actuator that allows for a wide range of torque control. The actuation module <b>224</b> may disable cylinders using the cylinder actuator module <b>120</b>, which also provides for a wide range of torque control, but may also be slow and may involve drivability and emissions concerns. The actuation module <b>224</b> may use spark timing as a fast engine actuator. However, spark timing may not provide as much range of torque control. In addition, the amount of torque control possible with changes in spark timing (referred to as spark reserve capacity) may vary as one or more airflow conditions change.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In various implementations, the actuation module <b>224</b> may generate an air torque request based on the predicted torque request. The air torque request may be equal to the predicted torque request, thereby controlling engine airflow actuators so that the adjusted predicted torque request can be rapidly achieved by adjusting one or more actuator values associated with fast engine actuators.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">An air control module <b>228</b> may determine desired actuator values for the engine airflow actuators based on the air torque request. For example, the air control module <b>228</b> may determine a desired manifold absolute pressure (MAP), a desired throttle area, and/or a desired air per cylinder (APC). The desired MAP may be used to determine desired boost, and the desired APC may be used to determine desired cam phaser positions. In various implementations, the air control module <b>228</b> may also determine a desired opening of the EGR valve <b>170</b> and other engine airflow parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The actuation module <b>224</b> may also generate a spark torque request, a cylinder shut-off torque request, and a fuel mass torque request. For example only, the actuation module <b>224</b> may generate the spark torque request, the cylinder shut-off torque request, and/or the fuel mass torque request based on the immediate torque request.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The spark torque request may be used by a spark control module <b>232</b> to determine how much to retard the spark timing (which reduces the engine output torque) from a calibrated spark advance. The cylinder shut-off torque request may be used by a cylinder control module <b>236</b> to determine how many cylinders to deactivate. The cylinder control module <b>236</b> may instruct the cylinder actuator module <b>120</b> to deactivate one or more cylinders of the engine <b>102</b>. In various implementations, a predefined group of cylinders may be deactivated jointly.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The cylinder control module <b>236</b> may also instruct a fuel control module <b>240</b> to stop providing fuel for deactivated cylinders and may instruct the spark control module <b>232</b> to stop providing spark for deactivated cylinders. In various implementations, the spark control module <b>232</b> only stops providing spark for a cylinder once any fuel/air mixture already present in the cylinder has been combusted.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In various implementations, the cylinder actuator module <b>120</b> may include a hydraulic system that selectively decouples intake and/or exhaust valves from the corresponding camshafts for one or more cylinders in order to deactivate those cylinders. For example only, valves for half of the cylinders are either hydraulically coupled or decoupled as a group by the cylinder actuator module <b>120</b>. In various implementations, cylinders may be deactivated simply by halting provision of fuel to those cylinders, without stopping the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves. In such implementations, the cylinder actuator module <b>120</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The fuel control module <b>240</b> may vary the amount of fuel provided to each cylinder based on the fuel mass torque request from the actuation module <b>224</b>. During normal operation of a spark-ignition engine, the fuel control module <b>240</b> may attempt to maintain a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio. The fuel control module <b>240</b> may therefore determine a fuel mass that will yield stoichiometric combustion when combined with the current APC. The fuel control module <b>240</b> may instruct the fuel actuator module <b>124</b> to inject this fuel mass for each activated cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Based on the fuel mass torque request, the fuel control module <b>240</b> may adjust the air/fuel ratio with respect to stoichiometry to increase or decrease engine output torque.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">This relationship may be modeled by an equation and/or may be stored as a lookup table. The torque estimation module <b>244</b> may determine the APC based on the MAF and the RPM, thereby allowing closed-loop control of the engine airflow parameters control based on current engine airflow conditions. The intake and exhaust cam phaser positions used may be based on actual positions, as the phasers may be traveling toward desired positions.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The torque estimation module <b>244</b> may use the actual spark advance to estimate the engine output torque. When a calibrated spark advance value is used to estimate the engine output torque, the estimated torque may be called an estimated air torque, or simply air torque. The air torque is an estimate of how much torque the engine <b>102</b> could generate with the current airflow conditions if spark retard was removed (i.e., spark timing was set to the calibrated spark advance value) and all cylinders were fueled.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The air control module <b>228</b> may output a desired area signal to the throttle actuator module <b>116</b>. The throttle actuator module <b>116</b> then regulates the throttle valve <b>112</b> to produce the desired throttle area.

The air control module <b>228</b> may use the estimated air torque and/or the MAF signal in order to perform closed-loop control of the engine airflow actuators.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">When the spark advance is set to the calibrated spark advance, the resulting torque may be as close to a mean best torque (MBT) as possible. MBT refers to the maximum engine output torque that is achievable for a given engine airflow conditions as spark advance is increased, while using fuel having an octane rating greater than a predetermined octane rating and using stoichiometric fueling. The spark advance at which the MBT occurs is referred to as MBT spark timing. The calibrated spark advance may differ slightly from MBT spark timing because of, for example, fuel quality (such as when lower octane fuel is used) and environmental factors. The engine output torque produced using the calibrated spark advance may therefore be less than the MBT.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A brake torque estimation module <b>282</b> may estimate the brake torque. The brake torque may correspond to torque at a flywheel (or crankshaft) that may be used by the propulsion system. For example only, the propulsion system may use torque at the flywheel to drive the transmission <b>195</b>, the driveline <b>199</b>, the wheels, etc. The brake torque may also be referred to as crankshaft torque. In operation, the brake torque is the torque that is transferred from the engine <b>102</b> to the torque converter <b>197</b>. The torque converter <b>197</b> may multiply the brake torque if the slip amount is greater than zero and provide torque to the transmission <b>195</b>.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The brake torque estimation module <b>282</b> may estimate the brake torque by adjusting the base brake torque based on an engine friction adjustment and an accessory load adjustment. For example only, the brake torque estimation module <b>282</b> may estimate the brake torque by subtracting the engine friction adjustment and the accessory load adjustment from the base brake torque. The engine friction adjustment (e.g., Nm) may be determined based on the ECT and/or the OT. For example only, the engine friction adjustment may increase (resulting in a lower brake torque) as the ECT and/or the OT decrease. The accessory load adjustment (e.g., Nm) may be determined based on the accessory loads or may be equal to the accessory loads.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">A friction torque losses module <b>284</b> may estimate the friction torque losses (Nm). The friction torque losses may correspond to torque losses attributable to friction.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A pumping torque losses module <b>286</b> may estimate the pumping torque losses (Nm). The pumping torque losses may correspond to torque losses associated with engine pumping. More specifically, the pumping torque losses may include torque losses associated with drawing air through the throttle valve <b>112</b>, drawing air into the cylinders, the damping effect that the contents of the cylinders may have, and other sources of pumping torque losses. The pumping losses torque module <b>286</b> may estimate the pumping torque losses based on the engine vacuum.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The non-constant production of torque inherent in internal combustion engines may cause vibration that may be noticeable within a passenger cabin of the vehicle.

The vibration control module <b>280</b> may command the transmission control module <b>194</b> to relax the stiffness of the driveline <b>199</b> via a relaxation signal. More specifically, the vibration control module <b>280</b> may set the relaxation signal to an active state (e.g., 5 V) to command relaxation of the driveline <b>199</b>. Otherwise, the relaxation signal may be set to an inactive state (e.g., 0 V).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When commanding relaxation of the driveline <b>199</b>, the vibration control module <b>280</b> may also specify an amount of relaxation to be performed. The vibration control module <b>280</b> may specify the amount (e.g., level) of relaxation to be performed using a relaxation amount signal. The vibration control module <b>280</b> may specify relaxation, for example, in one of a predetermined number of relaxation amounts. For example only, the vibration control module <b>280</b> may specify one of three relaxation amounts: a first relaxation amount, a second relaxation amount, and a third relaxation amount.

The transmission control module <b>194</b> may gradually increase the slip amount until the torque converter <b>197</b> reaches the unlocked state for the second relaxation amount. The transmission control module <b>194</b> may transition the torque converter <b>197</b> to the unlocked state as quickly as possible for the third relaxation amount. In this manner, as the vibration that may potentially be experienced increases, a greater amount of relaxation may be performed to prevent such vibration from being experienced.</p>
