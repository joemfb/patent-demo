<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/234,849 entitled BLADE OUTER AIR SEAL filed on Aug. 18, 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The described subject matter relates generally to gas turbine engines and more particularly, to a blade outer air seal of gas turbine engines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical gas turbine engine includes a fan, compressor, combustor and turbine disposed along a common longitudinal axis. In most cases, the turbine includes several stages, each having a rotor assembly and at least one stationary vane assembly located forward and/or aft of the rotor assembly to guide the hot gas flow entering and/or exiting the rotor assemblies. Each rotor assembly includes a static turbine shroud around the turbine rotor to form a blade outer air seal (BOAS) in order to guide the hot gas flow passing through the turbine rotor. The turbine shroud is supported by a support structure within a core case of the engine. The BOAS works in the hot section of the engine and is subject to elevated temperatures. Therefore, efforts have been made to improve the BOAS configuration in order to limit and/or properly transfer loads caused by dissimilar thermal expansion within the engine, thereby providing an axially straight tip clearance above the blades of the turbine rotor and maintaining appropriate tip clearance of the turbine blades, which has a significant affect on engine performance. The efforts for improving the BOAS involve both a load transfer issue and a cooling issue of the BOAS.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need to provide an improved BOAS.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect, the described subject matter provides a blade outer air seal assembly of a gas turbine engine having a main axis of rotation defining axial, radial and circumferential directions, the blade outer air seal assembly comprising an array of circumferentially adjacent blade outer air seal segments forming a static turbine shroud surrounding a turbine rotor; and an array of blade outer air seal support segments forming a support ring around the turbine shroud, each of the support segments supporting at least one of the blade outer air seal segments and defining a recess on respective opposed circumferential sides of each of the support segments, the turbine shroud defining a cooling air distribution system for directing cooling air to pass through the respective support segments and to be discharged onto the blade outer air seal segments, the cooling air distribution system including a plurality of inlet cavities extending axially and inwardly from a forward end of the support ring to communicate with an inner cooling air passage of the respective support segments, each of the inlet cavities being formed with two of said recesses defined in respective adjacent two of said blade outer air seal support segments.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another aspect, the described subject matter provides a blade outer air seal support segment for supporting at least one of a plurality of blade outer air seal segments which in combination form a static turbine shroud within a blade outer air seal assembly of a gas turbine engine, the engine having a main axis of rotation defining axial, radial and circumferential directions, the blade outer air seal support segment comprising a forward end and a rearward end, opposed circumferential sides, a radially inner side and a radially outer side, the radially inner side adapted to be connected to the at least one blade outer air seal segment; a circumferential wall extending between the forward and rearward ends and between the opposed circumferential sides to define a dump plenum within the support segment, the dump plenum having an opening at the radially inner side, and the dump plenum being in fluid communication with a space within the support segment; an impingement baffle plate having a plurality of holes extending therethrough, attached to the opening of the dump plenum; and an inlet recess defined on one of the opposed circumferential sides in fluid communication with at least one air passage extending through a part of the support segment leading to the space within the support segment, the inlet recess defining an opening on the forward end for intake of cooling air into the support segment, the cooling air being discharged through the holes of the impingement baffle plate.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a turbofan gas turbine engine which includes a nacelle configuration <b>10</b>, a core casing <b>13</b>, a low pressure spool assembly seen generally at <b>12</b> which includes a fan assembly <b>14</b>, a low pressure compressor assembly <b>16</b> and a low pressure turbine assembly <b>18</b>, and a high pressure spool assembly seen generally at <b>20</b> which includes a high pressure compressor assembly <b>22</b> and a high pressure turbine assembly <b>24</b>. The core casing <b>13</b> surrounds the low and high pressure spool assemblies <b>12</b> and <b>20</b> in order to define a main fluid path (not indicated) therethrough. In the main fluid path there is provided a combustion chamber <b>26</b> in which a combustion process takes place, producing combustion gases for powering the high and low pressure turbine assemblies <b>24</b>, and <b>18</b>. The engine has a main axis <b>28</b> of rotation and therefore, axial, radial and circumferential/tangential directions mentioned in this description and appended claims are defined with respect to this axis <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the engine further includes a static vane ring assembly <b>30</b> axially positioned between the combustion chamber <b>26</b> and a turbine assembly, for example the high pressure turbine assembly <b>24</b> for directing combustion gases from the combustion chamber <b>26</b> to pass through the high pressure turbine assembly <b>24</b>. The vane ring assembly <b>30</b> and the high pressure turbine assembly <b>24</b> are both supported within an outer case <b>32</b> which may be part of the core casing <b>13</b>. The turbine assembly <b>24</b> includes a blade outer air seal (BOAS) assembly <b>34</b> having an array of circumferentially adjacent BOAS segments <b>36</b> (only one shown) forming a static turbine shroud (not indicated) surrounding a turbine rotor <b>38</b>. The BOAS assembly <b>34</b> further includes an array of circumferentially adjacent BOAS support segments <b>40</b> (only one shown) forming a static support ring (not indicated) around the array of BOAS segments <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-6</figref>, each of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b> has a forward end <b>42</b> (upstream end) and a rearward end <b>44</b> (downstream end) with respect to the gas flow passing through the turbines, opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, a radially inner side <b>50</b> and radially outer side <b>52</b>. The one or more BOAS segments <b>36</b> are connected to the radially inner side <b>50</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. A pair of BOAS segments <b>36</b> is connected to one BOAS support segment <b>40</b>, according to this embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The radially outer side <b>52</b> provides a radially outwardly abutting surface (not indicated) to support the support ring formed by the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>, within the outer case <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The BOAS support segment <b>40</b> has a hollow configuration and may include a circumferential wall <b>54</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) extending between the forward and rearward ends <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> and between the opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> to define an inner space <b>56</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) at a radial and outward portion of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. The inner space <b>56</b> is substantially open at both the radially outer side <b>52</b> and at the rearward end <b>44</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. The circumferential wall <b>54</b> also defines a cavity <b>58</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>) at a radial and inner portion of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. The cavity <b>58</b> defines an opening (not indicated) at the radially inner side <b>50</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. A radial wall <b>60</b> is positioned at the forward end <b>42</b> and extends circumferentially between the opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. A circumferential flange segment <b>62</b> extends axially forwardly from a radially outer end of the circumferentially extending radial wall <b>60</b> to thereby in combination with the radial wall <b>60</b>, form a front leg <b>64</b> (only indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) having an inverted L-shaped cross-section, for engagement with the outer case <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A pair of radially and outwardly extending elongated rear prongs <b>66</b> are positioned axially at the rearward end <b>44</b> and circumferentially at the respective opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. Each of the rear prongs <b>66</b> provides a surface at its radially outer end to radially and outwardly abut the outer case <b>32</b>. The two rear prongs <b>66</b> are circumferentially spaced apart, therefore the space <b>56</b> within the support segment <b>40</b> is conveniently accessible from an open area (not indicated) between the two rear prongs <b>66</b>, even when the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> is assembled in the BOAS assembly <b>34</b> and installed in the outer case <b>32</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The BOAS support segment <b>40</b> further includes a circumferential flange segment <b>67</b> extending axially forwardly from the forward end <b>42</b> at a location near the radially inner side <b>50</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>, to provide a radial surface (not indicated) which may be in contact with the static vane ring assembly <b>30</b>, for receiving an axial load from an adjacent component of the static vane ring assembly <b>30</b>. This axial load, acting on a location of the support segment <b>40</b> near the radially inner side <b>50</b> creates a moment of force in an anti-clockwise direction about the radially outer end of the front leg <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). This moment of force could cause a rocking motion of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> in the same direction, if not properly transferred to the outer case <b>32</b>. The rear prongs <b>66</b> provide an adequate load transfer link such that the moment of force created by vane loads acting axially on the circumferential flange segment <b>67</b> is properly transferred by the rear prongs <b>66</b> in a radially outward direction, to the outer case <b>32</b>, thereby preventing the rocking motion of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> from being transferred to the BOAS segment <b>36</b>, and thereby contributing to maintaining an axially straight tip clearance around the turbine rotor <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The rear prongs <b>66</b> also properly transfer other loads, such as radial thermal expansion loads of the turbine shroud formed with the BOAS segment <b>36</b>. However, the rear prongs <b>66</b> do not axially and circumferentially engage with the outer case <b>32</b>. The BOAS support segments <b>40</b> are allowed for axial and/or circumferential thermal expansion within a limited tolerance.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The radial wall <b>60</b> is provided with one or more apertures <b>68</b> for receiving fasteners (not indicated) extending axially through the radial wall <b>60</b> and into the inner space <b>56</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The fasteners are used to secure the front leg <b>64</b> to a radial wall (not indicated) of the outer case <b>32</b> in order to secure the entire BOAS assembly <b>34</b> to the outer case <b>32</b>. In this embodiment, two apertures <b>68</b> are circumferentially spaced apart. The fasteners received in the apertures <b>68</b> are conveniently accessible from the rearward end <b>44</b> through the open area between the pair of rear prongs <b>66</b>. A radial central wall <b>55</b> may be provided (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) extending axially from the radial wall <b>60</b> across the inner space <b>56</b> to divide the same into two circumferential portions, each accommodating one of the fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> according another embodiment may optionally include additional rear prongs, for example such as an additional middle prong <b>65</b> at the rearward end <b>44</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>, circumferentially located between the pair of rear prongs <b>66</b> at the opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>. Other structures and features are similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and are indicated by the same numerals. It is understood that the fasteners received in the respective apertures <b>68</b> are still accessible from the rearward end <b>44</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> because the apertures <b>68</b> are circumferentially aligned with the open areas between the middle rear prong <b>65</b> and the respective rear prongs <b>66</b> at the opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 8</figref>, each of the BOAS segments <b>36</b> includes a platform <b>70</b> extending axially from a leading edge <b>72</b> to a trailing edge <b>74</b> (with respect to the gas flow direction in the engine) and circumferentially extending between opposed circumferential sides <b>75</b>, and further includes front and rear hooks <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> integrated with the platform <b>70</b> to support the platform <b>70</b>, radially and inwardly spaced apart from the support ring formed by the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>. The front hook <b>76</b> includes a radial wall <b>80</b> circumferentially extending between the opposed circumferential sides <b>75</b> and a circumferential flange segment <b>82</b> extending radially rearwardly from a radially outer end of the radial wall <b>80</b>, thereby forming the front hook <b>76</b> in an inverted L-shape. The rear hook <b>78</b> includes a radial wall <b>84</b> circumferentially extending between the opposed circumferential sides <b>75</b> and axially spaced apart from the radial wall <b>80</b>, and a circumferential flange segment <b>86</b> extending axially forwardly from the radial wall <b>84</b>, thereby forming the rear hook <b>78</b> in an inverted L-shape. The front and rear hooks <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> in combination form an engaging device for connection with the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> and <b>8</b>-<b>9</b>, the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> according to this embodiment may be provided with a complementary engaging device for radial and axial engagement with the front and rear hooks <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> of the BOAS segments <b>36</b>. The complementary engaging device of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> according to this embodiment, may include at least one circumferentially extending front engaging element <b>88</b> projecting axially and forwardly from the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> near the radially inner side <b>50</b>, and a circumferentially extending rear engaging element <b>90</b> projecting axially and rearwardly from the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> near the radially inner side <b>50</b>. The front and rear engaging elements <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> radially and axially engage the respective front and rear hooks <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> of the BOAS segment <b>36</b> and allow a circumferential movement of the BOAS segment <b>36</b> relative to the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> such that the BOAS segment <b>36</b> can be circumferentially slid from one of the opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> into a predetermined circumferential position, while maintaining connection with the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">An anti-rotation apparatus is provided for restricting relative circumferential movement between the turbine shroud formed by the BOAS segments <b>36</b> and the support ring formed by the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>. The anti-rotation apparatus may include a stopper <b>92</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) provided at least in one of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b> and at least one cast anti-rotation tab <b>94</b> integrated with one of the BOAS segments <b>36</b> supported on the at least one BOAS support segments <b>40</b>. The stopper <b>92</b> and the cast anti-rotation tab <b>94</b> circumferentially abut each other. Those BOAS support segments having no stoppers will be circumferentially restricted by those having stoppers. Those BOAS segments having no cast anti-rotation tabs will be circumferentially restricted by those having the cast anti-rotation tabs.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this embodiment, each of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b> supports a pair of the BOAS segments <b>36</b>, and the anti-rotation apparatus may include at least one stopper <b>92</b> provided on each of the BOAS support segments <b>36</b> and at least one cast anti-rotation tab <b>94</b> integrated with each of the BOAS segments <b>36</b>. The stopper <b>92</b> of each of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>, defines circumferentially opposed side surfaces for abutting the at least one cast anti-rotation tab <b>94</b> of the respective BOAS segments <b>36</b> supported on the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. Therefore, every BOAS segment <b>36</b> and every BOAS support segment <b>40</b> is circumferentially restricted with their own cast anti-rotation tab <b>94</b> and the stoppers <b>92</b>. The anti-rotation tolerance between the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> and the pair of BOAS segments <b>36</b> supported thereon is therefore more controllable.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>8</b>-<b>9</b>, two stoppers <b>92</b> and two cast anti-rotation tabs <b>94</b> may be provided to the respective BOAS support segment <b>40</b> and the BOAS segment <b>36</b> and casting process of the BOAS segment <b>36</b>. The cast anti-rotation tab <b>94</b> may be positioned in an inner corner of each BOAS segment <b>36</b> and integrated with both the front hook <b>76</b> and the platform <b>70</b> of the BOAS segments <b>36</b>. The stoppers <b>92</b> may be attached to a forward end <b>42</b> near the radially inner side <b>50</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. The two stoppers <b>92</b> may be a machined component which is attached for example to a circumferentially middle area of the BOAS segment <b>40</b> between two front engaging elements <b>88</b>, by fasteners (not shown). The machined stoppers <b>92</b> may be circumferentially spaced apart from each other and the space therebetween may be slightly adjustable. The respective stoppers <b>92</b> define abutting surfaces circumferentially facing away from each other to abut one cast anti-rotation tab <b>94</b> of the respective BOAS segments <b>36</b> which are circumferentially slid into position from the opposed circumferential sides <b>48</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The two cast anti-rotation tabs <b>94</b> of each BOAS segment <b>36</b> are circumferentially spaced apart one from another and are circumferentially symmetric about a central axis <b>96</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) of the BOAS segment <b>36</b>. It is noted that only one of the cast anti-rotation tabs <b>94</b> of each BOAS segment <b>36</b> is in contact with a stopper <b>92</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>, in order to provide the anti-rotation function. However, the symmetrically positioned two cast anti-rotation tabs <b>94</b> allow each of the BOAS segments <b>36</b> to be connected to the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> by sliding into position from either one of the opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b> because the two stoppers <b>92</b> (or the at least one stopper <b>92</b> if only one stopper <b>92</b> is provided) are also circumferentially symmetrical about an axially central axis <b>98</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. In other words, the circumferential position of the paired BOAS segments <b>36</b> supported by one BOAS support segment <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, can be interchangeable with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The anti-rotation apparatus formed by the stoppers <b>92</b> in each BOAS support segment <b>40</b> and the cast anti-rotation tabs <b>94</b> in each BOAS segment <b>36</b>, prevents the paired BOAS segments <b>36</b> from rotating relative to the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> within an acceptable tolerance, after the BOAS assembly <b>24</b> is mounted into the outer case <b>32</b>. The acceptable tolerance may be adjusted during or prior to the assembly procedure by the adjustment of the space between the two stoppers <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The BOAS assembly <b>34</b> defines a cooling system, particularly a cooling air distribution system within the support ring formed by the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>, for intake of compressor bleed air, which distributes cooling air radially inwardly to and along the entire circumference of the static turbine shroud formed by the BOAS segments <b>36</b>, to cool the same. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>, the cooling air distribution system includes a plurality of inlet cavities <b>100</b> (one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) axially and inwardly extending from a forward end of the support ring formed by the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>. The forward end of the support ring is defined by the forward end <b>42</b> of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b> and the inlet cavities <b>100</b> are circumferentially located at a respective adjacent area between two adjacent BOAS support segments <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-7</figref>, each of the inlet cavities <b>100</b> is formed with two recesses <b>102</b> defined in the respective adjacent two BOAS support segments <b>40</b>. Each of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b> defines one of the two recesses <b>102</b> on the respective opposed circumferential sides <b>48</b> which for example may be formed by a cut-away portion of a corner of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> between the forward end <b>42</b> and the opposed circumferential sides <b>48</b> thereof. Therefore, each recess <b>102</b> has openings at both the forward end <b>42</b> and the circumferential side <b>46</b> or <b>48</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>. Each of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b> further includes a plurality of substantially circumferential or tangential passages <b>104</b> extending from the respective recesses <b>102</b> inwardly to the inner space <b>56</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The inner space <b>56</b> is in fluid communication with a damp plenum formed by the cavity <b>58</b>, through a plurality of holes <b>106</b> radially extending through the circumferential wall <b>54</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). A buffer plate <b>108</b> with a plurality of impingement holes <b>110</b> extending therethrough may be provided, to be attached to the radially inner side <b>50</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), covering the opening of the cavity <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Therefore, the above-described configuration of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b> defines the cooling air distribution system for intake of compressor bleed air from the forward end of the support ring formed by the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>, through the inlet cavities <b>100</b>. The cooling compressor bleed air is then directed from the inlet cavities <b>100</b> through the substantially circumferential passages <b>104</b> into the inner space <b>56</b> of the respective BOAS support segments <b>40</b>. In each of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>, the cooling air in the inner space <b>56</b> enters the dump plenum formed by the cavity <b>58</b> radially and inwardly through the holes <b>106</b> and then further passes through the impingement holes <b>110</b> of the buffer plate <b>108</b>, to radially and inwardly impinge upon the BOAS segments <b>36</b> connected to the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Each of the BOAS support segments <b>40</b> according to one embodiment, may further include seal slots defined in the opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, to receive seals (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> but not indicated) to prevent cooling air leakage from a circumferential gap (not indicated) between the two recesses <b>102</b> on the respective adjacent BOAS support segments <b>40</b>, which forms one inlet cavity <b>100</b>. For example, each of the opposed circumferential sides <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the BOAS support segment <b>40</b>, may define a seal slot <b>112</b> extending axially from the forward end <b>42</b> to the rearward end <b>44</b> and a seal slot <b>113</b> extending radially and inwardly from the forward end <b>42</b> to the rearward end <b>44</b> and adjacent the seal slot <b>112</b> near the rearward end <b>44</b>. Therefore, the recess <b>102</b> is positioned between the seal slots <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>10</b>-<b>12</b>, the axially spaced apart front and rear hooks <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> of the respective BOAS segments <b>36</b>, support the platform <b>70</b> to be radially and inwardly spaced apart from the support ring formed by the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>, thereby defining an annular cavity <b>114</b> between the front and rear hooks <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>. According to another embodiment, each of the BOAS segments <b>36</b> may define a plurality of cooling passages <b>116</b> extending axially through the platform <b>70</b> from individual inlet cavities <b>118</b> which are defined in a radially outer surface of the platform <b>70</b>, to an exit hole <b>120</b> defined on the leading edge <b>72</b> of the platform <b>70</b>. Each inlet cavity <b>118</b> may be cylindrical and may have a diameter larger than the connected cooling passage <b>116</b>, and may be referred to as a &#x201c;bucket&#x201d; inlet for the cooling passage <b>116</b>. The inlet cavity <b>118</b> is in fluid communication with the annular cavity <b>114</b> for intake of cooling air discharged from the cooling air distribution system of the support ring formed by the BOAS support segments <b>40</b>, through the impingement holes <b>110</b> of the impingement buffer plate <b>108</b> into the annular cavity <b>114</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). At least one of the cooling passages <b>116</b> which is particularly indicated as <b>116</b><i>a </i>and is positioned close to respective opposed circumferential sides <b>75</b> of each BOAS segment <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) according to one embodiment, extends linearly from an inlet cavity <b>118</b><i>a </i>and is skewed away from the axial direction in order to direct cooling air to cool a corner area between the leading edge <b>72</b> and the respective opposed circumferential sides <b>75</b> of the platform <b>70</b>. It may not be convenient or possible to position the inlet cavity <b>118</b><i>a </i>in a proximity of the respective opposed circumferential sides <b>75</b> of the platform <b>70</b> due to the existence of a seal slot <b>122</b> defined in the respective opposed circumferential sides <b>75</b> of the platform <b>70</b> and extending between the leading edge <b>72</b> and trailing edge <b>74</b> of the platform <b>70</b>. The skewed orientation of the cooling passage <b>116</b><i>a </i>provides a solution in this circumstance to cool the corner areas of the leading edges <b>72</b> of the platform <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The inlet cavities <b>118</b> (including <b>118</b><i>a</i>) extend radially and inwardly from the radially outer surface of the platform <b>70</b> to a depth at which inlet cavity <b>118</b> (or <b>118</b><i>a</i>) can communicate with the respective cooling passages <b>116</b> (or <b>116</b><i>a</i>) such that the cooling passages <b>116</b> (or <b>116</b><i>a</i>) are closer to a radially inner surface (not indicated) of the platform <b>70</b> and are radially spaced apart from the seal slots <b>122</b>. The inlet cavity <b>118</b><i>a </i>is circumferentially spaced apart from the seal slot <b>122</b>. An exit hole <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the cooling passage <b>116</b><i>a </i>may be circumferentially aligned with the seal slot <b>122</b> defined in the opposed circumferential sides <b>75</b> of the platform <b>70</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The platform <b>70</b> of the BOAS segment <b>36</b> is configured such that each of the seal slots <b>122</b> is in a curved shape and may have an opening <b>124</b> in the radially outer surface of the platform <b>70</b>. The opening <b>124</b> has a size in the circumferential direction equal to the circumferential depth of the seal slot <b>122</b>. Therefore, the inlet cavity <b>118</b><i>a </i>is circumferentially spaced apart from the opening <b>124</b> of the respective seal slots <b>122</b>. It may be convenient for the cooling passage <b>116</b><i>a </i>and an adjacent cooling passage <b>116</b> to share the inlet cavity <b>118</b><i>a </i>due to the skewed orientation of the cooling passage <b>118</b><i>a</i>. In contrast to cylindrical inlet cavities <b>118</b> which communicate individually with the cooling passage <b>116</b>, the shared inlet cavity <b>118</b><i>a </i>may have a larger size in the circumferential direction such as in an oblong shape.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The leading edge <b>72</b> of the platform <b>70</b> may further define an axially outward projection configuration <b>126</b> to prevent the exit holes <b>120</b> on the leading edge <b>72</b> from being blocked by adjacent engine components when the BOAS assembly <b>34</b> is installed in the outer casing case <b>32</b> of the engine. Therefore, the cooling air passing through the cooling passages <b>116</b> and <b>116</b><i>a </i>cools the platform <b>70</b> of the respective BOAS segments <b>36</b> and is discharged through the exit holes <b>120</b>, into the hot gas path defined by the turbine shroud.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The above description is meant to be exemplary only, and one skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made to the embodiments described without departure from the scope of the described subject matter.
