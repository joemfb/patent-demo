<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, a system is provided for customized execution sequences for portions of third party applications. The system includes a processor and a customizing tool. When executed by the processor, the customizing tool conducts discovery through application program interfaces to identify data associated with screens associated with third party applications. Each of the application program interfaces is associated with a corresponding third party application. The customizing tool also enables selection of a customized screen execution sequence based on the data and a portion of the screens. The customized screen execution sequence includes at least one screen corresponding to each of the third party applications and excludes at least one default start screen associated with at least one of the third party applications. Additionally, the customizing tool stores the selection of the customized screen execution sequence as a customized application. Execution of the customized application outputs a customized result to a user interface. The customized result is based on execution of the customized screen execution sequence.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below, the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although a mobile device may execute many different applications developed by third parties to benefit a mobile device user, the mobile device user may not be satisfied with the functioning of many third party applications. For example, a mobile device may execute a navigation application to determine which movie theaters are in the mobile device's vicinity and identify a nearby theater, but the user may cancel execution of the navigation application before the application provides directions to the identified movie theater. The user may instruct the mobile device to begin execution of a ticket purchase application to list which movies are playing at the identified theater, to identify when each movie is playing, and to purchase tickets for a movie that is showing at a specific time. After the user purchases the tickets via the ticket purchase application, the user may have to execute the navigation application again to be provided with directions to the movie theater. In addition to requiring the user to stop and start multiple applications to fulfill the user's requests, the applications may display many screens to the user that are not directly relevant to the user's current requests, which altogether may decrease customer satisfaction with the mobile device, the third party applications, and/or the mobile device communication provider.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide systems and methods for customized execution sequences for portions of third party applications. A third party application developer may provide an application program interface that a client may invoke to identify data associated with a third party application's screens. For example, an application program interface for a navigation application enables a developer to identify data that includes the execution entry point, the entry data, the execution exit point, and the exit data for the screen that displays a list of restaurants or movie theaters at or nearby a specified location. The execution entry point may be the first of a series of instructions that may be executed to display a screen. The entry data may be the data that an application's instructions require to properly display a screen. For example, specification of a location may be required as entry data for a screen to display a list of movie theaters at or nearby the specified location. The execution exit point may be the last of the series of instructions that may be executed to display a screen. The exit data may be the data that an application's instructions retain and/or return after a screen is displayed. An application may use the exit data to determine the next screen to be generated, and may provide the exit data to the next screen. For example, a selection of a movie theater from a list of movie theaters may be the exit data for a first screen, the selection of the movie theater may determine that a second screen corresponding to the selected movie theater is the next screen to be generated, and the selection of the movie theater may be the entry data that enables the second screen to display the street address and telephone number for the selected movie theater.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A customizing tool may execute on a mobile device to create a customized application. A customized application is an application that combines the capabilities of independent applications in a manner that may be quicker and/or easier for a user to use than the use of the independent applications executed independently. A customized application may comprise portions of off-the-shelf applications which are combined in some new ways not provided by the original developers of the off-the-shelf applications. In some circumstances, a customized application may be built or composed by a user of the mobile device by using the customizing tool to provide an automated function of interest to that specific user or to provide an output in a format desired by that specific user. A customized application may be said in some contexts to produce a customized result. Alternatively, the customizing tool may execute on a computer to create a customized application that may be downloaded to a mobile device. The customizing tool may conduct discovery through application program interfaces to identify data associated with third party applications' screens. Discovery may be a procedure of determining an interface to an application through an interactive process involving queries and analysis of the responses to the queries. For example, the customizing tool uses application program interfaces to identify the execution entry points, the execution exit points, the entry data, and the exit data for the screens for a navigation application and a ticket purchase application.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The customizing tool enables a software developer, who may be a mobile device user, to select a customized screen execution sequence based on the data and a portion of the screens. For example, a mobile device user who is a software developer uses a computer to create the first half of a customized screen execution sequence based on the screens from a navigation application that enable identification and selection of movie theaters at or nearby a specified location. The developer may create the second half of the customized screen execution sequence based on screens from a ticket purchase application that enable the selection of movies and show times for a selected theater and the purchase of movie tickets for a selected movie and show time. The customized screen execution sequence may include at least one screen provided by each of the third party applications and excludes at least one default start screen associated with at least one of the third party applications. For example, execution of the customized screen execution sequence results in displaying some of the screens of the navigation application and the ticket purchase application, but bypasses displaying some of the screens of the navigation application and/or the ticket purchase application. In this example, the execution of the customized screen execution sequence bypasses displaying the ticket purchase application's default start screen, which requests a user to identify whether to purchase tickets for sporting events or for movie theaters.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The customizing tool may store the selection of the customized screen execution sequence as a customized application. If the customizing tool creates the customized application on the mobile device, then the customized application may be ready for execution. If the customizing tool creates the customized application on a computer, the computer may download the customized application to the mobile device. The customizing tool executes a customized application based on executing a customized screen execution sequence. For example, the customized tool executes the customized application, which results in displaying a screen that prompts the mobile device user to specify a location. Using the location specified by the user as entry data, the customized application may display the navigation application screens that enable the user to view a list of movie theaters at or nearby the specified location and to select one of the movie theaters. Then the customized application may use the specified location as entry data to display the ticket purchase applications screen for the selected theater, which enables the user to select a movie and a show time and then to purchase tickets for the selected movie and show time. The customizing tool outputs a customized result to a user interface. For example, the customized result may confirm purchase of the selected tickets and offer the user the option to switch back to the navigation application to be provided with directions from the mobile device's current location to the movie theater.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Enabling the creation of customized execution sequences for portions of third party applications may result in increased usage of portions of the third party applications, which may result in increased advertising revenue for and/or increased customer satisfaction with the third party applications. Creation of such customized execution sequences may also result in increased mobile device usage, which may result in increased revenue for the mobile device communication service provider and in increased customer satisfaction for the mobile device manufacturer and the mobile device communication service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a system <b>100</b> for customized execution sequences for portions of third party applications according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The system <b>100</b> includes a first application <b>102</b> and a second application <b>104</b>, which are each third party applications that a mobile device <b>106</b> may execute. The mobile device <b>106</b> may execute the first application <b>102</b> to display screen A <b>108</b>, screen B <b>110</b>, screen C <b>112</b>, screen D <b>114</b>, screen E <b>116</b>, screen F <b>118</b>, screen G <b>120</b>, screen H <b>122</b>, and screen <b>1124</b>. The mobile device <b>106</b> also may execute the second application <b>104</b> to display screen S <b>126</b>, screen T <b>128</b>, screen U <b>130</b>, screen V <b>132</b>, screen W <b>134</b>, screen X <b>136</b>, screen Y <b>138</b>, and screen Z <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The system <b>100</b> also includes a customizing tool <b>142</b> that may create and promote execution of a customized application <b>144</b>. The customizing tool <b>142</b> may communicate with the first application <b>102</b> via a first application program interface <b>146</b> and communicate with the second application <b>104</b> via a second application program interface <b>148</b>. The customized application <b>144</b> includes a first transition screen <b>150</b>, a second transition screen <b>152</b>, and a third transition screen <b>154</b>. Additionally the system <b>100</b> includes execution paths <b>156</b>-<b>170</b> created by the customizing tool <b>142</b> to direct the execution of the applications <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, and <b>144</b> to display some of the screens <b>108</b>-<b>140</b> and <b>150</b>-<b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The developer of the first application <b>102</b> may provide the first application program interface <b>146</b> that provides data associated with the screens <b>108</b>-<b>124</b> for the first application <b>102</b>. For example, the first application program interface <b>146</b> provides data that identifies the execution entry points, the entry data, the execution exit points, and the exit data for the screens <b>108</b>-<b>124</b>, such as the execution entry point, the entry data, the execution exit point, and the exit data for the screen E <b>116</b> that identifies movie theaters at or nearby a specified location. The execution entry point may be the first of a series of instructions that may be executed to display the screen E <b>116</b>. The entry data may be the data that the instructions of the first application <b>102</b> require to properly display the screen E <b>116</b>. For example, the specification of a location may be the entry data required by the screen E <b>116</b> to display a list of movie theaters at or nearby the specified location. The entry data may include required entry data and/or optional entry data. For example, the screen E <b>116</b> may display a general list of movie theaters based on a specified zip code, or the screen E <b>116</b> may display a focused list of movie theaters based on a specified street address and zip code, such that the street address is optional entry data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The customizing tool <b>142</b> may prompt identification of entry data for each selected execution entry point. For example, the customizing tool <b>142</b> outputs information to a user interface that specifies that the entry data for the execution entry point to the screen E <b>116</b> requires a specified location, based on the data identified via the first application program interface <b>146</b>. In response to this information, the developer using the customizing tool <b>142</b> may select from various options to provide the entry data for the entry execution point to ensure that the screen E <b>116</b> is displayed properly. For example, the developer may select for the mobile device <b>106</b> to activate a location application to determine the location of the mobile device <b>106</b>, and use the location of the mobile device <b>106</b> as the entry data for the screen E <b>116</b>. In another example, the developer may select to display the screen C <b>112</b> as part of the custom execution sequence because the screen C <b>112</b> requests a location to be entered and the screen E <b>116</b> may use the location entered via the screen C <b>112</b> as the entry data. In yet another example, the developer may create the first transition screen <b>150</b> that requests a location to be entered, and specify the execution path <b>156</b> from the execution exit point for the first transition screen <b>150</b> to the execution entry point for the screen E <b>116</b>, such that the screen E <b>116</b> may use the location entered via the first transition screen <b>150</b> as entry data.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Transition screens, such as the transition screens <b>150</b>-<b>154</b>, are screens that are not native to the underlying applications, such as the first application <b>102</b> or the second application <b>104</b>. The developer may create a transition screen for many reasons, such as to fill a gap in obtaining information to feed into an application program interface, to shorten an information-obtaining process to more efficiently obtain information, and/or to transition into or between application programming interfaces. The developer may use transition screens to present fewer screens to a user or to make the screen presented more user-friendly. Depending on the underlying applications used by the developer and the customized execution sequence, the developer may employ numerous transition screens, one transition screen, or no transition screens.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The execution exit point may be the last of the series of instructions that may be executed to display the screen E <b>116</b>, and the exit data may be the data that the instructions for the first application <b>102</b> provide to the next screen to be generated. For example, the screen E <b>116</b> may prompt the user of the mobile device <b>106</b> to select a movie theater from a displayed list of movie theaters. The selection of the movie theater may be the exit data for the screen E <b>116</b>, and may determine whether the next screen to be displayed is the screen G <b>120</b> or the screen H <b>122</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the execution path <b>158</b> indicates that the user's selection of a movie theater resulted in the mobile device <b>106</b> displaying the screen H <b>122</b>, such that the selection of the movie theater from the list of movie theaters enables the screen H <b>122</b> to display the street address and telephone number for the selected movie theater. The customizing tool <b>142</b> may identify exit data for each selected execution exit point. For example, if the screen H <b>122</b> is selected for the customized screen execution sequence, the customizing tool <b>142</b> displays on a user interface the identification of a movie theater that is output by the screen H <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The customizing tool <b>142</b> may execute on the mobile device <b>106</b> to create the customized application <b>144</b> or execute on a computer to create the customized application <b>144</b> that may be downloaded to the mobile device <b>106</b>. The customizing tool <b>142</b> may conduct discovery through the application program interfaces <b>146</b>-<b>148</b> to identify data associated with the screens <b>108</b>-<b>140</b>. For example, the customizing tool <b>142</b> uses the application program interfaces <b>146</b>-<b>148</b> to identify the execution entry points, the execution exit points, the entry data, and the exit data for the screens for the first application <b>102</b>, which is a navigation application, and the second application <b>104</b>, which is a ticket purchase application. The customizing tool <b>142</b> enables a software developer and/or a mobile device user to select a customized screen execution sequence based on the data and a portion of the screens <b>108</b>-<b>140</b>. For example, a mobile device user who is a software developer uses his computer to create the first half of a customized screen execution sequence based on the screens <b>116</b> and <b>122</b> from the navigation application <b>102</b> that enable identification and selection of movie theaters at or nearby a specified location. The developer may also create the second half of the customized screen execution sequence based on the screens <b>132</b>, <b>136</b>, and <b>140</b> from the ticket purchase application <b>104</b> that enable the selection of movies and show times for a selected theater and the purchase of movie tickets for the selected movie and show time.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The customized screen execution sequence includes at least one screen corresponding to each of the third party applications and excludes at least one default start screen associated with at least one of the third party applications. For example, execution of the customized screen execution sequence displays the screens <b>116</b> and <b>122</b> of the navigation application <b>102</b> and the screens <b>132</b>, <b>136</b>, and <b>140</b> of the ticket purchase application <b>104</b>. However, the execution of the customized screen execution sequence bypasses displaying some of the screens of the navigation application <b>102</b> and the ticket purchase application <b>104</b>, such as the default start screen S <b>126</b> for the ticket purchase application that requests a user to identify whether to purchase tickets for sporting events or for movie theaters. The execution of the customized execution sequence may also result in bypassing the display of other screens, such as the screens <b>108</b>-<b>114</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>126</b>-<b>130</b>, <b>134</b>, and <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The customizing tool <b>142</b> may store the selection of the customized screen execution sequence and the identification of any entry data as the customized application <b>144</b>. For example, when the customizing tool <b>142</b> stores the customized application <b>144</b>, the customizing tool <b>142</b> also stores the identification of the location entered via the first transition screen <b>150</b> as the exit data for the first transition screen <b>150</b> and as the entry data for the screen E <b>116</b>. If the customizing tool <b>142</b> creates the customized application <b>144</b> on the mobile device <b>106</b>, then the customized application <b>144</b> may be ready for execution. If the customizing tool <b>142</b> creates the customized application <b>144</b> on a computer, the computer may download the customized application <b>144</b> to the mobile device <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The customizing tool <b>142</b> executes the customized application <b>144</b> based on executing a customized screen execution sequence. For example, the customized tool <b>142</b> may execute the customized application <b>144</b> to display the first transition screen <b>150</b> to prompt the mobile device user to specify a location. Based on the location specified by the user, the customized application <b>144</b> may follow the execution path <b>156</b> to display the navigation application screen E <b>116</b> that enables the user to view a list of movie theaters at or nearby the specified location and to select one of the movie theaters. Based on the movie theater selected by the user, the customized application <b>144</b> may follow the execution path <b>158</b> to display the screen H <b>122</b>, which displays the street address and the telephone number for the selected theater.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Instead of displaying the screen <b>1124</b>, which may provide directions to the selected movie theater, the customized application <b>144</b> may respond to a selection of the option to receive the directions by following the execution path <b>160</b> to display the ticket purchase applications screen <b>132</b> for the selected theater, which enables the user to select a movie and a show time. Entry data for a selected execution entry point may be based at least in part on exit data for a selected execution exit point. For example, the entry data for the ticket purchase applications screen <b>132</b>, which requires the identification of a movie theater, is based on the exit data for the screen H <b>122</b>, which identifies a movie theater. Based on the selected movie and show time, the customized application <b>144</b> may follow the execution path <b>162</b> to display the ticket purchase applications screen <b>136</b>, which identifies the price of the tickets for the selected movie and show time and enables the user to enter information to purchase the tickets.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Instead of requiring the user to continue to the screen Y <b>138</b> to type in the long list of numbers that comprise the user's registration identification with the ticket purchase application <b>104</b>, and the user's credit card number, the customized application <b>144</b> may respond to the selection of the option to enter information by following the execution path <b>164</b> to display the second transition screen <b>152</b>. The second transition screen <b>152</b> may accept the selected movie, the selected time, and the price displayed by the screen X <b>136</b> as entry data. The second transition screen <b>152</b> may display information that prompts data entry, prompts a selection, and/or provides an insight. For example, the second transition screen <b>152</b> displays the user's registration identification with the ticket purchase application <b>104</b> and the user's credit card number, and prompts the user to request the purchase of the selected movie tickets.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In response to a selection to purchase the selected movie tickets, the customized application <b>144</b> may follow the execution path <b>166</b> to bypass the screen Y <b>138</b> and display the screen Z <b>140</b> which confirms the purchase of the selected tickets. Bypassing screens may save time and increase customer satisfaction for the mobile device user.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The customizing tool <b>142</b> may execute the customized application <b>144</b> by executing a portion of the first application <b>102</b> in background while executing another portion of the second application <b>104</b>, such that the customizing tool <b>142</b> executes the portion of the first application <b>102</b> upon completion of execution of the other portion of the second application <b>104</b> without reloading the first application <b>102</b>. For example, in response to the confirmation of the purchase of the selected tickets, the customized application <b>144</b> may follow the execution path <b>168</b> to display the third transition screen <b>154</b>, which outputs a customized result to a user interface on the mobile device <b>106</b>. The customized result may confirm purchase of the tickets and offer the user the option for the customized application <b>144</b> to follow the execution path <b>170</b> to the navigation application <b>102</b> to display the screen <b>1124</b> to be provided with directions from the specified location to the movie theater. The customized result may be based on entry data for each selected execution entry point, exit data for each selected execution exit point, and data provided via the transition screens <b>150</b>-<b>154</b>. For example, the confirmation of the purchase of the movie tickets is based on the specification of the location, the selection of the theater, the selection of the movie and show time, the confirmation of the credit card information, and the request to purchase the tickets that were provided via the navigation application screens <b>116</b> and <b>122</b>, the ticket purchase application screens <b>132</b>, <b>136</b>, and <b>140</b>, and the transition screens <b>150</b>-<b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the user selects the option to be provided with the directions to the selected movie theater, the customized application <b>144</b> may follow the execution path <b>170</b> to display the screen <b>1124</b>, which displays the directions from the specified location to the selected movie theater. However, if the user postpones selection of the option to be provided with the directions to the movie theater, the customized application <b>144</b> may continue to execute the navigation application <b>102</b> in the background. In this situation, whenever the user selects the option to be provided with the directions to the selected movie theater, the customized application <b>144</b> retains the identification of the selected theater and does not have to reload the navigation application <b>102</b>. Whenever the user selects to be provided with the directions to the movie theater, the third transition screen <b>154</b> enables the specification of a revised starting location, and the customized application <b>144</b> follows the execution path <b>170</b> to display the screen <b>1124</b>, which displays the directions from the previously specified location or the revised starting location to the movie theater. For example, the user of the mobile device <b>106</b> may purchase the movie tickets while the user is at work, and postpone requesting directions to the movie theater until the user is eating at a restaurant prior to the beginning of the selected movie show time.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Enabling the creation of customized execution sequences for portions of the applications <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> may result in increased usage of the portions of the applications <b>102</b>-<b>104</b>, which may result in increased advertising revenue for and/or increased customer satisfaction with the applications <b>102</b>-<b>104</b>. Creation of the customized application <b>144</b> also may result in increased mobile device usage, which may result in increased revenue for the mobile device communication service provider and in increased customer satisfaction with the mobile device manufacturer and the mobile device communication service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The customized application <b>144</b> may be conveyed from the mobile device <b>106</b> to another mobile device <b>106</b>. For example, because a user of the mobile device <b>106</b>, who may or may not be a professional software developer, is highly satisfied with the capabilities of the customized application <b>144</b>, which the user may have created and/or downloaded via the customizing tool <b>142</b>, the user forwards the customized application <b>144</b> to a friend's mobile device <b>106</b>. Sharing the customized application <b>144</b> with a friend may result in increasing the friend's customer satisfaction with the mobile device manufacturer and the mobile device communication service provider. Furthermore, the user of the mobile device <b>106</b> may encourage another friend to purchase the same model of the mobile device <b>106</b> and to subscribe to the same mobile device communication service provider so that the user can share customized applications with the friend, which may result in increasing the sales of the mobile device <b>106</b> and subscriptions to the mobile device communication service provider. Although the pending disclosure describes the customizing tool using one navigation application <b>102</b> and one ticket purchase application <b>104</b> to create the customized application <b>144</b>, the customizing tool may use any number and any type of the applications <b>102</b>-<b>104</b> to create the customized application <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a flowchart of a method <b>200</b> for customized execution sequences for portions of third party applications according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The system <b>100</b> may execute the method <b>200</b> to enable a mobile device user to execute customized execution sequences for portions of third party applications <b>102</b>-<b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In box <b>202</b>, application program interfaces are discovered to identify data associated with screens that are associated with third party applications.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Some aspects of the system described above may be implemented on a computer with sufficient processing power, memory resources, and network throughput capability to handle the necessary workload placed upon it. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a typical computer system suitable for implementing one or more embodiments disclosed herein. The computer system <b>680</b> includes a processor <b>682</b> (which may be referred to as a central processor unit or CPU) that is in communication with memory devices including secondary storage <b>684</b>, read only memory (ROM) <b>686</b>, random access memory (RAM) <b>688</b>, input/output (I/O) devices <b>690</b>, and network connectivity devices <b>692</b>. The processor <b>682</b> may be implemented as one or more CPU chips.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">It is understood that by programming and/or loading executable instructions onto the computer system <b>680</b>, at least one of the CPU <b>682</b>, the RAM <b>688</b>, and the ROM <b>686</b> are changed, transforming the computer system <b>680</b> in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally, a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software, because re-spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re-spinning a software design. Generally, a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware, for example in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed, by well known design rules, to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus, likewise a computer that has been programmed and/or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The secondary storage <b>684</b> is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non-volatile storage of data and as an over-flow data storage device if RAM <b>688</b> is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage <b>684</b> may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM <b>688</b> when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM <b>686</b> is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM <b>686</b> is a non-volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage <b>684</b>. The RAM <b>688</b> is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM <b>686</b> and RAM <b>688</b> is typically faster than to secondary storage <b>684</b>.</p>

These network connectivity devices <b>692</b> may enable the processor <b>682</b> to communicate with an Internet or one or more intranets. With such a network connection, it is contemplated that the processor <b>682</b> might receive information from the network, or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above-described method steps. Such information, which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor <b>682</b>, may be received from and outputted to the network, for example, in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Such information, which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor <b>682</b> for example, may be received from and outputted to the network, for example, in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embodied in the carrier wave generated by the network connectivity devices <b>692</b> may propagate in or on the surface of electrical conductors, in coaxial cables, in waveguides, in optical media, for example optical fiber, or in the air or free space. The information contained in the baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be ordered according to different sequences, as may be desirable for either processing or generating the information or transmitting or receiving the information. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave, or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed, referred to herein as the transmission medium, may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The processor <b>682</b> executes instructions, codes, computer programs, scripts which it accesses from hard disk, floppy disk, optical disk (these various disk based systems may all be considered secondary storage <b>684</b>), ROM <b>686</b>, RAM <b>688</b>, or the network connectivity devices <b>692</b>.
