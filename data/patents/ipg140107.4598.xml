<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is related to digital broadcasting systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A single-frequency network (SFN) is a broadcast network where multiple transmitters simultaneously transmit the same signal over the same frequency channel. Some examples of SFNs include Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T) and Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial (ISDB-T) systems. DVB-T is a coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing modulation (COFDM) system. In a DVB-T system, a number of time-shifted versions of the same transmitted signal are received by the DVB-T receiver. The distribution of path delays between the signals is known as the delay spread of the channel. The delay spread causes the transfer function of the channel to vary over frequency which results in inter-symbol interference (ISI) and frequency selective fading.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a DVB-T or ISDB-T system, a cyclic prefix is inserted as a guard interval (with a length of &#xbc;, &#x215b;, 1/16, or 1/32 of one symbol) to combat the ISI caused by channel delay spread. An ISI-free transmission may be guaranteed when the channel length is shorter than the guard interval. Increasing the length of the guard interval, however, may reduce the channel efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pilots are also transmitted, on selected carriers, to equalize the received signal, estimate the channel response, determine the signal to noise ratio (SNR), and to assist in timing and synchronization. There are two types of pilots that are commonly used in an SFN; continuous pilots and scatter pilots. Continuous pilots are transmitted in every symbol whereas scattered pilots are repeated periodically, such as every four symbols. The pilot carriers are identified by carrier indexes. An example pilot structure of a DVB-T system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Pilots are transmitted using binary phase-shift keying (BPSK). The pilot carriers have a boosted power level of 16/9, compared to QPSK/16 QAM/64 QAM with power level of 1/1 for data carriers. The power boost assures that the channel response of the pilot carriers (H<sub>P</sub>) can be reliably estimated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example pilot structure of an OFDM DVB-T system. The bit stream is split into parallel data streams, each transferred over its own carrier using BPSK. The modulated carriers may be summed to form an OFDM signal. A bitstream is transferred over a communication channel using a sequence of OFDM symbols. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in one symbol, there is one pilot inserted every twelve carriers. The scattered pilot pattern repeats every four symbols. Combining the pilots from four symbols gives one pilot every three carriers. A channel estimate (&#x124;<sub>P</sub>) that is generated based on the pilots of a scattered pilot pattern is a downsampled-by-three version of the overall channel frequency response H.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In DVB-T, the continuous pilots are a sub-set of scattered pilots. Both continuous/scattered pilots only use a portion of all the carriers in one symbol. The channel response on these pilot carriers is first estimated. The channel response may be estimated for the data carriers based on any known algorithm, including least square (LS), minimum mean-square error (MMSE) or Modified MMSE. The estimation can be performed once per symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow diagram of a method (<b>200</b>) to estimate the channel frequency response of an OFDM system. A handset receives the pilots over pilot carriers with boosted power levels <b>205</b>. The handset then determines the channel response H<sub>P </sub>of the data carriers that are transmitted in between the transmission of the pilot carriers <b>210</b>. The channel response H<sub>P </sub>may be determined using interpolation based on the channel estimate &#x124;<sub>P</sub>. Next, the handset performs an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) on the channel estimate &#x124;<sub>P</sub>, to generate a resolution-reduced channel impulse response (CIR) &#x125; (<b>215</b>). The resolution-reduced CIR &#x125; is used to adjust the symbol timing, which refers to the point where individual OFDM symbols start and end (<b>220</b>). A fast Fourier process is performed, wherein the adjusted symbol timing is used to define the fast Fourier transform window (<b>225</b>). This method, however, may result in aliasing. Because the channel estimate &#x124;<sub>P </sub>is the downsampled-by-three version of the channel frequency response H, the resolution-reduced CIR &#x125; will be repeated at T<sub>u</sub>/3 interval, where T<sub>u </sub>is the time span of one OFDM symbol. Therefore, any channel longer than T<sub>u</sub>/6 will cause aliasing, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing an aliasing problem associated with a long channel. Instead of a post-cursive channel with length of T<sub>u</sub>/4, the resolution-reduced CIR &#x125; becomes a pre-cursive channel with length of T<sub>u</sub>/12 because of the use of the window [&#x2212;T<sub>u</sub>/6, T<sub>u</sub>/6], which can result in aliasing. Aliasing can affect both the symbol timing and channel estimation, which thereby causes a demodulator malfunction.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The aliasing problem can be partially resolved by designing a system that weighs the post-cursive channel more heavily. However, this design only improves the aliasing problem in a channel with a constrained channel length and without any outside guard echoes. Current solutions focus on generating a channel estimate based only on the continuous/scattered pilot signal. However, if the channel impulse response is too long, the continuous/scattered pilots are not transmitted frequently enough to recover all the channel information.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the DVB-T/ISDB-T systems, continuous/scattered pilots are transmitted for the use in synchronization, channel estimation, etc. In addition to the continuous and scattered pilot carriers, DVB-T systems may also include transmission parameter signaling (TPS) carriers. TPS carriers are transmitted in parallel with the continuous/scattered pilot carriers; however they are transmitted more frequently (seventeen carriers for 2K mode and sixty-eight carriers for 8K mode). TPS carriers convey information regarding: a) modulation including the value of the QAM constellation pattern; b) hierarchy information; c) guard interval (not for initial acquisition but for supporting initial response of the receiver in case of reconfiguration); d) inner code rates; e) transmission mode; and f) frame number in a super-frame. Methods and apparatus using the TPS carrier to assist in acquiring channel information, particularly the optimal window that contains the correct channel impulse response, are disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A baseband equivalent OFDM system <b>400</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, including an OFDM transmitter <b>401</b> and an OFDM receiver <b>402</b>. The OFDM transmitter <b>401</b> includes a channel coding and modulation block <b>405</b>, pilot signal inserter block <b>410</b>, a serial-to-parallel (S/P) converter <b>415</b>, an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) block <b>420</b>, a parallel-to-serial (P/S) converter <b>425</b>, a cyclic prefix (CP) inserter <b>430</b>, a digital-to-analog converter <b>435</b>, and a transmitter antenna <b>440</b>. The OFDM receiver <b>402</b> includes a receiver antenna <b>445</b>, an analog-to-digital converter <b>450</b>, a CP remover <b>455</b>, an S/P converter <b>460</b>, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) block <b>465</b>, a P/S shifter <b>470</b>, a pilot symbol extractor <b>475</b>, a channel decoding and demodulation block <b>480</b>, and a synchronization and channel estimation (SCE) block <b>485</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to the OFDM transmitter <b>401</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an input bitstream is received by a channel coding and modulation block <b>405</b> which performs channel coding and modulation (e.g., quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 8-ary PSK (8 PSK), 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (16 QAM, 64 QAM, 256 QAM, etc.) on the input bitstream and outputs a modulated signal.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The pilot signal inserter <b>410</b> is configured to insert the continuous pilot signaling, the scattered pilot signaling, as well as the TPS signaling into the modulated signal. The S/P converter <b>415</b> converts the modulated signal into a parallel signal. The parallel signal is received by the IFFT block <b>420</b>, which performs IFFT processing and converts the composite signal into a time domain signal. The time domain signal is converted into a serial digital signal by P/S converter <b>425</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The CP inserter <b>430</b> inserts a CP into the time domain signal, which is used for dealing with multi-path distortion. The signal is then passed through the digital-to-analog converter <b>435</b> which converts it to a radio frequency (RF) analog signal. The RF analog signal is then transmitted by the transmitter antenna <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to the OFDM receiver <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the receiver antenna <b>445</b> receives the RF analog signal. The analog-to-digital converter <b>450</b> converts it to a digital signal. The CP remover <b>455</b> receives the digital signal and removes the CP. The S/P converter <b>460</b> converts the digital signal into a parallel signal. The output of the S/P converter <b>460</b> is also received by the SCE block <b>485</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The SCE block <b>485</b> is configured to estimate the noise power based on inserted continuous/scattered pilot signals, TPS signals and other equivalent signals, (e.g. TMCC), as will be explained in further detail hereinafter. The SCE block <b>485</b> then outputs channel estimates, as will be discussed further below. The SCE block <b>485</b> can be configured to operate using any known approach of channel estimation, including but not limited to: Least-squares (LS) or Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error (LMMSE) methods. For example, the SCE block <b>485</b> may be configured to generate LS estimates of the channel gains over the continuous pilot carriers by backrotating the received signal according to the knowledge of the continuous pilot symbols. The SCE block <b>485</b> may also include an interpolation filter <b>486</b> configured to smooth over (interpolate) the LS estimates over the entire frequency-time grid.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, to resolve the aliasing problem that is often associated with long channels, the SCE block <b>485</b> is configured for dynamic channel selection of the window to capture the CIR. In order to perform the dynamic channel selection, after receiving a parallel signal from the S/P converter <b>460</b>, the SCE block <b>485</b> isolates the TPS carriers. The TPS carriers are then processed by the SCE block to determine a first channel estimate based on the TPS carriers. Because of the frequency of transmission of the TPS carriers, the channel response can be estimated accurately on the TPS carriers. These properties of the TPS signaling allow the SCE Block <b>48</b> to determine the first channel estimate in the same manner as a channel estimate for a continuous pilot carrier would be determined, (using e.g. LS, LMMSE, etc.) Since the TPS carrier and continuous pilot carriers comprise known data, the simplest method to estimate the channel frequency response is to divide the received data on those carriers by the known data.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The SCE block <b>485</b> would generate a second channel estimate based on the continuous/scattered pilots. This estimate can be generated based on any of the methods discussed above or any method known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Once the first and second channel estimates have been determined, the SCE block <b>485</b> then compares the first channel estimate and the second channel estimate. Based on the comparison, the SCE block <b>485</b> selects a window that minimizes the differences between the two channel estimates for the interpolation filter <b>486</b>. However, for different windows, the estimation based on pilots will be different. Accordingly, the SCE block <b>485</b> may select multiple different windows and repeat the process described above for several windows. The SCE block <b>485</b> may also store the values of the comparisons resulting from the multiple window selections. The SCE block <b>485</b> may then select the window that minimizes the difference in channel estimates. Alternatively, the SCE block <b>485</b> may be configured with an algorithm to assist in the window selection to minimize the steps involved in the iterative process. Once a preferred window is selected, the SCE block <b>485</b> may capture a channel impulse response. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if the interpolation filter <b>486</b> uses the window [&#x2212;T<sub>u</sub>/6, T<sub>u</sub>/6], then aliasing occurs. However, if the window between [0, T<sub>u</sub>/3] is used, there will be no aliasing.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph where the channel impulse response is shifted to reduce aliasing. In some systems, the interpolation filter <b>486</b> may be configured to always use the window centered at zero. After determining the channel estimates, the SCE block <b>485</b> may apply a phase slope across all of the pilot carriers, which will shift the correct CIR into the window. Accordingly, referring to the example above, the time interval [&#x2212;T<sub>u</sub>/6, T<sub>u</sub>/6] becomes the correct window by shifting the correct CIR into the window [&#x2212;T<sub>u</sub>/6, T<sub>u</sub>/6]. Selecting the proper window may guarantee proper equalization for channels shorter than T<sub>u</sub>/3. With the interpolation filter <b>486</b>, as long as the channel length is less than T<sub>u</sub>/3, by trying different shifting of CIR, the SCE block <b>485</b> is able to find the shifting direction and the amount of shifting to make minimize the difference in the channel estimates {tilde over (H)}<sub>TPS </sub>and {tilde over (H)}<sub>TPS</sub>, which is equivalent to finding the correct window to capture the correct CIR.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The FFT block <b>465</b> receives the output signal of the S/P converter <b>460</b> and performs FFT processing on it. FFT processing is well known in the art and can be performed according to any known method. A time domain signal is output from the FFT block <b>465</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the channel estimate is available from the SCE block <b>485</b>, the output of the FFT block <b>465</b> is signaled to the P/S shifter <b>470</b>. The P/S shifter <b>470</b> compensates any channel effects and improves the bit error rate (BER) performance and converts the received time domain signal into a serial signal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The pilot signal remover <b>475</b> receives the output of the P/S shifter <b>470</b> and extracts the pilot signal. The pilot signal remover <b>475</b> output then passes to the channel decoding and demodulation block <b>480</b> which decodes and demodulates the signal to a display.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow diagram of a method <b>600</b> of window position optimization for a pilot-aided OFDM system. The OFDM receiver receives an RF analog signal including a TPS signal (<b>605</b>). A first channel estimate of a TPS carrier is generated (<b>610</b>). Interpolation is used on the first channel estimate to calculate a TPS carrier channel frequency response (<b>615</b>). A second channel frequency response is estimated based on the continuous/scattered pilot signals (<b>620</b>). Interpolation is used on the second channel estimate to calculate a continuous/scattered pilot carrier channel frequency response (<b>625</b>). A window is then dynamically selected to minimize the difference of the two estimates (<b>630</b>). When there is no aliasing, &#x124;<sub>TPS </sub>and {tilde over (H)}<sub>TPS </sub>will be almost identical, subject to minor difference because of noise. However, if aliasing occurs, then &#x124;<sub>TPS </sub>and {tilde over (H)}<sub>TPS </sub>will be different because they represent different channels. As mentioned herein before, selection of the proper window to capture the CIR can prevent aliasing.</p>
