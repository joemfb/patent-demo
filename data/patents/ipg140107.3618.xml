<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-112012 filed on May 14, 2010 including the specification, drawings and abstract is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and more specifically to layout of the components of a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) formed on a semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With advances in high-speed interface technologies such as PCI EXPRESS, increasing attention is being given to mounting of parts such as a VCO on an interface circuit by using inexpensive and compact complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, an LC-tank VCO including CMOS transistors on a single semiconductor substrate has been proposed in &#x201c;A 10-Ghz CMOS LC VCO with Wide Tuning Range Using Capacitive Degeneration&#x201d;, TAE-Guen Yu, Seong-IK Cho, and Hang-Geun Jeong, JOURNAL OF SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE, VOL. 6, No. 4, December, 2006.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, according to the layout of the LC-tank VCO in &#x201c;A 10-Ghz CMOS LC VCO with Wide Tuning Range Using Capacitive Degeneration&#x201d;, spiral inductors and MOS varactors are positioned apart from each other. A parasitic inductor and parasitic capacitance are thus added to the wiring that couples these components. As a result, the measured oscillation frequency of the VCO sometimes deviates from the theoretical estimate obtained by circuit simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">That is, letting L be the inductance of the spiral inductors included in the LC-tank, and C be the capacitance of the MOS varactors, the theoretical oscillation frequency f<b>1</b> of the VCO is given by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>f</i>1=1/[2<i>&#xd7;&#x3c0;{L&#xd7;C}</i><sup>1/2</sup>].&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Further, letting Lp be the inductance of the parasitic inductor added to the wiring that couples the spiral inductors and the MOS varactors, and letting Cp be the parasitic capacitance added to the wiring, the measured oscillation frequency f<b>2</b> of the VCO is given by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>f</i>2=1/[2&#xd7;&#x3c0;&#xd7;{(<i>L+Lp</i>)&#xd7;(<i>C+Cp</i>)}<sup>1/2</sup>].&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the wiring that couples the spiral inductor and the MOS varactors has a large length in the LC-tank VCO in &#x201c;A 10-Ghz CMOS LC VCO with Wide Tuning Range Using Capacitive Degeneration&#x201d;, the values of Lp and Cp in Equation (2) become large. As a result, the frequency f<b>2</b> as given by Equation (2) deviates significantly from the theoretical frequency f<b>1</b> as given by Equation (1).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, the present invention provides a semiconductor device that can reduce a parasitic inductor and/or parasitic capacitance added to the wiring that couples spiral inductors and MOS varactors included in a VCO.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a semiconductor substrate, and an LC-tank VCO formed on the semiconductor substrate. The LC-tank VCO includes a first spiral inductor and a second spiral inductor, and a first MOS varactor and a second MOS varactor. As seen perpendicularly to the semiconductor substrate, the first MOS varactor and the second MOS varactor are arranged in the region between the first spiral inductor and the second spiral indicator.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a parasitic inductor and/or parasitic capacitance added to the wiring that couples the spiral inductors and the MOS varactors included in the VCO can be reduced.</p>
