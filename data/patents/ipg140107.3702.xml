<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is claims priority from European Patent Application No. 12002892.3, filed Apr. 24, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an electronic device and a method for analog-to-digital conversion, and more specifically to an electronic device and a method for analog-to-digital conversion according to Delta-Sigma modulation using double sampling.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Delta-Sigma modulation (also referred to as Sigma-Delta modulation) is one of the widely used principles for analog-to-digital conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Delta-Sigma modulation is based on oversampling and noise-shaping providing among others a large dynamic range which is desirable for many applications. The term noise-shaping refers to the effect that the modulator moves the quantization noise to a frequency range outside the signal frequency range such that it can easily be suppressed in a digital post-processing step through digital filtering.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The Delta-Sigma modulator receives the analog signal at its input and provides the oversampled digital data at its output. Digital data appears with the high oversampling rate of the modulator at the modulator output and has a rather small bitwidth. Many modulator types use only a single-bit comparator which means that they output a digital single-bit stream. This single bit stream is typically filtered in order to remove undesired quantization noise and to receive multi-bit words of the desired resolution (for example 8, 16, 20 or more bit) at a lower sampling frequency. This means that a complete Delta-Sigma analog-to-digital converter comprises a modulator and digital filter.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The main factors for achieving a high signal-to-noise ratio and a large dynamic range are the oversampling factor and the order of the Delta-Sigma modulator. The oversampling rate is the quotient of sampling rate of the modulator divided by the Nyquist frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The higher the sampling rate (and thereby the oversampling ratio) and/or the order of a modulator, the higher is the achievable dynamic range. However, with an increasing sampling rate and/or order of the modulator, the power consumption and the complexity also increase.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are various different architectures for Delta-Sigma modulators each having their specific advantages and disadvantages. The order of a Delta-Sigma modulator is primarily determined by the number of integrators (or integration stages) of the modulator. The integrators or integration stages are often implemented as switched capacitor circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second order Delta-Sigma modulator mainly comprises two integrators, a comparator and a digital-analog converter. A system theoretical structure of a feedforward second order modulator is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The output signal of the first integrator, the output signal of the second integrator and the input signal are directly fed to the comparator input. At the input summing point, a reference signal depended on the comparator output signal of the last integration step (second integrator) is subtracted from the input signal. The resulting signal corresponds to the quantization error.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a feedback architecture, the reference signal would be subtracted from the input signal and the output of the first integrator. The comparator input signal would be the output signal of the second integrator.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The way of interconnecting the integration stages, the comparator and the inputs and outputs in accordance with a given modulator architecture determines the signal and noise transfer functions of a modulator, as it is well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other factors that influence the performance of a Delta-Sigma modulator and thereby the performance of the analog-to-digital converter using the Delta-Sigma modulator are, for example the noise introduced through the supply and reference voltages, the characteristics of the comparator and matching of the used components.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The maximum theoretically achievable signal-to-noise ratio of a Delta-Sigma modulator can also be increased, if a multi-bit comparator instead of a single-bit comparator is used. However, using multi-bit comparators entails other problems and may, for example affect linearity of the Delta-Sigma modulator. The most robust solution is a single-bit comparator.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first integrator or integration stage of the modulator has a major influence on the overall performance of the Delta-Sigma modulator. The present invention therefore focuses on an improved architecture for the first integrator. As previously described, one possibility to improve the performance of a Delta-Sigma modulator consists in increasing the oversampling ratio, which however, usually entails higher power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Increasing the sampling rate without substantially increasing the power consumption or maintaining the sampling rate while decreasing the power consumption can be achieved by a technique which is referred to as double sampling. Using double sampling for Delta-Sigma modulators is generally known in the art. There are various double sampling Delta-Sigma modulators known in the art, as for example from &#x201c;A second-order double-sampled delta-sigma modulator using additive-error switching&#x201d;, Burmas, T. V.; Dyer, K. C.; Hurst, P. J.; Lewis, S. H.; Solid-State Circuits, IEEE, Volume: 31 Issue:3, pages 284-293. There are various drawbacks of the solutions given in the above cited reference. These drawbacks relate to the specific way of sampling, the use of the capacitors during sampling, the comparators and the general architectures of the Delta-Sigma modulators.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is an object of the invention to provide an electronic device and an architecture for analog-to-digital conversion according to Delta-Sigma modulation using double sampling which has a better performance than the solutions according the prior art. According to an aspect of the invention, an electronic device for analog-to-digital conversion is provided. The analog-to-digital conversion is performed according to Delta-Sigma modulation. There is at least a first switched capacitor integration stage, a second switched capacitor integration stage and a single bit comparator. The first switched capacitor integration stage can be implemented in a fully differential architecture. The other parts of the electronic device may then also be configured according to fully differential architectures. Furthermore, the first switched capacitor integration stage can comprise an operational amplifier, integration capacitors coupled between input(s) and output(s) of the operational amplifier, a plurality of sets of input sampling capacitors for sampling an analog input voltage and a plurality of sets of reference feedback capacitors for sampling a feedback reference voltage. The first integration stage can then be configured to sample the analog input voltage on a first set of input capacitors out of the plurality of sets of input capacitors during a first portion of a clock cycle. The first integration stage is further configured to sample the analog input voltage on a second set out of the plurality of sets of input capacitors during a second portion of the clock cycle. Furthermore, the first integration stage is configured to sample the feedback reference voltage on a first set of reference feedback capacitors out of the plurality of sets of reference feedback capacitors during the first portion of the clock cycle and on a second set of reference feedback capacitors out of the plurality of sets of reference feedback capacitors during the second portion of the clock cycle. The first set of reference feedback capacitors and the second set of reference feedback capacitors are randomly selected out of the plurality of sets of reference feedback capacitors from clock cycle to clock cycle. This aspect of the invention provides that dual sampling of the feedback reference voltage in combination with random selection of sets of reference feedback capacitors out of a plurality of sets of reference feedback capacitors is used. The sampling frequency can then be maintained so that the time for charging and discharging the capacitors is increased, which reduces the power consumption of the operational amplifier. In a different embodiment, the sampling frequency may be increased in order to improve the performance of the analog-to-digital conversion. Any non-linearities due to mismatch of the reference feedback capacitors are eliminated or suppressed using the random exchange of sets of reference feedback capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The electronic device can further be configured to change the polarity of the integration capacitors and the analog input voltage with respect to each set of input capacitors from clock cycle to clock cycle. This aspect provides that a chopper-principle is applied. This chopper-principle eliminates distortion along the whole signal path, i.e. distortion of the sampled signals signal due to mismatch of the input capacitors network and the effect of offset of the amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The plurality of reference feedback capacitors can comprise more than two pairs, for example four pairs of capacitors. Each pair can represent a randomly selected set of feedback capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The plurality of sets of input capacitors can comprise two pairs of capacitors each pair representing a set of input capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Input and output common mode voltage can be separately adjusted for example by additional capacitors. This adjustment has to be performed in accordance with the double sampling techniques. According to an aspect of the invention, separate capacitors for defining the input common mode can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The input capacitors and reference feedback capacitors can be coupled in parallel to the inputs of the operational amplifier. This provides that the charge that is transferred to the integration capacitors is the difference of the charge on the respective reference feedback capacitor and the corresponding input capacitor. The input capacitors and reference feedback capacitors are then not stacked on the reference signals for providing the signals subtraction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention also provides a method of operating at least a first switched capacitor integration stage of an electronic device for analog-to-digital conversion. The analog input signal is double sampled during each clock cycle. The reference feedback voltage is also double sampled during each clock cycle. The polarity of the analog input signal and the polarity of the integration capacitors can be periodically or randomly changed. If a periodic change is used, the frequency of changing the polarity may correspond to the main clock frequency divided by any positive integer greater than 1 (i.e. for example half the frequency of the main clock, a quarter or an eighth of the frequency of the main clock etc.). This is performed in order to apply a chopper-principle to the signal path. The sets of reference feedback capacitors are periodically and randomly exchanged, which provides that mismatch between the different reference feedback path is modulated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention avoids periodic use of sets of reference feedback capacitors. This provides that the total harmonic distortion is reduced and that differential and integral non-linearity as well as the signal to noise ratio is improved. Furthermore, using a pseudo-random selection of sets of reference feedback capacitors is more useful than a pseudo-random selection of sets of input capacitors as any capacitor mismatch in the reference feedback path affects the modulator output much more than a mismatch of input capacitors. The frequency distribution of the pseudo-random signal can be the same as the one of the signal used for chopping the integrator.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The frequency distribution of the pseudo-random (either for changing the polarity of the input signal and/or for selecting the sets of reference feedback capacitors) signal can show a noise shaping behavior of first or higher order.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a more detailed simplified circuit diagram of the second order Delta-Sigma modulator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A first integration stage is formed by operational amplifier OP<b>1</b> and capacitors C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>. The second integration stage is formed by capacitors C<b>4</b> and C<b>5</b> and operational amplifier OP<b>2</b>. The outputs of the first integration stage and the second integration stage as well as the input voltage VIN are sampled on capacitors C<b>6</b>, C<b>7</b> and C<b>8</b> and summed up in order to be fed to one input of comparator COMP. The input of comparator COMP is supplied with the reference voltage VREF. The comparator COMP provides the output signal of the modulator MODOUT. The output signal MODOUT is given to an inverting 1-bit analog to digital converter. The resulting converted signal is fed back to the first integration stage through capacitor C<b>1</b>. The input signal VIN is sampled on capacitor C<b>2</b> in order to be fed to the operational amplifier OP<b>1</b>. According to the present invention, an improved architecture and sampling scheme for the first integration stage can be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> each show a first integration stage INT<b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the invention and a set of input capacitors and a set of reference feedback capacitors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the integration stage in INT<b>1</b> a first double sampling phase and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the integration stage in INT<b>1</b> in a subsequent second double sampling phase.</p>

In the following description, a switch is referred to as &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; if it is not conducting (disconnecting). A switch is referred to as &#x201c;ON&#x201d; if it is conducting (or connecting). There are four input capacitors CIN<b>1</b>, CIN<b>2</b>, CIN<b>3</b> and CIN<b>4</b>. Furthermore, there are four reference feedback capacitors CRF<b>1</b>, CRF<b>2</b>, CRF<b>3</b> and CRF<b>4</b>. There are also two integrating capacitors of the operational amplifier OP<b>1</b> which are referred to as CF<b>1</b> and CF<b>2</b>. CF<b>1</b> is coupled with a first side to the positive input of the operational amplifier and with a second side to the negative output of operational amplifier OP<b>1</b>. CF<b>2</b> is coupled with a first side to the negative input of the operational amplifier and with a second side to the positive output of operational amplifier OP<b>1</b>. The shown architecture is fully differential. This means that input and reference signals are processed in a symmetric manner. Accordingly, there is a positive input voltage level VIN+ and a negative input voltage level VIN&#x2212;, a positive reference voltage level VREF+ and a negative reference voltage level VREF&#x2212; as well as a positive output voltage level VOUT+ and a negative output voltage level VOUT&#x2212;.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The previously described configuration of switches and capacitors with respect to the fully differential operational amplifier OP<b>1</b> allows the first integrator INT<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to perform double sampling in combination with a chopping principle of the signal path and random selection of pairs of reference feedback capacitors in the feedback path of the reference signal VREF. The random signal for selecting the pairs of reference feedback capacitors is advantageously a separate signal, i.e. it is not derived, for example from the modulator output signal or the like. This reduces the risk of distortion due to signal correlation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">First and second portions of each clock cycle are periods of about (a bit less than) half the clock cycle taking into account that non-overlapping clock signals are used. Therefore, a portion of a clock cycle can not span the entire duration of half a clock cycle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows waveforms relating to the control signals of the switches of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A high level (ON) of a control signal indicates that the switch is conducting, a low level (OFF) indicates that the switch is not conducting. The following table indicates the states of the signals for each half clock cycle CC1.1 to CC5.1.</p>
