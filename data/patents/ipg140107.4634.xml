<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is related to the field of communications and, specifically, to the field of data communication by Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) is a bandwidth-efficient type of FSK digital modulation. Specifically, GFSK modulation utilizes a pulse shaping Gaussian filter to reduce the bandwidth of a modulated transmission carrier. In FSK modulation, a data symbol sequence having sharp transitions results in a modulated transmission carrier having discontinuities in frequency. The frequency discontinuities result in a transmission carrier of wide bandwidth. Smoothing the sharp transitions of the data symbol sequence, however, using a pulse shaping Gaussian filter, circumvents this problem. The pulse shaping Gaussian filter removes the higher frequency components in the data symbol sequence which, in turn, permits a more compact transmission spectrum.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The compact transmission spectrum facilitated by the GFSK modulation scheme aides wireless communication systems which operate in both licensed bands and the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, by reducing the spectral bandwidth and out-of-band spectrum of the GFSK transmission carrier, to meet FCC adjacent channel power rejection requirements. Similar requirements are enforced by international radio spectrum regulatory bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, pulse shaping by the pulse shaping Gaussian filter induces inter-symbol interference (ISI). In fact, it is the pulse shaping by the Gaussian filter which introduces the ISI. Consequently, systems designed around the GFSK modulation scheme are designed in view of low data throughput or increased bit error rate. Conventionally, the ISI associated with the GFSK modulation scheme prohibits data communication at high modulation orders, where multiple bits of data are transmitted per symbol. In an attempt to facilitate GFSK communications systems with higher data throughput, the use of more complex and expensive receiver structures have been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Discussion of the Related Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As illustrated at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first related art GFSK system <b>100</b> includes a GFSK transmitter <b>102</b> and a GFSK receiver <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The GFSK transmitter <b>102</b> includes a data source <b>104</b>, Gaussian filter <b>106</b>, an FSK modulator <b>108</b>, a transmitter back end <b>110</b>, and a transmission antenna <b>112</b>. The Gaussian filter <b>106</b> filters a data symbol sequence provided from data source <b>104</b>, and outputs a pulse-shaped data symbol sequence to the FSK modulator <b>108</b>. The FSK modulator <b>108</b> modulates a carrier frequency based on the pulse-shaped data symbol sequence, according to a selected FSK modulation order (i.e., a number of bits per symbol). The output of the FSK modulator <b>108</b> is provided to the transmitter back end <b>110</b>, where it is up-converted to a transmission frequency and coupled to the transmission antenna <b>112</b> for radio-frequency (RF) transmission. Accordingly, the transmission antenna <b>112</b> transmits a GFSK modulated transmission carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The GFSK receiver <b>114</b> includes a reception antenna <b>116</b>, a receiver front end <b>118</b>, a channel filter <b>120</b>, a discriminator <b>122</b>, a post detection filter <b>124</b>, a symbol slicer <b>126</b>, and a data sink <b>128</b>. In operation, the reception antenna <b>116</b> and receiver front end <b>118</b> receive a transmitted GFSK modulated signal and down-convert the received GFSK modulated signal to baseband. The channel filter <b>120</b> selectively filters the received baseband GFSK modulated signal to reject adjacent channel interference and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The discriminator <b>122</b> performs frequency demodulation by providing an output signal that is proportional to the instantaneous frequency of the modulated transmission carrier and outputs a demodulated sequence of symbols. Specifically, in the case of a 1 bit/symbol modulation order (i.e., 2-GFSK), the discriminator <b>122</b> discriminates between two frequencies, f<sub>0</sub>+f<sub>1 </sub>and f<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;f<sub>1</sub>, where f<sub>0 </sub>is the un-modulated carrier frequency. The post detection filter <b>124</b> filters the demodulated sequence of symbols produced by the discriminator <b>122</b> to reduce noise amplified by the discriminator <b>122</b>. The slicer <b>126</b> produces symbol decisions based on the filtered sequence of symbols output from the post detection filter <b>124</b>, to produce a sequence of symbol decisions, which is provided to the data sink <b>128</b>. In the GFSK receiver <b>114</b>, the post detection filter <b>124</b> is not designed to remove ISI, and the slicer <b>126</b> is required to produce symbol decisions in the presence of ISI, causing symbol and bit errors to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the first related art GFSK system <b>100</b>, the ISI introduced by the Gaussian filter <b>106</b> requires that a modulation scheme of low modulation order (i.e., few bits/symbol) be used by the FSK modulator <b>108</b>. Otherwise, unacceptable levels of symbol and bit errors will occur at the GFSK receiver <b>114</b>. Specifically, the ISI introduced by the Gaussian filter <b>106</b> causes the &#x201c;eye&#x201d; of the demodulated symbol sequence output by the discriminator <b>122</b> to close, and, thus, the slicer <b>126</b> will produce erroneous symbol decisions, as the output of the discriminator <b>122</b> will fail to be consistently above or below symbol decision threshold(s) of the slicer <b>126</b> with certainty at determined symbol timings. At higher modulation orders, it becomes even more difficult for the discriminator <b>122</b> and the slicer <b>126</b> to produce correct symbol decisions. Therefore, the data throughput of the first related art GFSK system <b>100</b> is limited because of the ISI introduced by the Gaussian filter <b>106</b>, as only lower order modulation schemes may be utilized without unacceptable levels of symbol errors. The channel filter <b>120</b> also contributes to the introduction of ISI in the received signal, further compounding the limitations of the GFSK system <b>100</b>.</p>

The GFSK transmitter <b>202</b> operates the same as the first related art GFSK transmitter <b>102</b>.</p>

As compared to the first related art GFSK receiver <b>114</b>, the second related art GFSK receiver <b>214</b> relies upon the MLSE estimator <b>224</b> to produce symbol decisions in the presence of ISI. That is, the MLSE estimator <b>224</b> does not remove the ISI. Instead, the MLSE estimator <b>224</b> estimates data symbols according to a least probability of errors, in the presence of the ISI, and outputs data bits in terms of error probability. For example, the MLSE estimator <b>224</b> may utilize the Vitrerbi algorithm for determining a symbol decision of lowest error probability, attempting to mitigate the presence of the ISI. However, especially at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), MLSE estimators cannot adequately mitigate symbol errors due to ISI.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention is directed to a communications receiver and a communications receiver method to substantially reduce and largely remove ISI introduced by pulse shaping Gaussian filters of GFSK transmitters, so that higher modulation orders of FSK may be utilized to increase data throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The disclosed receiver and receiver method permit the use of Gaussian filters which more aggressively pulse shape symbol sequences, as compared to filters conventionally used, to mitigate and substantially remove frequency discontinuities and to reduce occupied transmission bandwidth. Additionally, the disclosed receiver and receiver method permit higher FSK modulation orders to be used, while the higher-order modulated symbol sequences are more aggressively pulse shaped. Thus, the disclosed receiver and receiver method achieve increased data throughput while reducing the occupied transmission bandwidth. These and other advantages are achieved by a GFSK receiver including a filter which accounts for and removes ISI induced by pulse shaping Gaussian filters of GFSK transmitters.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Additionally, the disclosed receiver and receiver method substantially reduce and largely remove ISI introduced by transmitter modulators, receiver demodulators, and receiver channel filters.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further, the disclosed receiver and receiver method provide a communication system incorporating the known advantages of GFSK modulation while reducing the processing stages of conventional GFSK receivers to arrive at a simpler, more efficient, and cost effective GFSK receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The removal of ISI based on the receiver and receiver method of the present invention is not limited to GFSK communication systems, but may be used to remove ISI and other undesirable communication artifacts from communication systems other than GFSK communications systems, both wired and wireless.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An embodiment of a GFSK communications system which achieves the above-described advantages will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a GFSK communication system <b>300</b>. The GFSK communication system <b>300</b> includes a GFSK transmitter <b>302</b> and a GFSK receiver <b>314</b>. The GFSK transmitter <b>302</b> and the GFSK receiver <b>314</b> may be combined in a single communications unit as an integrated GFSK transceiver or may be provided as separate communication units.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The GFSK transmitter <b>302</b> includes a data source <b>304</b>, a Gaussian filter <b>306</b>, an FSK modulator <b>308</b>, a transmitter back end <b>310</b>, and a transmission antenna <b>312</b>. The Gaussian filter <b>306</b> filters a sequence of symbols provided from data source <b>304</b>, and outputs a pulse-shaped sequence of symbols to the FSK modulator <b>308</b>. The FSK modulator <b>308</b> modulates a frequency f<sub>0 </sub>based on the pulse-shaped sequence of symbols, according to a selected FSK modulation order m (i.e., a number of bits per symbol). The output of the FSK modulator <b>308</b> is provided to the transmitter back end <b>310</b>, where it is up-converted to a transmission frequency and coupled to the transmission antenna <b>312</b> for wireless RF transmission. The transmission antenna <b>312</b> transmits a GFSK modulated transmission signal at the transmission frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiments of the data source <b>304</b> may include a Forward Error Correction (FEC) code generator which adds redundant data to the sequence of symbols, so that a GFSK receiver can correct errors without re-transmission of data using an FEC decoder.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pulse shaping characteristics of the Gaussian filter <b>306</b> are described. The response of the Gaussian filter <b>306</b> is described in terms of its BT product, where B is the &#x2212;3 dB half-bandwidth of the filter and T is the symbol period (i.e., 1/f<sub>symbol rate</sub>) of an input symbol. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the impulse response of Gaussian filters of BT=0.3, 0.5, and 0.8, as convoluted with a rectangular impulse waveform of time period T and unit amplitude. The impulse responses of Gaussian filters of BT=0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 are illustrated, respectively, as output response waveforms <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, and <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vertical or y-axis represents the amplitude of the impulse responses, and the horizontal or x-axis represents the symbol time base T.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for lower values of the BT product, the output response waveforms <b>406</b>, <b>404</b>, and <b>402</b> become progressively more spread over the symbol time period T, representing increased introduction of ISI between data symbols. Specifically, any output response waveform having a duration greater than the symbol period T corresponds to a Gaussian filter having a BT product which results in the introduction of ISI among symbols when provided with a sequence of the symbols at its input. As illustrated, ISI among five symbol periods approaches for a BT of approximately 0.3.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In GFSK communications systems, Gaussian filters having low BT product values, although introducing significant amounts of ISI, result in modulated transmission carriers of more compact and efficient bandwidth, which is preferable. Specifically, frequency discontinuities in a modulated transmission carrier, which cause the transmission bandwidth of the modulated transmission carrier to be undesirably wide, are removed by the use of Gaussian filters in a GFSK communication system. The lower the BT product of a Gaussian filter, the better the removal of frequency discontinuities.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In preferred embodiments, the use of pulse shaping Gaussian filters having low BT products, such as 0.36 or lower, is possible because of a GFSK receiver filter described below. Thus, in the preferred embodiment, the Gaussian filter <b>306</b> has a BT product of 0.36.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the FSK modulator <b>308</b> modulates a carrier f<sub>0 </sub>based upon a modulation index h and the selected FSK modulation order m.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For FSK modulation at the selected FSK modulation order m, the modulation index h is defined as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>h=&#x394;f</i><sub>m</sub><i>/f</i><sub>symbol rate</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where f<sub>symbol rate </sub>is the symbol rate and &#x394;f<sub>m </sub>is the frequency spacing of adjacent symbols. Thus, the modulation index h indicates how much a modulated carrier varies from its unmodulated frequency, f<sub>0</sub>. The modulation index h is also related to an amount of bandwidth a modulated FSK carrier occupies. A lower modulation index h relates to a smaller occupied frequency bandwidth, and a larger modulation index h relates to a larger occupied frequency bandwidth. The susceptibility of a GFSK receiver to make erroneous symbol decisions increases as the modulation index, h, decreases.
</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The FSK modulator <b>308</b> of the GFSK receiver <b>314</b> may operate at relatively high modulation orders, m, and at relatively low modulation indexes, h, as compared to those conventionally used. For example, the FSK modulator <b>308</b> may operate at modulation orders such as 2-GFSK, 4-GFSK, 8-GFSK, and 16-GFSK, and embodiments may utilize odd modulation orders and modulation orders as high as 256-GFSK or higher. Also the FSK modulator <b>308</b> may operate at modulation indexes, h, as low as 1/256.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Embodiments are not limited to utilizing FSK modulation, however, and the FSK modulator <b>308</b> may be implemented by a Phase Shift Key (PSK) modulator, a Quadrature Amplitude (QAM) modulator, or equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The 2-GFSK modulation order relates to the transmission of 1 bit/symbol. Thus, when operating under a 2-GFSK modulation order, the FSK modulator <b>308</b> modulates a frequency f<sub>0 </sub>by offset frequencies +/&#x2212;f<sub>1</sub>, to arrive at two modulation symbols, f<sub>0</sub>+f<sub>1 </sub>and f<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;f<sub>1</sub>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a data symbol sequence <b>500</b>, an un-modulated carrier <b>502</b>, and a modulated carrier <b>504</b> are illustrated. As compared to the unmodulated carrier <b>502</b>, the modulated carrier <b>504</b> depicts a first FSK symbol <b>506</b>, at a frequency f<sub>0</sub>+f<sub>1</sub>, and a second FSK symbol <b>508</b>, at a frequency f<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;f<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the vertical or y-axis represents amplitude, and the horizontal or x-axis represents time.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the modulation orders of 4-GFSK, 8-GFSK, and 16-GFSK are based upon an extension of 2-GFSK using additional multiples of the offset frequency f<sub>1</sub>. That is, for 4-GFSK, which is a 2 bit/symbol modulation order, the FSK modulator <b>308</b> relies on four modulation symbols, f<sub>0</sub>+f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>0</sub>+3f<sub>1</sub>, and f<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;3f<sub>1</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, transmitter back end <b>310</b> up-converts the modulated carrier output from the FSK modulator <b>308</b> to a frequency suitable for RF transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The transmitter back end <b>310</b> includes hardware circuit components necessary to up-convert the frequency modulated carrier f<sub>0 </sub>to the frequency suitable for RF transmission. As part of a non-limiting group of hardware components, the transmitter back end <b>310</b> may include Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCO), Phase Locked Loops (PLLs), mixers, analog filters, Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs), and other hardware components recognized as being used to up-convert a modulated carrier to a frequency suitable for RF transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As discussed above, GFSK modulated transmission carriers of more compact and efficient bandwidth advantageously permit operation of GFSK transmitters in both licensed bands and the unlicensed ISM bands, by providing a transmission signal which conforms to FCC adjacent channel interference regulations. Further, GFSK modulated transmission carriers of more compact and efficient bandwidth advantageously permit the selection of transmission amplifiers which are simple and cost effective. Thus, because the transmission back end <b>310</b> transmits a modulated transmission carrier of compact bandwidth, as facilitated by the pulse shaping Gaussian filter <b>306</b>, the transmission back end <b>310</b> may be designed using a class of amplifiers which are simple, cost effective, and efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After up-conversion by the transmitter back end <b>310</b>, a GFSK modulated transmission carrier signal is transmitted from transmission antenna <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Embodiments of the GFSK transmitter <b>302</b> may be implemented entirely in hardware as a combination of hardware circuits. Alternatively, the GFSK transmitter <b>302</b> may be implemented in a combination of hardware and software. For example, the data source <b>304</b>, the Gaussian filter <b>306</b>, and the FSK modulator <b>308</b> may be implemented by a processor of a data processing apparatus executing computer readable instructions stored in a computer readable medium while the transmitter back end <b>310</b> and the transmission antenna <b>312</b> may be implemented in hardware as a combination of hardware circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring back to the GFSK communication system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the GFSK receiver <b>314</b> includes a reception antenna <b>316</b>, a receiver front end <b>318</b>, a channel filter <b>320</b>, an FSK demodulator <b>322</b>, a digital filter <b>324</b>, a slicer <b>326</b>, a symbol to bit mapper <b>328</b>, and a data sink <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The GFSK receiver <b>314</b> receives a GFSK modulated transmission carrier signal, such as the GFSK modulated transmission carrier signal transmitted by the GFSK transmitter <b>302</b>, at antenna <b>316</b>, and down-converts the received GFSK modulated transmission carrier signal at the receiver front end <b>318</b> to a baseband frequency modulated signal.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The receiver front end <b>318</b> includes hardware circuit components necessary to down-convert the received GFSK modulated transmission carrier signal to baseband. As part of a non-limiting group of hardware components, the receiver front end <b>318</b> may include Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCO), Phase Locked Loops (PLLs), mixers, analog filters, Low Noise Amplifiers (LNAs), and other hardware components recognized as being used to down-convert a received transmission carrier signal.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The channel filter <b>320</b> selectively reduces adjacent channel interference adjacent to a desired channel of the baseband frequency modulated signal from the baseband modulated signal and produces a channel filtered baseband modulated signal. In particular, the channel filter <b>320</b> reduces frequencies other than the transmission carrier frequency. However, as the BT of the channel filter <b>320</b> decreases, the channel filter <b>320</b> induces additional ISI in the received signal, as it reduces the adjacent channel interference. The channel filter <b>320</b> may have a BT product of 0.75, 0.6, 0.5, or lower. As compared to channel filters used in conventional GFSK receivers, the channel filter <b>320</b> may more aggressively pursue the reduction of adjacent channel interference by using a filter with a lower BT product, and the additional ISI may be substantially reduced and largely removed by the digital filter <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The FSK frequency demodulator <b>322</b> demodulates the channel filtered baseband frequency modulated signal, to recover a sequence of symbols. That is, depending upon the modulation order, m, used to modulate the GFSK modulated transmission carrier signal, the FSK frequency demodulator <b>322</b> may distinguish between the frequency f<sub>0 </sub>offset in frequency by multiples (i.e., f<sub>1</sub>, 3f<sub>1</sub>, 5f<sub>1</sub>, 7f<sub>1</sub>, etc.) of offset frequency f<sub>1</sub>. For example, in the case of a 1 bit/symbol modulation order (i.e., 2-GFSK), the frequency demodulator <b>322</b> discriminates between the two frequencies f<sub>0</sub>+f<sub>1 </sub>and f<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;f<sub>1</sub>, whereto is the carrier frequency, to produce an output signal. In the case of 2-GFSK, f<sub>0</sub>+f<sub>1 </sub>may relate to a demodulated logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; and f<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;f<sub>1 </sub>may relate to a demodulated logic &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Further modulation orders, such as 4-GFSK, 8-GFSK, and 16-GFSK may be realized based upon additional multiples of offset frequency f<sub>1</sub>, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The FSK frequency demodulator <b>322</b> may be realized by any frequency demodulator providing an output proportional to the instantaneous frequency at its input. To achieve high fidelity for higher modulation orders, the preferred embodiment of the FSK frequency demodulator <b>322</b> includes a digital signal processor (DSP) frequency demodulator that performs d&#x3b8;/dt in a bandwidth wider than the channel filter <b>320</b>, where &#x3b8; is instantaneous phase at the input of the FSK frequency demodulator <b>322</b>. The FSK frequency demodulator <b>322</b> outputs a recovered sequence of symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The recovered sequence of symbols output from the FSK frequency demodulator <b>322</b> is subject to ISI. The ISI is substantially caused by a pulse shaping Gaussian filter of the transmitter which transmitted the GFSK modulated transmission carrier signal, such as the pulse shaping Gaussian filter <b>306</b> of the GFSK transmitter <b>302</b>. Because the recovered sequence of symbols output from the FSK frequency demodulator <b>322</b> is subject to ISI, the &#x201c;eye&#x201d; of the recovered sequence of symbols collapses. To remove the ISI, the demodulated data output signal is filtered by the digital filter <b>324</b> to remove the ISI, before symbol decisions are made by the slicer <b>326</b>. Thus, the digital filter <b>324</b> opens the &#x201c;eye&#x201d; of the recovered sequence of symbols output from the FSK frequency demodulator <b>322</b>, so that symbol decisions made by the slicer <b>326</b> are made with less error, even at high modulation orders, m, and low SNR. The digital filter <b>324</b> substantially reduces and largely removes ISI based on a plurality of coefficients. The digital filter <b>324</b> also performs filtering similar to the filtering performed by the post detection filter <b>124</b> based on the plurality of coefficients.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A technique for determining the plurality of coefficients is described in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> below, and the structure and operation of the digital filter <b>324</b> is describe in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> below. Because the digital filter <b>324</b> removes ISI and also performs post detection filtering, the GFSK receiver <b>314</b> is designed to be at least as simple and as cost effective as conventional GFSK communication systems, but with better performance.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the slicer <b>326</b> produces symbol decisions based on the sequence of symbols filtered by the digital filter <b>324</b>. Based on the filtered sequence of symbols, the slicer <b>326</b> is capable of distinguishing among several FSK symbols, without error. Thus, the use of the digital filter <b>324</b> permits the FSK modulator <b>308</b> of the GFSK transmitter <b>302</b> to operate based on modulation orders which are higher than those conventionally used. Thus, data throughput is increased. Data throughput is also increased due to the removal of ISI by the digital filter <b>324</b>, because the slicer <b>326</b> is able to make symbol decisions with less error, which results in fewer re-transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">After symbol decisions are produced by the slicer <b>326</b>, the symbol-to-bit mapper <b>328</b> maps the symbol decisions to data bits. Depending upon the modulation order, m, one symbol input to the symbol-to-bit mapper <b>328</b> may correspond to 1, 2, 4, or more data bits. The symbol-to-bit mapper <b>328</b> may also map incoming symbols to an odd number of data bits. Further, embodiments of the slicer <b>326</b> and/or the symbol-to-bit mapper <b>328</b> may include an FEC decoder which uses redundant data to correct errors without re-transmission of the data. Data bits output by the symbol-to-bit mapper <b>328</b> are provided to the data sink <b>330</b>.</p>

The FIR digital filter <b>800</b> may also be embodied by an FIR digital filter which varies in structure from that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> based on known structures of FIR digital filters.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The number of the delay units in the chain of delay units <b>802</b> and the number of multiplier units in the chain of multiplier units <b>804</b> are determined based upon at least one of the symbol rate of received symbols, the digital filter sampling frequency the BT product of the pulse shaping Gaussian filter <b>306</b>, and the BT product of the channel filter <b>320</b>. The digital filter sampling frequency, must be greater than or equal to the Nyquist sampling frequency, which is twice the bandwidth of the signal at the output of the FSK demodulator <b>322</b>.</p>

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, [X] represents an input sequence of symbols, such as the sequence of symbols recovered by the FSK demodulator <b>322</b>. Each delay unit in the chain of delay units <b>802</b> stores a respective symbol of the input sequence of symbols, for one symbol period, and outputs the stored symbol to the next delay unit <b>802</b>. As illustrated at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, symbols are tapped before, between, and after each delay unit <b>802</b>, for multiplication of the tapped symbols by respective filter coefficients A<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;A<sub>N </sub>at respective multipliers <b>804</b>.

Based on the Nyquist response, ISI may be substantially eliminated from a sequence of symbols filtered by a Nyquist filter. The digital filter <b>324</b> and the FIR digital filter <b>800</b> are designed to remove residual ISI from a received signal to 1 part in 1000 (i.e., 0.1%) or less.</p>

The removal of adjacent channel interference at <b>1006</b> is accomplished by a channel filter, which may induce ISI in addition to any ISI already present in the received signal. The removal of adjacent channel interference at <b>1006</b> may be accomplished by a channel filter such as the channel filter <b>320</b>. Demodulation of the channel filtered baseband modulated signal at <b>1008</b> may be implemented by any suitable demodulator that provides an output proportional to the instantaneous frequency at its input, such as the frequency demodulator <b>322</b>.

With the ISI removed by filtering at <b>1010</b>, accurate symbol decisions may be made, substantially free from error even at low SNR, at <b>1012</b>.
