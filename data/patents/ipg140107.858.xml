<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/333,775 filed May 12, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electric variable cam phaser (eVCP) which uses an electric motor and a harmonic drive unit to vary the phase relationship between a crankshaft and a camshaft in an internal combustion engine; more particularly, to an eVCP where a sprocket used to drive the eVCP is smaller in diameter than a housing containing the eVCP; and even more particularly to an eVCP using a sleeve gear type joint to rotationally fix a sprocket used to drive the eVCP to a housing containing the harmonic drive unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Camshaft phasers (&#x201c;cam phasers&#x201d;) for varying the timing of combustion valves in internal combustion engines are well known. A first element, known generally as a sprocket element, is driven by a chain, belt, or gearing from an engine's crankshaft. A second element, known generally as a camshaft plate, is mounted to the end of an engine's camshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 7,421,990 B2 discloses an eVCP comprising first and second harmonic gear drive units facing each other along a common axis of the camshaft and the phaser and connected by a common flexible spline (flexspline). The first, or input, harmonic drive unit is driven by an engine sprocket, and the second, or output, harmonic drive unit is connected to an engine camshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first drawback of this arrangement is that the overall phaser package is undesirably bulky in an axial direction and thus consumptive of precious space in an engine's allotted envelope in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A second drawback is that two complete wave generator units are required, resulting in complexity of design and cost of fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A third drawback is that the phaser has no means to move the driven unit and attached camshaft to a phase position with respect to the crankshaft that would allow the engine to start and/or run in case of drive motor power malfunction. eVCPs have been put into production by two Japanese car manufacturers; interestingly, these devices have been limited to very low phase shift authority despite the trend in hydraulic variable cam phasers (hVCP) to have greater shift authority. Unlike hVCP, the prior art eVCP has no default seeking or locking mechanism. Thus, phase authority in production eVCPs to date has been undesirably limited to a low phase angle to avoid a stall or no-restart condition if the rotational position of the eVCP is far from an engine-operable position when it experiences electric motor or controller malfunction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/536,575 and US Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0030632-A1 which are commonly owned by Applicant disclose an eVCP camshaft phaser comprising a flat harmonic drive unit having a circular spline and a dynamic spline linked by a common flexspline within the circular and dynamic splines, and a single wave generator disposed within the flexspline. The circular spline is connectable to either of an engine camshaft or an engine crankshaft driven sprocket circumferentially surrounding and rotationally fixed to the outside diameter of a housing, the dynamic spline being connectable to the other thereof. The wave generator is driven selectively by an electric motor to cause the dynamic spline to rotate past the circular spline, thereby changing the phase relationship between the crankshaft and the camshaft. The electric motor may be equipped with an electromagnetic brake. At least one coaxial coil spring is connected to the sprocket and to the phaser hub and is positioned and tensioned to bias the phaser and camshaft to a default position wherein the engine can run or be restarted should control of the electric motor be lost resulting in the electric motor being unintentionally de-energized or held in an unintended energized position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Engine applications exist that require that the drive sprocket be made smaller in diameter than the housing to which it will be transmitting torque. The logical solution used in hydraulic type phasers is to place the small diameter gear axially behind the phasing mechanism, integral with a plate or rear cover, which is then fixed to the rear of the housing. However, implementing this solution with the eVCP presents two challenges. The first challenge is that offsetting the drive sprocket so far rearward would offset the radial drive load so far from the journal bearing that binding or wear problems could result. Increasing the length of the journal bearing to compensate for the offsetting of the drive sprocket is not practical due to the need for axial compactness. The second challenge is that the spring plate now needs to transmit the drive torque to the housing. The knurled press fit design presently known is not adequate to transmit this drive torque load.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">While the eVCP does not rely on engine oil to actuate, it does rely on engine oil to lubricate the harmonic drive unit and bearings. In order to minimize parasitic oil pressure loss, the amount of oil flow used to lubricate the eVCP needs to be held to a minimum. This results in a dead headed oiling system in which there is not enough oil flowing through the eVCP to flush out contaminants. This allows the contaminants to accumulate within the eVCP which may lead to premature wear.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">What is needed is an eVCP with a drive sprocket smaller in diameter than the housing which does not result in binding or wearing problems to the journal bearing. What is also needed is an eVCP that has a spring plate which is able to transmit the drive torque to the housing. What is also needed is an eVCP that prevents the accumulation of contaminants that may lead to premature wear of eVCP components.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Briefly described, a camshaft phaser is provided for controllably varying the phase relationship between a crankshaft and a camshaft in an internal combustion engine. The camshaft phaser includes a housing having a bore with a longitudinal axis and an array of internal splines formed within the bore. A harmonic gear drive unit is disposed within the housing, the harmonic gear drive unit comprising a circular spline and an axially adjacent dynamic spline, a flexspline disposed within the circular spline and the dynamic spline, a wave generator disposed within the flexspline, and a rotational actuator connectable to the wave generator such that rotation of the wave generator causes relative rotation between the circular spline and the dynamic spline. One of the circular spline and the dynamic spline is fixed to the housing in order to prevent relative rotation therebetween. An output hub is rotatably disposed within the housing axially adjacent to the harmonic gear drive unit and attachable to the camshaft and fixed to the other of the circular spline and the dynamic spline in order to prevent relative rotation therebetween. A back plate has an array of external splines engaged in a sliding fit with the array of internal splines for transmitting torque from the back plate to the housing. The back plate also has an input sprocket for receiving rotational motion, in use, from the crankshaft.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an eVCP <b>10</b> in accordance with the present invention includes a flat harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b>; a rotational actuator <b>14</b> that may be a hydraulic motor but is preferably a DC electric motor, operationally connected to harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b>; an input sprocket <b>16</b> operationally connected to harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b> and drivable by a crankshaft (not shown) of engine <b>18</b>; an output hub <b>20</b> attached to harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b> and mountable to an end of an engine camshaft <b>22</b>; and a bias spring <b>24</b> operationally disposed between output hub <b>20</b> and input sprocket <b>16</b>. Electric motor <b>14</b> may be an axial-flux DC motor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b> comprises an outer first spline <b>28</b> which may be either a circular spline or a dynamic spline as described below; an outer second spline <b>30</b> which is the opposite (dynamic or circular) of first spline <b>28</b> and is coaxially positioned adjacent first spline <b>28</b>; a flexspline <b>32</b> disposed radially inwards of both first and second splines <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and having outwardly-extending gear teeth disposed for engaging inwardly-extending gear teeth on both first and second splines <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>; and a wave generator <b>36</b> disposed radially inwards of and engaging flexspline <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Flexspline <b>32</b> is a non-rigid ring with external teeth on a slightly smaller pitch diameter than the circular spline. It is fitted over and elastically deflected by wave generator <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The circular spline is a rigid ring with internal teeth engaging the teeth of flexspline <b>32</b> across the major axis of wave generator <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The dynamic spline is a rigid ring having internal teeth of the same number as flexspline <b>32</b>. It rotates together with flexspline <b>32</b> and serves as the output member. Either the dynamic spline or the circular spline may be identified by a chamfered corner <b>34</b> at its outside diameter to distinguish one spline from the other.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As is disclosed in the prior art, wave generator <b>36</b> is an assembly of an elliptical steel disc supporting an elliptical bearing, the combination defining a wave generator plug. A flexible bearing retainer surrounds the elliptical bearing and engages flexspline <b>32</b>. Rotation of the wave generator plug causes a rotational wave to be generated in flexspline <b>32</b> (actually two waves 180&#xb0; apart, corresponding to opposite ends of the major ellipse axis of the disc).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">During assembly of a harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b>, flexspline teeth engage both circular spline teeth and dynamic spline teeth along and near the major elliptical axis of the wave generator. The dynamic spline has the same number of teeth as the flexspline, so rotation of the wave generator causes no net rotation per revolution therebetween. However, the circular spline has slightly fewer gear teeth than does the dynamic spline, and therefore the circular spline rotates past the dynamic spline during rotation of the wave generator plug, defining a gear ratio therebetween (for example, a gear ratio of 50:1 would mean that 1 rotation of the circular spline past the dynamic spline corresponds to 50 rotations of the wave generator). Harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b> is thus a high-ratio gear transmission; that is, the angular phase relationship between first spline <b>28</b> and second spline <b>30</b> changes by 2% for every revolution of wave generator <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Of course, as will be obvious to those skilled in the art, the circular spline rather may have slightly more teeth than the dynamic spline has, in which case the rotational relationships described below are reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, input sprocket <b>16</b> is rotationally fixed to a generally cup-shaped sprocket housing <b>40</b> that is fastened by bolts <b>42</b> to first spline <b>28</b>. Coupling adaptor <b>44</b> is mounted to wave generator <b>36</b> and extends through sprocket housing <b>40</b>, being supported by bearing <b>46</b> mounted in sprocket housing <b>40</b>. Coupling <b>48</b> mounted to the motor shaft of electric motor <b>14</b> and pinned thereto by pin <b>50</b> engages coupling adaptor <b>44</b>, permitting wave generator <b>36</b> to be rotationally driven by electric motor <b>14</b>, as may be desired to alter the phase relationship between first spline <b>28</b> and second spline <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Output hub <b>20</b> is fastened to second spline <b>30</b> by bolts <b>52</b> and may be secured to engine camshaft <b>22</b> by central through-bolt <b>54</b> extending through output hub axial bore <b>56</b> in output hub <b>20</b>, and capturing stepped thrust washer <b>58</b> and filter <b>60</b> recessed in output hub <b>20</b>. In an eVCP, it is necessary to limit radial run-out between the input hub and output hub. In the prior art, this has been done by providing multiple roller bearings to maintain concentricity between the input and output hubs. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, radial run-out is limited by a single journal bearing interface <b>38</b> between sprocket housing <b>40</b> (input hub) and output hub <b>20</b>, thereby reducing the overall axial length of eVCP <b>10</b> and its cost to manufacture. Output hub <b>20</b> is retained within sprocket housing <b>40</b> by snap ring <b>62</b> disposed in an annular groove <b>64</b> formed in sprocket housing <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Back plate <b>66</b>, which is integrally formed with input sprocket <b>16</b>, captures bias spring <b>24</b> against output hub <b>20</b>. Inner spring tang <b>67</b> is engaged by output hub <b>20</b>, and outer spring tang <b>68</b> is attached to back plate <b>66</b> by pin <b>69</b>. In the event of an electric motor malfunction, bias spring <b>24</b> is biased to back-drive harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b> without help from electric motor <b>14</b> to a rotational position of second spline <b>30</b> wherein engine <b>18</b> will start or run, which position may be at one of the extreme ends of the range of authority or intermediate of the phaser's extreme ends of its rotational range of authority. For example, the rotational range of travel in which bias spring <b>24</b> biases harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b> may be limited to something short of the end stop position of the phaser's range of authority. Such an arrangement would be useful for engines requiring an intermediate park position for idle or restart.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The nominal diameter of output hub <b>20</b> is D; the nominal axial length of first journal bearing <b>70</b> is L; and the nominal axial length of the oil groove <b>72</b> formed in either output hub <b>20</b> (shown) and/or in sprocket housing <b>40</b> (not shown) for supplying oil to first journal bearing <b>70</b> is W. In addition to journal bearing clearance, the length L of the journal bearing in relation to output hub diameter D controls how much output hub <b>20</b> can tip within sprocket housing <b>40</b>. The width of oil groove <b>72</b> in relation to journal bearing length L controls how much bearing contact area is available to carry the radial load. Experimentation has shown that a currently preferred range of the ratio L/D may be between about 0.25 and about 0.40, and that a currently preferred range of the ratio W/L may be between about 0.15 and about 0.70.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Oil provided by engine <b>18</b> is supplied to oil groove <b>72</b> by one or more oil passages <b>74</b> that extend radially from output hub axial bore <b>56</b> of output hub <b>20</b> to oil groove <b>72</b>. Filter <b>60</b> filters contaminants from the incoming oil before entering oil passages <b>74</b>. Filter <b>60</b> also filters contaminants from the incoming oil before being supplied to harmonic gear drive unit <b>12</b> and bearing <b>46</b>. Filter <b>60</b> is a band-type filter that may be a screen or mesh and may be made from any number of different materials that are known in the art of oil filtering.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Extension portion <b>82</b> of output hub <b>20</b> receives bushing <b>78</b> in a press fit manner. In this way, output hub <b>20</b> is fixed to bushing <b>78</b>. Input sprocket axial bore <b>76</b> interfaces in a sliding fit manner with bushing <b>78</b> to form second journal bearing <b>84</b>. This provides support for the radial drive load placed on input sprocket <b>16</b> and prevents the radial drive load from tipping output hub <b>20</b>/first journal bearing <b>70</b> which could cause binding and wear issues for first journal bearing <b>70</b>. Bushing <b>78</b> includes radial flange <b>80</b> which serves to axially retain back plate <b>66</b>/input sprocket <b>16</b>. Alternatively, but not shown, bushing <b>78</b> may be eliminated and input sprocket axial bore <b>76</b> could interface in a sliding fit manner with extension portion <b>82</b> of output hub <b>20</b> to form second journal bearing <b>84</b> and thereby provide the support for the radial drive load placed on input sprocket <b>16</b>. In this alternative, back plate <b>66</b>/input sprocket <b>16</b> may be axially retained by a snap ring (not shown) received in a groove (not shown) of extension portion <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to transmit torque from input sprocket <b>16</b>/back plate <b>66</b> to sprocket housing <b>40</b> and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a sleeve gear type joint is used in which back plate <b>66</b> includes an array of external splines <b>86</b> which slidingly fit with an array of internal splines <b>88</b> included within sprocket housing <b>40</b>. The sliding fit nature of the splines <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> eliminates or significantly reduces the radial tolerance stack issue between first journal bearing <b>70</b> and second journal bearing <b>84</b> because the two journal bearings <b>70</b>, <b>84</b> operate independently and do not transfer load from one to the other, thereby preventing binding between output hub <b>20</b> and sprocket housing <b>40</b>. If this tolerance stack issue were not resolved, manufacture of the two journal bearings would be prohibitive in mass production because of component size and concentricity tolerances that would need to be maintained. The sleeve gear arrangement also eliminates then need for a bolted flange arrangement to rotationally fix back plate <b>66</b> to sprocket housing <b>40</b> which minimizes size and mass. Additionally, splines <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> lend themselves to fabrication methods where they can be net formed onto back plate <b>66</b> and into sprocket housing <b>40</b> respectively. Splines <b>86</b>, <b>88</b> may be made, for example, by powder metal process or by standard gear cutting methods.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While extension portion <b>82</b> has been described and shown as being integrally formed with output hub <b>20</b>, it should now be understood that other arrangements could also be used while obtaining the same effect. One alternative that may be employed is to use an extended length camshaft which extends through input sprocket <b>16</b> in a sliding fit manner to form a journal bearing therewith. After central through-bolt <b>54</b> has been tightened, this alternative arrangement would effectively be equivalent to providing the output hub with an extension portion.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While eVCP is driven by a crankshaft through input sprocket <b>16</b>, it should now be understood that other known drive arrangements, for example a pulley or a gear, may also be used and fall within the scope of the term &#x201c;sprocket.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the invention has been described by reference to various specific embodiments, it should be understood that numerous changes may be made within the spirit and scope of the inventive concepts described. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the described embodiments, but rather only to the extent set forth in the claims that follow.</p>
