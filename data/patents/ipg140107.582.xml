<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The application relates generally to methods and apparatus for in-process form checks of manufactured components, and more specifically to checks of gas turbine airfoils.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Components, including those built to tight tolerances like airfoils, are repeatedly checked throughout the manufacturing process for conformance with such tolerances. For example, fan blades include several manufacturing stages such as casting or forging, quenching, rough machining, and final machining. Hollow fan blades include additional manufacturing steps depending on the chosen process for forming the internal features. Diffusion bonded hollow blades are formed in two pieces then joined around the edges. Both position and thickness of the blade surfaces must be measured often.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tight tolerances often require expensive, high precision sensors which must consistently be placed correctly relative to the airfoil to reliably take correct measurements. The location of each measurement reading must also be correctly mapped to the corresponding airfoil reference point. Manual measurements using a single sensor without the aid of precise guidance can lead to significant opportunity for error both in position and location. One method of overcoming these shortcomings involves individual sensors fixed and integrated into a gauge at each and every reference point. However, such an arrangement is incredibly expensive, requiring the use of twenty or more sensors in order to take the simultaneous measurements.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows fan blade <b>10</b>, root edge <b>12</b>, tip region <b>14</b>, suction surface <b>16</b>, leading edge <b>18</b>, trailing edge <b>20</b>, airfoil inspection system <b>22</b>, inspection template <b>24</b>, sacrificial airfoil element <b>25</b>, inspection bosses <b>26</b>-I, clamps <b>27</b>, sensor apparatus <b>28</b>, and sensor apertures <b>30</b>-I. Fan blade <b>10</b>, which for example can be used in a turbofan gas turbine engine (not shown), includes root edge <b>12</b>, tip region <b>14</b>, suction surface <b>16</b>, leading edge <b>18</b>, and trailing edge <b>20</b>. Fan blade <b>10</b> is joined at root edge <b>12</b> to a fan rotor (not shown) which generates thrust by using a plurality of circumferentially arranged blades <b>10</b> to push air through a bypass duct around the turbine power core (not shown). In this example, fan blade <b>10</b> is shown as a separate entity with root edge <b>12</b> removably securable to the rotor (not shown). However, fan blade <b>10</b> can alternatively be integrally formed with, or welded directly to the fan rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Fan blade <b>10</b> can be checked at multiple stages throughout production. A reliable form check entails evaluating blade <b>10</b> at a plurality of reference points (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) distributed around suction surface <b>16</b>. One or more characteristics of blade <b>10</b> are checked against the ideal or nominal characteristics of the reference blade or the digital design model at each of the plurality of reference points shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. It will be understood that the blade pressure surface opposite suction surface <b>16</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) also can have a similar plurality of reference points and corresponding characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Potential nominal, ideal, and actual characteristics of blade <b>10</b> include surface position, thickness, surface contour angle, etc. An appropriate contact or non-contact sensor is thus positioned on or normal to each reference point to measure these or other characteristics of blade <b>10</b>. Example sensors thus can include without limitation, a white light sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) sensor, a thermal acoustic sensor, and a coordinate measuring sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Airfoil inspection system <b>22</b> includes sensor template <b>24</b> and sensor apparatus <b>28</b>. Sensor template <b>24</b> can be secured to blade <b>10</b> such as by clamps <b>23</b>. As will be seen later, template <b>24</b> generally conforms to blade <b>10</b> but is held a substantially uniform distance therefrom by various tooling or nesting features not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, some of which may be present on one or more sacrificial blade elements <b>25</b>. Template <b>24</b> includes a plurality of inspection bosses <b>26</b>-I for removably securing sensor apparatus <b>28</b> to template <b>24</b>. In this example, I is a sequential nonzero integer value identifying each unique position of reference point <b>22</b>. Each boss <b>26</b>-I has a corresponding sensor aperture <b>30</b>-I disposed axially therethrough, as well as a coupling portion for engaging a coupling disposed on sensor apparatus <b>28</b> (detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>). In this example, template <b>24</b> has a total of 29 apertures, but this number can vary depending on the number of blade reference points <b>32</b>-I (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When template <b>24</b> is aligned with blade <b>10</b> and when the sensor (not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) contained in apparatus <b>28</b> projects through sensor apertures <b>30</b>-I, the sensor is correctly positioned relative to respective blade reference points located thereunder. As will be seen later, in this example, sensor apparatus <b>28</b> is removably secured to boss <b>26</b>-<b>29</b>. Though not visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it will be described below that the operative end of the sensor thus projects through aperture <b>30</b>-<b>29</b> and is substantially normal to suction surface <b>16</b> at or above the corresponding reference point <b>32</b>-<b>29</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows fan blade <b>10</b>, root edge <b>12</b>, tip region <b>14</b>, suction surface <b>16</b>, leading edge <b>18</b>, trailing edge <b>20</b>, inspection template <b>24</b>, sacrificial blade elements <b>25</b>, inspection bosses <b>26</b>-I, sensor apertures <b>30</b>-I, blade reference points <b>32</b>-I, blade nesting points <b>34</b>, neutral line <b>36</b>, and recesses <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> depicts an exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with template <b>24</b> disposed above suction surface <b>16</b> of fan blade <b>10</b>. Template <b>24</b> includes a plurality of inspection bosses <b>26</b>-I to sequentially position sensor apparatus <b>28</b> on or substantially normal to each respective blade reference point <b>32</b>-I, ensuring correct measurements and minimizing tolerance stacking. Template <b>24</b> is aligned relative to blade <b>10</b> at blade nesting points <b>34</b> and blade neutral line <b>36</b> delineated by two conical recesses <b>38</b>. Neutral line <b>36</b> passes through the aerodynamic center of blade <b>10</b>. One recess <b>38</b> is disposed on sacrificial blade portion <b>25</b> proximate tip region <b>14</b>, while a second recess <b>38</b> is disposed on the interface between suction surface <b>16</b> and root edge <b>12</b>. A third recess is on sacrificial portion <b>25</b> adjacent root edge <b>12</b>. Sacrificial elements <b>25</b> are provided during manufacturing for various purposes, including for holding blade <b>10</b> in a chuck for machining or for other processing. Inspection template <b>24</b> includes corresponding nesting features shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in more detail below, sensor apparatus <b>28</b> includes a sensor retained in a receptacle. The receptacle individually and sequentially removably engages with the plurality of inspection bosses <b>26</b>-I to retain the sensor through the corresponding apertures <b>30</b>-I. As noted above, each boss <b>26</b>-I is aligned with and corresponds to the location of respective blade reference points <b>32</b>-I, and can be centered with respective apertures <b>30</b>-I substantially normal thereto. In certain embodiments described in detail below, inspection template <b>24</b> and sensor apparatus <b>28</b> can be configured to include interacting features such as a tab and resistor, whereby a circuit is closed and a sensor reading is recorded only when sensor apparatus <b>28</b> is properly placed in the boss <b>26</b>-I. As further described below, the resistor can optionally be configured to have a unique ohm value corresponding to the relative location of each individual boss, allowing a controller or other analyzing device to automatically correlate and register the location of each sensor on or normal to a given blade reference point <b>32</b>-I. Thus a single sensor apparatus <b>28</b> can be used for form checks occurring throughout production of blade <b>10</b> or its precursors. Form checks performed during production not only identifies parts falling outside acceptable tolerances, checking each blade throughout production can alert workers when tooling for casting or forging (not shown) should be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When used without additional aids, the sensor must be manually positioned correctly and the reading for each reference point <b>32</b>-I must be taken and registered by the user only upon the sensor orientation falling within an acceptable measurement tolerance. Thus substantial risk of human error is likely when positioning the sensor without additional guidance. But since inspection template <b>24</b> enables use of as few as one movable sensor, the need is avoided to procure, fix, and connect twenty or more individual sensors to a gauge and corresponding controller. Using a large number of sensors can be prohibitively expensive and complex, particularly for repeated in-process form checks where several such gauges are used at different stages of the manufacturing process. For example, when using a gauge with fixed sensors, checking an airfoil at twenty reference points after each of three production stages can require up to sixty different sensors for the three different in-process gauges. In contrast, the present arrangement facilitates the use of as few as one sensor, which is removably secured to individual templates each of which represents the nominal result of each production stage. The sixty sensor requirement can double, triple, or more if multiple types of sensors are required to measure multiple characteristics of the in-process airfoil.</p>

In this example, hollow fan blade <b>10</b> is formed from two separate blade precursors <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, representing respective pressure surface <b>40</b> and opposing suction surface <b>16</b>. Precursors <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B are individually formed and upon passing one or more form checks are then diffusion bonded around their perimeters (i.e., around root edge <b>12</b>, tip edge <b>14</b>, leading edge <b>18</b>, and trailing edge <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>). Precursors <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B may be cast, forged, and/or machined from blanks prior to diffusion bonding and can be form checked after initial forming, before and after bonding, after quenching, and after processing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Blade <b>10</b> also includes ribs <b>44</b>, cavities <b>46</b>, and surface thicknesses <b>48</b>. Ribs <b>44</b> support suction surface <b>16</b> and pressure surface <b>40</b>, defining cavities <b>46</b> to reduce the weight of blade <b>10</b>, increasing its efficiency. Ribs <b>44</b> can be either integral to one or both precursors <b>42</b>A, <b>42</b>B, or can alternatively be bonded separately thereto. Positions and depths of cavities <b>46</b> and of surface thicknesses <b>48</b> can be measured and compared to nominal or ideal values. These nominal or ideal values have been determined as part of the design with respect to each reference points <b>32</b>-I (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). In other alternative examples, fan blade <b>10</b> is solid and would thus not need to be checked at quite as many stages or for as many characteristics. In either case, suction surface <b>16</b> and pressure surface <b>40</b> are typically checked at least after initial forming (e.g. casting or forging), and after subsequent processing (e.g. machining, twisting, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows inspection template <b>24</b>, sensor apertures <b>30</b>-I, sensor <b>50</b>, template body <b>52</b>, component side <b>54</b>, template leading edge <b>56</b>, template trailing edge <b>58</b>, template tip region <b>60</b>, template root region <b>62</b>, tooling balls <b>64</b>, plungers <b>66</b>, and locating pin <b>70</b>. Inspection template <b>24</b> includes sensor <b>50</b> projecting therethrough. Template <b>24</b> has body <b>52</b> with component side <b>54</b>. For reference, template body <b>52</b> also has template leading edge <b>56</b>, template trailing edge <b>58</b>, template tip region <b>60</b>, and template root region <b>62</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows the inspection side opposite component side <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Sensor <b>50</b> projects through one of a plurality of sensor apertures <b>30</b>-I. In this example, it is aperture <b>30</b>-<b>29</b>, consistent with the view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Proper alignment of template <b>24</b> locates apertures <b>30</b>-I substantially equidistant and normal to the surface being inspected. Therefore an operative portion of sensor <b>50</b> projects through one or the plurality of apertures <b>30</b>-I when correctly engaged to respective boss <b>26</b>-I (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Sensor <b>50</b> is thus positioned on or directly above blade reference point <b>32</b>-I (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) to a high degree of precision. Sensor <b>50</b> can be either a contact or non-contact sensor used to measure one or more characteristics of blade <b>10</b>. Example nominal, ideal, and actual characteristics of blade <b>10</b> include without limitation surface location (coordinates), thickness, and contour angle. Appropriate sensors are positioned as close as possible to each reference point <b>32</b>-I to measure these or other characteristics of blade <b>10</b>. Example sensors <b>50</b> thus can include without limitation, a white light sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) sensor, a thermal acoustic sensor, and a coordinate measuring sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Gauges and templates typically are aligned visually with the component to be inspected, but such gauges are prone to parallax error. Here, parallax error is eliminated by providing a nest based on datums used throughout the manufacturing process, which map the surfaces of blade <b>10</b> relative to a zero- or neutral-point located at the blade center. While template <b>24</b> generally conforms to the surface of blade <b>10</b>, template <b>24</b> can additionally be aligned with blade <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) using a five- or six-point nest consisting of alignment protuberances. In this example, protuberances include tooling balls <b>64</b> (disposed around the perimeter of component side <b>54</b>) and plungers <b>66</b> (arranged along neutral line <b>36</b>) define a five-point nest on component side <b>54</b>. Tooling balls <b>64</b> align with nesting points <b>34</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), while plungers <b>66</b> can include a retractor or similar structure to resiliently engage with conical recesses <b>38</b>. Recesses <b>38</b> can be formed on sacrificial portions <b>25</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and removed after final machining of blade <b>10</b>. Tooling balls <b>64</b> and plungers <b>66</b> maintain component side <b>54</b> at a substantially uniform distance normal to the surface of fan blade <b>10</b>. Locating pin <b>70</b> optionally corresponds to third recess <b>38</b> on sacrificial portion <b>25</b>. In certain embodiments, pin <b>70</b> can thus serve as a sixth nest point.</p>

Inspection boss <b>26</b>-<b>29</b> includes sensor aperture <b>30</b>-<b>29</b> disposed therethrough, providing access for sensor <b>50</b> to reach through to airfoil reference point <b>22</b>-<b>29</b>.</p>

Each first coupling <b>82</b>-I and second coupling <b>84</b> can be interlocking portions of any suitable standard or quick connect coupling. Standard couplings are typically of the threaded type, such that one of coupling <b>82</b>, <b>84</b> includes a threaded inner portion mating with a threaded outer portion on the other of couplings <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>. Quick connect couplings can be of the twist on or spring loaded type where resilient elements are substituted for the mating threads. Here, first couplings <b>82</b>-I constitute the male end with coupling features disposed around the outer diameter, while second coupling <b>84</b> has coupling features disposed on its inner diameter. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, first couplings <b>82</b> include three outer projections <b>83</b> while second coupling <b>84</b> includes a corresponding three L-shaped slots <b>85</b>.</p>

Sensor receptacle <b>74</b> can also include at least one knurled outer surface <b>88</b> to improve grip and further facilitate rapid engagement and disengagement of apparatus <b>74</b> to bosses <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Using substantially identical first couplings <b>82</b>-I on each respective boss <b>26</b>-I allows sensor <b>50</b> to be reliably positioned individually and sequentially to each boss <b>26</b>-I. Thus this inspection arrangement requires as few as one sensor <b>50</b> to inspect the entire surface of the component, or one more of its precursors, while simultaneously reliably mapping the localized inspection results without human intervention. To ensure quality measurements, previous inspection gauges require that a large plurality of sensors be positioned and/or activated simultaneously at the reference points. Without a gauge, there was no way to reliably identify correct positioning of a single sensor absent the use of several simultaneously positioned sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this example, however, inspection system <b>22</b> includes a sensor activation circuit, which can be configured to take one or more readings from sensor <b>50</b> automatically upon correct positioning of sensor apparatus <b>28</b>. In certain embodiments, the sensor activation circuit includes at least sensor apparatus <b>28</b> along with controller <b>78</b> and communication cable <b>80</b>. In these embodiments, controller <b>78</b> is programmed to record at least one measurement from sensor <b>50</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) communicated via cable <b>80</b> only when properly positioned in a selected boss <b>26</b>-I, here boss <b>26</b>-<b>29</b>. In certain of those embodiments, controller <b>78</b> also automatically registers the position of sensor apparatus <b>28</b> (and thus sensor <b>50</b>) upon recording the at least one measurement. Controller <b>78</b> is then programmed to map the recorded measurement data to the corresponding reference point <b>32</b>-<b>29</b>. Controller <b>78</b> can be signaled in any suitable manner that sensor <b>50</b> is correctly positioned, thus triggering the programming directing controller <b>78</b> to record the at least one measurement. In one example, controller <b>78</b> can be signaled via a tab and resistor arrangement that is triggered upon engaging of first coupling <b>82</b>-<b>29</b> to second coupling <b>84</b>. In this example, tab <b>90</b> is disposed on sensor receptacle <b>74</b>. Tab <b>90</b> is configured to remain engaged to a corresponding structure disposed on boss <b>26</b>-<b>29</b>, such as recess <b>92</b>, so long as sensor apparatus <b>28</b> remains secured to boss <b>26</b>-<b>29</b>. When sensor apparatus <b>28</b> is pushed down onto boss <b>26</b>-<b>29</b> (or any other boss <b>264</b>), tab <b>90</b> engages recess <b>92</b> and remains as such after apparatus <b>28</b> is rotated in the manner shown by arrow <b>86</b>. This indicates correct positioning and retaining of sensor <b>50</b> on or above blade reference point <b>32</b>-<b>29</b> (or other corresponding reference point <b>32</b>-I). Upon correct engagement, the sensor activation circuit is then closed, which is sensed by controller <b>78</b> (via cable <b>80</b>). After a designated time period to ensure full engagement and correct positioning of sensor <b>50</b>, controller <b>78</b> then records at least one correct reading from sensor <b>50</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows one example of a resistor disposed in or around one or more surfaces of recess <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As discussed above, sensor <b>50</b> can be a contact sensor or non-contact sensor with the choice determined by the characteristic(s) being measured. Contact sensors operate by contacting the surface being inspected, while non-contact sensors operate in proximity to the surface being inspected and operate using EMF, ultrasonic, or other emissions reflected back to the sensor. Sensor <b>50</b> communicates via wired connection <b>80</b> to controller <b>78</b>, which may convert, aggregate, and/or analyze the sensor readings into usable information. It will also be recognized that in an alternative embodiment, sensor <b>44</b> can communicate wirelessly with controller <b>78</b> via a variety of protocols, in which cable <b>80</b> is replaced by suitable receivers, transmitters, and/or wireless signals such as radio frequencies, as well as other short- or long-range wireless communication technology.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is an exploded view of sensor apparatus <b>28</b> with sensor <b>50</b> and receptacle <b>74</b>. Receptacle <b>74</b> includes collar <b>96</b> axially disposed through an inner diameter of cap <b>94</b>. Collar <b>96</b> also has flange end <b>98</b> for mating with lip <b>100</b> disposed around the inner diameter of cap <b>94</b>. Sensor <b>44</b> can be secured to cap <b>94</b> and collar <b>96</b> with adjustable band <b>102</b>, or other suitable apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this example, second coupling <b>84</b> has three quick coupling slots <b>85</b> arranged such that they engage projections <b>85</b> defining first coupling <b>82</b>-I (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). L-shaped slots <b>85</b> are disposed around an inner diameter portion of cap <b>94</b>. Upon engagement, tab <b>90</b> is thus held in place against recess <b>92</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4C</figref>), ensuring that sensor <b>50</b> is positioned correctly as described above and triggering the sensor activation circuit. To facilitate this, tab <b>90</b> can also include metal contacts <b>104</b> electrically connected to sensor <b>50</b> and/or controller <b>78</b> via connection to cable <b>80</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). Contacts <b>104</b> serve to close the sensor activation circuit upon contact with the resistor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, this can signal controller <b>78</b> (via cable <b>80</b>) to record one or more sensor <b>50</b> readings and to optionally register the location of receptacle <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows boss <b>26</b>-<b>29</b>, first coupling <b>82</b>-<b>29</b>, coupling projections <b>83</b>, recess <b>92</b>, and resistor <b>106</b>-<b>29</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a detailed view of one of the plurality of inspection bosses <b>26</b>. First coupling <b>82</b>-<b>29</b>, like other first couplings <b>82</b>-I, includes three quick coupling tabs <b>83</b> disposed around the periphery of boss <b>26</b>-I for engaging quick coupling slots <b>85</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Resistor <b>106</b>-<b>29</b> is an electrically conductive element disposed on an inner surface of recess <b>92</b> proximate first coupling <b>82</b>-<b>29</b>. As described above, in certain embodiments, resistor <b>106</b>-<b>29</b> can be recognized by controller <b>78</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), which is programmed to then record one or more sensor readings.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a further embodiment, the plurality of inspection bosses <b>26</b>-I (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), can each include resistor <b>106</b>-I, with each resistor having a specific and unique resistance value corresponding to the particular location of each boss <b>26</b>-I. Controller <b>78</b> can then be programmed to recognize this individual resistance value and correlate it to the particular reference point <b>32</b>-I (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) at or above which sensor <b>50</b> is positioned. For example resistor <b>106</b>-<b>1</b> may have a 10 milliohm (mohm) resistor, resistor <b>106</b>-<b>2</b> may have a 20 mohm resistor, and so on. In this example, resistor <b>106</b>-<b>29</b> would have a 290 mohm resistor. In addition to notifying controller <b>78</b> that sensor <b>50</b> is in position for a correct reading, it also allows controller <b>78</b> to automatically map and register location information of sensor <b>50</b>. This improves measurement reliability as well as reducing user error in recording and mapping sensor readings.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While described with reference to a single sensor, the example apparatus described above can be used simultaneously with more than one sensor and corresponding sensor receptacles. For example, two different types of sensors such as an LVDT sensor and an ultrasonic sensor may be used to simultaneously measure surface position and thickness respectively. Of course it will be recognized that the two sensors are not positioned on or above the same reference point at the same time. However, the two sensors can be removably secured to different bosses at the same time in order to measure the different characteristics using the same template. Similarly, two of the same type of sensors may be used simultaneously in different positions on the template to either expedite measurement of a single characteristic or to check the precision of one or the other sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Various embodiments of the apparatus described above can be used in numerous inspection scenarios. In one example scenario, an inspection template having a plurality of inspection bosses can be used in conjunction with a single sensor to inspect a component or a precursor thereof. The inspection template is aligned with the airfoil on a component side such that the inspection side of the template faces away from the component surface. The single sensor is coupled to at least one of the plurality of inspection bosses, aligning the sensor at or normal to a reference point on the component through a sensor aperture disposed through the inspection boss. Alignment of the template with the component can optionally be facilitated with one or more nesting features. The sensor can be retained as part of a sensor apparatus comprising the sensor and a receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Upon correct alignment of the sensor with the component reference point, the sensor is then operated to take one or more readings defining a localized inspection result. The localized inspection result can be compared with a reference value corresponding to nominal or ideal values at the component reference point. A localized deviation value can be derived by comparing the localized result and reference value. These values and results relate to various characteristics of the component to be inspected and can include without limitation coordinates, surface thickness, contour angle, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In certain embodiments, the coupling, operating, and comparing steps can be iteratively performed at a plurality of inspection bosses to derive a plurality of localized deviation values for a corresponding plurality of component reference points. In certain of those embodiments, an overall deviation value can be derived from the plurality of localized deviation values. The overall deviation value may correspond to deviation of at least a portion of the component being inspected. The localized and/or overall deviation values can be compared to corresponding localized and/or overall tolerance values to determine whether the component or its precursor has acceptable characteristics. Localized and overall values can be determined by a controller or analyzer communicating with the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, the inspection system can be configured to automatically activate the sensor only when correctly positioned relative to a blade reference point. This can be done for example by providing a sensor activation circuit that activates the sensor only upon removably securing the sensor apparatus to one of the plurality of inspection bosses. Each inspection boss may have a first coupling identical to first couplings on each of the plurality of inspection bosses, with the first coupling configured to operate with the second coupling disposed on the sensor apparatus. The couplings can be any suitable variation on a standard or quick connect coupling as described above. The method can also utilize a self-registration system as part of the sensor activation circuit so as to minimize errors in measurement and in correlating the localized inspection values with a particular reference point on the component.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be recognized that the above method and apparatus were described using the illustrative example of a fan blade of a gas turbine engine. However, the method and apparatus can be readily adapted to inspection of other manufactured components, including other airfoil components, as well as to manufacturing precursors thereof. The method and apparatus can also be readily adapted to in-process and post-process form checks of other manufactured components.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment(s), it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof.
