<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref> together show an exploded view of the preferred embodiment <b>20</b> of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a socket adaptor <b>22</b> having a flange <b>23</b> is fastened to a cap <b>24</b>, an upper catch plate <b>26</b> having a square channel <b>28</b> formed through its center, and a circular circuit board <b>30</b> having a square channel <b>32</b> formed through its center, using bolts <b>32</b> and nuts <b>34</b>. The cap <b>24</b> has a raised center portion <b>36</b> and an outer rim <b>37</b>. Vent holes <b>39</b> provide an air circulation path into the embodiment for cooling and to more easily allow sound to enter the embodiment <b>20</b>. A circular channel <b>40</b> is formed through the raised center portion <b>36</b> for attachment to the socket adaptor <b>22</b>. The upper catch plate <b>26</b> is positioned within the raised center portion <b>36</b>. Power wires <b>35</b> are connected between socket adaptor <b>22</b> and the circuit board <b>30</b>. The upper catch plate <b>26</b> is positioned around and adhered to a connecting member <b>38</b> at its upper end <b>41</b>. The connecting member <b>38</b> is an elongate member having three sides to form an open channel <b>42</b> between the upper end <b>41</b> and a lower end <b>44</b>. The connecting member <b>38</b> provides structural rigidity to the embodiment <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, an LED assembly <b>46</b> is formed of a flexible second circuit board <b>48</b> and a plurality of LEDs <b>50</b> positioned therein. The plurality of LEDs <b>50</b> includes first, second, third, and fourth pluralities of LEDs that are red, blue, green, and white respectively. A ribbon cable <b>52</b> electrically connects each of the LEDs <b>50</b> to the circuit board <b>30</b> to provide power. The ribbon cable <b>52</b> is positioned in the channel <b>42</b> of the connecting member <b>38</b> and is electrically connected to the circuit board <b>30</b>. The LED assembly <b>46</b> comprises a center ring member <b>54</b> that defines a passage <b>55</b> through the bottom of the LED assembly <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The LED assembly <b>46</b> is positioned within an opaque inner bowl <b>56</b> having a plurality of channels <b>58</b> disposed therethrough that are alignable with the LEDs <b>50</b> of the LED assembly <b>46</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To use the assembly, the flanged socket adaptor <b>22</b> is threaded into a standard one-hundred twenty volt lighting socket. When the light socket is powered, power is provided through the socket adaptor <b>22</b> to the circuit board <b>30</b>. Thereafter, behavior of the embodiment <b>20</b> is determined from the operating program in combination with user input.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The preferred embodiment can be changed between five modes of operation: STROBE, DISCO, PARTY BULB, MOOD LAMP, and COLOR ORGAN. The apparatus powers up in STROBE mode in the STEADY ON flash rate. The INC and DEC buttons of the user input device cause the microprocessor to change the flash rate between STEADY ON and ten cycles per second (cps).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the MODE button is pressed and assembly is in STROBE mode, the microprocessor changes to DISCO mode. The microprocessor causes the LEDs to actuate in a pattern that gives the appearance the apparatus is rotating. INC and DEC inputs cause the microprocessor to change the rate of apparent rotation between one cps and one rotation every ten seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the MODE button is pressed and assembly is in DISCO mode, the microprocessor changes to PARTY BULB mode in which only the red LEDs are powered. An INC input in this state causes only the blue LEDs to be powered, while a DEC input in this state causes only the green LEDs to be powered. When only the blue LEDs are powered, an INC input causes the green LEDs to be powered, and a DEC input causes only the red LEDs to be powered. When only the green LEDs are powered, an INC input causes only the red LEDs to be powered and a DEC input causes only the blue LEDs to be powered.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the MODE button is pressed with the assembly in PARTY BULB mode, the microprocessor changes to MOOD LAMP mode with the red LEDs fully powered with a cycle rate of sixty-six thousandths of a cps. The red LEDs fade while the blue LEDs simultaneously are brought to full power, such that when the blue LEDs are fully powered, the red LEDs are fully unpowered. The blue LEDs then begin to fade while the green LEDs are brought to fully power after which the greed LEDs begin to fade while the red LEDs again are brought to full power. The INC and DEC inputs increase or decrease, respectively, the rate of the full three-color cycle between approximately one-third cps (i.e., one of each color every three seconds) and sixty-six thousands of a CPS (i.e., one of each color every fifteen seconds).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the MODE button is pressed with the assembly in MOOD LAMP mode, the microprocessor changes the operating mode to COLOR ORGAN mode, wherein the level and frequency of the ambient sound selectively power of red, blue, or green LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the MODE button is pressed with the assembly in MOOD LAMP mode, the microprocessor changes back to STROBE mode.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the MODE button is held for at least three seconds, the microprocessor causes the apparatus to go into a standby mode in which the LED assembly is not powered. The apparatus may be revived by pressing the MODE button.</p>

Thereafter, the first and second LED supports <b>246</b> are engaged so that the first interlocking members <b>248</b> interlock with the second interlocking members <b>250</b>. The support assembly <b>232</b> is then positioned in the lens <b>236</b>, where the interlocking members <b>248</b>, <b>258</b> and spacing members <b>252</b> cause the support assembly <b>232</b> to be. The top spacing members <b>247</b> are aligned with alignment slots <b>265</b> to prevent rotation of the support assembly <b>232</b> relative to the lens <b>236</b>.
