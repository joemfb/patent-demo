<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electronic devices, such as smart phones, tablet computers, digital media players, and so forth, increasingly employ light sensors to control the manipulation of a variety of functions provided by the device. For example, light sensors may be used by an electronic device to detect ambient lighting conditions in order to control the brightness of the device's display screen. Typical light sensors employ photodetectors such as photodiodes, phototransistors, or the like, which convert received light into an electrical signal (e.g., a current or voltage). However, the response of such photodetectors can be influenced by the presence of infrared (IR) light (i.e., electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength greater than approximately 700 nanometers (nm) that can be detected by the photodetector). For example, a light sensor of an electronic device may indicate that the surrounding ambient environment is &#x201c;brighter&#x201d; than it really is because the surrounding lighted environment contains a larger proportion of infrared light than normal, such as where the surrounding lighted environment is furnished by artificial lighting, and so forth.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A light sensor is described that includes an IR cut interference filter and at least one color interference filter integrated on-chip (i.e., integrated on the die of the light sensor). In one or more implementations, the light sensor comprises a semiconductor device (e.g., a die) that includes a substrate. Photodetectors (e.g., photodiodes, phototransistors, etc.) are formed in the substrate proximate to the surface of the substrate. An IR cut interference filter is disposed over the photodetectors. The IR cut interference filter is configured to filter infrared light from light received by the light sensor to at least substantially block infrared light from reaching the photodetectors. At least one color interference filter is placed above or below the IR cut interference filter. The color interference filter is configured to filter visible light received by the light sensor to pass light in a limited spectrum of wavelengths (e.g., light having wavelengths between a first wavelength and a second wavelength) to at least one of the photodetectors. The photodetectors may also comprise one or more clear photodetectors configured to receive light that is not filtered by a color interference filter, thereby allowing the clear photodetector to detect the ambient light environment.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To filter infrared light, light sensors may employ infrared blocking filters to reduce the transmission of infrared light, while passing visible light to the photodetector array of the light sensor. Such IR blocking filters are comprised of IR cut material applied externally to the light sensor package following fabrication of the package. This configuration effectively blocks infrared light from reaching the photodiodes, but also substantially reduces the amount of infrared light that reaches the infrared photodetectors of the light sensor. Consequently, the sensitivity of the resulting light sensor to infrared light is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, a light sensor is described that includes an IR cut and at least one color interference filter integrated on-chip (i.e., integrated on the die of the light sensor). In this manner, the IR cut interference filter may be patterned so that it does not block infrared light to infrared photodetectors of the light sensor. In one or more implementations, the light sensor is fabricated as a semiconductor device that comprises a die having a substrate. Photodetectors such as photodiodes, phototransistors, or the like, are formed in the substrate proximate to the surface of the substrate. The IR cut interference filter is disposed on the surface of the substrate over the photodetectors. The IR cut interference filter is configured to filter infrared light from light received by the light sensor to at least substantially block infrared light from reaching the photodetectors. However, by forming the IR cut interference filter on the substrate, the IR cut interference filter may be patterned so that it does not block infrared light to infrared photodetectors of the light sensor. One or more color interference filters are disposed proximate to the IR cut interference filter. For example, color interference filters (e.g., red, green, blue filters) may be formed on the IR cut interference filter or on the surface of the substrate under the IR cut interference filter. The color interference filters are configured to filter visible light received by the light sensor to pass light in a limited spectrum of wavelengths (e.g., light having wavelengths between a first wavelength and a second wavelength) to at least one of the photodetectors. The photodetectors may also comprise one or more clear photodetectors configured to receive light that is not filtered by a color interference filter, thereby allowing the clear photodetector to detect the ambient light environment. In implementations, the clear photodetectors may be positioned between color interference filters to reduce the silicon implementation area of the light sensor. In at least one implementation, a dark mirror may be formed about the periphery of the IR cut interference filter. The dark mirror is configured to at least substantially eliminate impingement of light onto the photodetectors that does not pass through the IR cut interference filter.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following discussion, example implementations of light sensors that include an IR cut interference filter and at least one color interference filter integrated on-chip are first described. Example procedures are then discussed that may be employed to fabricate the example light sensor.</p>

The substrate <b>102</b> furnishes a base material utilized to form one or more electronic devices through various fabrication techniques such as photolithography, ion implantation, deposition, etching, and so forth. The substrate <b>102</b> may comprise n-type silicon (e.g., silicon doped with a group V element (e.g., phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, etc.) to furnish n-type charge carrier elements to the silicon) or p-type silicon (e.g., silicon doped with a group IIIA element (e.g., boron, etc.) to furnish p-type charge carrier elements to the silicon).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The substrate <b>102</b> of each light sensor <b>100</b> is illustrated as having a top surface <b>104</b> and a bottom surface <b>106</b>. An array of photodetectors (photodetectors <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> are shown) is formed in the substrate <b>102</b> proximate to the top surface <b>104</b>. The photodetectors <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> within the array may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, the photodetectors <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> may be comprised of a photo sensor diode, a phototransistor, or the like. In an implementation, the photodetectors <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> are capable of detecting a light and providing a signal in response thereto. The photodetectors <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> may provide a signal by converting light into current or voltage based upon the intensity of the detected light. Thus, once a photodetector is exposed to light, multiple free electrons may be generated to create a current. The photodetectors <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> are configured to detect light in both the visible light spectrum and the infrared light spectrum. As used herein, the term light is contemplated to encompass electromagnetic radiation occurring in the visible light spectrum and the infrared light spectrum. The visible light spectrum (visible light) includes electromagnetic radiation occurring in the range of wavelengths from approximately three hundred and ninety (390) nanometers to approximately seven hundred and fifty (750) nanometers. Similarly, the infrared light spectrum (infrared light) includes electromagnetic radiation that ranges in wavelength from approximately seven hundred (700) nanometers to approximately three hundred thousand (300,000) nanometers. In implementations, complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication techniques may be utilized to form the photodetectors <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> is illustrated as formed over the photodetectors <b>108</b> on the top surface <b>104</b> of the substrate <b>102</b>. The IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> is configured to filter infrared light from light received by the light sensor <b>100</b> to at least substantially block infrared light from reaching the photodetectors <b>108</b>. The IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> may further be configured to at least substantially pass visible light (i.e., light in the visible spectrum) received by the light sensor <b>100</b> to the photodetectors <b>108</b>. For instance, in an example implementation, an IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> may be provided that is capable of blocking approximately fifty (50) to one hundred (100) percent of infrared light (e.g., light in the infrared spectrum) incident on the photodetectors <b>108</b> while at least substantially passing (e.g., passing greater than approximately fifty (50) percent) visible light (e.g., light in the visible spectrum) to the photodetectors <b>108</b>. However, the aforementioned values (e.g., percentage values representing the proportion of infrared light blocked and/or passed by the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b>) may depend on particular application requirements of the light sensor <b>100</b>. Moreover, IR cut interference filters <b>110</b> that are capable of blocking a higher or lower proportion of infrared light and/or of transmitting a higher or lower proportion of visible light are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> may be configured in a variety of ways. In an implementation, the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> may comprise a multi-layer structure that includes at least two different materials of different refractive indices. The IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> may be approximately five (5) to fifteen (15) microns thick and/or approximately seventy (70) to one hundred twenty (120) layers thick. In a specific implementation, the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> may be approximately ten (10) microns thick and/or approximately ninety (90) to one hundred (100) layers thick. However, it is contemplated that the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> may have other constructions (e.g., number of layers) and/or thicknesses. Moreover, although a single IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> is illustrated, it is contemplated that the light sensor <b>100</b> may be provided with multiple IR cut interference filters <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In at least some implementations, the light sensor <b>100</b> may be configured to include one or more infrared photodetectors <b>112</b> (i.e., photodetectors <b>108</b> that are configured to detect light in the infrared spectrum formed in the substrate <b>102</b> of the light sensor <b>100</b> die). These photodetectors <b>112</b> detect infrared light (i.e., light in the infrared spectrum) that may, for example, be transmitted by an infrared transmitter (e.g., an infrared light emitting diode (LED)) as part of a proximity sensor implemented in the electronic device. Accordingly, the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> may be patterned so that it does not block the reception of infrared light (i.e., light in the infrared spectrum) by the infrared photodetectors <b>112</b>, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the light sensor to infrared light and improving the performance of devices that employ the light sensor <b>100</b> (e.g., the proximity sensor in an electronic device).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Color interference filters <b>114</b> are illustrated proximate to the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b>. The color interference filters <b>114</b> are configured to filter visible light received by the light sensor <b>100</b> to pass light in a limited spectrum of wavelengths (e.g., light having wavelengths between a first wavelength and a second wavelength) to at least one of the photodetectors <b>108</b>. In one implementation, the color interference filters <b>114</b> allow visible light in a limited spectrum of wavelengths to pass through the filter, while blocking (e.g., reflecting) visible light within a second spectrum of wavelengths. Thus, the color interference filters <b>114</b> may be substantially transparent for visible light within a first spectrum of wavelengths, and substantially opaque within a second spectrum of wavelengths. In implementations, the color interference filters <b>114</b> may comprise multilayer structures having varied thicknesses and/or numbers of layers, which may have differing thicknesses and/or refractive indices.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A plurality of color interference filters <b>114</b> may be employed. For example, the light sensor <b>100</b> may comprise a first color interference filter <b>114</b><i>a </i>configured to filter visible light and pass light having a first limited spectrum of wavelengths (e.g., wavelengths between a first wavelength and a second wavelength), a second color interference filter <b>114</b><i>b </i>configured to filter visible light and pass light having a second limited spectrum of wavelengths (e.g., wavelengths between a third wavelength and a fourth wavelength), and a third color interference filter <b>114</b><i>c </i>configured to filter visible light and pass light having a third spectrum of wavelengths (e.g., wavelengths between a fifth wavelength and a sixth wavelength), and so forth. In the example illustrated, the light sensor <b>100</b> is comprised of an array of three different color interference filters <b>114</b>: a first (blue) color interference filter <b>114</b><i>a </i>configured to transmit a &#x201c;blue&#x201d; visible light (i.e., visible light with a wavelength between approximately four hundred fifty (450) nanometers and approximately four hundred seventy-five (475) nanometers); a second (green) color interference filter <b>114</b><i>b </i>configured to transmit a &#x201c;green&#x201d; visible light (i.e., visible light with a wavelength between approximately four hundred ninety-five (495) nanometers and approximately five hundred and seventy (570) nanometers); and a third (red) color interference filter <b>114</b><i>c </i>configured to transmit a &#x201c;red&#x201d; visible light (i.e., visible light with a wavelength between approximately six hundred and twenty (620) nanometers and approximately seven hundred and fifty (750) nanometers). It is contemplated that other visible light color interference filters <b>114</b> may be employed. For instance, color interference filters <b>114</b> configured to transmit visible light having limited spectrums of wavelengths typically associated with the colors of cyan, magenta, yellow, and so forth, may be provided. The color interference filters <b>114</b> are selectively arrayed over photodetectors <b>108</b> to allow visible light in a desired limited spectrum of wavelengths to be passed to the photodetectors <b>108</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the first color interference filter <b>114</b><i>a </i>is positioned over a first photodetector <b>108</b><i>a</i>, the second color interference filter <b>114</b><i>b </i>is positioned over a second photodetector <b>108</b><i>b</i>, and the third filter <b>112</b><i>c </i>is positioned over a third photodetector <b>108</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the implementations illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the color interference filters <b>114</b> are formed on the outer surface of the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b>. However, it is contemplated that, in other implementations, the color interference filters <b>114</b> may be formed on the surface <b>104</b> of the substrate <b>102</b> directly over one or more corresponding photodetectors <b>108</b>. The IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> is thus formed on the surface <b>104</b> of the substrate <b>102</b> over the color interference filters <b>108</b>, and would at least substantially cover the color interference filters <b>114</b> upon completion of the fabrication process. In an example implementation, the color interference filters <b>114</b> have a thickness of approximately five (5) microns. However, it is contemplated that color interference filters <b>114</b> having lesser or greater thicknesses are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The array of photodetectors <b>108</b> may further include one or more clear photodetectors <b>116</b> configured to receive light that is not filtered by a color interference filter <b>114</b>. As illustrated, the clear photodetectors <b>116</b> may be positioned in the substrate <b>102</b> so that they are positioned under the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> but are not located below a color interference filter <b>114</b>. Thus, the clear photodetectors <b>116</b> detect light within a spectrum of wavelengths corresponding to several visible colors (i.e., light from the visible spectrum). In this manner, the clear photodetectors <b>116</b> may be used to detect visible ambient lighting conditions absent infrared interference.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The clear photodetectors <b>116</b> may be configured in a variety of ways. For example, like the other photodetectors <b>112</b> within the array, the clear photodetectors <b>114</b> may comprise a photodiode, a phototransistor, or the like, that is capable of detecting a light by converting light into current or voltage. In an implementation, the signal (e.g., current or voltage) produced by the clear photodetectors <b>116</b> is based upon (e.g., proportional to) the detected intensity of visible light received. Thus, the clear photodetectors <b>116</b> may be used to detect the intensity of the ambient light level outside of a portable electronic device (not shown) in which the light sensor <b>100</b> is integrated. The resulting measure of ambient light intensity may be utilized by various applications running in the portable electronic device. For example, an application of the portable electronic device may control the brightness of a display screen based upon the ambient light intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As discussed above, the clear photodetectors <b>116</b> may be arrayed with the photodetectors <b>108</b> which receive light that passes through a color interference filter <b>114</b>. In the implementation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2C</figref>, the clear photodetectors <b>116</b> are shown positioned in one or more cells (clear sensor cells <b>202</b>) that are arrayed with cells (color sensor cells <b>204</b>) containing photodetectors <b>108</b> which receive light that passes through a color interference filter <b>114</b>. Thus, in the implementation illustrated, the light sensor <b>100</b> may include an array <b>206</b> of cells <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> having one or more clear sensor cells <b>202</b> that do not include a color interference filter <b>114</b>, one or more first color sensor cells <b>204</b><i>a </i>that comprise a first color interference filter <b>114</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a blue color interference filter), one or more second color sensor cells <b>204</b><i>b </i>that comprise a second color interference filter <b>114</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a green color interference filter), one or more third cells that comprise a third color interference filter <b>114</b><i>c </i>(e.g., a red color interference filter), and so forth. As noted above, it is contemplated that a wide variety of visible light color interference filters <b>114</b> may be employed by the light sensor <b>100</b>. Thus, color sensor cells <b>204</b> may comprise color interference filters <b>114</b> configured to transmit light having colors of cyan, magenta, yellow, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Spacing exists between the color interference filters <b>114</b> due to the requirements of fabrication processes (e.g., lithography) used in their formation. For instance, in an example array <b>206</b>, between approximately twenty (20) to approximately forty (40) microns of &#x201c;empty&#x201d; space (channels) may be left between each color interference filter <b>114</b> (e.g., between each color cell <b>204</b>) and other color interference filters <b>114</b> (e.g., other color cells <b>204</b>), or other circuit elements of the light sensor <b>100</b>. In the implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B through 1F</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>D, the clear photodetectors <b>114</b> are positioned to utilize this empty space. For example, in the example implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B through 1F</figref>, a clear photodetector <b>116</b> may be positioned between the first photodetector <b>108</b><i>a </i>and the second photodetector <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, a second clear photodetector <b>116</b> may be positioned between the second photodetector <b>108</b><i>b </i>and the third photodetector <b>108</b><i>c</i>. The clear photodetectors <b>116</b> are covered by the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The clear photodetectors <b>116</b> may thus be positioned in the &#x201c;empty&#x201d; channels <b>206</b> between color cells <b>204</b> (i.e., cells comprising color interference filters <b>114</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2D</figref>. The clear photodetectors <b>116</b> may also be positioned proximate to the outside edges of array <b>208</b>. Thus, an array <b>208</b> is formed wherein the clear sensor cell <b>202</b> (e.g., clear photodetectors <b>116</b>) is interlaced between multiple color sensor cells <b>204</b> (i.e., between the color interference filters <b>114</b>). This array <b>208</b> provides greater utilization of the surface area of the substrate <b>202</b>. For instance, in one example, area utilization by an implementation employing the array <b>208</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2D</figref> was ten percent (10%) greater than that of an implementation configured with the array <b>206</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C through 1F</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C through 2D</figref>, light sensors <b>100</b> are illustrated that further include a dark mirror <b>118</b> configured to substantially eliminate impingement of light on the photodetectors <b>108</b> that does not pass through the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b>. The dark mirror <b>118</b> may be constructed from opaque dielectric materials in such a way that does not transmit and reflects light (visible light and infrared light). As shown, the dark mirror <b>118</b> is positioned about the periphery of the IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> (e.g., proximate to edges <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> of the array <b>208</b>). However, in other implementations, the dark mirror <b>118</b> can also cover the edge of the color interference filters <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In various implementations, the light sensors <b>100</b> described herein may be configured to detect a surrounding light environment and/or to provide infrared light detection (e.g., for use as a proximity sensor). The color interference filters <b>114</b> are configured to filter visible light and pass light in a limited spectrum of wavelengths to the respective photodetectors <b>108</b>. The photodetectors <b>108</b> generate a signal (e.g., current value) based upon the intensity of the light. The IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> is configured to filter infrared light to substantially block infrared light from reaching the photodetectors <b>108</b>. The clear photodetectors <b>114</b> detect ambient lighting conditions absent color filtration and generate a signal (e.g., a current value) based upon the intensity of visible light detected. The signal generated by the photodetectors <b>108</b> that receive filtered light and the clear photodetectors <b>114</b> may be utilized by other circuit devices and/or applications to control various aspects of a portable electronic device (e.g., control the brightness of the device's display screen, to turn off backlighting to conserving battery life, and so forth). Infrared photodetectors <b>114</b> may detect infrared light (i.e., light in the infrared spectrum) that may, for example, be transmitted by an infrared transmitter (e.g., an infrared light emitting diode (LED)) as part of a proximity sensor implemented in the electronic device. The IR cut interference filter <b>110</b> may be patterned so that it does not block the reception of infrared light by the infrared photodetectors <b>114</b>, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the light sensor to infrared light and improving the performance of devices that employ the light sensor <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Example Fabrication Process</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The following discussion describes example techniques for fabricating a light sensor that includes an IR cut interference filter and at least one color interference filter integrated on-chip (i.e., integrated on the die of the light sensor). In the implementation described below, the light sensor is fabricated utilizing back-end complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing techniques. However, it is contemplated that light sensors in accordance with the present disclosure may be fabricated using other semiconductor chip fabrication/packaging technologies, such as wafer-level packaging (WLP), and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a process <b>300</b>, in an example implementation, for fabricating a light sensor, such as the example light sensors <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 2D</figref> and described above. In the process <b>300</b> illustrated, a plurality of photodetectors are formed in a substrate of a wafer proximate to the surface of the substrate (Block <b>302</b>). The substrate of the wafer may comprise n-type silicon (e.g., silicon doped with a group V element (e.g., phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, etc.) to furnish n-type charge carrier elements to the silicon) or p-type silicon (e.g., silicon doped with a group IIIA element (e.g., boron, etc.) to furnish p-type charge carrier elements to the silicon). Thus, the substrate furnishes a base material utilized to form the photodetectors as well as other electronic devices of the light sensor. The photodetectors may comprise photodiodes, phototransistors, or the like, formed in the substrate of the wafer using suitable fabrication techniques such as photolithography, ion implantation, deposition, etching, and so forth. In one or more implementations, at least one photodetector of the plurality of photodetectors may comprise an infrared photodetector that is configured to detect an infrared light (light in the infrared spectrum).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An IR cut interference filter is next formed over the surface of the substrate <b>102</b> (Block <b>304</b>). In one or more implementations, the IR cut interference filter may be deposited on the surface of the substrate over the photodetectors (Block <b>306</b>) using a suitable deposition technique. The IR cut interference filter may further be patterned so that it does not block the reception of infrared light (i.e., light in the infrared spectrum) by infrared photodetectors formed in the substrate, as described in the discussion of Block <b>302</b>. For instance, in an example implementation, the IR cut interference filter may comprise a multi-layer structure that includes two different materials that each has a different refractive index to create an interference effect to block infrared light. In such implementations, the various layers of the IR cut interference filter may be formed on a wafer using sputtering deposition techniques and patterned using resist lift-off techniques. However, it is contemplated that other techniques may also be employed. These techniques may include, but are not limited to: magnetron sputtering, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrochemical deposition (ECD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), and atomic layer deposition (ALD). When formed, the IR cut interference filter may be approximately five (5) to fifteen (15) micros thick and/or approximately seventy (70) to one hundred and twenty (120) layers thick. However, it is contemplated that the IR cut interference filter may have other constructions and/or thicknesses.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">One or more color interference filters <b>112</b> are formed proximate to the IR cut interference filter (Block <b>308</b>). In an implementation, the color interference filters are deposited on the outer surface of the IR cut interference filter using suitable deposition techniques (Block <b>310</b>). However, it is contemplated that, in other implementations, the color interference filters may be formed on the surface of the substrate directly over one or more corresponding photodetectors prior to formation of the IR cut interference filter. The IR cut interference filter may then be formed on the surface of the substrate over the color interference filters, so that the IR cut interference filter at least substantially covers the color interference filters. The color interference filters may be aligned with a respective photodetector to filter light received by that photodetector. When formed, the color interference filters may have a thickness of approximately five (5) microns. However, it is contemplated that color interference filters having lesser or greater thicknesses are possible. The color interference filters may be fabricated using methodology and/or techniques that are the same as, or similar to, those used to form the IR cut interference filter.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one or more implementations, a dark mirror may be provided about the periphery of the IR cut interference filter and/or the periphery of the color interference filters (Block <b>118</b>) to substantially eliminate impingement of light on the photodetectors that does not pass through the IR cut interference filter (and/or the color interference filters). The dark mirror is formed of opaque materials (e.g., metal/oxide multilayer, or the like) that do not transmit light (visible light and infrared light). The dark mirror may be formed using a variety of techniques, such as via the deposition/patterning techniques, and so forth. For example, sputtering and photo-resist lift-off techniques may be utilized to form the dark mirror.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As noted, the light sensor may be fabricated utilizing back-end complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing techniques. Thus, the photodetectors, the color interference filters, and the IR cut interference filter may be formed at wafer level. The wafer is thereafter diced into one or more dies, and each die packaged individually to form a light sensor. The wafer may also be further processed following formation of the photodetectors, color interference filters, and IR cut interference filter using wafer-level packaging (WLP) techniques and diced to form one or more light sensors.</p>
