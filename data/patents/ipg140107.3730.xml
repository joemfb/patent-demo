<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to an application filed with the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jul. 13, 2009 and assigned Serial No. 10-2009-0063499, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for controlling a dual display, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for controlling a dual display in a mobile terminal with a projector module.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to overcome the limitation of screen size of mobile terminals, a function capable of displaying information of the mobile terminals on large external display devices has been recently developed, such as the TV-OUT function, and the use of a connector connecting mobile terminals to the external projector devices has increased accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to the above functions, a technology also has been developed that mounts a small projector module in mobile terminals instead of using the external projector devices. A mobile terminal with the projector module allows a user to view Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) images on large screens by projecting the DMB images onto any alternative screens such as A4 papers, walls and white shirts, mitigating the inconvenience of viewing the images on a small Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the mobile terminal includes a projector module, a user may input commands such as numbers and characters, by directly pressing buttons on a keypad of the mobile terminal in order to control the projector module. Recently, however, touch pad technology has been increasingly applied to most mobile terminals, and full-touch phones are becoming the trend of the next-generation mobile terminals. In this case, the user touches soft buttons displayed on the screen rather than pressing hard buttons on the existing keypad, and then the mobile terminal recognizes numbers, characters and commands corresponding to the touch inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A full-touch LCD screen of the mobile terminal with a projector module should always be turned on in order to receive key inputs. In the conventional mobile terminal with a projector function shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example, when a user desires to watch a DMB broadcast, an image <b>110</b> for the DMB broadcast may be projected onto a projector screen <b>100</b>, and volume information, channel change information and other control command buttons may be displayed on an LCD screen <b>120</b> of the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this case, there is a need to focus on controlling the data to be output through the LCD screen <b>120</b> and the data to be output through the projector screen <b>100</b>. With the development of multimedia, when large high-resolution images are processed, efficient data processing should also be considered. In images with a resolution of Wide Video Graphics Array (WVGA) (800&#xd7;480 or 854&#xd7;480 class), the existing Central Processing Unit (CPU) interface needs a Write Enable (WE) signal of about up to 43 nsec to transmit video data consisting of 30 frames per second to an LCD panel and a projector module. That is, if the resolution increases, the time required to display one frame should be reduced. In particular, an expensive Application Processor (AP) chip for fast signal processing is needed to avoid high power consumption.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, specific details such as detailed configuration and components are merely provided to assist the overall understanding of embodiments of the present invention. Therefore, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. In addition, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted for the sake of clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention provides a method for controlling a dual display in a mobile terminal with a projector module. In particular, the present invention may control each of a mobile terminal's screen and a projector screen in real time by using an RGB interface to support high-resolution images. To be specific, the present invention independently controls data transmitted to each of an LCD panel and a projector driver (or a projector module) of the mobile terminal, and uses Chip Select (CS) signals for this control. By doing so, same or different high-resolution images may be displayed on a mobile terminal's screen and a projector screen.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Prior to a description of the present invention, a brief description of the RGB interface used in the present invention will now be given.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Generally, a CPU interface and/or an RGB interface are used to display images on an LCD panel of a mobile terminal, and control signals and data are transmitted through such interfaces. The CPU interface is mainly used to display still images. The RGB interface may implement high-resolution videos because it scatters data in sync with an external clock. Thus, the RGB interface is suitable to display high-resolution images compared with the CPU interface. With the continuing development of multimedia, however, a method for displaying high-resolution images should be provided in mobile terminals to support the multimedia.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">If a modem chip or AP chip supporting the actual resolution of QVGA (240&#xd7;320) or WQVGA (240&#xd7;400) is provided in a mobile terminal, the CPU interface is also available. However, if the CPU interface is used when the performance has been improved to the resolution of WVGA (800&#xd7;480 or 854&#xd7;480 class), there is needed a modem chip and an AP chip, which have a high-performance CPU, and the existing display panels cannot be used. Considering this, the present invention uses the RGB interface that can easily display high-resolution images compared with the CPU interface.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A description will now be made of a structure of a control apparatus for displaying high-resolution images through an LCD panel and a projector driver in a mobile terminal that supports a projector function using an RGB interface.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A first embodiment of the present invention controls images being transmitted to an LCD panel and a projector driver through their associated paths using CS signals. A second embodiment of the present invention controls data being transmitted to an LCD panel only when the LCD panel needs an image update while the projector function is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an internal structure of a mobile terminal with a projector function according to the first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A dual-display control apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention essentially includes a controller <b>200</b>, an image processor <b>210</b>, a display <b>220</b>, and a projector module <b>230</b>. While only the blocks needed for a description of the first embodiment of the present invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for convenience, the present invention will not be limited to these blocks. Herein, the controller <b>200</b> may be realized using an application processor, and the image processor <b>210</b> may be implemented using an image control Integrated Circuit (IC).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The controller <b>200</b> serves to control the overall operation of the mobile terminal and a signal flow between the components. The controller <b>200</b> outputs control signals to the image processor <b>210</b> so that images may be displayed according to each of standards of the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Four paths are formed for outputting the control signals and for data transmission. A path #<b>1</b> may be realized with 2 pins, and serves as a path for transmitting screen change information. Initial setting values such as an individual porch value and a resolution are transmitted through path #<b>1</b>. The term &#x201c;porch value&#x201d; as used herein refers to top, bottom, left and right margins of images displayed through the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b>. A path #<b>3</b> may be realized with 24 pins, and serves as a path through which image data is transmitted. A path #<b>2</b> and a path #<b>4</b> are connected, respectively, to a first buffer <b>240</b> for storing data to be transmitted to the display <b>220</b> and a second buffer <b>250</b> for storing data to be transmitted to the projector module <b>230</b>. As control signals are transmitted from the controller <b>200</b> through the paths #<b>2</b> and #<b>4</b> and chip select signals CS<b>1</b> and CS<b>2</b> are both enabled through the paths #<b>2</b> and #<b>4</b>, data from the first and second buffers <b>240</b> and <b>250</b> may be simultaneously transmitted to the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b> through paths #<b>5</b> and #<b>6</b>, respectively. By doing so, it is possible to output synchronized same images.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the projector module <b>230</b> is in an OFF state, the first buffer <b>240</b> may not be used because it is not necessary to acquire synchronization with the projector module <b>230</b>. Thus, in this bypass mode, images are directly transmitted to the display <b>220</b> through a path #<b>3</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">However, when it is desired to display different images, the controller <b>200</b> alternately enables the chip select signals CS<b>1</b> and CS<b>2</b> through the paths #<b>2</b> and #<b>4</b> in a toggle manner. First, the controller <b>200</b> activates the first buffer <b>240</b> assigned to the display <b>220</b> by enabling the chip select signal CS<b>1</b> through path #<b>2</b>, and then instructs the display <b>220</b> to load data for a menu image from the first buffer <b>240</b>. Subsequently, the controller <b>200</b> disables the chip select signal CS<b>1</b> through the path #<b>2</b> and then enables the chip select signal CS<b>2</b> through the path #<b>4</b> so that data from the second buffer <b>250</b> may be transmitted to the projector module <b>230</b>. Thereafter, upon occurrence of an even in which a menu configuration of the display <b>220</b> should be changed, the controller <b>200</b> changes data displayed on the display <b>220</b> by disabling the chip select signal CS<b>2</b> through the path #<b>4</b> and enabling the chip select signal CS<b>1</b> through the path #<b>2</b> during one frame. By doing so, a menu image for operation of the projector module <b>230</b> is displayed on the display <b>220</b>, and videos may be projected onto the projector screen.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The image processor <b>210</b> serves to control data being transmitted to the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b> under the control of the controller <b>200</b>, and for this control, includes two frame buffers <b>240</b> and <b>250</b>. By providing the first and second buffers <b>240</b> and <b>250</b>, it is possible to transmit different or same data to the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b>, enabling independent control. This image processor <b>210</b> may feed back data from the controller <b>200</b> by the chip select signals through paths #<b>2</b> and #<b>4</b>. In case the image signals supported in the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b> are incompatible with each other, the image processor <b>210</b> is adapted to enable independent settings, including self-generating RGB image signals supported in each of the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b>, such as a back porch, a front porch and a sync signal.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The display <b>220</b> may be realized with an LCD panel, and if the LCD panel is realized in the form of a touch screen, the display <b>220</b> may also serve as an input means. The display <b>220</b> serves to display user input information or information provided to the user, including various menus of the mobile terminal. Particularly, the display <b>220</b> displays menus for operation of the projector module <b>230</b>, and may also display the same image as the image displayed through the projector module <b>230</b>. When displaying the same images, the display <b>220</b> may display the images without any loss in performance of the controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The projector module <b>230</b> is provided in the mobile terminal and serves to expand images and project them onto external screens.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a description will be made of the second embodiment of the present invention, in which data being transmitted to an LCD panel is controlled only when an image on the LCD panel needs to be updated while a projector function is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, unlike in the first embodiment of the present invention, the image processor <b>210</b> includes only one buffer <b>300</b> and uses no chip select signal, so only two paths exist between the controller <b>200</b> and the image processor <b>210</b>. A set value for controlling a menu image displayed on the display <b>220</b> and an update command, are transmitted through path #<b>1</b>. Image data is transmitted through path #<b>3</b>, and may be transmitted to the display <b>220</b> through the buffer <b>300</b>, or may be directly transmitted to the display <b>220</b> without passing through the buffer <b>300</b> in a bypass mode. At the same time, the image data may be transmitted even to the projector module <b>230</b> through path #<b>7</b>-<b>1</b>. This method excludes chip select signals, and reduces the number of output pints in the image processor <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this method, if the projector module <b>230</b> is in an OFF state, image data is directly transmitted to the display <b>220</b> through a path #<b>7</b>-<b>2</b> without passing through the buffer <b>300</b> in a bypass mode. That is, the display <b>220</b> is directly connected to the controller <b>200</b>, and displays data from the controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, if the projector module <b>230</b> is in an ON state, the controller <b>200</b> transmits an update command to the image processor <b>210</b> to control it only when information displayed on the display <b>220</b> is updated. An I2C command may be used as the update command. Specifically, the update command is transmitted to the image processor <b>210</b> through the path #<b>1</b>. Thus, the final image being projected or the image being updated is stored in the buffer <b>300</b> of the image processor <b>210</b>, and the buffer <b>300</b> generates an image signal to the display <b>220</b>, which has predetermined porch values. When the image needs to be updated, the image processor <b>210</b> may fetch data from the controller <b>200</b> by controlling path #<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the second embodiment of the present invention, since data of the controller <b>200</b> can be directly transmitted to the projector module <b>230</b>, the image processor <b>210</b> can minimize the number of its output pins, contributing to a reduction in chip size and ensuring price competitiveness. Path #<b>7</b>-<b>1</b> may be connected to the buffer <b>300</b> instead of being connected in front of the image processor <b>210</b>, in which case the image processor <b>210</b> may directly generate output signals to the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b> on behalf of the controller <b>200</b>, which removes the need to consider pan-out and load capacity of the controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While it has been described in the first and second embodiments of the present invention that the image processor <b>210</b> is interposed between the controller <b>200</b> and the display <b>200</b> and the projector module <b>230</b>, the image processor <b>210</b> may also be integrated in controller <b>200</b>. That is, the image processor <b>210</b> may be built in the controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An operation according to the first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if the projector module <b>230</b> is in an ON state in step <b>400</b>, the controller <b>200</b> provides screen change information to the image processor <b>210</b> through path #<b>1</b> in step <b>405</b>. Thereafter, the controller <b>200</b> determines in step <b>410</b> whether there is a selection to display the same images on the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b>. If so, the controller <b>200</b> enables both of the chip select signals CS<b>1</b> and CS<b>2</b> in step <b>415</b>, and data from the first and second buffers <b>240</b> and <b>250</b> is transmitted to the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b>, respectively, based on the enable signals in step <b>420</b>. In this case, the same RGB images are output to the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In contrast, if there is no selection to display the same images, i.e., if there is a selection to display different images, the controller <b>200</b> selectively enables the chip select signals CS<b>1</b> and CS<b>2</b> in step <b>425</b>. In step <b>430</b>, the controller <b>200</b> outputs a menu image to the display <b>220</b> while the chip select signal CS<b>1</b> is enabled. In step <b>435</b>, the controller <b>200</b> enables the chip select signal CS<b>2</b> after disabling the chip select signal CS<b>1</b>, and outputs an RGB image to the projector module <b>230</b>. By doing so, the controller <b>200</b> outputs different images through the display <b>220</b> and the projector module <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If a menu selection event is input from a user through the display <b>220</b> in step <b>440</b>, the controller <b>200</b> enables the chip select signal CS<b>1</b> after disabling the chip select signal CS<b>2</b> to output a changed menu image transmitted from the controller <b>200</b> to the display <b>220</b> in step <b>445</b>. Thus, a changed menu image is displayed on the display <b>220</b>. Thereafter, unless the projector module <b>230</b> is in an OFF state in step <b>450</b>, the controller <b>200</b> returns step <b>410</b> and repeats the proceeding steps, and if the projector module <b>230</b> is in the OFF state, the image processor <b>210</b> operates in a bypass mode in which the display <b>220</b> is directly connected to the controller <b>200</b>. Thus, the display <b>220</b> directly receives data from the controller <b>200</b> and displays the received data.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As is apparent from the foregoing description, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the mobile terminal may output high-resolution images through the LCD panel and the projector module even though it uses the RGB interface. In addition, the projector function may incur a low cost by using the existing LCD panel and AP chip and the projector module.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to another embodiment of the present invention, the mobile terminal not only may display different images on the projector screen and the mobile terminal's screen, but also may output the same images during web browsing, despite using the RGB interface. According to the present invention, it is also possible to remove input pointing errors that may occur during web browsing. Moreover, even though an image control IC is added, compatibility with the existing LCD panel and AP chip is maintained, so they can be used without specification changes. Accordingly, it is not necessary to use high-performance AP chips, contributing to a reduction in the total cost of the system, and the existing intact platform can be used, shortening the development period.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
