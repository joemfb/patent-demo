<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) the benefit of Taiwanese Application No. 099107207 filed Mar. 12, 2010, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to quad flat non-leaded (QFN) semiconductor packages, and more particularly, to a QFN semiconductor package capable of preventing solder extrusion and a method for fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a QFN semiconductor package having a die pad and a plurality of leads, the bottom surfaces of the die pad and the leads are exposed from the semiconductor package such that the semiconductor package can be coupled to a printed circuit board through surface mount techniques, thereby forming a circuit module with a specific function. During such a surface mount process, the die pad and leads of the QFN semiconductor package are directly soldered to the printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,952, U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,864 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,685, a conventional QFN semiconductor package <b>8</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The QFN semiconductor package <b>8</b> comprises: a lead frame <b>81</b> having a die pad <b>811</b> and a plurality of leads <b>813</b>; a chip <b>83</b> mounted on the die pad <b>811</b>; a plurality of bonding wires <b>84</b> electrically connecting to the chip <b>83</b> and the leads <b>813</b>; and an encapsulant <b>85</b> encapsulating the chip <b>83</b>, the bonding wires <b>84</b> and the lead frame <b>81</b>, wherein the die pad <b>811</b> and the leads <b>813</b> protrude from the encapsulant <b>85</b> since the die pad <b>811</b> and the leads <b>813</b> are directly formed from a metal carrier by etching. Although such a method increases the number of I/O connections, it cannot form complex conductive traces.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>C&#x2032; show a conventional QFN semiconductor package <b>9</b> and a fabrication method thereof disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,800 and No. 6,635,957. Referring to FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>C&#x2032;, a plurality of leads <b>913</b> is formed on a metal carrier <b>90</b> by electroplating, wherein the leads <b>913</b> may be made of Au//Pd/Ni/Pd or Pd/Ni/Au; then, a plurality of chips <b>93</b> is mounted on the leads and electrically connected to the leads through bonding wires <b>94</b>, and an encapsulant <b>95</b> is formed; thereafter, the carrier <b>90</b> is removed and a dielectric layer <b>96</b> is formed on the bottom surface of the encapsulant <b>95</b> and has a plurality of openings <b>961</b> formed therein such that a plurality of solder balls <b>97</b> can be mounted on the leads <b>913</b> exposed from the openings <b>961</b>. However, since the solder balls <b>97</b> have good wetting ability on a gold layer or a palladium layer but the bonding between the dielectric layer <b>96</b> and the gold layer or palladium layer is quite poor, solder material can easily permeate into the interface between the gold layer or palladium layer and the dielectric layer <b>96</b>, thereby resulting in occurrence of solder extrusion <b>962</b> that prevents formation of solder balls and even causes short circuits between adjacent solder balls. As such, subsequent SMT processes are adversely affected, fabrication time and cost are increased and the product yield is decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is imperative to overcome the above drawbacks of the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the above drawbacks of the prior art, the present invention provides a method for fabricating a QFN semiconductor package, which comprises: providing a copper carrier and forming on the copper carrier a die pad and a plurality of I/O connections disposed at the periphery of the die pad; applying energy to the copper carrier, the die pad and the I/O connections so as to allow copper atoms to migrate and diffuse to the bottom surface of the die pad and the bottom surface of the I/O connections so as to form a surface layer; mounting a chip on the top surface of the die pad; electrically connecting the chip and the I/O connections through a plurality of bonding wires; forming an encapsulant on the copper carrier to encapsulate the die pad, the I/O connections, the chip and the bonding wires; removing the copper carrier to expose the surface layer; and forming a dielectric layer on a bottom surface of the encapsulant, the bottom surface of the die pad and the bottom surface of the I/O connections, the dielectric layer having a plurality of openings for exposing the surface layer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the above-described method, the present invention further provides a QFN semiconductor package, which comprises: a die pad; a plurality of I/O connections disposed at the periphery of the die pad; a chip mounted on the top surface of the die pad; a plurality of bonding wires electrically connecting to the chip and the I/O connections; an encapsulant encapsulating the die pad, the I/O connections, the chip and the bonding wires while exposing the bottom surface of the die pad and the bottom surface of the I/O connections; a surface layer formed on the bottom surface of the die pad and the bottom surface of the I/O connections; and a dielectric layer formed on a bottom surface of the encapsulant and a bottom surface of the surface layer and having a plurality of openings for exposing the surface layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, by forming on the carrier the die pad and the plurality of I/O connections with conductive traces extending therefrom, the present invention meets the demands for conductive traces and increased number of I/O connections. Further, since the surface layer that is formed on the bottom surface of the die pad and the bottom surface of the I/O connections through migration and diffusion of metal atoms has good bonding with the dielectric layer, solder material in a reflow process can be prevented from permeating into the interface between the die pad, the I/O connections and the dielectric layer, thereby enhancing the product yield. In addition, the present invention forms the surface layer by applying energy to the copper carrier instead of utilizing an electroplating process or a sputtering process, thereby simplifying the fabrication process, reducing the fabrication time and cost.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The following illustrative embodiments are provided to illustrate the disclosure of the present invention, these and other advantages and effects can be apparent to those in the art after reading this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> are schematic views showing a method for fabricating a QFN semiconductor package according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a copper carrier <b>10</b> is prepared, on which a die pad <b>111</b> and a plurality of I/O connections <b>113</b> at the periphery of the die pad <b>111</b> are formed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, preferably, at least a portion of the I/O connections <b>113</b> comprise conductive traces <b>1131</b> extending therefrom. The die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> can be formed by electroplating, and made of one of Au/Pd/Ni/Pd, Au/Ni/Cu/Ni/Ag, Au/Ni/Cu/Ag, Pd/Ni/Pd, Au/Ni/Au and Pd/Ni/Au. Preferably, a gold layer or palladium layer is located at the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b> (where the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> are in contact with the copper carrier <b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, thermal energy can be applied to the copper carrier <b>10</b>, the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> so as to allow copper atoms to migrate and diffuse to the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b> so as to form a surface layer <b>12</b> in the gold layer or palladium layer at the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b>. It should be noted that a portion of the atoms of the gold layer or palladium layer at the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b> may also migrate towards the copper carrier <b>10</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> in the case the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> are made of Au/Pd/Ni/Pd, due to migration and diffusion of copper atoms, a surface layer <b>12</b> is formed at the bottom surface of a portion of the gold layer. Meanwhile, gold atoms or palladium atoms of the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b> may also migrate and diffuse towards the copper carrier <b>10</b>. As a result, the surface layer <b>12</b> may also be formed on a portion of the carrier <b>10</b> that is in contact with the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b>. In other embodiments, electric energy, light energy, magnetic energy, or ion beams may be applied for forming the surface layer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, the surface layer <b>12</b> fully or partially covers the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a bottom view of the die pad and the I/O connections with a gold layer formed at the bottoms surface thereof. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the surface layer <b>12</b> partially covers the gold layer of the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> is a top view of the carrier formed with a shielding pattern. Before the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> are formed, a shielding pattern <b>101</b> can be formed on the copper carrier <b>10</b> corresponding in position to the die pad <b>111</b>, the I/O connections <b>113</b> and openings of a dielectric layer to be formed later so as to shield a portion of the surface of the copper carrier <b>10</b> and thereby prevent copper atoms from migrating into the shielded region.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a chip <b>13</b> is mounted on the top surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and electrically connected to the I/O connections <b>113</b> through a plurality of bonding wires <b>14</b>. Thereafter, an encapsulant <b>15</b> is formed on the copper carrier <b>10</b> to encapsulate the die pad <b>111</b>, the I/O connections <b>113</b>, the chip <b>13</b>, and the bonding wires <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the copper carrier <b>10</b> is removed by such as etching so as to expose the surface layer <b>12</b>. Given the difference in the etching rate between the surface layer <b>12</b> and the copper carrier <b>10</b>, the bottom surface of the encapsulant <b>15</b> is exposed from the surface layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a dielectric layer <b>16</b> is formed on the bottom surface of the encapsulant <b>15</b> and the bottom surface of the surface layer <b>12</b>, and has a plurality of openings <b>161</b> formed for exposing the surface layer <b>12</b>. Therein, the surface layer <b>12</b> prevents the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> from coming into contact with the dielectric layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a plurality of solder balls <b>17</b> is further formed in the openings <b>161</b> and a cutting process is performed to the encapsulant so as to obtain a QFN semiconductor package.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention further provides a QFN semiconductor package <b>6</b>, which comprises: a die pad <b>111</b>, a plurality of I/O connections <b>113</b>, a chip <b>13</b>, a plurality of bonding wires <b>14</b>, an encapsulant <b>15</b>, a surface layer <b>12</b>, and a dielectric layer <b>16</b> with a plurality of openings <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, the QFN semiconductor package further comprises a plurality of solder balls <b>17</b> formed in the openings <b>161</b> of the dielectric layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The I/O connections <b>113</b> are disposed at the periphery of the die pad <b>111</b>. Preferably, at least a portion of the I/O connections <b>113</b> comprise conductive traces <b>1131</b> extending therefrom. The die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> can be made of one or more selected from the group consisting of Au, Pd, Ag, Cu and Ni. For instance, the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> can be made of one of Au/Pd/Ni/Pd, Au/Ni/Cu/Ni/Ag, Au/Ni/Cu/Ag, Pd/Ni/Pd, Au/Ni/Au and Pd/Ni/Au. Preferably, a gold layer or a palladium layer is formed at the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The chip <b>13</b> is mounted on the top surface of the die pad <b>111</b>. A plurality of bonding wires <b>14</b> electrically connect the chip <b>13</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b>. The encapsulant <b>15</b> encapsulates the die pad <b>111</b>, the I/O connections <b>113</b>, the chip <b>13</b>, and the bonding wires <b>14</b> but exposes the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The surface layer <b>12</b> is formed on the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b> through migration and diffusion of metal atoms. Further, the surface layer <b>12</b> may also be formed on a portion of the copper carrier <b>10</b> in contact with the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b>. The surface layer <b>12</b> is exposed from the bottom surface of the encapsulant <b>15</b>. The dielectric layer <b>16</b> is formed on the bottom surface of the encapsulant <b>15</b> and the bottom surface of the surface layer <b>12</b> and has a plurality of openings <b>161</b> for exposing the surface layer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, the surface layer <b>12</b> can fully or partially cover the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the surface layer <b>12</b> partially covers the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the surface layer <b>12</b> is formed in a region where the dielectric layer <b>16</b> is to be formed to cover the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> while the region where the surface layer <b>12</b> is not formed corresponds to the openings of the dielectric layer <b>16</b>. In other words, the surface layer <b>12</b> prevents the die pad <b>111</b> and the I/O connections <b>113</b> from coming into contact with the dielectric layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows another QFN semiconductor package according to another embodiment of the present invention. The present embodiment is similar to the above-described embodiment. The main difference between the present embodiment and the above-described embodiment is that, in the present embodiment, the surface layer <b>12</b> partially covers the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b> and the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b> such that the bottom surface of the die pad <b>111</b>, the bottom surface of the I/O connections <b>113</b>, the surface layer <b>12</b>, and the dielectric layer <b>16</b> together form a stepped structure. In the present embodiment, the stepped structure forms strong bonding strength with the solder balls and meanwhile prevents solder material from permeating into the interface between the die pad, the I/O connections and the dielectric layer and avoid solder extrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therefore, since the surface layer that is formed on the bottom surface of the die pad and the bottom surface of the I/O connections through migration and diffusion of metal atoms has good bonding with the dielectric layer, solder material in a reflow process can be prevented from permeating into the interface between the die pad, the I/O connections and the dielectric layer, thereby enhancing the product yield. In addition, the present invention forms the surface layer by applying energy to the copper carrier instead of utilizing an electroplating process or a sputtering process, thus simplifying the fabrication process, reducing the fabrication time and costs.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The above-described descriptions of the detailed embodiments are intended to illustrate the preferred implementation according to the present invention, but it is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, Accordingly, all modifications and variations completed by those with ordinary skill in the art should fall within the scope of present invention defined by the appended claims.</p>
