<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a remote control. More particularly, the present invention relates to a remote control that controls a charging station, such as an electric vehicle charging station, and remote notification to the remote device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Vehicles powered either fully or partially by batteries must at some point recharge their batteries. Particularly in the case of battery electric vehicles, the lack of an alternative power source, like one that a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle would have, causes the batteries to deplete faster and have a more limited range. Plug-in electric hybrids are generally less taxing on the batteries and built-in regenerative systems may suffice to recharge the batteries enough to go longer without having to plug-in the vehicle to recharge it. However, the driver will dictate the need for recharging an electric vehicle through the extent of use, driving conditions, and driving style. High mileage, stop-and-go traffic, and quick accelerations are all things that the driver may subject an electric vehicle to, and all will deplete the batteries faster than under ideal conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicles are commonly parked/stored in areas separate from where a vehicle owner/operator generally spends the majority of his time. A garage, be it an attached or detached home garage, or a shared building garage, are places where the vehicle operator may park and leave his vehicle, and not return to the garage until it is time to operate the vehicle again. Carports, parking lots, street parking spots, driveways, racks, docks, hangars, and others are all examples of where one may leave his vehicle while it is not in use, and otherwise spend little to no time at that location for reasons not relating to the use of the vehicle. Since places where the vehicle may be stored are not usually considered living or working spaces, they are often not as easily accessible as other places where one may conduct his daily activities.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unlike traditional fossil fuel vehicles, and non-traditional alternative fuel vehicles, which can be adequately fueled, generally by filling a fuel tank with a liquid fuel, in a matter of seconds or a few minutes while the vehicle operator fills the fuel tank, an electric vehicle's charge time is generally measured in hours. Also unlike other forms of refueling, electric vehicles are often recharged while parked or stored in their designated areas, like the areas described above. Thus, because recharging an electric vehicle is a relatively lengthy process that is often carried out in places where the vehicle operator doesn't spend time, it would be useful for the vehicle operator to be able to monitor and control the vehicle charging remotely.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is desirable to provide a convenient way of controlling and monitoring the recharging of electric vehicles from remote devices, such as smart phones, that can be used in locations away from where the electric vehicles are parked/stored. This will allow vehicle operators to better prepare for and plan electric vehicle usage without requiring that they go to the area where the vehicle and/or electric vehicle supply equipment is located to effect and to get information relating to the recharging. This will also make the electric vehicle more practical, acceptable and provide a convenience to overcome potential obstacles of ownership and use for the vehicle consumer.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An embodiment of the present inventive system for connecting an electric vehicle, such as a battery electric vehicle (BEV) or a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), to a Level I or II power source (Level II power may also be referred to as high voltage) may include an apparatus, such as an electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) for connecting the electric vehicle to a power source. The EVSE may be employed to make a circuit connection to allow power from an electrical socket, like a wall socket, to flow to a charging circuit within the electric vehicle. The wall socket may be a standard outlet found in a residential garage or a socket at a powering station in or outside the residential garage. The power station may be positioned, for example, at a parking garage, at a public parking space, at a rest stop, a conventional gas station, or a powering station (similar to a gas station, but has power stations instead of gas pumps). Further, the EVSE may be constructed to at least meet industry standards, such as SAE J1772, UL 2594, and NEC Article 625. The SAE J2836 vehicle communication standard may also be considered in constructing the EVSE.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The EVSE may have a socket connector at a first end to couple the EVSE to the electrical socket, such as a wall socket, and a vehicle connector at a second end to couple the EVSE to the electric vehicle. Once coupled, to both the wall socket and the vehicle, the EVSE may allow passage of electrical current from the wall socket to the electric vehicle, thus recharging the electric vehicle's batteries. This embodiment allows for the use of standard electrical outlets instead of hardwiring the EVSE directly to a power source.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Level I and Level II sockets are different in configurations. The EVSE may be constructed and/or provided with adapters to make the EVSE compatible with both a Level I and II socket. This may be accomplished through a combination of internal hardware and/or electrical components, external wiring components, and plug components and/or adapters.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the EVSE may analyze signals and/or data received from the electric vehicle. Analyzing the signals and/or data may involve checking the electric vehicle for specific conditions. While analyzing, the EVSE may determine when to allow and when to prohibit the flow of current between the socket and the electric vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A user of an EVSE may require that the EVSE be able to charge more than one vehicle. In one embodiment the EVSE may be configured to charge the vehicles simultaneously. Other embodiments may include an EVSE which may charge vehicles sequentially in a number of different manners.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The invention will now be described with reference to the drawing figures, in which like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram view of an apparatus for connecting an electric vehicle to Level I or Level II power source according to an embodiment of the invention. An EVSE <b>30</b> is one such apparatus and may include an input device <b>32</b>, a memory <b>34</b>, a communication device <b>36</b>, a processor <b>38</b>, and a display <b>40</b>, some or all of which can be interconnected by a data link <b>48</b>. The EVSE <b>30</b> can be a general computing device, such as a personal computer (PC), a UNIX workstation, a server, a mainframe computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular phone, a smart phone, some combination of these or any other suitable computing device. Alternatively, the EVSE <b>30</b> can be a specialized computing device made up of components specifically chosen to execute the functionality of the EVSE <b>30</b>. The remaining components can include programming code, such as source code, object code or executable code, stored on a computer-readable medium that can be loaded into the memory <b>34</b> and processed by the processor <b>38</b> in order to perform the desired functions of the EVSE <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The processor <b>38</b> may be executed in different ways for different embodiments of the EVSE <b>30</b>. One embodiment is that the processor <b>38</b> is a device that can read and process data such as a program instruction stored in the memory <b>34</b> or received from a source on the electric vehicle. Such a processor <b>38</b> may be embodied by a microcontroller. On the other hand, the processor <b>38</b> may be a collection of electrical circuitry components built to interpret certain electrical signals and perform certain tasks in response to those signals, or an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The memory <b>34</b> may include, for example, any form or combination of volatile, non-volatile, solid state, magnetic, optical, permanent, removable, writable, rewriteable, and read-only memory. The memory <b>34</b> may contain a number of program instructions for use with the EVSE <b>30</b>. The instructions may include methods, for example, for controlling the flow of current between the electrical socket and the electric vehicle. These methods may include controlling when to allow or prohibit the flow of current, or perhaps moderate the flow of current. The flow of current can be controlled based on various factors such as when off peak rates of an electrical utility are in progress; the usage of power, for example, within a house, a building, a power grid, or a parking structure; the availability of current or if the current is constant; scheduled power outages; availability of raw materials that are used in generating electricity; the availability of alternative means of generating electricity; the weather at the local charging station or outlet, which can effect means of generating electricity, such as wind turbines, and solar panels and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further, the memory may contain software having instructions related to diagnosing vehicle functions, such as OBD-II, battery testing, tire pressure sensor testing, emissions testing and the like. Further, the software may include the ability to track the status of various batteries in the vehicles, such as which batteries have been replaced, the remaining battery life of the various batteries, the warranty information about the batteries, the type of batteries used in the vehicle (mix and match) and the like. Many other embodiments may provide for further methods, some of which will be discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Additionally, an embodiment of the EVSE <b>30</b> can communicate information to a user through the display <b>40</b> and request user input through the input device <b>32</b> by way of an interactive, menu-driven, visual display-based user interface, or graphical user interface (GUI). The user may interactively input information using direct manipulation of the GUI. Direct manipulation can include the use of a pointing device, such as a mouse or a stylus, to select from a variety of selectable fields, including selectable menus, drop-down menus, tabs, buttons, bullets, checkboxes, text boxes, and the like. Nevertheless, various embodiments of the invention may incorporate any number of additional functional user interface schemes in place of this interface scheme, with or without the use of a mouse or buttons or keys, including for example, a trackball, a scroll wheel, a touch screen or a voice-activated system.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Some options that may be selected through the input device <b>32</b> may allow the user control over the charging of the electric vehicle. The user may select, for example, that the batteries be charged to or at a certain level or for a certain amount of time, a certain number of charges or start and stop at a certain time or at a particular event. Further, the user may select to be notified on a separate device, like on a cellular device, smart phone, pager, fax, remote control/display, or other wired and wireless devices, that the electric vehicle or charging is in a certain state, such as complete or faulted. The user may be able to set the EVSE <b>30</b> to control and power some of the vehicle's components while plugged in. For example, during different seasons the user may desire to heat or cool the vehicle as he gets ready for work in the morning so that the vehicle is comfortable when he gets in it. The EVSE <b>30</b> may also control setting the radio, power seats and mirrors depending on user preferences. Through the use of the EVSE <b>30</b>, other devices like a GPS, radar detector, and other devices that require boot or warm up periods may be powered on before the user enters the electric vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The display <b>40</b> may have a more simple implementation than previously mentioned, consisting of one or multiple indicators. Such indicators may consist of a small liquid crystal display (LCD) that can depict text or graphics. The LCD may be monochrome or colored. Other embodiments may include a single or multiple light emitting diodes (LED). This implementation could work for transmitting a limited number of simple messages. An LED may emit a single color of light, or it may be able to emit a number of different colors. Each LED or color may be associated with a different message. Some messages may include that power is available to charge the electric vehicle batteries, that charging the electric vehicle batteries is in progress, that the charging is complete, and that there is a fault or problem. The display may also be used to indicate the level of charge for the batteries, the number of times the batteries have been charged and the remaining charging time or the time the batteries have been charging.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The display <b>40</b> may also be separate from the EVSE <b>30</b> or a second remote display can be utilized. The second remote display (not shown) can be a remote control panel that receives the same or similar information as the display <b>40</b>. The second remote display can also control the EVSE <b>30</b> in the same or similar manner as the display <b>40</b> or the input device <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic view of an apparatus for connecting an electric vehicle to a high voltage power source according to another embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic view of an apparatus for connecting an electric vehicle to a Level I or Level II power source according to still another embodiment of the invention. The EVSE <b>30</b> may further include a relay <b>42</b> (referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref> and B as a contactor), a voltage regulating device <b>44</b> (referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref> and B as a power brick), a breaking device <b>46</b> (referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref> and B as a GFI), and a switch <b>58</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), some or all of which may be connected by an electric conduit <b>50</b>. A control circuit <b>56</b> may act as a buffer between different parts of the EVSE <b>30</b>. At one end of the EVSE <b>30</b> is a socket connector <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and at the other end is a vehicle connector <b>54</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and explained herein).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The voltage regulating device <b>44</b> may be needed to power the electronic components of the EVSE <b>30</b>. Since the EVSE <b>30</b> may draw its power from the same electrical socket it uses to charge the batteries of the electric vehicle, the EVSE <b>30</b> will be receiving high voltage electricity. The electrical socket may supply, for example 120 volts, 220 volts or 240 volts. The high voltage of the power drawn from the electrical socket could damage some of the electronic components of the EVSE <b>30</b>. Thus, the voltage regulator device <b>44</b>, such as a transformer or a voltage regulator, may be employed between to the electrical socket and the electrical components of the EVSE <b>30</b>. The voltage may then be lowered to a level that is manageable to the electrical components, such as, for example, 5 volts or 12 volts. In other embodiments, the voltage regulator device <b>44</b> can increase the voltage as needed by the EVSE <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the voltage regulating device <b>44</b> may regulate the voltage to parts of the EVSE <b>30</b>, there are parts where electricity may flow unaltered from the electrical socket to the electric vehicle. An electric conduit <b>50</b> may run the length of the EVSE <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment of the invention, the electric conduit <b>50</b> may be of the type having a gauge and/or rating such that it may appropriately handle the range of supplied current from the electrical socket. That being, the electric conduit <b>50</b> should be able to handle at least the highest supplied current, and in turn it will also be able to handle lower levels of current. The electric conduit <b>50</b> may be one appropriate for handling Level I and Level II charging or any level of charging. The electric conduit <b>50</b> suited for Level II charging may be comprised of a combination of conduits including, for example, two conduits for power supply (L1 and L2), one conduit as a neutral, and one conduit as a ground. The supplied current may be split over L1 and L2, thus aiding in supplying the proper current for Level I and Level II charging.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In connecting the electric conduit to the internal components of the EVSE <b>30</b>, it may be convenient to connect some or all of the combination of conduits that make up the electric conduit <b>50</b> to the different internal components. For example, the voltage regulating device <b>44</b>, as discussed herein, receives power from the supplied power from the electrical socket the EVSE <b>30</b> connects to. To receive this power, the voltage regulating device <b>44</b> may be connected to, at least, L1 and/or L2.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the electric conduit <b>50</b> includes a relay <b>42</b> that may be placed to bridge segments of the electric conduit <b>50</b>, allowing the EVSE <b>30</b> to start and stop the flow of current to the electric vehicle. The electric conduit <b>50</b> may optionally be connected to a voltage regulator to step up or step down the voltage passed to the electric vehicle. Further, to aid in providing the proper current to charge the electric vehicle, it is possible to provide the relay <b>42</b> with some or all of the current provided by the electrical socket. Power supply conduits L1 and L2 may both be connected to the relay <b>42</b>. Alternatively, the relay <b>42</b> may be connected to only either conduit L1 or L2.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an alternative embodiment, it may be that when only connected to conduit L1 or L2, the relay <b>42</b> may only enable the EVSE <b>30</b> to be able to provide the vehicle with Level I charging capabilities. Thus, to enable the EVSE <b>30</b> to provide Level II charging capabilities, as well as Level I charging, it maybe a possible to provide a switch <b>58</b> that will allow the EVSE <b>30</b> to selectively connect the unconnected conduit, either L1 or L2, to the relay <b>42</b>. In one embodiment, the switch <b>58</b> may be connected to, at least, the conduit, either L1 or L2, not already connected to the relay <b>42</b>. Further, the switch <b>58</b> may be connected to the control circuit <b>56</b> that controls when the switch allows for the selective connection of the unconnected conduit, either L1 or L2, to the relay <b>42</b>. The control function will be discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also connected to the electric conduit <b>50</b> may be a breaking device <b>46</b> (also called a ground device, GFI, or a current monitor). The breaking device <b>46</b> is intended to cut power along the electric conduit <b>50</b> quickly so as to avoid harming a user with a high voltage electric shock, harming the components of the EVSE <b>30</b> or damaging the electric vehicle. Such a breaking device <b>46</b> may be a ground fault interrupter. If the breaking device <b>46</b> trips and cuts power, EVSE <b>30</b> may have an auto-reset function to attempt to restore the power transfer to the electric vehicle. The auto-reset function may attempt to restore the power transfer after a determined time and/or for a determined number of tries. The auto-reset functions allows for continuous charging of the vehicle should a power surge occurs while the user is asleep or away from the charging location.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The control circuit <b>56</b> may be connected to the electric conduit <b>50</b> and to the data link <b>48</b>. Acting as a buffer between two portions of the EVSE <b>30</b>, the control circuit may pass signals from the electric conduit <b>50</b> representing the voltage on the electric conduit <b>50</b> to the processor <b>38</b>. From these signals, the processor <b>38</b> may react accordingly to control the relay <b>42</b> and the breaking device <b>46</b>. Further, the processor <b>38</b>, and other components, such as a voltage monitor, an oscillator, and a pulse width modulator may act accordingly to conduct a number of functions of the EVSE <b>30</b>. The control circuit <b>56</b> may also be connected to the voltage control device <b>44</b> for power, and a control pilot pin of a vehicle connector (discussed herein) to pass on signals from the vehicle to the other components of the EVSE <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the switch's <b>58</b> initial state, it will be open, thereby causing a disconnect between the unconnected conduit, either L1 or L2, and the relay <b>42</b>. When the EVSE <b>30</b> is connected to a Level I electrical socket, the control circuit <b>56</b> would recognize that there exists a <b>120</b> volt drop between the powered conduit, either L1 or L2, and the neutral conduit of the electric conduit <b>50</b> and leave the circuit between the unconnected conduit, either L1 or L2, and the relay <b>42</b> open. Alternatively, when the EVSE <b>30</b> is plugged into a Level II electrical socket, then the control circuit <b>56</b> would recognize the power on the unconnected conduit and, either via a signal from the processor <b>38</b> or via logical circuitry, provide a signal to the switch <b>58</b> to close the circuit between the unconnected conduit and the relay <b>42</b>. With the circuit closed, the relay <b>42</b> is connected to both power supply conduits, L1 and L2, of the electric conduit <b>50</b>, and the EVSE <b>30</b> can provide the electric vehicle with Level II charging capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The EVSE <b>30</b> also includes peripheral connection <b>51</b> that can add additional functionality to it, including USB, Fire-Wire, card reader, vehicle connector interface (for OBD-II, and the like connections), CD, DVD, memory, wireless communication, and additional hardware and software. The EVSE's software can be updated via the peripheral connection <b>51</b>. Additional hardware can be added to include, for example, additional processor, memory, FPGA (field programmable gate array), ASIC, pin connections, multiplexor and the other hardware to expand the functionality of the EVSE <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an elevation view of an apparatus for connecting an electric vehicle to a Level I or Level II power source according to another embodiment of the invention. Attached to a respective end of the electric conduit <b>50</b> may be the socket connector <b>52</b> and the vehicle connector <b>54</b>. The socket connector <b>52</b> may couple with the electrical socket to allow electricity to flow to the EVSE <b>30</b>. Any of a number of available or proprietary connectors may be used for the socket connector <b>52</b>. Such available connectors may include a NEMA 5 plug, for example, a NEMA 5-15 plug for Level I charging, or a NEMA 14 plug, for example, a NEMA 14-50P plug for Level II charging, if appropriate for the electrical socket. These socket connectors <b>52</b> may be interchangeable. Alternatively, the socket connector may be of an appropriate type for Level I or Level II charging, and an adapter <b>60</b> may be used to adapt the socket connector <b>52</b> to work for the other type of charging, as discussed herein. Connected to the opposite end of the electric conduit <b>50</b> may be the vehicle connector <b>54</b>, which also may be any number of available or proprietary connectors. One such example of a vehicle connector <b>54</b> may be a five-pin connector including two power pins, a ground pin, a control pilot pin, and a proximity sensor pin as specified in the SAE standard J1772 and designed by Yazaki of North America.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The EVSE <b>30</b> may include a housing <b>62</b>. The housing <b>62</b> may encase a number of the components of the EVSE <b>30</b>, for example, all the components previously mentioned except for portions of the electric conduit <b>50</b>, the socket connector <b>52</b> and the vehicle connector <b>54</b>. A bracket may be attached to the housing <b>62</b> to mount the housing <b>62</b> on a vertical surface such as a wall or post. The housing <b>62</b> or bracket may further include a hook to hang the power conduit <b>50</b>. Alternatively, the power conduit may be retractable into the housing <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The EVSE <b>30</b> may be available for both indoor and outdoor applications. Proper weather proofing may be part of the housing to protect the components from damage and the users from injury. Some outdoor installations of the EVSE <b>30</b> may include burial in the ground, being attached to a post, or integrated into a pedestal.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates adapters <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>B for connecting an apparatus that connects to a Level I or Level II power source according to another embodiment of the invention. If the socket connector <b>52</b> is, for example, a NEMA type 5 plug suitable for Level I charging is at the end of the electric conduit <b>50</b>, and it is desired to plug the EVSE <b>30</b> into a Level II socket, then the adapter <b>60</b>A is configured to accept the prongs of the socket connector <b>52</b> (with NEMA type 5 plug) and has prongs configured to be inserted into a Level II socket. Alternatively, if the socket connector <b>52</b> is, for example, a NEMA type 14 plug suitable for Level II charging is at the end of the electric conduit <b>50</b>, and it is desired to plug the EVSE <b>30</b> into a Level I socket, then the adapter <b>60</b>B is configured to accept the prongs of the socket connector <b>52</b> (with NEMA type 14 plug) and has prongs configured to be inserted into a Level I socket. An example of an adapter <b>60</b>B that would allow for connecting the socket connector <b>52</b> configured to connect to a Level II socket to connect to a Level I socket is the Marinco 50A to 15A RV Pigtail Adapter 150SPPRV.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in various embodiments, the EVSE <b>30</b> can be coupled to a communication network. The communication network allows for communication between the EVSE <b>30</b> and a remote device, such as a smart phone. The EVSE <b>30</b> can be coupled to the communication network by way of the communication device <b>36</b> which in various embodiments can incorporate any combination of devices&#x2014;as well as any associated software or firmware&#x2014;configured to couple processor-based systems. Such communication devices <b>36</b> may include modems, network interface cards, serial buses, parallel buses, LAN or WAN interfaces, wired, wireless or optical interfaces, and the like, along with any associated transmission protocols, as may be desired or required by the design.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The communication network links the communication device <b>36</b> of the EVSE <b>30</b> with the smart phone (as discussed herein). Various embodiments of the communication network may include any viable combination of devices and systems capable of linking computer-based systems that may use various communication protocols, such as USB; Bluetooth; WiFi; ZigBee; power line communication (PLC); home area network (HAN); Silver Spring network; stable election protocol (SEP); the Internet; TCP/IP; an intranet or extranet; a local area network (LAN); a wide area network (WAN); a direct cable connection; a private network; a public network; an Ethernet-based system; a token ring; a value-added network; a telephony-based system, including, for example, T1 or E1 devices; a cellular telephony system, for example, GPRS or GSM; a satellite system; an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network; a wired system; a wireless system; an optical system; a combination of any number of distributed processing networks or systems or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The remote device may be a common remote device, such as a electronic control unit of a vehicle, an example of which often used in vehicles for receiving diagnostic signals such an OBD-II signals. The remote device may also be a proprietary remote device, such as one developed for use with a specific brand of engine or specific model of engine. Further embodiments may encompass the remote device being a data receiver for a tire pressure management system. In either of these cases, the communication device <b>36</b> may be able to connect with a dealer, manufacturer, service department, government entity such as a state inspection office, etc. and report the findings transmitted from the remote device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Moreover, the remote device may be a wireless device with a display that gives the user information about the status of the electric vehicle connected to the EVSE <b>30</b>. The remote device may be such that it is easily placed within a room in a building, or even attached to a key like a key chain. The information delivered to the user may include charge status of the vehicle, diagnostic messages, tire pressure management system messages, and other vehicle related information.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The EVSE <b>30</b> may also act as a remote control allowing the user to control function of the car, like power, air conditioning and heat, radio settings, power seat and mirror settings, etc. The EVSE <b>30</b> may also have internet access or similar communication access to remote server in order to obtain information such as emails, weather report, web pages, stock information, diagnostic databases and the other information.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The communication device <b>36</b> may also be able to communicate with the local utility company. This may allow for the utility company to know that the vehicle is connected and to charge the vehicle at a certain time of the day, such as during off-peak hours, if requested by the user. One embodiment to implement this feature is through the remote device, where the remote device encompasses a smart meter or a computerized utility meter. The EVSE <b>30</b> may communicate with the smart meter to determine when the EVSE <b>30</b> should charge the vehicle depending on certain parameters. If it is a goal to reduce energy costs, the smart meter may determine at what time of the day the rate for electricity is lowest, and during that time, tell the EVSE <b>30</b> to charge the vehicle. The EVSE <b>30</b> may also communicate with the smart meter to indicate when the vehicle is charging and how much charging is required. With this information, the smart meter may be able to manage the power consumption of the rest of a house to keep overall power consumption at or herein a desired level.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A further embodiment of the EVSE <b>30</b> may be to include a battery charging monitor. This feature could add a further layer of safety to the EVSE <b>30</b> by preventing overheating of the charging battery by, for example, decreasing the amount of electricity to the vehicle or simply terminate the electrical supply to the vehicle. The EVSE <b>30</b> may be able to connect to the vehicle's own battery temperature sensor, such as a thermistor or a laser temperature sensor. Signals from the temperature sensors may be interpreted by the EVSE <b>30</b>. If the signals indicate that the temperature of the battery is rising to an undesired temperature, the EVSE <b>30</b> may discontinue charging the battery, and in some instances issue a notification of the problem to the user. The notification may be sent to a smart phone.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Other embodiments of the EVSE <b>30</b> may allow for the power conduit <b>50</b> to have multiple vehicle connectors <b>54</b> stemming therefrom, or multiple power conduits <b>50</b>, each with its own vehicle connector <b>54</b> or a combination thereof The EVSE <b>30</b> may charge the vehicles simultaneously or switch from one vehicle to another after the first vehicle has completed recharging. There may also be an adapter that allows the socket connector to connect to low voltage sockets, such as ones that provide <b>120</b> volts or less, as discussed herein. In other embodiments, the EVSE <b>30</b> can connect to alternative power sources that use renewable energy to charge the vehicle. Such sources may include solar panels and wind turbines, for example. If the alternative power sources alone are insufficient, then they may be supplemented by an electrical socket connected to a utility company source.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an embodiment where the EVSE <b>30</b> is configured to charge more than one vehicle simultaneously, as mentioned herein, the EVSE <b>30</b> may have multiple power conduits <b>50</b>, each with its own vehicle connector <b>54</b>. An EVSE <b>30</b> connected to a power source, such as an electrical socket, may divide the power provided by the source and provide a certain percentage of the power to each vehicle via the respective power conduit <b>50</b> and vehicle connector <b>54</b> connected to each vehicle. In the simplest implementation of such an embodiment, the power could be split 50/50, with half of the power provided to each vehicle for charging.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Not all simultaneous charging need be so symmetric. An EVSE <b>30</b> configured for simultaneous charging may include power management features that allow the EVSE <b>30</b> to increase or decrease the power provided to the individual vehicles depending on various factors. For example, a situation may exist where a first vehicle is connected to the EVSE <b>30</b> before a second vehicle. While the first vehicle is charging alone, it may be allocated all of the power available for charging, i.e. 100% power. Once the second vehicle is connected to the EVSE <b>30</b>, some of the 100% power allocated to the first vehicle may be reallocated to the second vehicle, making the power split, for example, 50/50, 70/30, 45/55, or any other combination.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The amount of power allocated to each vehicle may vary for multiple reasons. One may be the charge state of the battery in the respective vehicle. The EVSE <b>30</b> may be able to tell the level of charge remaining in the battery of each vehicle. If one vehicle battery has a higher charged level than the other, then the EVSE <b>30</b> may determine to provide the vehicle battery with the lower charged level more power. This determination may be made on the basis that the battery with the lower charge may require more power to charge it faster, while the battery with more remaining charge could finish charging in an adequate time with less power. The reverse of this power distribution may occur in the same situation depending on the power management settings. The EVSE <b>30</b> may determine that it may be more efficient, to provide the vehicle battery with a higher charged level with more power than the other battery to more quickly complete the higher charged battery's charging. Then, once the higher charge battery is done charging, or at a certain level, the EVSE <b>30</b> may allocate more power to the lower charged battery to complete charging.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">During simultaneous charging, the charge levels of the batteries change. The EVSE <b>30</b> may have the ability to detect these charge levels and manage the power provided to each battery throughout the charging. For example, when a battery is charging, there may come a point in the charging cycle where the battery is approaching a full charge. Often at this point, charging power to the battery is reduced to until the battery is fully charged. In many instances, the reduction of charging power may occur in stages, each stage further reducing the charging power. If one battery were to reach this point before another charging battery, then the power management system could reallocated the power no longer needed for one battery to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, the EVSE <b>30</b> does not have to deliver 100% of the charging power to any of the batteries, alone or combined, during charging. There may be times, when none of batteries require enough charging power to equate to 100% of the available charging power. In such instances, the EVSE <b>30</b> may be able to control the amount of power delivered to the batteries such that the delivered power totals less than the available charging power, for example, 15/20 or any other combination less than 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Another factor that may affect how the EVSE <b>30</b> allocates the charging power to the vehicles may have to do with the battery technology implemented within the vehicles themselves. The EVSE <b>30</b> may be able to identify the battery technology used in a specific vehicle and determine that the vehicle charging is best effected using a specific charging profile, or the vehicle may be able to instruct the EVSE <b>30</b> to use a specific charging profile based on the battery technology, charge state, weather conditions, availability of accessible charging and/or gas stations within a given driving range, or other factors. Any information used to identify the battery technology, the vehicle, the battery charge state, or any other feature of the vehicle and/or battery may be detected or received by the EVSE <b>30</b> via the communication device <b>36</b> over the communication network. The EVSE <b>30</b> may connect to the vehicle wirelessly or by wire, for example via OBD II connector or the vehicle connector <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The allocation of electricity, detection of battery level, and the type of battery system that is in the vehicle and other detection discussed herein can be done automatically when the EVSE is connected to the vehicle. Alternatively, the allocation and detection can be predetermined and manually set by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As stated above, the allocation of charging power may also be determined by customizable settings. One such setting, which may be user programmable to the EVSE <b>30</b> via the input device <b>32</b> or the remote device, is a vehicle priority setting. The EVSE <b>30</b> may be instructed that one vehicle has priority over another, thus the prioritized vehicle should complete charging before the other vehicle. For example, one user may go to work earlier than another user or one user anticipate only a lower usage of the vehicle on a particular day but may need more charging on another day. Other settings may indicate, for example, when the next time the vehicle will be used, how far the vehicle will be driven, the conditions the vehicle will be driven in (hills or no hills, mainly during high traffic times or not, for example), how economical the user wishes the EVSE <b>30</b> to be when charging the vehicle, a minimum charge level the user wishes the car to be at, the current or forecasted weather, the availability of accessible charging and/or gas stations within a given driving range, or any other factors that may affect how the EVSE <b>30</b> may allocate the charging power to meet the charge level needed, indicated by the settings, for the next use of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Sequentially charging multiple vehicles is another option for an EVSE <b>30</b> charging more than one vehicle. The simplest approach would be to configure the EVSE <b>30</b> to charge the vehicle it is connected to first until completion and then charge another vehicle thereafter. This could be implemented in a semi-manual fashion where the EVSE <b>30</b> has one power conduit <b>50</b> and one vehicle connector <b>54</b>, and the EVSE <b>30</b> signals a user when one vehicle is charged and the EVSE <b>30</b> is available to be connected to another vehicle for charging. Another option would be to configure the EVSE <b>30</b> with multiple power conduits <b>50</b> having respective vehicle connectors <b>54</b>. In one embodiment, there can be one power conduit <b>50</b> having multiple vehicle connectors <b>54</b> stemming therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">With multiple vehicle connectors connected to respective vehicles, the EVSE <b>30</b> could be configured to automatically sequentially charge the vehicles. One implementation, similar to the sequential charging described herein, would be when completing the charging of a connected vehicle, the EVSE <b>30</b> could automatically charge another vehicle when finished charging the first one.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Sequential charging could be implemented in a number of other ways as well. Some embodiments of sequential charging would not require that the first vehicle charging be fully charged prior to reallocating power from the first vehicle to the second vehicle. Some batteries can be quickly charged with high power at first, thereby charging a certain percentage of the battery's charge potential. Often that portion of the battery's charge potential that can be quickly charged is a majority of the charge potential or a predetermined charge level. The remaining charge potential of the battery may require slower charging at a lower power level, including a trickle level. In instances where the vehicles being charged possess these types of batteries, the EVSE <b>30</b> may charge a substantial portion of the battery of the first vehicle until a quick charge potential threshold has been reached. Once the quick charge threshold of the first vehicle is reached, the EVSE <b>30</b> may discontinue power to the first vehicle (or charge at a lower level) and reallocate the power (or most of the power) to the second vehicle. When the EVSE <b>30</b> determines that the second vehicle has reached a satisfactory charge level, the EVSE <b>30</b> may discontinue power to the second vehicle and reallocate the power, at an appropriate level, to the first vehicle. This process of switching the allocation of power between the first and second vehicle may occur numerous times depending on power management settings implemented in the EVSE <b>30</b>, based on efficiency, speed, economy, weather, availability of charging and/or gas station, or other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The switching of power allocation between charging vehicles during sequential charging may occur for various reasons. One such reason is the EVSE <b>30</b> can be configured to detect the remaining charge levels of the connected vehicles. If the first vehicle is already connected and charging when the second vehicle is connected, the EVSE <b>30</b> may be able to compare the remaining charge level of each vehicle. In one instance, the EVSE <b>30</b> may determine that the first vehicle's remaining charge level is lower than the second vehicle. Then, depending on power management settings, the EVSE <b>30</b> may determine to continue charging the first vehicle until it reaches a satisfactory charge level, which may include a completed charge or a partial charge, before reallocating some or all power to the second vehicle. Conversely, the EVSE <b>30</b> may determine to discontinue charging the first vehicle and reallocate power to the second vehicle until a satisfactory charge level is reached before continuing to charge the first vehicle. This may be due to the need of the second vehicle earlier then the need of the first vehicle. The same charging determinations can be made by the EVSE <b>30</b> when the second vehicle's remaining charge level is lower than the first vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The satisfactory charge levels mentioned herein may be at any level of charging. A vehicle's battery may reach multiple satisfactory charge levels throughout the sequential charging process causing the EVSE <b>30</b> to discontinue charging one vehicle and allocate the charging power to another vehicle several times. The satisfactory charge level for each vehicle battery may depend on a single factor or multiple factors. Some such factors may include: battery charge state, battery type, charging method, charging efficiency, charging cost, charging speed, weather, availability of charging and/or gas stations en route, user settings (described herein), or a number of other factors. Similar factors may also be used for the EVSE <b>30</b> to determine the level of power to provide when charging a battery.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As described herein the allocation of charging power may also be determined by customizable settings. One such setting, which may be user programmable to the EVSE <b>30</b> via the input device <b>32</b> or the remote device, is the vehicle priority setting. The EVSE <b>30</b> may be instructed that one vehicle has priority over another, thus the prioritized vehicle should complete charging before the other vehicle. Other settings may indicate, for example, when the next time the vehicle will be used, how far the vehicle will be driven, the conditions the vehicle will be driven in, how economical the user wishes the EVSE <b>30</b> to be when charging the vehicle, the minimum charge level the user wishes the vehicle to be at, the availability of charging and/or gas stations in the proximity of a path of travel, or any other factor that may affect how the EVSE <b>30</b> may allocate the charging power to meet the charge level needed, indicated by the settings, for the next use of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Many of the EVSE's capabilities described in connection with the simultaneous charging description are similarly applicable to sequential charging. In both embodiments the EVSE <b>30</b> may be able to detect or receive the same information from the vehicles, and make the same determinations about the vehicles and power management. However, instead of adjusting power levels to multiple vehicles at the same time as in the simultaneous charging, in sequential charging the EVSE <b>30</b> adjusts power levels to the charging vehicle and determines when to discontinue charging the charging vehicle and begin charging the other vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Another embodiment may include the EVSE <b>30</b> in communication with a remote server. The remote server may provide instructions to the EVSE <b>30</b> or it may just store information, such as in a database, and provide the EVSE <b>30</b> with requested information including performing other functions such as sending emails, as requested by the EVSE. In the embodiment where the remote server provides the EVSE <b>30</b> instructions, the EVSE <b>30</b> may pass information received, extracted, or sensed from the charging vehicle to the remote server. The remote server may then interpret that information and make the charging determinations described herein, such as if a vehicle battery has reached a satisfactory charge level, detect the remaining charge level, and determine when to discontinue charging and reallocate power. The remote sever may also store and take into account the power management settings and user settings. After interpreting the information, the remote server may then instruct the EVSE <b>30</b> to implement the different functions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the embodiment where the EVSE <b>30</b> is connected to a remote server storing a database for providing information requested, the EVSE <b>30</b> may have the hardware and software to interpret the information and make the determinations described herein. An example of this would be when the EVSE <b>30</b> is connected to the vehicle for charging and basic information is available about the vehicle's make and model, or about the type of battery employed in the vehicle. The EVSE <b>30</b> may query the database on the remote server for more detailed information about the vehicle's battery, such as preferred battery charging methods and battery charging thresholds. The database may also be queried for power management settings and user preferences. The EVSE <b>30</b> may then use the information queried to make the vehicle charging related determinations.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The remote server may also serve to update software and information stored on the EVSE <b>30</b>. In the embodiments where the EVSE <b>30</b> contains the charging determination software and/or the information used by the charging determination software, such as vehicle information, power management settings, weather, traffic, charging and/or gas station locations, and user preferences, the remote server may update the software and information stored on the EVSE <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, illustrated is a schematic of an apparatus for sequentially charging multiple electric vehicles. The apparatus depicted, herein the sequential EVSE <b>70</b> is much like the EVSE <b>30</b> described herein with a few modifications. The sequential EVSE <b>70</b> may include multiple vehicle connectors <b>54</b>, connected to the rest of the sequential EVSE <b>70</b> by a respective power conduit <b>50</b>. There may also be another contactor <b>42</b><i>a </i>between the breaking device <b>46</b> and the vehicle connectors <b>54</b> for controlling the power to each vehicle connector <b>54</b>. Further, the EVSE <b>70</b> may include another voltage regulator device (not shown) to a manipulate the voltage levels provided to the vehicle connector <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, illustrated is a flow diagram of a method for sequentially (or simultaneously) charging multiple electric vehicles <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. First, the EVSE <b>30</b> may detect that multiple vehicles are connected to it via the vehicle connectors <b>54</b> (step <b>110</b>). Detecting that multiple vehicles are connected may be conducted by polling the vehicle connectors <b>54</b> to see if they are connected to a vehicle, or the EVSE <b>30</b> may wait to receive a signal once the vehicle connectors <b>54</b> are connected to the vehicles. The signal may be automated or as a result of an entry by the user. Once the EVSE <b>30</b> detects multiple vehicles, the EVSE <b>30</b> may detect vehicle/vehicle battery information (step <b>112</b>). Optionally the EVSE <b>30</b> may query the remote database for information, such as about the vehicle battery, power management settings, and/or user settings (step <b>150</b>). In another embodiment, an option may be for the EVSE <b>30</b> to pass information to a remote server to process the information and instruct the EVSE <b>30</b> on how to manage the charging of the vehicles (step <b>160</b>). This may be due to the user remotely entering charging information on the remote server for the EVSE to access at a later point in time. The user would access the remote server and enter the desired information for the EVSE to use during charging.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">After step <b>112</b>, the EVSE <b>30</b> may then compare any information detected from the first vehicle/vehicle battery with information from the second vehicle/vehicle battery, power management settings, and/or user settings (step <b>114</b>). After making such comparisons, the EVSE <b>30</b> may determine, whether to continue any charging in progress, discontinue charging in progress and begin charging a different vehicle, simultaneously charge the vehicles, or exit (step <b>116</b>). If the EVSE continues to charge, then the EVSE <b>30</b> determines the amount of power to allocate to charging (step <b>118</b>) one vehicle versus the other, i.e. charging only on vehicle at a certain level or charging both vehicles at respective levels. While charging, the EVSE <b>30</b> monitors the charge level of the charging vehicle battery for the charge level (step <b>120</b>). If the charge level is satisfactory, the process returns back to step <b>114</b>, otherwise the charging continues.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Back at step <b>116</b>, if the EVSE <b>30</b> determines to discontinue the charging in progress and begin charging a different vehicle, then the EVSE discontinues power to the charging vehicle (step <b>122</b>). The EVSE <b>30</b> then determines the amount of power to allocate to charging the charging vehicle (step <b>118</b>). While charging, the EVSE <b>30</b> monitors the charge level of the charging vehicle battery for the charge level (step <b>120</b>). If the charge level is satisfactory, the process returns back to step <b>116</b>, otherwise the charging continues.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">If, at step <b>116</b>, the EVSE <b>30</b> determines that all connected vehicles have completed charging, then the EVSE <b>30</b> exits the sequential method for sequentially charging multiple electric vehicles <b>100</b> (step <b>124</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As stated herein, the EVSE may potentially perform a variety of other functions in addition to its primary purpose of charging the electric vehicle. Multiple embodiments may also include any number of functions that may be considered secondary purposes of the EVSE. A few examples of these functions may include conducting battery tests and reporting the state of the batteries and the number of times the batteries have been charged. The EVSE may also conduct vehicle diagnostics, execute a tire pressure management system, run an emissions analysis, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As mentioned herein, one embodiment of the EVSE <b>30</b> may be to communicate over a communication network <b>200</b> with a remote device <b>210</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The communication over communication network <b>200</b> can be implemented by a variety of communication protocols. EVSE <b>30</b> may have an integrated or peripheral communication device <b>36</b>, through which the EVSE <b>30</b> may communicate with the remote device <b>210</b> over the communication network <b>200</b>. The communication device <b>36</b> may be able to communicate via one or more communication protocols. For example, the communication device <b>36</b> may be able to connected to and communicate over a WiFi network, a radio telecommunications network, such as a GSM and/or CDMA network, a mobile broadband network, such as HSPA, EVDO, LTE, and WiMAX, or ant communication protocol described herein. The communication device <b>36</b> is not limited to any specific number or combinations of communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the remote device <b>210</b> may include input device <b>212</b>, a memory <b>214</b>, a communication device <b>216</b>, a processor <b>218</b>, and a display <b>220</b>, some or all of which can be interconnected by a data link <b>228</b>. The remote device <b>210</b> can be a general computing device, such as a personal computer (PC), a UNIX workstation, a server, a mainframe computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular phone, a smart phone, a tablet, a slate, some combination of these or any other suitable computing device. Alternatively, the remote device <b>210</b> can be a specialized computing device made up of components specifically chosen to execute the functionality of the remote device <b>210</b>. The remaining components can include programming code, such as source code, object code or executable code, stored on a computer-readable medium that can be loaded into the memory <b>214</b> and processed by the processor <b>218</b> in order to perform the desired functions of the remote device <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The processor <b>218</b> may be executed in different ways for different embodiments of the remote device <b>210</b>. One embodiment is that the processor <b>218</b> is a device that can read and process data such as a program instruction stored in the memory <b>214</b>. Such a processor <b>218</b> may be embodied by a programmable microcontroller.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The memory <b>214</b> may include, for example, any form or combination of volatile, non-volatile, solid state, magnetic, optical, permanent, removable, writable, rewriteable, and read-only memory. The memory <b>214</b> may contain a number of program instructions for use with the remote device <b>210</b> as discussed herein. The instructions may include methods, for example, for controlling the functions of the EVSE <b>30</b> and retrieving or receiving information from the EVSE <b>30</b>. The program instructions may be configured to work with various or individual smart phone and mobile device operating systems (or operating system families, including different versions), such as iOS, Android, Chrome, BlackBerry OS, QNX, Palm OS, webOS, Windows, Windows Phone, Symbian, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Additionally, an embodiment of the remote device <b>210</b> can communicate information to a user through the display <b>220</b> and request user input through the input device <b>212</b> by way of an interactive, menu-driven, visual display-based user interface, or graphical user interface (GUI). The user may interactively input information using direct manipulation of the GUI. Direct manipulation can include the use of a pointing device, such as a mouse or a stylus, to select from a variety of selectable fields, including selectable menus, drop-down menus, tabs, buttons, bullets, checkboxes, text boxes, and the like. Nevertheless, various embodiments of the invention may incorporate any number of additional functional user interface schemes in place of this interface scheme, with or without the use of a mouse or buttons or keys, including for example, a trackball, a scroll wheel, a touch screen (via the display <b>220</b>) or a voice-activated system.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Some options that may be selected through the input device <b>212</b> may allow the user control over the EVSE <b>30</b> and the charging of the electric vehicle. The user may select, for example, that the batteries be charged to or at a certain level or for a certain amount of time, a certain number of charges or start and stop at a certain time or at a particular event. Further, the user may select to be notified on the remote device <b>210</b> that the electric vehicle or charging is in a certain state, such as complete or faulted. The user may be able to control the EVSE <b>30</b> from the remote device <b>210</b> to control and power some of the vehicle's components while plugged in. For example, during different seasons the user may desire to start and heat or cool the vehicle as he gets ready for work in the morning so that the vehicle is comfortable when he gets in it. The remote device <b>210</b> may also instruct the EVSE <b>30</b> to control setting the radio, power seats and mirrors depending on user preferences, or lock or unlock the vehicle. Through the use of the remote device <b>210</b> to control the EVSE <b>30</b>, other devices like a GPS, radar detector, and other devices that require boot or warm up periods may be powered on before the user enters the electric vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, the options may include instructing the EVSE <b>30</b> to run vehicle diagnostic functions, such as OBD-II, battery testing, tire pressure sensor testing, emissions testing and the like. The remote device <b>210</b> may also instruct the EVSE <b>30</b> to track the status of various batteries in the vehicles, such as which batteries have been replaced, the remaining battery life of the various batteries, the warranty information about the batteries, the type of batteries used in the vehicle (mix and match) and the like. Many other embodiments may provide for further methods, some of which will be discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">With each of the various functions of the EVSE <b>30</b> that may be controlled by the remote device <b>210</b>, notifications may be sent from the EVSE <b>30</b> to the remote device for display to the user. Some such notifications may be prompted by an instruction from the remote device <b>210</b>, such as an acknowledgement that a function has successfully been executed, or alternatively has failed. For example, if the user of the remote device <b>210</b> instructs the EVSE <b>30</b> via the remote device <b>210</b> to start the vehicle, and the vehicle is located somewhere where the user cannot see or hear it, the use may want confirmation indicating whether the vehicle started or not. In other instances, the remote device <b>210</b> may be notified of an event by the EVSE <b>30</b> without prompting. For example, when the vehicle is connected to the EVSE <b>30</b> it may begin to charge, and the vehicle operator may move away from the vehicle to an area where he can not see or here the vehicle or the EVSE <b>30</b>. The operator then may not be able to tell when the vehicle has finished charging. The vehicle operator may use the remote device <b>210</b> to query the EVSE <b>30</b> for the vehicle charging status, or the EVSE <b>30</b> may automatically notify the operator via the remote device <b>210</b> when the vehicle has completed charging. These example are in no way limiting of the types of notifications that the remote device <b>210</b> may receive from the EVSE <b>30</b>, and one skilled in the art would understand that multiple notifications may exist for every function carried out by the EVSE <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Similar to the communication device <b>36</b>, the remote device <b>210</b> may also communicate via one or more communication protocols. To continue the example, the remote device <b>210</b> may be a cellular phone, or a smart phone, capable of communicating over a WiFi network, a radio telecommunications network, such as a GSM and/or CDMA network, and a mobile broadband network, such as HSPA, EVDO, LTE, and WiMAX. The remote device <b>210</b> is not limited to any specific number or combinations of communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Which communication protocol may be used to communicate between the EVSE <b>30</b> and the remote device <b>210</b> may depend a few factors. One factor affecting the communication protocol selection may be the compatibility of each of the communication device <b>36</b> and the remote device <b>210</b> with the communication protocol. If both the communication device <b>36</b> and the remote device <b>210</b> are compatible with the same communication protocol, the common protocol may be the selected communication protocol to effect the communication over the communication network <b>200</b>. However, it may not be necessary for the communication device <b>36</b> and the remote device <b>210</b> to support the same communication protocol because a intermediary communication device (not shown) may be used to convert data sent in protocol format to another protocol format to be received.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Another factor in selecting the communication protocol may be the proximity of the of the communication device <b>36</b> and the remote device <b>210</b> to the communication network <b>200</b>. If the communication network <b>200</b> is a local network, for example a WiFi network for a home or building, and both the communication device <b>36</b> and the remote device <b>210</b> can access the local communication network <b>200</b>, then the local communication network <b>200</b> may be used to effect communication between the communication device <b>36</b> and the remote device <b>210</b>. The local communication network <b>200</b> may be chosen above other available networks. Reasons for selecting one available network over another may include faster communication speed, lower power consumption, reduced risk of lost or corrupted data, greater network security, and other reasons. For example, a smart phone may be able to communicate over a WiFi network and a mobile broadband network, but the WiFi network requires the smart phone to use less power, it may be firewalled and encrypted, and it may cover a smaller area. In such an example, the smart phone or the EVSE <b>30</b> may recognize that the other is connected to the WiFi network and chose to communicate of the WiFi network instead of the alternatives. In another example, a user of a smart phone may decide to manually select an available communication network <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As mentioned herein, the memory <b>214</b> may contain a number of program instructions for use with the remote device <b>210</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the memory <b>214</b> may contain a number of instruction modules for providing various functionalities of the remote device <b>210</b>. Such modules may include: a communication protocol selection module <b>500</b>; an EVSE recognition module <b>502</b>; an EVSE search module <b>504</b>; an EVSE connection determination module <b>506</b>; an EVSE connection module <b>508</b>; an EVSE manual entry module <b>510</b>; an option determination module <b>512</b>; an option display module <b>514</b>; an option selection module <b>516</b>; a vehicle recognition module <b>518</b>; an EVSE type recognition module <b>520</b>; an instruction transmit module <b>522</b>; a confirmation receipt module <b>524</b>; a confirmation display module <b>526</b>; an alert handling module <b>528</b>; and an encryption module <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The communication protocol selection module <b>500</b>, the EVSE recognition module <b>502</b>, the EVSE search module <b>504</b>, the EVSE connection determination module <b>506</b>, the EVSE connection module <b>508</b>, and the EVSE manual entry module <b>510</b> all relate to establishing a connection between the remote device <b>210</b> and the EVSE <b>30</b>. The communication protocol selection module <b>500</b> is responsible for determining the communication protocol to use to connect to the EVSE <b>30</b> and initializing the use of the selected communication protocol. The EVSE recognition module <b>502</b> determines if any known EVSEs <b>30</b> are connected to the communication network <b>200</b> the remote device <b>210</b> has connected to via the selection and initialization made by the communication protocol selection module <b>500</b>. The EVSE search module <b>504</b> executes a search for EVSEs <b>30</b> connected to the communication network <b>200</b> when no know EVSEs <b>30</b> are identified, or if none are desired to connect with. The EVSE connection determination module <b>506</b> determines whether any EVSE <b>30</b> identified, known or otherwise, is the EVSE <b>30</b> with which the remote device <b>210</b> is to connect. The EVSE connection module <b>508</b> effects the connection between the EVSE <b>30</b> and the remote device <b>210</b> based on the determination of the EVSE connection determination module <b>506</b>. The EVSE manual entry module <b>510</b> allows a user to manually identify the EVSE <b>30</b> for connection when automatic connection fails or is not desired.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The option determination module <b>512</b>, the option display module <b>514</b>, the option selection module <b>516</b>, the vehicle recognition module <b>518</b>, and the EVSE type recognition module <b>520</b> each relate to determining the instructions to send to the EVSE <b>30</b>. The option determination module <b>512</b> is responsible for identifying the options available for use with the EVSE <b>30</b> and the connected vehicle. The identification of options may be from a pool of options generally available for EVSEs <b>30</b>, or a subset of options available from certain vehicles and/or EVSE types. Identifying the available options may occur once after connection to an EVSE <b>30</b> or after an option selection is made further identification may be required to identify available suboptions. The option display module <b>514</b> formats the display of the options identified by the option determination module <b>512</b> and presents the options on the display <b>220</b>. The formatting and presentation may occur each time the option determination module <b>512</b> is executed to present varying sets of options. The option selection module <b>516</b> receives signals representing the selection of an option on the remote device <b>210</b> and interprets the selection such that it identifies a command that results in further executing the option determination module <b>510</b> or selecting an instruction for the EVSE <b>30</b>. The vehicle recognition module <b>518</b> and the EVSE type recognition module <b>520</b> identify a type of vehicle connected to the EVSE <b>30</b> and the type of EVSE <b>30</b> connected to the remote device <b>212</b>, respectively. The identification may include make, model, year, software and hardware identifiers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The instruction transmit module <b>522</b> is initiated when the option selection module <b>516</b> interprets the signal received as an instruction for the EVSE <b>30</b>, and the instruction transmit module <b>522</b> communicates the instruction to the EVSE <b>30</b> via the communication network <b>200</b>. If the EVSE <b>30</b> receives the instruction and executes the instruction, either to completion, or until a fault occurs, the EVSE <b>30</b> will return a confirmation of the action executed by the EVSE <b>30</b> and the result of the action. The confirmation receipt module <b>524</b> receives the confirmation from the EVSE <b>30</b> via the communication network <b>200</b>. The confirmation display module <b>526</b> interprets the confirmation received from the EVSE <b>30</b> and formats the confirmation to be presented on the display <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, after a connection is established between the remote device <b>210</b> and the EVSE <b>30</b>, an alert may originate from the EVSE <b>30</b> and be received by the remote device <b>210</b>. Events that may trigger an alert may be preset or set by user preference in the remote device <b>210</b>, or may be programmed into the EVSE <b>30</b>. Some alerts may be informative of common occurrences, for example, the vehicle has commenced or completed charging, or the vehicle charge has reached a certain level. Other alerts may be informative of abnormalities, for example, the EVSE <b>30</b> has failed, the vehicle batteries are overheating, or the vehicle connection has been interrupted. In any of these examples, the EVSE <b>30</b> may send an alert which is received by the remote device <b>210</b>. Upon receiving an alert the alert handling module <b>528</b> may identify the communication from the EVSE <b>30</b> as an alert and format it for display on the remote device <b>210</b>. If there are options for responding to the alert, the alert handling module <b>528</b> may also display the options to the user of the remote device <b>210</b>, and depending on the user's selection, instruct the remote device <b>210</b> to execute an appropriate response to the EVSE <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Communication between the remote device <b>210</b> and the EVSE <b>30</b> is susceptible to tampering. To address this threat, the encryption module <b>530</b> may encrypt any outgoing communications and decrypt any encrypted incoming communications. The encryption module <b>530</b> may implement symmetric or asymmetric key algorithms, it may encrypt all communications or selectively encrypt communications, and it may implement known or proprietary encryption algorithms.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> the description of the method for communicating between the EVSE and the remote device <b>300</b> will be described from the perspective of the remote device <b>210</b>, however one skilled in the art would recognize that individual roles of the EVSE <b>30</b> and the remote device <b>210</b> in the method described could be reversed. To begin, the remote device <b>210</b> selects a communication protocol (step <b>310</b>). As described herein, the communication protocol may be selected on the basis of one or numerous factors. The remote device <b>210</b> may select a communications protocol from the communication protocols with which the remote device <b>210</b> is compatible. The remote device <b>210</b> may also be aware of the communications protocols supported by the EVSE <b>30</b> and networks to which the EVSE <b>30</b> is connected. If the remote device <b>210</b> supports a communication protocol shared by the EVSE <b>30</b>, and can detect a network to which the EVSE <b>30</b> is connected, then the remote device <b>210</b> may select this communication protocol and network. This may be accomplished automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Once the communication network <b>200</b> is selected, the remote device <b>210</b> may determine if there is a known EVSE <b>30</b> with which the remote device <b>210</b> may interact on the communication network <b>200</b> (step <b>320</b>). If a known EVSE <b>30</b> is on the communication network <b>200</b>, the remote device <b>210</b> then will decide whether to connect to the known EVSE <b>30</b> (step <b>330</b>). Determining whether to connect to the known EVSE <b>30</b> may occur in a few different ways. For one, the known EVSE <b>30</b> may have been set as a preferred EVSE <b>30</b> and is set to automatically connect to that EVSE <b>30</b>. Such a setting may be useful for when a person connects their vehicle to the same EVSE <b>30</b> repeatedly, like at home. Another example may include presenting the user of the remote device <b>210</b> with the option to connect to one EVSE <b>30</b> of one or more detected EVSEs <b>30</b>, such as in the user's office parking garage where the user may repeatedly connect to various EVSEs <b>30</b>. In this circumstance each EVSE <b>30</b> may have an identification number, similar to a parking spot number or a MAC address, so that the user may know to which EVSE <b>30</b> the vehicle is connected. In another embodiment, the remote device <b>210</b> may be able to automatically identify which of a number of EVSEs <b>30</b> is connected to the user's vehicle, and automatically connect to the proper EVSE <b>30</b>. If the remote device <b>210</b> determines to connect to a known EVSE <b>30</b>, then the method continue to step <b>370</b>. If the remote device <b>210</b> does not find a known EVSE <b>30</b> or determines not to connect to a known EVSE <b>30</b>, then the method continues to step <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">At step <b>340</b>, the remote device <b>210</b> may search for any EVSE <b>30</b> connected to the communication network <b>200</b>. The results of such a search may return a prohibitively large number of EVSEs <b>30</b>. The search may be limited by a number of parameters including, but not limited to, compatibility, proximity, location, and being connected to a vehicle (including any vehicle or a specific vehicle). If an EVSE <b>30</b> is found on the communication network <b>200</b>, the remote device <b>210</b> then will decide whether to connect to the EVSE <b>30</b> (step <b>350</b>). To determine if to connect, the user of the remote device may then select an EVSE <b>30</b> to connect to or the remote device <b>210</b> may automatically connect to the EVSE <b>30</b> as described herein in relation to connecting to a known EVSE <b>30</b>. If the remote device <b>210</b>, or the user, determines to connect to the EVSE <b>30</b>, then the method continue to step <b>370</b>. If the remote device <b>210</b> does not find an EVSE <b>30</b> or determines not to connect to the EVSE <b>30</b>, or the user determines not to connect to the EVSE <b>30</b>, then the method exits at step <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In an alternative embodiment, the remote device <b>210</b> may not search for EVSEs <b>30</b>, and the user of the remote device <b>210</b> may manually enter a command to connect to a specific EVSE <b>30</b>. For example, the EVSE <b>30</b> to which the user wished to connect may be saved on the remote device and the user selects the saved EVSE <b>30</b> for connecting. Alternatively, the EVSE <b>30</b> may have an identifier, such as an alphanumeric string or a MAC address, that the user may enter manually into the remote device <b>210</b>. In yet another embodiment, the user may place the remote device <b>210</b> on or near the EVSE and instruct the remote device <b>210</b> to connect to the EVSE <b>30</b> in close proximity using range dependent technology such as Near Field Communication or Bluetooth.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Once the remote device <b>210</b> has established a connection with the EVSE <b>30</b> (step <b>370</b>), then the remote device <b>210</b> may present a user of the remote device <b>210</b> with various options (step <b>380</b>) for retrieving information from or controlling the EVSE <b>30</b>. The options may be presented on the display <b>220</b> in many forms, and the user may interact with the option via the input device <b>212</b> as discussed herein. The options presented to the user may depend on the organization of the options in the GUI. For example, the organization may be in the form of a menu with top level options and categories that when selected may display related suboptions or subcategories. Alternatively, all of the options may be presented on a single screen or multiple screens which the user may scroll or page through. These option organizations may be varied, combined, or modified in numerous other ways.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The remote device <b>210</b> may then receive an option selection from the user (step <b>390</b>). Upon receiving the option selection, the remote device <b>210</b> may send an instruction to the EVSE <b>30</b> (step <b>400</b>). The instruction sent to the EVSE <b>30</b> may include a variety of commands The commands may include instructions to execute an EVSE function, requests for information, or both. The instructions to execute an EVSE function may include any of the EVSE functions discussed herein, such as: the EVSE charging and charging management functions, the EVSE vehicle and charging monitoring functions, the EVSE vehicle diagnostic functions, the EVSE vehicle control functions, the EVSE safety functions, the EVSE reporting functions, the EVSE maintenance functions, the EVSE utility functions, the EVSE route planning functions, and the EVSE network connection functions. The requests for information may include any information that is available to the EVSE <b>30</b> including, for example: the state of the EVSE <b>30</b> (e.g. on, off, charging, standby, fault/error, (not) connected to a vehicle, etc.); the state of the electric vehicle charging (e.g. charging power level, charging progress and time elapsed and remaining, charging profile, charging settings, charging metrics (i.e. efficiency and cost), charging events (i.e. completed, a certain charging level attained, stopped or interrupted), etc.); the state of the electric vehicle (e.g. vehicle diagnostic information, battery charge level, battery condition, battery temperature during charging, battery life, battery statistics, whether certain vehicle systems and engine are on or off, settings for certain vehicle systems, etc.); information from the electric utility provider (e.g. peak/off-peak times and costs, current costs, usage and savings comparisons, usage statistics, bills, etc.), including home utility providers, such as solar panels, wind turbines, fuel cells, etc.; driving conditions information (e.g. weather, traffic, effect on efficiency of driving the electric vehicle); route planning (e.g. distances, types of roadways, availability of EVSEs <b>30</b> on the way to a destination, electric vehicle driving dynamics for the route (i.e. what to expect in terms of battery usage, ratio of battery usage and other fuel in a hybrid), etc.); EVSE and vehicle manufacturer information and updates (e.g. relevant news, tips, software updates, etc).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Upon receiving a command from the remote device <b>210</b> (step <b>410</b>), the EVSE <b>30</b> executes the command (step <b>420</b>). Executing the command from the remote device <b>210</b> may require that the EVSE <b>30</b> change setting within itself, interact with the connected electric vehicle, or retrieve information from other sources. Often times, executing the commands may result in effects that are not detectable by the user of the remote device <b>210</b>, and other times executing the device may require that information be sent to the remote device <b>210</b>, in either instance the EVSE <b>30</b> should send a confirmation of the completed task to the remote device <b>210</b> (step <b>430</b>). The confirmation may be a message indicating whether a task was completed by the EVSE <b>30</b> or if the EVSE <b>30</b> failed to complete the task. In other instances the confirmation may just be the return of information requested by the remote device <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The remote device <b>210</b> receives the confirmation from the EVSE <b>30</b> (step <b>440</b>) and displays an appropriate message to the user (step <b>450</b>). The message displayed to the user may be textual, graphical, audible, tactile, or a combination of any of these features. For example, if the EVSE <b>30</b> sends a confirmation that charging is complete, the remote device may vibrate and/or make a sound to alert the user of the message that is further being displayed on the display <b>220</b>. The audible portion may also state the contents of the message, such as by stating &#x201c;charge complete.&#x201d; A visual portion of the display may include a textual and/or graphical representation that charging is complete, such as text stating &#x201c;charging complete,&#x201d; or an image of a full battery or full fuel gauge.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">It has been described that a single EVSE <b>30</b> may be connected to multiple electric vehicles at once. Therefore, the method described herein may be implemented such that the option to select one or more of multiple vehicles connected to the EVSE <b>30</b> may be presented to the user and the selection may be received by the remote device <b>210</b> as part of step <b>380</b>. The vehicles may be identified to the user by vehicle specific information, such as any single or combination of make, model, year, VIN, license plate number, etc. Alternatively, a customized tag may be assigned to each vehicle, such as &#x201c;Dad's car,&#x201d; &#x201c;guest,&#x201d; &#x201c;Eleanor,&#x201d; etc. The option selections received by the remote device <b>210</b> and the commands transmitted to the EVSE <b>30</b> will be applied for the vehicle(s) selected by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">It has also been conceived that the remote device <b>210</b> may connect to, control, and receive/retrieve inform from a variety of EVSEs <b>30</b> including those from different manufactures. The remote device <b>210</b> may identify the type of EVSE <b>30</b> and from that type, determine what functionality is available to the remote device <b>210</b>. Further, it has been conceived that the method be executed as part of a preloaded or downloaded smart phone application, or a smart phone app, designed for repeatedly connecting to a specific EVSE <b>30</b>, such that the remote device <b>210</b> connects to the same EVSE <b>30</b> each time the smart phone app is implemented. In such an embodiment, some of the method steps of method for communicating between the EVSE and the remote device <b>300</b> may be not need to be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In one embodiment of the described method, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at any point after establishing a connection (step <b>370</b>) between the remote device <b>210</b> and the EVSE <b>30</b>, the remote device <b>210</b> may receive an alert from the EVSE <b>30</b> (step <b>600</b>). Upon receiving an alert the alert handling module <b>528</b> may identify the communication from the EVSE <b>30</b> as an alert (step <b>610</b>) and format the alert for display (step <b>620</b>) on the remote device <b>210</b>. The alert handling module <b>528</b> may determine if there are options for responding to the alert (step <b>630</b>). Options for responding to the alert may be stored on the remote device <b>210</b> and matched with the alert by the alert handling module <b>528</b>, or they may be part of the alert transmission received from the EVSE <b>30</b>. Once it is determined that there are options for responding to the alert (step <b>630</b>) the alert handling module <b>528</b> may also display the options (step <b>640</b>) to the user of the remote device <b>210</b>. An option selection may be received (step <b>650</b>) by the alert handling module <b>210</b>, and depending on the user's selection, instruct the remote device <b>210</b> to execute an appropriate response to the EVSE <b>30</b> (step <b>660</b>). If, on the other hand, there are no associated options for the alert, the alert handling module may display an option to acknowledge receipt of the alert (step <b>670</b>), receive the acknowledgment of receipt of the alert (<b>680</b>), and return to the previous function prior to receiving the alert (step <b>690</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In another embodiment, the encryption module <b>530</b> may be executed at various points in the methods described herein. The encryption module <b>530</b> may be executed prior to any information being sent from the remote device <b>210</b> to encrypt the information such that only the intended receiving device, such as the EVSE <b>30</b>, may decrypt the information and read it. The encryption module <b>530</b> may also be executed following receipt of any message by the remote device <b>210</b> from any other device, such as the EVSE <b>30</b>. Upon receiving a message, the encryption module <b>530</b> may determine if the received message is encrypted, what sort of encryption has been applied to the message, and may decrypt the message for use by the remote device <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The many features and advantages of the invention are apparent from the detailed specification, and thus, it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention which fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
