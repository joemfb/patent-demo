<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates in general to wellhead assemblies and in particular to a seal for sealing between inner and outer wellhead members.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Seals are used between inner and outer wellhead tubular members to contain internal well pressure. The inner wellhead member may be a casing hanger located in a wellhead housing and that supports a string of casing extending into the well. A seal or packoff seals between the casing hanger and the wellhead housing. The casing hanger could also be the outer wellhead member, with an isolation sleeve as the inner wellhead member. Alternatively, the inner wellhead member could be a tubing hanger that supports a string of tubing extending into the well for the flow of production fluid. The tubing hanger lands in an outer wellhead member, which may be a wellhead housing, a Christmas tree, or a tubing head. A packoff or seal seals between the tubing hanger and the outer wellhead member.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of seals of this nature have been employed in the prior art. Prior art seals include elastomeric and partially metal and elastomeric rings. Prior art seal rings made entirely or partially of metal for forming metal-to-metal seals are also employed. The seals may be set by a running tool, or they may be set in response to the weight of the string of casing or tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">If the bore or surface of the outer wellhead member is damaged, a seal would struggle to maintain a seal. The elastomeric portion can provide additional robustness to the seal to help maintain a seal. In addition, a softer metal on the outer surface of a seal can also be used to fill scratches and surface imperfections on the surfaces of the wellhead members.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A need exists for a technique that addresses the seal leakage as described above. The following technique may solve these problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment of the present technique, a bi-metallic seal assembly for use in subsea oil and gas applications is provided that comprises a metallic U-shaped seal that forms a metal-to-metal seal and has features that increase the reliability of the seal assembly in the event surface degradation or defects in a bore of a wellhead member increases the difficulty of maintaining a seal. The seal assembly also has a softer, lower yield metal at regions on the seal assembly where sealing occurs. The U-shaped seal incorporates tapered faces on its internal slot or pocket and is set (conditioned to seal at low pressure) by a test pressure applied to the seal assembly via an interim or bulk seal coupled to a wedge element that drives the legs of the U-shaped seal apart. The softer, low yield metal on the outer portions of the legs is forced against the surfaces of the wellhead members, causing localized yielding of the low yield metal to fill defects on wellhead member surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The bulk seal is on the primary pressure side and the taper of the legs is acute enough to prevent friction lock to allow seal retrieval. The wedge may be vented to allow fluid to flow as the wedge is forced into the seal pocket and thus avoid hydraulic lock. An additional compressible element may be fitted into the pocket of the U-shaped seal to avoid hydraulic lock. The compressible element could either be in the pocket or in the annulus formed between the interim seal and the metal seal. Axial loads required to push the seal assembly into its annular space between the wellhead members are minimal as only a small amount of radial squeeze, i.e. interference fit, is needed to maintain a sealing contact at low pressure. This also ensures that if the wedging mechanism fails, a seal can be obtained at least on surfaces without defects. Further, two U-shaped seals may be mounted back to back to allow sealing in two directions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The seal assembly is preferably pre-assembled onto an inner wellhead member, such as an isolation sleeve or tubing hanger. The inner wellhead member and seal assembly may then be lowered into an outer wellhead member, such as a wellhead housing, in the same run and the seal set by applying pressure to the bulk seal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the event of bulk seal failure, the U-shaped seal is self-energizing and when pressurized is capable of sealing and filling against damaged annular surfaces of wellhead members. The pocket formed by the legs of each of the U-shaped seals may allow well pressure to act on the inner side of the legs, pushing the legs outward against the outer and inner wellhead members.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The seal assembly can rest on a shoulder formed on the wellhead housing and can be set by pressurizing the annular space between the outer and inner wellhead members to push the seal assembly into place. The combination of the lower yield metal on the exterior of the seal legs, as well as the bulk seal coupled to the wedge, improves sealing in wellhead members having surface degradations.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of the invention shows a seal assembly <b>10</b> located between a portion of an inner wellhead member that may comprise an isolation sleeve or a tubing hanger <b>13</b> having an outer profile and an outer wellhead member that may comprise a wellhead housing, treehead, or casing hanger <b>11</b>. The isolation sleeve or tubing hanger <b>13</b> has a radially extending shoulder <b>16</b>. The shoulder <b>16</b> supports the seal assembly <b>10</b> in this embodiment and provides a reaction point during setting operations. Alternatively, the inner wellhead member <b>13</b> could instead be a plug, safety valve, or other device, and outer wellhead member <b>11</b> could be a tubing spool or a Christmas tree. The annular seal assembly <b>10</b> can be fitted to the isolation sleeve or tubing hanger <b>13</b> via interference with their outer profile and is pre-assembled onto the isolation sleeve or tubing hanger <b>13</b> prior to installation at the well. The seal assembly <b>10</b> and tubing hanger <b>13</b> can be run into the bore of the housing <b>11</b> as one in a single trip with a conventional running tool. If the inner wellhead member is an isolation sleeve, the isolation sleeve <b>13</b> can be lowered into place in a tree.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The seal assembly <b>10</b> is shown in the unset position and comprises a U-shaped metal seal <b>14</b> having legs <b>15</b> that form a U-shaped slot <b>19</b>. In this embodiment, the metal seals <b>14</b> may be bi-metallic, with the body formed out of a higher yield strength metal and a lower yield metal seal bands <b>17</b> forming the areas of sealing contact, such as the tips <b>18</b> of the legs <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an annular energizing ring <b>30</b> is coupled to an interim or bulk seal <b>32</b> at its wider end. The energizing ring <b>30</b> is initially in a run-in position. The energizing ring <b>30</b> may have tapered or conical inner and outer surfaces. During setting, a setting pressure is applied to the seal assembly <b>10</b> via an exposed surface <b>36</b> of the bulk seal <b>32</b> in order to push energizing ring <b>30</b> downward between the legs <b>15</b> of the U-shaped seal <b>14</b>. Energizing ring <b>30</b> creates a radial inward and outward force on seal bands <b>17</b>. In this embodiment, the bulk seal <b>32</b> is on the primary pressure side. The inner surfaces of the legs <b>15</b> of the seal <b>14</b> and the outer surfaces of energizing ring <b>30</b> have a mating taper that is acute enough to prevent energizing ring <b>30</b> from locking in slot <b>19</b>. The acute taper angle allows retrieval of the seal <b>10</b>. A sealed cavity <b>37</b> is defined by the bulk seal <b>32</b> and the seal bands <b>17</b> of the seal <b>14</b>. Energizing ring <b>30</b> may have vents <b>34</b> that traverse the body of the wedge <b>30</b> to allow fluid to flow from cavity <b>37</b> through it as the wedge <b>34</b> is forced into the seal slot <b>19</b>. This prevents hydraulic lock from occurring within the pocket <b>19</b> and the sealed cavity <b>37</b> and thus allows wedge <b>30</b> to travel to thereby set the seal <b>14</b>. A compressible element <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) may also be located within pocket <b>19</b> to further aid in the prevention of hydraulic lock within the pocket <b>19</b> and cavity <b>37</b>. In addition to the sealing provided by bulk seal <b>32</b>, bulk seal <b>32</b> may also perform a wiping function for the metal seal <b>14</b> when energized.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the seal assembly <b>10</b> is shown in the set position. During setting operations, for example, the annulus between the outer wellhead member <b>11</b> and the inner wellhead member <b>13</b> may be pressurized. As explained above, the outer wellhead member <b>11</b> may be a casing hanger and the inner wellhead member <b>13</b> may be a tubing hanger. The applied force from the pressure acts on the exposed surface <b>36</b> of the bulk seal <b>32</b>, is transmitted through the energizing ring <b>30</b> to the seal <b>14</b>, and reacts against the shoulder <b>16</b> on the tubing hanger <b>13</b> to force the energizing ring <b>30</b> into seal slot <b>19</b>. Metal bands <b>17</b> on the outer portions of the legs <b>15</b> touch the surfaces of the wellhead members before any energization takes place. When energizing ring <b>30</b> is inserted into seal slot <b>19</b>, the legs <b>15</b> deflect slightly. Only a minimal axial force is needed to insert the energizing ring <b>30</b> into the seal slot <b>19</b>. The energizing ring <b>30</b> thus does not significantly expand legs <b>15</b> but rather form a solid reacting member and causes more radial force to be applied to seal bands <b>17</b> located on the outer portions of the legs <b>15</b>. The deformation of the legs <b>15</b> is elastic as the force on them does not exceed their yield strength.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The radial force applied by the energizing ring <b>30</b> to the lower yield strength metal bands <b>17</b> causes them to deform outward against the surfaces of, for example, the casing hanger <b>11</b> and tubing hanger <b>13</b>, causing localized yielding in the bands <b>17</b>. Extensive material yielding of the bands <b>17</b> thus occurs during energization. The lower yield strength metal bands <b>17</b> are soft and malleable enough to flow into defects and degradations on the surfaces of the casing hanger <b>11</b> and tubing hanger <b>13</b>. This improves the metal-to-metal seal with the bore of the casing hanger <b>11</b> and the outer surface of the tubing hanger <b>13</b> when set.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the event of bulk seal <b>32</b> failure, the U-shaped seal <b>14</b> is self-energizing and when pressurized is capable of sealing and filling against damaged annular surfaces of wellhead members with the low yield metal <b>17</b>. The slot <b>19</b> formed by the legs <b>15</b> of the U-shaped seals <b>14</b> may allow pressure to act on the inner sides of the legs <b>15</b>, pushing the legs <b>15</b> outward against the outer and inner wellhead members <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The axial loads required to push the seal assembly <b>10</b> into its annular space between the wellhead members <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> are minimal as only a small amount of radial squeeze, i.e. interference fit, is needed to maintain a sealing contact at low pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the seal assembly <b>10</b> may further comprise a compressible element <b>38</b> fitted into the slot <b>19</b> of the U-shaped seal <b>14</b>. The compressible element <b>38</b> shrinks in volume as fluid pressure is applied to it during setting operations, preventing hydraulic lock. In this example, the energizing ring <b>30</b> may also have vents <b>34</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> to aid in the prevention of hydraulic lock.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In yet another embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the seal assembly <b>10</b> may comprise two U-shaped seals <b>14</b> mounted back to back to allow sealing in two directions. In this embodiment, the annulus is pressurized on one side, preferably in the primary direction, of the seal assembly <b>10</b> during setting operations. The pressurization applies a force on the bulk seal <b>34</b> to force the energizing rings <b>30</b> into the seal pockets <b>19</b> of each U-shaped seal <b>14</b>. In the same way as explained for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the legs <b>15</b> of each U-shaped seal <b>14</b> are forced outward against the surfaces of the wellhead housing <b>11</b> and casing hanger <b>13</b>, causing localized yielding in the low yield metal bands <b>17</b> on the outer portion of the legs <b>15</b> to deform against the surfaces of the wellhead members to fill any defects. In this example, the U seals are bidirectional such that the back to back arrangement provides bidirectional sealing (from above and below). Although compressible element <b>38</b> is shown in this embodiment, the compressible element may be omitted. However, location of the compressible elements <b>38</b> within the pockets <b>19</b> is preferred to prevent the potential for hydraulic lock. Vents <b>34</b> formed on the energizing ring <b>30</b> further aid in preventing hydraulic lock within the sealed cavity <b>37</b>, where generated pressure may cause fluid to bypass seal bands <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While the invention has been shown in only one of its forms, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that it is not so limited but is susceptible to various changes without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
