<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treating functional somatic syndromes using combination therapies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fibromyalgia (FM), a common, frequently misdiagnosed systemic disorder that often presents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is generally classified as a functional somatic syndrome (FSS). While patients with myalgia, fatigue and other functional somatic complaints have been recognized in the medical literature for centuries, many physicians believe FM and related FSS to be nothing more than a psychosomatic condition. Skeptics have even challenged the validity of FM as a distinct clinical entity, expressing concern about the subjective nature of chronic pain, the lack of standard laboratory tests and the bias of the tender point (TP) examination. Patients with FM typically experience prolonged periods of pain accompanied by stiffness. Associated symptoms may also include sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, depressive symptoms, headaches, and anxiety. Patients often report the onset of their symptoms after a period of substantial physical and/or emotional stress.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is no gold standard for diagnosing FM and there are currently no laboratory tests to diagnose the disorder. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and physical examination. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of FM require the presence of widespread pain for at least 3 months involving 4 quadrants of the body, as well as pressure pain on palpation in at least 11 of 18 standardized anatomical sites. While the etiology and pathogenesis of the disorder are not clearly understood, a combination of interactions among external stressors, behavioral and psychiatric constructs, neurotransmitters, hormones, immune, and sympathetic nervous systems appears to be involved. The initial diagnosis of FM is usually made between the ages of 20 and 50 years. In the United States, an estimated 2% to 4% of the population is affected by FM. Although women comprise 90% of these patients, FM also occurs in men and children of all ethnic groups.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The overabundance of complaints, coupled with the time constraints of a busy medical practice frequently overwhelms physicians, resulting in frustrated physicians and antagonized patients. Unfortunately, the secret to understanding FM may be to evaluate the entire spectrum of complaints. When coupling FM with CFS and IBS, the array of symptoms and signs is daunting to analyze.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The focus of drug therapy for FM is primarily symptomatic. Traditional treatment is multifaceted and includes anti-epileptic medicines such as pregabalin and gabapentin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has also approved the serotonin and norepinepherine reuptake inhibitors duloxetine hydrochloride and milnacipran hydrochloride, for management of FM.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics and muscle relaxers have also been used in the management of FM.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The common strategy of choice for most physicians is to decrease pain and to increase function without promoting polypharmacy. Unfortunately, ineffective medical treatment and an excess of prescribed drugs often results in a continued deterioration of the patient's health. Thus there is a need for new, more effective treatments for patients suffering from functional somatic syndromes.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">B. Clinical Observations</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The present invention is to be understood as embracing treatment of functional somatic syndromes (FSS), including but not limited to fibromyalgia, as well as pain and associated functional symptoms associated with fibromyalgia. Patients with fibromyalgia were observed to display a variety of symptoms, including but not limited to fatigue, insomnia, depression, allodynia, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, sensitivity to light, numbness and anxiety. Stress often exacerbates the symptoms. While the etiology and pathogenesis of FSS is not clearly understood, a combination of interactions among external stressors, neurotransmitters, hormones, the immune system, and the sympathetic nervous system, appear to be involved.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Earlier studies, evaluating patients with chronic gastrointestinal disorders (W. L. Pridgen and E. Haggard, &#x201c;Biliary and Gastrointestinal Manifestations of the Herpes Simplex Virus, Type I (HSV-I)&#x201d;, http://tuscaloosasurgery.com/pdf/biliary-gastroherpes-simplex-ibs-final-copy.pdf), a spectrum of disorders were observed, including functional somatic syndromes such as fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome. Based on this experience, it is hypothesized that HSV-1 plays a major role in fibromyalgia and related functional somatic syndromes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The worldwide prevalence rate of HSV-1 is reported to be 98%. The primary target cells are epithelial cells of mucocutaneous membranes. In these cells, HSV-1 replicates efficiently and causes cell lysis. Following the initial replication at the site of entry, the virus gains access to the sensory neurons in the nucleus of the nerve cell bodies where it remains in a state known as latency (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Primary infection with HSV-1 generally occurs in childhood or early adolescence following inoculation via the eyes, nose, or oral mucosa, or the genital tract. It is less well known that inoculation can also take place through the GI tract. The virus is then transported to the nerve cell nucleus located in the sensory ganglia. Gesser and Koo demonstrated involvement of the ganglion of the vagus nerve (nodose ganglion). They postulated a potential for apoptotic destruction of the ganglion over time [R. Gesser and S. Koo, J. Virol. 70, 4097-4102 (1996)], [R. Gesser and S. Koo, J. Virol. 71, 4103-4106 (1997)]. Human studies proved the presence of only HSV-1 in the neurons of the mesenteric, submucosal, and periglandular plexuses of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. In these studies the spread was specific to the nerve inoculation site rather than that of the circulatory system. The fibers that originated in the nodose ganglion, ultimately terminated centrally in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) [R. Gesser and S. Koo, J. Virol. 71, 4103-4106 (1997)]. Based on the observed development of erosive esophagitis and gastric ulcers in mice, they noted that these ulcers were not directly infected, but were found to overlie virus-infected enteric ganglia. Gesser and Koo postulated that HSV-1 infection of the enteric nervous system is a causal agent in the pathogenesis of chronic recurrent functional human gastrointestinal disorders [R. Gesser and S. Koo, J. Virol. 70, 4097-4102 (1996)], [R. Gesser and S. Koo, J. Virol. 71, 4103-4106 (1997)].</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Herpes viruses are unique because they remain dormant until conditions are sufficient for a reactivation. The stressors in this process may initiate the synthesis and release of peptides and hormones of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Most viruses in this class rarely reactivate. Only two viruses in this family reactivate often enough to create the milieu needed for a chronic debilitating process. We found no evidence for HSV-2 to be the offending organism as it cycles only once or twice a year. Only HSV-1 cycles frequently enough, on average 4 times a year, yet occasionally as often as monthly, to result in the slowly debilitating illnesses. We theorize that after many reactivations, a neuronal cell body dies due to apoptosis and that the ganglion undergoes destruction in the regions governing the first inoculation site.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The existence of HSV-1 in one or more ganglia may directly or indirectly affect the central nervous system (CNS), hypothalamic pituitary axes (HPA) and immune system (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Dysregulation of pain processing within the CNS may lead to an amplified perception of pain and other sensory stimuli. This phenomenon, often referred to as central sensitization or augmentation, results from changes in the properties of neurons in the CNS where pain is no longer coupled, as acute nociceptive pain is, to the presence, intensity, or duration of noxious peripheral stimuli. Neurotransmitters such as glutamate, Substance P, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), are activated in chronic pain and depression. Substance P, cerebrospinal fluid levels and serum concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor have been consistently higher in patients with fibromyalgia compared with controls. Patients with fibromyalgia also have an abnormal dopamine response to pain. Recent data suggest a putative role of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF&#x3b1;), IL-6 and IL-8, in the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia and the modulation of symptoms [M. DiFranco, et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1193(1), 84-90 (2010)]. Hence pain, as the defining characteristic of fibromyalgia, is not due to tissue damage or inflammation and is thus fundamentally different from rheumatic disorders and many other pain conditions as these conditions cause inflammation in the joints and tissues. HSV-1 has developed various immune evasion mechanisms which prove to be a particular challenge for the immune system. Cytokines and cytokine-induced genes are important for the ability of any organism to raise an antiviral response. Understanding the immune mediators and their possible role in fibromyalgia may be the most daunting obstacles in understanding the disorder. Gur and Oktayoglu [A. Gur and P. Oktayoglu, Curr. Pain Headache Rep. 12(3), 175-181 (2008)] explain how cytokines related to acute or repetitive tissue injuries may be responsible for long-term activation of spinal cord glia and dorsal horn neurons, thus resulting in central sensitization. The immune system responds to stressors by causing certain immune cells to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-6. Both cytokines are involved in inflammation, and IL-6 is thought to worsen the symptoms of autoimmune disease and fibromyalgia [L. Vanderhaeghe, Total Health 23, 34-35 (2001)].</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">IL-6 and TNF&#x3b1; are increased in autoimmune disorders, osteoporosis, over-exercise, fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis [A. Gur, et al., J. Rheumatol. 29, 358-361 (2002)]. The neuroendocrine system (NS) and cytokines also figure in the course of fibromyalgia. The NS responds to stress by activating the HPA-axis. Individuals who have reduced HPA-axis activity often have symptoms of fatigue, depressed mood, myalgias and disturbed sleep. Increased glucocorticoid levels may be related to reduced fatigue and increased wellbeing and energy. Stimulation of the hypothalamus with IL-6 showed delayed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) responsiveness in fibromyalgia [D. Torpy, et al., Arthritis Rheum. 43, 872-880 (2000)]. Cytokines, such as IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF&#x3b1; have been shown to contribute directly to central and peripheral neuropathic pain [D. Wallace, Curr. Pharm. Des. 12, 17-22 (2006)].</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Fibromyalgia patients often have little motivation to eat, are listless, complain of fatigue and malaise, lose interest in social activities, and have significant changes in sleep patterns. They also are unable to experience pleasure, have exaggerated responses to pain and cannot concentrate. In patients with fibromyalgia, the level of pain intensity can be related to the spinal fluid level of arginine a precursor to nitric oxide [K. Kelley, et al., Brain Behav. Immun. 17, 5112-5118 (2003)]. Wallace postulated that activation of glial cells in the brain and spinal cord by substances known to be involved with chronic pain leads to release of IL-1, IL-6, nerve growth factor, NMDA, and Substance P which further perpetuates pain and flu-like symptoms [D. Wallace, Curr. Pharm. Des. 12, 17-22 (2006)].</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">There are lower levels of IL-4 and IL-10 in patients with chronic pain. Chronic pain (dull, aching, or burning) is believed to be transmitted through unmyelinated C fibers to dorsal horn nociceptive neurons. The synapses use glutamate as a neurotransmitter. Nitric oxide promotes the exaggerated release of excitatory amino acids and Substance P from presynaptic afferent terminals and causes the dorsal horn to become hyper-excitable [K. Kelley, et al., Brain Behav. Immun. 17, 5112-5118 (2003)].</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Nociception, neural processing of noxious stimuli, is also thought to play a role in fibromyalgia (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The locus coeruleus is a nucleus in the brain stem involved in mediating sympathetic effects during stress, specifically the synthesis and release of norepinephrine. Fibromyalgia patients are much more sensitive to windup pain, which increases with repetitive stimuli. The locus coeruleus also innervates the amygdala, involved in the emotional processing of pain. This nucleus also innervates the hypothalamus, activating the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, stimulating secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor causing release of adrenocorticotropic hormone from the anterior pituitary, increasing cortisol synthesis in the adrenal glands.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Growth hormone deficiency has also been observed in some fibromyalgia patients. Since some symptoms of growth hormone deficiency are similar to those observed in fibromyalgia (e.g., fatigue, depression, muscle weakness, impaired memory) it is believed that growth hormone deficiency may contribute to the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia. Defective growth hormone secretion in fibromyalgia patients may result from increased release of somatostatin by the hypothalamus.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Various studies confirm that isoforms of COX-1 and COX-2 are critical for efficient viral replication. In one study Ray and Enquist showed that simultaneous inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 caused a dramatic reduction of viral yield after HSV-1 infection [N. Ray and L. Enquist, J. Virol. 78, 3489-3501 (2004)]. Hill, et al., used microarrays to analyze gene expression in the trigeminal ganglion of mice infected with latent HSV-1, and found COX-2 gene expression significantly up regulated after reactivation [J. Hill, et al., Virus Genes 23, 273-280 (2001)]. Gebhardt reported that the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib can suppress hyperthermic stress-induced herpes viral reactivation in the nervous system of mice [B. Gebhardt, et al., J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 21, 114-120 (2005)].</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Functional somatic syndromes (FSS) may be defined as conditions &#x201c;characterized by patterns of persistent bodily complaints for which adequate examination does not reveal sufficiently explanatory structural or other specified pathology&#x201d; [P. Henningsen, et al. (2007) Lancet 369, 946-954]. A diverse number of conditions are commonly described as FSS, including: fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, premenstrual syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, chronic pain, chronic pelvic pain, hypoglycemia, low back pain, sick building syndrome, Gulf War syndrome, tension headache, tempo-mandibular joint disorder, repetitive strain injury, multiple chemical sensitivity, interstitial cystitis, chronic Lyme disease, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic anxiety disorder, food hypersensitivity and brain fog or cognitive dysfunction.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Despite the broad range of FSS conditions, these disease states may have a common etiology, rather than being distinct syndromes. Wessely and colleagues concluded on the basis of a literature review that there was substantial overlap between these conditions and that their similarities were greater than their differences, proposing the concept of a general functional somatic syndrome [S. Wessely, et al. (1999) Lancet 354, 936-939].</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">A common etiology for FSS was also explored by Bland, who pointed out that when the allostatic load, the combined external and internal stress, exceeds the ability of the patient to maintain allostasis, alterations in function occur giving rise to symptomatic FSS [J. Bland (2008) Alt. Therapies 14, 14-16.]</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The rationale for the combination therapy described herein, where it is hypothesized that HSV-1 plays a major causal role in fibromyalgia and other FSS, is based in part on the discovery that the combination of an antiviral compound and a COX-2 inhibitor will increase efficacy in the treatment of these conditions (see Example A).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Additional support for the concept that HSV-1 is a common etiological stressor that gives rise to FSS is provided in the following biopsy studies:</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Study Protocol I: HSV-1 DNA and EM Analysis of Human Gastrointestinal Mucosa</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Study Purpose:</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A number of gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are frequently co-morbid with functional somatic syndromes (FSS) such as but not limited to fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. We hypothesize that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) plays a major role in the chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders associated with FSS. This study uses virus-specific DNA amplification/sequencing, herpesvirus-specific antibodies to demonstrate active infection (immunoblot) and electron microscopy (EM) to demonstrate the presence of the virus in GI biopsies from chronically ill patients who present with both fibromyalgia and an associated GI disorder.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Study Procedure:</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In ongoing studies, GI specimens (biopsies) were collected from fibromyalgia patients who are undergoing their routine endoscopic work-up for GI disease. Test samples were obtained from patients that present with both GI disease and fibromyalgia. The specimens were divided, with one part used for medical/diagnostic purposes (sent to pathology) and the other part used for this study.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with universal herpesvirus primers were used to amplify any herpesvirus DNA present in the biopsy samples. Herpesvirus DNA was sequenced to determine which herpesvirus was present in the tissue samples. Quantitative PCR using primers specific to the identified herpesvirus was performed to measure and compare the infection levels in test and control samples. Using an antibody specific to a herpesvirus protein produced in infected cells, immunoblot assays were done to determine whether active infection was underway in the biopsied tissue at the time of collection. In subsequent studies, electron microscopy will be performed to reveal the presence of herpesvirus particles in the tissue samples.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The study population includes both men and women ages 19-75 years that suffer from chronic gastrointestinal illnesses. These illnesses include, but are not limited to GERD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), colonic inertia, gastroparesis, gastritis, recurrent pancreatitis, and peptic ulcer disease.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Results: 19 fibromyalgia patient tissue biopsies have been tested for the presence of herpesvirus DNA. All but one (18 out of 19 samples) were found to contain herpesvirus DNA. In analyzing the sequences of the herpesvirus DNA found in these 18 samples, all contained only HSV-1 DNA (no other herpesvirus DNA was present). The presence of HSV-1 DNA in the tissue samples is a strong indicator of HSV-1 infection.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">It is possible that HSV-1 DNA could be present in a tissue sample without active infection due to the presence of HSV-1 virus particles passing through the GI tract of the patient at the time of biopsy collection. Although this is unlikely to have occurred in all 18 samples that were positive for HSV-1 DNA, a more definitive test was performed for the presence of active HSV-1 infection in the tissue samples collected. In this test, an immunoblot is performed using an antibody specific to a viral protein (ICP8) that is present in virally infected cells, but is not present in free virus particles. Of the 9 positive biopsies examined with immunoblot, 8 were positive for the presence of ICP8, showing active HSV-1 infection was occurring in the GI tracts of these patients at the time of biopsy collection.</p>

<p id="p-0230" num="0232">1. Fibromyalgia-1990 ACR Diagnostic Criteria:</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0233">Pain on both sides of the body, above and below the waist In addition, axial skeletal pain (cervical spine, anterior chest, thoracic spine or low back pain) must be present. Pain in 11 of 18 tender point sites on digital palpation Digital palpation should be performed with an approximate force of 4 kg.

<p id="p-0233" num="0236">IBS is diagnosed when a person has abdominal pain or discomfort at least three times per month for the last 3 months without other disease or injury that could explain the pain. The pain or discomfort of IBS may occur with a change in stool frequency or consistency or may be relieved by a bowel movement.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0237">To meet the definition of IBS, the pain or discomfort should be associated with two of the following three symptoms:

<p id="p-0256" num="0313">Cognitive dysfunction or impairment, also referred to as brain fog or mental fog, is the loss of intellectual functions (such as thinking, remembering, and reasoning) of sufficient severity to interfere with daily functioning. Patients with cognitive dysfunction have trouble with verbal recall, basic arithmetic, and concentration.</p>

<p id="p-0262" num="0319">9. Chronic Pain</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0320">Chronic pain generally refers to persistent, non-acute, sometimes disabling pain in the extremities or other areas of the body. The pain can be associated with a known cause such as a major or minor injury, or it can be a symptom of a painful chronic condition such as fibromyalgia. It can just as often be of unknown origin. The term chronic pain can refer to pain that has been present for an arbitrarily defined period, for example, longer than 6 months. Alternatively, the term &#x201c;chronic pain&#x201d; is often used as a synonym for the term &#x201c;chronic pain syndrome,&#x201d; a descriptive term used to indicate persistent pain, subjective symptoms in excess of objective findings, associated dysfunctional pain behaviors, and self-limitation in activities of daily living. Chronic pain syndrome (CPS) is the presentation of combined physical and psychological changes due to chronic pain.

<heading id="h-0021" level="1">Human Clinical Trial Protocol (PRID-201)</heading>
<p id="p-0268" num="0332">TITLE: A Double-Blinded, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Proof of Concept Phase 2a Study Exploring the Safety and Efficacy of an Antiviral Drug (Famciclovir or Aciclovir)+a COX-2 Inhibitor (Celecoxib, Meloxicam or Diclofenac) in the Treatment of Patients with Fibromyalgia.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0333">OBJECTIVE: To explore the safety and efficacy of the combination of an antiviral drug (famciclovir or aciclovir)+a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib, meloxicam or diclofenac) vs. placebo in the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM).</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0334">Study Design:</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0335">Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an antiviral drug (famciclovir or aciclovir) and a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib, meloxicam or diclofenac) combination for the treatment of FM patients. During the first week of treatment, a loading dose of the antiviral drug (famciclovir or aciclovir) (2&#xd7; maintenance dose) twice a day (BID) will be employed, followed by 15 weeks of maintenance dose of the antiviral drug (famciclovir or aciclovir) BID. Depending on the patient population of the study group, use of a loading dose greater than 1000 mg/day is optional. The COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib, meloxicam or diclofenac) dosage (also BID) will remain constant throughout the 16 weeks of active treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0336">Patients will be randomized to treatment with either combination therapy or placebo.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0337">Qualified patients will have primary FM (defined by the 2010 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for FM [Wolfe, et al. (2010) Arthritis Care &#x26; Res. 62(5), 600-610], and an absence of other sources of significant pain related to systemic auto-immune diseases, structural or traumatic rheumatic conditions, or other conditions that could compromise the interpretation of study results.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0338">Patients will undergo initial screening procedures, after which they proceed with the washout of excluded medications, if required. Patients dependent upon opioids or narcotics for pain control should not be enrolled in the study.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0339">Due to the COX-2 inhibitor component (celecoxib, meloxicam or diclofenac), patients will discontinue regular use of all other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the time of randomization. Acetaminophen may be utilized throughout the study at doses not to exceed 3250 mg per day. Patients may also continue low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (&#x3c;325 mg/day), triptans and ergotamines for migraine, and dopaminergic agents for restless leg syndrome, as well as muscle relaxants, sleeping aids and benzodiazepines (assuming no evidence of abuse or dependency). Tramadol may be utilized as a rescue therapy for severe flares of FM or other acutely painful conditions (e.g., injury; procedure-related pain). Tramadol should not be taken within 48 hours of the Week 2, 6 and 12 study visits, or within 7 days of the Baseline and Week 16 visits.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0340">Metabolic profiles of each patient's concomitant medications should be assessed to ensure there is no risk of significant drug-drug interactions with either drug. For drugs that are metabolized by CYP2C9, the concomitant use of fluconazole&#x2014;a potent CYP2C9 inhibitor&#x2014;should be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0341">Patients will not be allowed to take duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin and sodium oxybate during the trial, and a seven day washout interval prior to randomization is required. In addition, to qualify for the study, each patient's 24 hour recall pain score must be between 40 and 90 on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) at the screening visit and between 4 and 9 on a numerical rating scale (NRS) at the Baseline visit.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0342">After ensuring that all entry criteria have been satisfied and washout successfully completed, patients will return for baseline assessments and randomization. The day of the baseline assessments will be referred to as Day 0; patients will initiate study drug either with the evening dose on Day 0 or the morning dose on the following day (Day 1), continuing with BID treatment for the duration of the study.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0343">Blood will be collected at the screening visit for safety assessments and for exploratory cytokine analyses (e.g., IL-1&#x3b2;, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#x3b1;, IFN-&#x3b1;, IFN-&#x3b2;, IFN-&#x3b3;). A second sample for cytokine analyses will also be obtained at the Baseline/randomization visit. Follow-up blood sampling for safety and cytokine analyses will take place at the Week 6 and 16 visits (or at the time of early termination). A standard urinalysis panel will be included as part of the safety labs collected at screening, Week 6 and Week 16.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0344">Study drugs will be over-encapsulated to maintain the double-blind, and active and placebo patients will receive identical-appearing supplies of study drug. Study drug will be provided in 2-week bottles; therefore, patients will receive 1, 2, or 3 separate bottles of each drug (or matching placebo) at every study visit, depending on the number of weeks until the next scheduled visit. For the first week only, the patient will receive a third bottle which contains additional antiviral drug (famciclovir or aciclovir) to provide a one week loading dose. Patients will take one capsule BID (with meals) from each of the 3 bottles assigned for the first week, followed by one capsule BID from each of the 2 bottles provided for subsequent weeks. Patients will receive study drug treatment for a total of 16 weeks, with study visits during the active treatment phase of the study scheduled for Weeks 2, 6, 12 and 16, or early termination (ET).</p>

Specifically, studies will be employed to determine the contributions of the individual drugs used in combination. By way of example, a four-arm factorial study design may be used to compare results from the combination therapy to individual components and placebo (e.g., A+B v. A v. B v. placebo). These comparative studies, when done subsequent to the dose-ranging studies described herein, will utilize doses that produced the best results, while comparative studies done simultaneously may utilize multiple doses, possibly favoring the higher range of doses.</p>
