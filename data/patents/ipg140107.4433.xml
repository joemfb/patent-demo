<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a network architecture of an Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (E-UMTS). The E-UMTS is an evolved form of the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) UMTS and has been standardized in the 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). Generally, the E-UMTS may be called a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system. For details of the technical specifications of the UMTS and E-UMTS, refer to Release 7 and Release 8 of &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the E-UMTS mainly includes a User Equipment (UE) <b>120</b>, base stations (or eNBs or eNode Bs) <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b</i>, and an Access Gateway (AG) which is located at an end of a network (E-UTRAN) and which is connected to an external network. Generally, an eNB can simultaneously transmit multiple data streams for a broadcast service, a multicast service and/or a unicast service. One or more cells may exist per eNB. The cell is set to use a bandwidth such as 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 or 20 MHz to provide a downlink or uplink transmission service to UEs. Different cells may be set to provide different bandwidths. The eNB controls data transmission or reception of a plurality of UEs. The eNB transmits downlink (DL) scheduling information with respect to DL data so as to inform a corresponding UE of time/frequency region for data, coding scheme, data size, and Hybrid Automatic Repeat and reQest (HARQ)-related information. In addition, the eNB transmits uplink (UL) scheduling information with respect to UL data to a corresponding UE so as to inform the UE of an available time/frequency domain, coding, data size and HARQ-related information. An interface for transmitting user traffic or control traffic can be used between eNBs. A Core Network (CN) may include the AG and a network node or the like for user registration of the UE. The AG manages mobility of a UE on a Tracking Area (TA) basis. One TA includes a plurality of cells.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although wireless communication technology has been developed up to Long Term Evolution (LTE) based on Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), the demands and the expectations of users and providers continue to increase. In addition, since other radio access technologies have been continuously developed, new technology evolution is required to secure high competitiveness in the future. Decrease in cost per bit, increase in service availability, flexible use of a frequency band, simple structure, open interface, suitable User Equipment (UE) power consumption and the like are required.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The standardization of the subsequent technology of the LTE is ongoing in the 3GPP. In the present specification, the above-described technology is called &#x201c;LTE-Advanced&#x201d; or &#x201c;LTE-A&#x201d;. The LTE system and the LTE-A system are different from each other in terms of system bandwidth. The LTE-A system aims to support a wideband of a maximum of 100 MHz. The LTE-A system uses carrier aggregation or bandwidth aggregation technology which achieves the wideband using a plurality of frequency blocks. The carrier aggregation enables the plurality of frequency blocks to be used as one large logical frequency band in order to use a wider frequency band. The bandwidth of each of the frequency blocks may be defined based on the bandwidth of a system block used in the LTE system. Each frequency block is transmitted using a component carrier. In the present specification, the component carrier may indicate a frequency block for carrier aggregation or a center carrier of a frequency block according to context, and the frequency block for carrier aggregation and the central carrier of the frequency block may be used together.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">BEST MODE</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The configuration, operation and other features of the present invention will be understood by the embodiments of the present invention described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following embodiments are examples of applying the technical features of the present invention to a 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) system.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Hereinafter, a system using a single frequency block as a system band is called a legacy system or a narrowband system. Meanwhile, a system including a plurality of frequency blocks in its system band and using one or more frequency blocks as a system block of a legacy system is called an evolved system or a wideband system. The frequency block used as the block of the legacy system has the same size as the system block of the legacy system. In contrast, the sizes of residual frequency blocks are not specially limited. However, for system simplicity, the sizes of the residual frequency blocks may be determined based on the size of the system block of the legacy system. For example, a 3GPP LTE (Release-8) system and a 3GPP LTE-A (Release-9) system are in relationship of a legacy system and an evolved system.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Based on the above definition, in the present specification, the 3GPP LTE (Release-8) system is referred to as an LTE system or a legacy system. In addition, a User Equipment (UE) which supports the LTE system is referred to as an LTE UE or a legacy UE. The 3GPP LTE-A (Release-9) system is referred to as an LTE-A system or an evolved system. In addition, a UE which supports the LTE-A system is referred to as an LTE-A UE or an evolved UE.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although, for convenience, the embodiments of the present invention are described using the LTE system and the LTE-A system in the present specification, the embodiments of the present invention are applicable to any communication system corresponding to the above definition. In addition, although the embodiments of the present invention are described based on a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) scheme in the present specification, the embodiments of the present invention may be easily modified and applied to a Half-Duplex FDD (H-FDD) scheme or a Time Division Duplex (TDD) scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a control plane and a user plane of a radio interface protocol between a UE and an Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) based on a 3GPP radio access network standard. The control plane refers to a path used for transmitting control messages, which are used for managing a call between the UE and the network. The user plane refers to a path used for transmitting data generated in an application layer, e.g., voice data or Internet packet data.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A physical (PHY) layer of a first layer provides an information transfer service to an upper layer using a physical channel. The PHY layer is connected to a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer on an upper layer via a transport channel. Data is transported between the MAC layer and the PHY layer via the transport channel. Data is also transported between a physical layer of a transmitting side and a physical layer of a receiving side via a physical channel. The physical channel uses a time and a frequency as radio resources. In detail, the physical channel is modulated using an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheme in downlink and is modulated using a Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) scheme in uplink.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer of a second layer provides a service to a Radio Link Control (RLC) layer of an upper layer via a logical channel. The RLC layer of the second layer supports reliable data transmission. The function of the RLC layer may be implemented by a functional block within the MAC. A Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer of the second layer performs a header compression function to reduce unnecessary control information for efficient transmission of an Internet Protocol (IP) packet such as an IPv4 packet or an IPv6 packet in a radio interface having a relatively narrow bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer located at the bottom of a third layer is defined only in the control plane and is responsible for control of logical, transport, and physical channels in association with configuration, re-configuration, and release of Radio Bearers (RBs). The RB is a service that the second layer provides for data communication between the UE and the network. To accomplish this, the RRC layer of the UE and the RRC layer of the network exchange RRC messages. The UE is in an RRC connected mode if an RRC connection has been established between the RRC layer of the radio network and the RRC layer of the UE. Otherwise, the UE is in an RRC idle mode. A Non-Access Stratum (NAS) layer located above the RRC layer performs functions such as session management and mobility management.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">One cell of the eNB is set to use a bandwidth such as 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 or 20 MHz to provide a downlink or uplink transmission service to UEs. Different cells may be set to provide different bandwidths.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Downlink transport channels for transmission of data from the network to the UE include a Broadcast Channel (BCH) for transmission of system information, a Paging Channel (PCH) for transmission of paging messages, and a downlink Shared Channel (SCH) for transmission of user traffic or control messages. User traffic or control messages of a downlink multicast or broadcast service may be transmitted through a downlink SCH and may also be transmitted through a downlink multicast channel (MCH). Uplink transport channels for transmission of data from the UE to the network include a Random Access Channel (RACH) for transmission of initial control messages and an uplink SCH for transmission of user traffic or control messages. Logical channels, which are located above the transport channels and are mapped to the transport channels, include a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), a Paging Control Channel (PCCH), a Common Control Channel (CCCH), a Multicast Control Channel (MCCH), and a Multicast Traffic Channel (MTCH).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing physical channels used in a 3GPP system and a general signal transmission method using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A UE performs an initial cell search operation such as synchronization with an eNB when power is turned on or the UE enters a new cell (S<b>301</b>). The UE may receive a Primary Synchronization Channel (P-SCH) and a Secondary Synchronization Channel (S-SCH) from the eNB, perform synchronization with the eNB, and acquire information such as a cell ID. Thereafter, the UE may receive a physical broadcast channel from the eNB so as to acquire broadcast information within the cell. Meanwhile, the UE may receive a Downlink Reference Signal (DL RS) so as to confirm a downlink channel state in the initial cell search step.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The UE which completes the initial cell search may receive a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) and a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) according to information included in the PDCCH so as to acquire more detailed system information (S<b>302</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Meanwhile, if the eNB is initially accessed or radio resources for signal transmission are not present, the UE may perform a Random Access Procedure (RACH) (step S<b>303</b> to S<b>306</b>) with respect to the eNB. In this case, the UE may transmit a specific sequence through a Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) as a preamble (S<b>303</b> and S<b>305</b>), and receive a response message of the preamble through the PDCCH and the PDSCH corresponding thereto (S<b>304</b> and S<b>306</b>). In the case of contention-based RACH, a contention resolution procedure may be further performed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The UE which performs the above procedures may perform PDCCH/PDSCH reception (S<b>307</b>) and Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)/Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) transmission (S<b>308</b>) as a general uplink/downlink signal transmission procedure. The control information transmitted from the UE to the eNB in uplink or transmitted from the eNB to the UE in downlink includes a downlink/uplink ACK/NACK signal, a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI), a Precoding Matrix Index (PMI), a Rank Indicator (RI), and the like. In the case of the 3GPP LTE system, the UE may transmit the control information such as CQI/PMI/RI through the PUSCH and/or the PUCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing the architecture of a radio frame used in Long Term Evolution (LTE).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the radio frame has a length of 10 ms (327200&#xb7;T<sub>s</sub>) and includes 10 subframes with the same size. Each of the subframes has a length of 1 ms and includes two slots. Each of the slots has a length of 0.5 ms (15360&#xb7;T<sub>s</sub>). T<sub>s </sub>denotes a sampling time, and is represented by T<sub>s</sub>=1/(15 kHz&#xd7;2048)=3.2552&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>(about 33 ns). Each slot includes a plurality of OFDM symbols in a time domain, and includes a plurality of resource blocks (RBs) in a frequency domain. In the LTE system, one RB includes 12 subcarriers&#xd7;7(6) OFDM symbols. A Transmission Time Interval (TTI) which is a unit time for transmission of data may be determined in units of one or more subframes. The architecture of the radio frame is only exemplary and the number of subframes included in the radio frame, the number of slots included in the subframe, or the number of OFDM symbols included in the slot may be variously changed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing the architecture of a downlink radio frame.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the downlink radio frame includes 10 subframes with the same length. In the 3GPP LTE system, the subframe is defined as the basic time unit of packet scheduling with respect to an overall downlink frequency. Each subframe is divided into a time interval for transmission of scheduling information and other control information (control region) and a time interval for transmission of downlink data (data region). The control region starts from a first OFDM symbol of the subframe and includes one or more OFDM symbols. The size of the control region may be independently set for each subframe. The control region is used to transmit an L1/L2 (layer 1/layer 2) control signal. The data region is used to transmit downlink traffic.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the subframe is composed of 14 OFDM symbols. According to the configuration of the subframe, the first one to three OFDM symbols are used as the control region and the remaining 13 to 11 OFDM symbols are used as the data region. In the drawing, R<b>1</b> to R<b>4</b> denote Reference Signals (RS) (or pilot signals) of antennas <b>0</b> to <b>3</b>. The RS is fixed within the subframe with a constant pattern regardless of the control region and the data region. Control channels are resources, to which the RSs are not allocated, in the control region, and traffic channels are allocated to resources, to which the RSs are not allocated, in the data region. The control channels include a Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH), a Physical Hybrid-ARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH), a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The PCFICH informs the UE of the number of OFDM symbols used in the PDCCH for each subframe. The PCFICH is located at a first OFDM symbol and is set prior to the PHICH and the PDCCH. The PCFICH is composed of four Resource Element Groups (REGs), and the REGs are distributed within the control region based on a cell Identity (ID). One REG is composed of four Resource Elements (REs). The RE refers to a minimum physical resource defined by one subcarrier&#xd7;one OFDM symbol. The architecture of the REG will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The PCFICH value indicates a value of 1 to 3 or 2 to 4 according to a bandwidth and is modulated using a Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The PHICH is used to transfer a HARQ ACK/NACK signal linked to uplink transmission. That is, the PHICH refers to a channel used for transmitting DL ACK/NACK information for UL HARQ. The PHICH is composed of one REG and is scrambled on cell-specific basis. The ACK/NACK signal is indicated by 1 bit and is modulated using a Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) scheme. The modulated ACK/NACK signal is spread using a Spreading Factor (SF) of 2 or 4. A plurality of PHICHs mapped to the same resources configures a PHICH group. The number of PHICHs multiplexed in the PHICH group is determined according to the number of spreading codes. The PHICH (group) is repeated three times in order to obtain a diversity gain in a frequency domain and/or a time domain.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The PDCCH is allocated to first n OFDM symbols of the subframe. Here, n is an integer of 1 or more and is indicated by the PCFICH. The PDCCH is composed of one or more Control Channel Elements (CCEs), which will be described later in detail. The PDCCH informs UEs or a UE group of information associated with resource allocation of a Paging Channel (PCH) and a Downlink-Shared Channel (DL-SCH) of a transport channel, Uplink scheduling Grant, HARQ information or the like. The PCH and the DL-SCH are transmitted through the PDSCH. Accordingly, the eNB and the UE generally transmit and receive data through the PDSCH except for specific control information or specific service data. Information indicating to which UE (one or a plurality of UEs) the data of the PDSCH is transmitted and how UEs receive and decode the data of the PDSCH is transmitted through the PDCCH. For example, it is assumed that a specific PDCCH is CRC-masked with a Radio Network Temporary Identity (RNTI) &#x201c;A&#x201d;, and information about data transmitted using radio resource (e.g., frequency location) &#x201c;B&#x201d; and transmission format information (e.g., transmission block size, modulation scheme, coding information, or the like) &#x201c;C&#x201d; is transmitted via a specific subframe. In this case, a UE located within a cell monitors a PDCCH using its own RNTI information, and if one or more UEs having &#x201c;A&#x201d; RNTI are present, the UEs receive the PDCCH and receive the PDSCH indicated by &#x201c;B&#x201d; and &#x201c;C&#x201d; through the information about the received PDCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing a resource unit used for configuring a control channel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the case where the number of transmission antennas is 1 or 2 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the case where the number of transmission antennas is 4, which are different from each other in only an RS pattern according to the number of transmission antennas, but are equal to each other in a method of setting a resource unit associated with the control channel. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the REG which is the basic resource unit of the control channel is composed of four neighbor REs in a state of excluding the RS. The REG is denoted by a thick line in the drawing. The PCFICH and the PHICH include four REGs and three REGs, respectively. The PDCCH is composed of CCE units and one CCE includes 9 REGs.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The UE is set to confirm M (L) (&#x2267;L) CCEs which are arranged consecutively or according to a specific rule in order to determine whether a PDCCH composed of L CCEs is transmitted to the UE. The value L which is considered when the UE receives the PDCCH may be plural. A set of CCEs which should be confirmed when the UE receives the PDCCH is referred to as a PDCCH search space. For example, in the LTE system, the PDCCH search space is defined as shown in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">L denotes the number of CCEs configuring the PDCCH, S<sub>k</sub><sup>(L) </sup>denotes the PDCCH search space, and M<sup>(L) </sup>denotes the number of PDCCH candidates to be monitored in the search space.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The PDCCH search space may be divided into a UE-specific search space in which access is allowed for only a specific UE and a common search space in which access is allowed for all UEs within a cell. The UE monitors the common search space at L=4 and 8 and monitors the UE-specific search space at L=1, 2, 4 and 8. The common search space and the UE-specific search space may overlap each other.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, the location of a first CCE (having a smallest index) in the PDCCH search space applied to a certain UE with respect to each value L is changed according to the UEs for each subframe. This is referred to as PDCCH search space hashing.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Hereinafter, a method of efficiently transmitting a signal in a wideband system will be described. To facilitate description, the method will be described using a method of transmitting a HARQ ACK/NACK signal. A downlink transmission method of an ACK/NACK signal will first be described and an uplink transmission method of an ACK/NACK signal will then be described. The following examples may be advantageously applied to the case where a wireless communication system is in an asymmetric carrier aggregation state.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">PHICH Allocation Scheme</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the 3GPP LTE system, the PHICH is transmitted through the first m (m&#x2267;1) OFDM symbols of the subframe. The PDCCH is transmitted through the remaining REs except for REs used for transmitting the control signals such as the PHICH and the PCFICH within the first n (m&#x2266;n) OFDM symbols of the subframe. Accordingly, the UE should check how PHICHs are mapped to subframes in order to receive scheduling information through the PDCCHs of the subframes. The mapping of the PHICHs to the subframes of the cells is determined according to two factors including the number of PHICHs existing in the subframes, N, and the number of OFDM symbols to which the PHICHs are mapped in the subframes, m. Accordingly, the UE should identify the values N and m in order to receive the PDCCHs of the subframes.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In particular, when the UE attempts initial access to a cell, the UE obtains basic system information such as a system bandwidth of the cell. Thereafter, the UE obtains detailed system information through a PDSCH which is used for transmitting general downlink data. Scheduling information of the PDSCH is transmitted through the PDCCH. That is, the UE which performs the initial access receives a PDCCH of a specific subframe after receiving a Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH), identifies scheduling information of the PDSCH used for transmitting the detailed system information through the PDCCH, and receives the PDSCH so as to identify the detailed system information. Accordingly, since the UE which attempts the initial access should identify the values N and m before obtaining the detailed system information through the PDSCH, the values N and m are included in the basic system information of the PBCH.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows an example of PHICH transmission in a single component carrier condition. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, one DL component carrier and one UL component carrier are present and correspond to each other so as to set a PHICH mapping relationship between the UL component carrier and the DL component carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the UE transmits data to the eNB through the PUSCH in uplink, and the eNB transmits an ACK/NACK signal of the data to the UE through the PHICH in downlink. In the transmission structure of the PHICH, a 1-bit ACK/NACK signal is modulated using the BPSK scheme and is then multiplexed using a Code Division Multiplexing scheme so as to be transmitted. In detail, the ACK/NACK signal is In-phase/Quadrature-phase (I/Q)-multiplexed with SF=4 in a subframe using a normal Cyclic Prefix (CP), and is I/Q-multiplexed with SF=2 in a subframe using an extended CP. Since the PHICH is repeated three times, in the normal CP, eight PHICHs configure one PHICH group, which is then transmitted through a total of 12 REs with a pattern, in which four REs are repeated three times. Similarly, in the extended CP, four PHICHs configure one PHICH group, which is then transmitted through a total of six REs with a pattern, in which two REs are repeated three times.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Meanwhile, since the number of users is changed according to the system bandwidth and the PHICH is a reception response of the uplink data, the number of PHICHs needs to be variably set according to an uplink system bandwidth. However, since the uplink system bandwidth can be identified after receiving the detailed system information through the PDSCH, the uplink system bandwidth cannot be used to determine the number of PHICHs, N. Accordingly, the LTE system sets the number of PHICHs, N, based on a downlink system bandwidth. In detail, the eNB signals a ratio N<sub>g </sub>to the overall downlink bandwidth, and the number of PHICH groups N<sub>PHICH</sub><sup>group </sup>is determined by Equation 1.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">N<sub>g </sub>is signaled by selecting one of four values of {&#x2159;, &#xbd;, 1, 2}. For example, if the system bandwidth includes 25 RBs and uses the normal CP, the N<sub>PHICH</sub><sup>group </sup>becomes {1, 2, 4, 7} and the value N becomes {8, 16, 32, 56}.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows an example of PHICH transmission under a multi-component-carrier condition. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the PHICH may be differently set in an eNB/UE system which can simultaneously perform transmission and reception by setting a plurality of frequency bands.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the number of frequency bands A<sub>DL</sub>, B<sub>DL </sub>and C<sub>DL </sub>used in downlink is less than the number of frequency bands A<sub>UL</sub>, B<sub>UL</sub>, C<sub>UL</sub>, D<sub>UL </sub>and E<sub>UL</sub>, used in uplink. An asymmetric component carrier condition may be generated due to the limit of an actually available frequency band or artificially generated by a network configuration. For example, although the overall system band includes N frequency blocks, frequency bands which may be received by a specific UE may be limited to M (&#x3c;N) frequency blocks. The asymmetric component carrier condition may be set on cell-specific, UE group-specific, or UE-specific basis. If the number of downlink frequency bands is less than the number of uplink frequency bands, PHICH information for transmission of a plurality of uplink PUSCHs should be transmitted through a smaller number of downlink PHICHs.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, the PHICH information linked to UL component carriers D and E (D<sub>UL </sub>and E<sub>UL</sub>) should be transmitted through at least one of the DL component carriers A, B and C (A<sub>DL</sub>, B<sub>DL </sub>and C<sub>DL</sub>). However, the DL component carriers A, B and C (A<sub>DL</sub>, B<sub>DL </sub>and C<sub>DL</sub>) are basically mapped so as to transmit the PHICHs linked to the UL component carriers A, B and C (A<sub>UL</sub>, B<sub>UL </sub>and C<sub>UL</sub>). Accordingly, at least one of the DL component carriers A, B and C (A<sub>DL</sub>, B<sub>DL </sub>and C<sub>DL</sub>) should additionally transmit the PHICH information of the UL component carriers D and E (D<sub>UL </sub>and E<sub>DL</sub>). Therefore, at least one of the DL component carriers A, B and C (A<sub>DL</sub>, B<sub>DL </sub>and C<sub>DL</sub>) should secure resources (that is, PHICH resources of D<sub>UL </sub>and E<sub>DL</sub>) for additional PHICH transmission in addition to resources (that is, PHICH resources linked to A<sub>UL</sub>, B<sub>UL </sub>and C<sub>UL</sub>) for existing PHICH transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, even when the number of downlink frequency bands is equal to the number of uplink frequency bands, one UE transmits a plurality of codewords if a transmission scheme such as a Single User-Multiple Input Multiple Output (SU-MIMO) scheme is used in uplink. In this case, the eNB should transmit a plurality of ACK/NACK signals of the codewords to one UE through the PHICH. Accordingly, it is necessary to secure a greater number of PHICH groups than the number of existing PHICH groups defined on the assumption that one PHICH is transmitted to each UE.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">However, as can be seen from Equation 1, in the exiting signaling scheme, the number of PHICH groups can be secured up to a maximum of twice the number of downlink Resource Blocks (RBs). Accordingly, a method of additionally securing a PHICH group and a signaling method thereof are necessary. The present invention suggests a method of securing an additional PHICH group using a CCE used for PDCCH transmission and a signaling method thereof. Hereinafter, for convenience, the CCE used for ACK/NACK transmission is referred to as a PHICH CCE.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The CCE is composed of 9 REGs, one PHICH group is transmitted through three REGs in a subframe using a normal CP, and two PHICH groups are transmitted through three REGs in a subframe using an extended CP. Accordingly, one PHICH CCE can transmit three PHICH groups in the subframe using the normal CP and transmit six PHICH groups in the subframe using the extended CP. In consideration of this condition, the number of PHICH CCEs may be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, the number of PHICH CCEs, n, may be determined by Equation 2.

In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the total number of CCEs is N. However, this is only exemplary and the number of CCEs may be changed according to a downlink transmission bandwidth and/or the number of OFDM symbols configuring a control region.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>a</i>), the PHICH CCEs may be consecutively set in all CCEs. In this case, the resources of the PHICH group may be specified by the number of PHICH CCEs and the location of the PHICH CCEs. Although not limited thereto, the number of PHICH CCEs may be determined using Equation 2. Although not limited thereto, the location of the PHICH CCEs may be a start portion or an end portion of all the CCEs. The start location of the PHICH CCEs may be indicated through signaling or previously determined between the eNB and the UE. In addition, the location of the PHICH CCEs may be determined on a cell-specific basis. Meanwhile, since the number of PDCCHs may be changed according to the amount of control information for each subframe, CCEs may remain in the control region without transmitting control information. Accordingly, preferably, last n CCEs for transmitting the PHICH group may be secured such that the CCEs for PDCCH transmission are least influenced.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>b</i>), the PHICH CCEs may be distributed in all CCEs. The resources of the PHICH group may be specified by the number of PHICH CCEs and/or a distribution pattern of the PHICH CCEs. The distribution pattern of the PHICH CCEs may be randomly or pseudo-randomly determined. In addition, the distribution pattern of the PHICH CCEs may be previously determined between the eNB and the UE. In addition, the distribution pattern of the PHICH CCEs may be determined using a parameter value shared between the eNB and the UE. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>c</i>) shows another example of distributing the PHICH CCEs in all CCEs. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref><i>c</i>), the PHICH CCEs are separated at a predetermined interval. The distribution pattern of the PHICH CCEs, where the PHICH CCEs are distributed for example randomly, pseudo-randomly or at the predetermined interval, may be changed with time according to a rule determined between the eNB and the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a diagram showing an example of distributing PHICH CCEs in a system band.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a plurality of CCEs which are logically consecutive is input to an interleaver. The plurality of CCEs includes CCEs for the PDCCH and CCEs for the PHICH. The interleaver performs a function for interleaving the plurality of CCEs in REG units. Accordingly, the REGs configuring the CCE are scattered in the overall frequency/time domain within the control region of the subframe. Therefore, the PHICH groups are physically scattered within the overall frequency band of the control region although they are allocated to logically consecutive or close locations within the PHICH CCEs. Accordingly, frequency diversity and interference randomization gain can be maximized.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram showing an example of allocating indexes to additionally secured PHICH resources according to an embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the PHICH group index and the orthogonal sequence index are automatically determined in association with an uplink physical RB (UL PRB). In this case, the PHICH group index and the orthogonal sequence index may be determined in consideration of a cyclic shift value n<sub>DMRS </sub>of a demodulation RS. Meanwhile, if one DL component carrier is mapped to two or more UL component carriers, the UL PRB indexes may overlap each other. Accordingly, the UL PRB indexes derived from the UL component carriers may be construed such that at least portions thereof do not overlap with each other. That is, the UL PRB indexes derived from the UL component carriers may be construed not to be overlapped with each other or to be overlapped with each other only within a predetermined range. For example, different offsets may be applied to the UL PRB indexes according to the component carriers.</p>

The information on the PHICH CCEs may be provided using a specific number or a specific ratio. The information on the PHICH CCEs may be implicitly or explicitly signaled. For example, in the DL component carriers, the number of PHICH CCEs may be determined by a combination of component carriers and/or the bandwidths of the component carriers within the system. Meanwhile, a network may set and broadcast the number of PHICH CCEs for the DL component carriers through a BCH on a cell-specific basis. Alternatively, the network may set and transmit the number of PHICH CCEs for the DL component carriers to the UEs through UE-specific RRC signaling on a UE-specific basis. In the DL component carriers, the PHICH CCEs may be consecutively allocated from a specific CCE of the CCEs aligned in logical order, may be allocated at a specific CCE interval, or may be allocated with a specific pattern. In this case, the index of a first CCE used as the PHICH CCE or a parameter for identifying the location of the CCE may be transmitted to the UEs through a BCH or UE-specific RRC signaling.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an uplink subframe may be divided into a region to which a PUCCH for transmitting control information is allocated and a region to which a PUSCH for transmitting user data is allocated. An intermediate portion of the subframe is allocated to the PUSCH, and both sides of a data region are allocated to the PUCCH in the frequency domain. The control information transmitted on the PUCCH includes the ACK/NACK used for HARQ, a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) indicating a downlink channel state, a Rank Indicator (RI) for MIMO, and a Scheduling Request (SR) of an uplink resource allocation request. The PUCCH for one UE uses one resource block occupying different frequencies in each slot within the subframe. That is, two resource blocks allocated to the PUCCH are frequency-hopped in a slot boundary. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the case where a PUCCH having m=0, a PUCCH having m=1, a PUCCH having m=2, and a PUCCH having m=3 are allocated to the subframe.</p>

In an extended CP, a slot includes six SC-FDMA symbols and RSs are carried on third and fourth SC-FDMA symbols. Resources for the ACK/NACK signal are divided using different Cyclic Shifts (CSs) (frequency spreading) of a Computer Generated Constant Amplitude Zero Auto Correlation (CG-CAZAC) sequence and different Walsh/DFT orthogonal codes (time spreading). The result of multiplying w<b>0</b>, w<b>1</b>, w<b>2</b> and w<b>3</b> after IFFT is equal to the result of multiplying w<b>0</b>, w<b>1</b>, w<b>2</b> and w<b>3</b> before IFFT. The resource blocks for the ACK/NACK signal are orthogonally allocated in the frequency domain. If it is assumed that the number of available CSs is 6 and the number of available Walsh/DFT codes is 3, 18 UEs may be multiplexed in one resource block. In the LTE system, the PUCCH resources for ACK/NACK transmission are indicated by indexes indicating a pair of a CS and an orthogonal code.</p>

For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, the PUCCH linked to the DL component carriers D and E (D<sub>DL </sub>and E<sub>DL</sub>) should be transmitted through at least one of the UL component carriers A, B and C (A<sub>UL</sub>, B<sub>UL </sub>and C<sub>UL</sub>).

Accordingly, at least one of the UL component carriers A, B and C (A<sub>UL</sub>, B<sub>UL </sub>and C<sub>UL</sub>) should additionally transmit the PUCCH associated to the DL component carriers D and E (D<sub>DL </sub>and E<sub>DL</sub>). Therefore, a scheme of mapping PUCCH indexes to the additional CCEs (e.g., CCEs of D<sub>DL </sub>and E<sub>DL</sub>) as well as a scheme of mapping PUCCH indexes to the existing CCEs (e.g., CCEs of A<sub>DL</sub>, B<sub>DL </sub>and C<sub>DL</sub>) is necessary in the UL component carriers A, B and C (A<sub>UL</sub>, B<sub>UL </sub>and/or C<sub>UL</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the present invention, if one UL component carrier is mapped to a plurality of DL component carriers, a scheme of mapping the carriers such that at least portions of the CCEs of the plurality of DL component carriers do not overlap with each other is suggested.

For convenience, the DL component carrier mapped to the UL component carrier in one-to-one correspondence is referred to as a normal component carrier.

In addition, Equation 5 is simply exemplified in order to facilitate the understanding of the present invention, and thus it may be adequately modified for the case that two or more extended DL component carries are used.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, some of the CCEs of different DL component carriers may be construed to have the same index (thus, the same PUCCH index). In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the offset value of DL CC<b>0</b> is 0 and the offset value of DL CC<b>1</b> is N&#x2212;2 in Equation 5. Even when some of the CCEs of the different component carriers are mapped to the same PUCCH index, actual collision of the PUCCH index may be avoided in a manner of disabling an eNB scheduler to simultaneously use the CCEs mapped to the same PUCCH index. Accordingly, the offset values applied to the DL component carriers do not need to be set such that the CCEs of the different component carriers do not overlap each other exclusively.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows another example of allocating PUCCH indexes for ACK/NACK transmission if uplink and downlink bandwidths are asymmetric, according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the case where a plurality of DL component carriers is mapped to one UL component carrier may be divided into a case of fixing a mapping scheme on a cell-specific basis and a case of fixing a mapping scheme on a UE-specific basis. That is, when the number of DL component carriers is actually greater than the number of UL component carriers within the cell, all or some of the UL component carriers may be set to be mapped to the plurality of DL component carriers. In addition, the mapping scheme may be differently set according to UEs in consideration of the uplink/downlink frequency band transmission/reception capability of the UE or the like, regardless of whether the number of uplink component carriers is equal to the number of downlink component carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">For example, it is assumed that two DL component carriers and two UL component carriers exist within a cell. In this case, if UEs capable of receiving two component carrier bands in downlink but transmitting only one component carrier band in uplink are present, a network may set some of the UEs having such capability to use a 0<sup>th </sup>UL component carrier UL CC<b>0</b> and set the remaining UEs to use a 1<sup>st </sup>UL component carrier UL CC<b>1</b>. In this case, a first offset for mapping the CCE of the 0<sup>th </sup>DL component carrier DL CC<b>0</b> to the UL CC<b>0</b> PUCCH index and a first offset for mapping the CCE of the 1<sup>st </sup>DL component carrier DL CC<b>1</b> to the UL CC<b>0</b> PUCCH index may be independently set. Similarly, a third offset between DL CC<b>0</b> and UL CC<b>1</b> and a fourth offset between DL CC<b>1</b> and UL CC<b>1</b> may be independently set.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">If the mapping of the DL component carrier for transmitting the PDCCH and the UL component carrier for transmitting the ACK/NACK signal is set to be fixed within the cell, the CCE index offset or the PUCCH index offset associated with the DL component carrier may be independently set according to the DL/UL component carrier mapping and may be broadcast to the UEs within the cell. Meanwhile, if the mapping of the DL component carrier for transmitting the PDCCH and the UL component carrier for transmitting the ACK/NACK signal is set to be fixed for each UE, the CCE index offset or the PUCCH index offset associated with the DL component carrier may be independently set with respect to the mapping of the DL/UL component carrier(s) set to the UEs and may be signaled to the UEs.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Preferably, in mapping a plurality of DL component carriers to one UL component carrier, the CCE index offset or the PUCCH index offset may be independently set and broadcast/signaled for each DL component carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Preferably, in mapping a plurality of DL component carrier to one UL component carrier, the CCE index offset or the PUCCH index offset may be set and broadcast/signaled such that the CCEs of the different DL component carriers are not mapped to the same PUCCH ACK/NACK index.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method of transmitting an ACK/NACK signal through a PUCCH according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the eNB obtains information on a mapping relationship between one UL component carrier and two or more DL component carriers (S<b>2110</b>). The information on the mapping relationship may include information for disabling all or at least some of the CCEs of different DL component carriers to overlap with each other. Alternatively, the information on the mapping relationship may include information for disabling PUCCH resource indexes to which the CCEs of different DL component carriers are mapped to overlap each other. For example, the information on the mapping relationship may include information on an offset value applied to the DL component carrier. The offset value may include a CCE index offset or PUCCH resource index offset. The information on the mapping relationship may be implicitly or explicitly signaled. For example, the information on the mapping relationship may be determined by a combination of the component carriers and/or the bandwidths of the component carriers within the system. Meanwhile, a network may set the information on the mapping relation based on cell-specific or UE-specific basis and broadcast it through a BCH. The information on the mapping relationship may be independently set for each DL component carrier. Alternatively, the network may set the information on the mapping relationship based on UE-specific basis and transmit it to the UEs through UE-specific RRC signaling.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Thereafter, the UE receives data from the eNB through two or more DL component carriers (S<b>2120</b>). The UE maps one UL component carrier to two or more DL component carriers to construct a new DL CCE index (S<b>2130</b>). In the construction of the new DL CCE index, for example, the CCE of each of the DL component carriers may be directly mapped to the new PUCCH resource index without constructing the new DL CCE. The UE determines the PUCCH resource index used for transmitting the ACK/NACk signal using the new CCE index (S<b>2140</b>). Thereafter, the eNB transmits the ACK/NACK signal using UL resource indicated by the PUCCH resource index (S<b>2150</b>).</p>
