<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This specification relates to transportation fleet management, such as a system for fleet vehicle management that records particular vehicle and driver information for subsequent communication, for example, to a remote device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A number of commercial companies and government institutions maintain a fleet of vehicles and have an interest in keeping track of the vehicles and shipments, as well as the performance and well-being of their drivers. These parties frequently equip their fleet vehicles with devices configured to track the vehicles' geographic locations, speeds, headings, cargo temperature, engine performance parameters, and other data. Such information is used, for example, to maintain the vehicles, estimate delivery times, provide warning of possible damage to cargo, and to evaluate driver performance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some regulatory agencies also have an interest in fleet vehicle information, such as the number of miles a delivery vehicle has traveled since its last safety inspection, or the number of hours a driver has been on duty since he or she last rested. In some cases, this information was traditionally recorded on paper (e.g., driver log books) or in proprietary electronic formats. In either case, such information can be inconvenient to access or share with regulatory inspectors or other third parties.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some embodiments of a system for communicating fleet vehicle information can provide equipment for use inside a fleet vehicle to facilitate prompt and efficient transfer of vehicle and driver information. In particular embodiments, the system can generate electronic reports that provide driver identification information, hours of service information, and (optionally) vehicle-related information, and such electronic reports can be readily communicated to a remote computer device in a number of different manners. For example, in some embodiments, the system may include an electronic onboard recorder mountable in a vehicle and a mobile communication device (e.g., a cellular phone in particular embodiments) that is configured to provide short-range, two-way wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth communication in particular embodiments) with the electronic onboard recorder. In such circumstances, a driver or other system user can operate the system to share a driver summary electronic report or other information by exporting the electronic information via a data port (e.g., a USB port in particular embodiments) of the electronic onboard recorder, by transferring the electronic information via a cellular link established by the mobile communication device, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Particular embodiments described herein may include a system for communicating fleet vehicle information including an electronic onboard recorder unit and a portable wireless display unit. The electronic onboard recorder unit may be configured to mount inside a vehicle and provide a wired connection to the vehicle for gathering data during operation of the vehicle. The electronic onboard recorder unit can be free of any user interface display and may include a short-range wireless communication device to wirelessly communicate vehicle usage information to a separate device, such as the portable wireless display unit. The electronic onboard recorder unit may also include a data connection port (e.g., a USB port in some embodiments) configured to removably receive a data cable of a remote computer device. The portable wireless display unit may include a short-range wireless communication device to wirelessly communicate with the electronic onboard recorder unit when the electronic onboard recorder unit and the portable wireless display unit are both positioned inside the vehicle. Also, the portable wireless display unit may include a cellular communication device configured to provide a cellular communication link with a remote system. Furthermore, the portable wireless display unit may include a user interface comprising a display device. Also, the portable wireless display unit may include a computer-readable memory module to store a driver summary electronic report, which may be generated by the portable wireless display unit in response to wirelessly receiving the vehicle usage information from the electronic onboard recorder unit mounted to the vehicle. The driver summary electronic report may include identification information for a driver and hours or service information for the driver. In response to input on the user interface of the portable wireless display unit indicative of a request to export the driver summary electronic report from the electronic onboard recorder unit mounted to the vehicle, the portable wireless display unit may be configured to wirelessly transfer the driver summary electronic report to the electronic onboard recorder unit mounted to the vehicle for exporting the driver summary electronic report via the data connection port of the electronic onboard recorder unit to the remote computer device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a system for communicating fleet vehicle information may include an electronic onboard recorder unit configured to mount inside a vehicle and provide a wired connection to the vehicle for gathering data during operation of the vehicle.

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The systems and techniques described here may provide one or more of the following benefits. First, a system for communicating vehicle information can provide an electronic onboard recorder mountable in a vehicle and a mobile communication device (e.g., a cellular phone in particular embodiments) that is configured to provide wireless communication with the electronic onboard recorder. As such, system can include a plurality of separately housed devices that are each configured to output electronic reports in different manners.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Second, in some embodiments of the system, the electronic onboard recorder can be equipped with an external data port (e.g., a USB connection port) so that the electronic onboard recorder can output driver summary electronic reports or other electronic files via a hardwired connection to a remote computer. For example, a vehicle inspector can carry a portable computer device or portable storage device, and the driver or the inspector can plug the inspector's device into the data port of the electronic onboard recorder so as to retrieve a driver summary electronic report or other electronic files via a hardwired connection to the unit mounted in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Third, particular embodiments of the system can provide a mobile communication device (e.g., a cellular phone in particular embodiments) that provides short-range, two wireless communication with an electronic onboard recorder mounted in a vehicle. In such circumstances, not only does the electronic onboard recorder wirelessly communicate information to the mobile communication device, but the mobile communication device can also transmit information back to the electronic onboard recorder. Therefore, one or more electronic files containing vehicle or driver information can be synced between the two separate devices for purposes of outputting the files in a number of optional manners.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Fourth, in some embodiments, the electronic onboard recorder mounted in the vehicle can be constructed as a displayless unit that is free of any user interface display. Such a construction can reduce the size of the electronic onboard recorder, provide for simplified installation (and, optionally, concealed installation inside the vehicle), and reduce the manufacturing complexities for the electronic onboard recorder. In these circumstances, the user interface of the mobile communication device can serve as the user interface for the system (including the electronic onboard recorder). As such, the mobile communication device can be separately housed from its corresponding electronic onboard recorder so that the mobile communication device can be carried by the vehicle driver or other user outside of the vehicle while the electronic onboard recorder remains mounted inside the vehicle. Moreover, because the mobile communication device is portable relative to its respective electronic onboard recorder unit, the driver can view or input vehicle or driver information on the user interface of the mobile communication device both when the driver is seated inside the vehicle and when the driver positioned outside the vehicle in proximity thereto (e.g., while inspecting the exterior of the vehicle, refueling, or sitting in a nearby building).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Fifth, in some embodiments of the system, the electronic onboard recorder can be configured to detect the particular type of communications protocol employed by vehicle, and automatically adapt to the detected protocol in order to communicate with an engine control module of the vehicle. As such, the electronic onboard recorder can be installed in any one of a number of different types of vehicles, and the installer's act of connecting the electronic onboard recorder to the vehicle's engine control module will prompt the control circuitry of the electronic onboard recorder to automatically recognize the type of vehicle in which it is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Sixth, in some embodiments of the system, the electronic onboard recorder can house one or more accelerometers therein so as to detect particular types of vehicle movement, such as hard brakes, acceleration, and lane changes. Instances of this type of vehicle movement can be recorded by the electronic onboard recorder can communicated to a control center (e.g., via the mobile communication device) for purposes of safety monitoring by a fleet manager or other system user.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, some embodiments of a fleet management system <b>100</b> can include a collection of vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>equipped with electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and accompanying mobile communication devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, which can be used for communication with a control center <b>104</b>. In particular embodiments, the control center <b>104</b> represents a physical or conceptual location in which information about the vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>(and the vehicles drivers) is collected and used. For example, the control center <b>104</b> may access information gathered from the vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>in order to identify and locate the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>carrying particular shipments, and estimate the remaining time until delivery. Also, the control center <b>104</b> can collect the information about the vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>so as to monitor the location, speed, heading, and planned route of particular vehicles and their respective shipments. Moreover, the control center <b>104</b> can collect the information about the drivers of the vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>so as to monitor the duty status, hours of service, and other characteristics of each driver.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">At least some of aforementioned vehicle information is gathered by the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>mounted in each of the vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c</i>, respectively. The electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>are electronic devices that collect and record information about the vehicles' <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c</i>, location, speed, operational parameters, acceleration, operating hours, and other vehicle-related information. For example, the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>can receive location information in the form of global positioning system (GPS) signals <b>108</b> from at least one GPS satellite <b>109</b> to determine the locations of their respective vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c</i>. Also, the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>can be configured to electrically connect with an engine control module (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) so as to receive vehicle operation information (e.g., speed, operational parameters, acceleration/braking data, fuel usage, and the like). As described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, each electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>can be equipped with a data connection port (e.g., a USB port in this embodiment) for purposes of readily exporting driver information electronic reports or other electronic data to remote devices of regulatory inspectors or other approved parties.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>can communicate with a corresponding mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c</i>, which may also be positioned inside or in close proximity to the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. In particular, each of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>can be portably carried by the driver of a vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, respectively, so that the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>is configured to wirelessly communicate with the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c</i>, respectively, mounted in the vehicle. For example, during use of the fleet vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can wirelessly communicate while both the unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the device <b>112</b><i>a </i>are positioned inside the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>. In such circumstances, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the corresponding mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can operate as a system <b>110</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>) for communicating information about the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>and its driver.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this embodiment, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>communicates with a mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>over a wireless link <b>114</b><i>a </i>and provides a user interface for the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>b </i>and <b>106</b><i>c </i>communicate with a mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>b </i>and <b>112</b><i>c</i>, respectively, over a wireless link <b>114</b><i>b </i>and <b>114</b><i>c</i>. In those embodiments in which the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>provides the user interface for the respective electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, each electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be constructed as a displayless unit that is free of any user interface display mounted thereto, thereby reducing the size of the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>(e.g., providing for simplified installation and, optionally, concealed installation inside the vehicle) and reducing the manufacturing complexities for the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the mobile communications devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>can be cellular telephones, satellite telephones, portable computers, tablet computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or another mobile computing device that is programmed to wirelessly communicate with one or more of the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. As such, each mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>can be separately housed from its corresponding electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>so that the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>can be carried by the vehicle driver or other user outside of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>while the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>remains mounted inside the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c</i>. In some implementations, the wireless links <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>c </i>can be short-range wireless communications links, such as Bluetooth, wireless Ethernet (WiFi), ZigBee, near-field communications (NFC), infrared (IrDA), or any other suitable short-range wireless communication link. In such circumstances, each mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>can display information in response to the vehicle data wirelessly communicated from the respective electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>while both items are positioned inside the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>(e.g., while the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>is mounted inside the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>is carried by the driver in the vehicle or otherwise temporarily placed inside the vehicle cabin). Moreover, because each mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>is portable relative to its respective electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c</i>, the driver or other human user can view or input vehicle-related information on the user interface of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>both when the driver is seated inside the vehicle and when the driver positioned outside the vehicle in proximity thereto (e.g., while inspecting the exterior of the vehicle, refueling, or sitting in a nearby building).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In use, each wireless link <b>114</b><i>a</i>-<b>114</b><i>c </i>transmits information between the respective electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>and its corresponding mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c</i>. In some implementations, the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>do not provide their own user interfaces (e.g., displays, input buttons), but instead wirelessly communicate bi-directionally with the mobile communication devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>to provide user interface functions for the overall mobile system <b>110</b><i>a </i>(refer, for example, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). For example, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>may wirelessly communicate vehicle usage information so that the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can calculate and display hours of service information on the display screen carried by the driver. In another example, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>may determine the location of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>and wirelessly communicate the location information to the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>so that the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can display the location on a map. Example uses of the mobile communication devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>as user interfaces for the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>are discussed further in the descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In use, the mobile communication devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>may communicate with at least one transceiver <b>122</b> over a collection of wireless links <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c</i>. In some implementations, the wireless links <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>can be long-range wireless links, such as cellular communication links, satellite communication links, WiMAX links, long term evolution (LTE) links, or any other suitable form of long-range wireless link that can communicate data between the mobile communication devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>and the transceiver <b>122</b>. In this particular embodiment, the transceiver <b>122</b> may be in the form a cellular antenna tower that is configured to provide cellular data links to a variety of cellular telephones within a particular geographic range. The transceiver <b>122</b> may be communicatively connected to a base station <b>124</b>. In some implementations, the base station <b>122</b> can be a cellular data communications provider, satellite communications provider, or any other appropriate wireless communications provider. Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a network <b>130</b> communicatively connects the base station <b>124</b> with the control center <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the network <b>130</b> may include the Internet or other public or private data networks. In alternative embodiments in which one or more of mobile communication devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>comprise a satellite phone, at least one of the long-range wireless links <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>can be a satellite communication link and the transceiver <b>122</b> may be in the form a satellite communication apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A mentioned previously, the control center <b>104</b> exchanges information with the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>(via the mobile communication devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c</i>) to monitor the status of the vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c</i>. For example, the control center <b>104</b> may track the locations of the vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>in order to estimate delivery or pickup times, or to coordinate the dispatch of the vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>to pick up a delivery (e.g., by dispatching the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>closest to the pickup location). In another example, the control center <b>104</b> may monitor the vehicles' <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>operating parameters to coordinate repairs or maintenance (e.g., monitor temperatures of refrigerated cargo, monitor engine warning signals).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Another form of information generated by the system for communication to the control center <b>4</b> are driver duty logs, which may include data indicative of the hours of service when the driver is on duty in a particular day. In some implementations, the driver duty logs can be automatically converted into electronic record of duty files (including hours of service records, driver identification information, etc.) that are readily exportable via the USB port of the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) or via the wireless link <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>of the mobile communication devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can collect the vehicle usage information over a period of time when a particular driver is using the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>, and the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can periodically transfer this vehicle usage information to the corresponding mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>linked thereto via the Bluetooth connection <b>114</b><i>a</i>. The mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can access the vehicle usage information along with other driver-specific information (e.g., driver identification information and the like) so as to generate the electronic record of duty file stored on the memory of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>. From there, the electronic record of duty file can be wirelessly communicated via the cellular link <b>120</b><i>a </i>to the control center <b>104</b>, wirelessly communicated via the Bluetooth link <b>114</b><i>a </i>to the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>for subsequent exporting via the USB port to a remote device (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), or both. Regarding the process for exporting via the USB port, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be configured to output the electronic record of duty file directly to a temporarily connected external computer device <b>150</b> (e.g., a notebook computer) or a portable storage device <b>152</b> (e.g., a USB thumb drive, a portable hard drive) provided by a vehicle inspector <b>154</b> (e.g., a law enforcement official, a regulatory inspector, or the like). In such circumstances, the vehicle inspector <b>154</b> can conveniently plug the external computer device <b>150</b> or the portable storage device <b>152</b> into the USB port provided by the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>to facilitate a transfer of the requested data from the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the mobile communication device <b>112</b> are two separately housed instruments that act together as a system to generate and communicate the electronic record of duty file associated with the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in some embodiments of the system <b>110</b><i>a </i>for communicating fleet vehicle information, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>is mounted in the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>so that the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>is electrically connected to the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>. In particular, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can include as input cable (e.g., data bus <b>204</b>) that electrically connects to a mating connector of an engine control module (ECM) <b>202</b> of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the ECM <b>202</b> is an electronic device that monitors and/or controls various functions of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>. For example, the ECM <b>202</b> can monitor vehicle speed, engine speed, coolant temperature, vehicle mileage, cargo environmental parameters, and any other appropriate vehicle parameters. In this embodiment, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>is configured to mount directly to a dash component inside the cabin of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>. As previously described, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be a displayless unit that is without any user interface display screen, thereby reducing the size of the unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>and facilitating a simplified installation process. The user interface <b>208</b> of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can be used as a portable user interface for the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>when the unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>communicates with the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>over the Bluetooth connection <b>114</b><i>a</i>. Moreover, in some implementations, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>may include a single printed circuit board upon which all of its electronic circuitry is mounted, thereby further reducing the size and manufacturing complexities of the unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. It should be understood from the description herein that the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>is depicted as an enlarged size in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> for purposes of illustration only, and that the actual size of the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be significantly smaller. For example, in some embodiments, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>has a maximum length of about 8 inches, a maximum width of about 6.5 inches, and a maximum height of about 1.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can detect the particular type of communications protocol employed by the ECM <b>202</b>, and automatically adapt to the detected protocol in order to communicate with the ECM <b>202</b>. In these circumstances, the electronic onboard recorder <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be installed in any one of a number of different types of vehicles (e.g., a class 8 large truck, a class 1 car, or the like), and the installer's act of connecting the cable <b>204</b> to the vehicle's ECM <b>202</b> will prompt the control circuitry of the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>to automatically recognize the type of vehicle in which it is installed. As such, some embodiments of the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>need not be manufactured or preprogrammed in a vehicle-specific manner. For example, in some implementations, the ECM <b>202</b> can implement a controller area network (CAN), a local interconnect network (LIN), a vehicle area network (VAN), FlexRay, J1939, ISO-11783, domestic digital bus (D2B), IDB-1394, SmartWireX, MOST, J1850, ISO-9141, J1708, J1587, SPI, IIC, or any other communications protocol for communicating with the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>through the data bus <b>204</b>. In such circumstances, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>may detect the combination and/or signal levels implemented over the data bus <b>204</b>, may analyze incoming data traffic, and/or may query the ECM <b>202</b> using various protocols and receive corresponding responses in order to determine the protocol in use by the ECM <b>202</b>. In some implementations, the connector on the end of the data bus cable <b>204</b> (e.g., the end which connects to the ECM <b>202</b>) can include a connection jack having more data lines than are provided by the ECM <b>202</b>. Multiple converters may be provided to adapt a subset of the port's data lines to a variety of configurations of the data bus <b>204</b>. For example, passenger cars and other &#x201c;class 1&#x201d; vehicles may provide a connector that is compliant with the on-board diagnostic (OBD) II specification, while large trucks and other &#x201c;class 8&#x201d; vehicles may provide a connector that is compliant with the heavy-duty OBD (HDOBD) specification. In such examples, one converter may be provided to adapt the port to connect to OBDII data buses, and another may be provided to adapt the port to connect to HDOBD data buses. The electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>may sense the configuration of an attached converter to determine the appropriate protocol to use for communication with the ECM <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be configured to simultaneously communicate via multiple protocols at once. For instance, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be configured to communicate via the J1939 and J1708 protocols at the same time. This feature can be useful, for example, for a vehicle in which the ECM <b>202</b> communicates in two different protocols (e.g., communicates some information (braking information) on one engine bus and other information (e.g., fuel information) on another engine bus. Also, this feature can be useful when a single vehicle includes multiple ECMs <b>202</b> that employed different protocols. Thus, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can to gather some vehicle information appears on one engine bus, and to gather other vehicle information on another engine bus. In one implementation, the cable <b>204</b> can have a first set of wires that are configured to connect with a first ECM (or a first engine bus of an individual ECM) while a second set of wires are configured to mate with a second ECM (or a second engine bus of the individual ECM).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, in particular embodiments in which the ECM <b>202</b> or engine bus <b>204</b> may not provide a direct odometer reading, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be configured to interpret other engine parameters to create an &#x201c;effective odometer reading&#x201d; of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>starting at the point when the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>was installed in the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>. For example, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can receive data indicative of vehicle speed (e.g., used in combination with an internal clock or timer of the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>) or data indicative of distance increments (e.g., distance pulses every 0.1 miles) so as to generate &#x201c;effective odometer reading&#x201d; for the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the system <b>110</b><i>a </i>can be used to comply with distance and odometer reporting requirements (via an electronic report) even if the ECM <b>202</b> or engine bus <b>204</b> of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>does not directly provide odometer readings. In addition, the system <b>110</b><i>a </i>can prompt an installer or other user to manually input the vehicle odometer reading (as shown on the dash of the vehicle) when the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>is initially installed so that the &#x201c;effective odometer reading&#x201d; calculated by the system <b>110</b> is a substantially accurate estimation of the actual total mileage of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As described previously, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>receives location information in the form of global positioning system (GPS) signals <b>108</b> from at least one GPS satellite <b>109</b> to determine the location of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>. For example, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be equipped with a GPS receiver device that receives signals from the GPS satellite <b>109</b> so that the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can receive coordinate information (e.g., longitude and latitude coordinates) and time information (e.g., current time). In addition, in some embodiments, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be equipped with one or more accelerometers <b>203</b> so as to detect particular types of vehicle movement, such as hard brakes, acceleration, and lane changes. Instances of this type of vehicle movement can be recorded by the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can communicated to the control center <b>104</b> (via the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>) for purposes of safety monitoring by a fleet manager or other system user. Thus, during operation of the vehicle, some embodiments of the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can receive input information from a combination of the ECM <b>202</b> of the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>, the GPS system, and the one or more internal accelerometers <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>collects information from the various inputs (e.g., the ECM <b>202</b>, the GPS system, and the one or more accelerometers <b>203</b>) and stores the vehicle usage information as data in a computer-readable memory module <b>206</b>. As previously described, in this embodiment, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>is displayless and thus has no user interface of its own with which to let a user view or interact with the vehicle usage information. Rather, in this embodiment, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>communicates the vehicle usage information from the memory module <b>206</b> to the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>over the Bluetooth connection <b>114</b><i>a</i>, and the vehicle usage information can be stored in a computer-readable memory module <b>116</b> of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>. The mobile communications device <b>112</b><i>a </i>provides a user interface <b>208</b> with which the user can access some or all the vehicle usage information. Examples of user interfaces are discussed in further detail in the descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition to displaying some or all of the vehicle usage information on the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>, the vehicle usage information may also be transmitted to the control center <b>104</b> for review and archiving. For example, in this embodiment, the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can communicate with the transceiver <b>122</b> over the cellular link <b>120</b><i>a </i>so as to wirelessly communicate the vehicle usage information and other electronic reports, messages, or data to the control center <b>104</b>. As such, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>operate as a system <b>110</b><i>a </i>that is positionable inside the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a </i>and that communicates information related to the vehicle and its driver. Moreover, at least the display portion (e.g., the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>) of the system <b>110</b><i>a </i>can be portable relative to the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>, thereby permitting the user to view and input vehicle or driver-related information even when the user is positioned outside the vehicle. Further, because each mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is portable relative to the vehicles <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), each mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be configured to wirelessly communicate with any one of the nearby electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. For example, if the driver carrying the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>switches to vehicle <b>102</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) for a new workday, the driver's mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can be configured to wirelessly communicate with the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) mounted inside that vehicle <b>102</b><i>b </i>for the workday.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be equipped with an external data port (e.g., a USB port in this embodiment) for exporting electronic reports or other data to a temporarily connected external storage device, such as the portable computer device <b>150</b>, the portable storage device <b>152</b>, or the like. As described previously, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>includes the memory module <b>206</b> for the vehicle usage information and other data, and the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can receive the vehicle usage information and generate electronic reports (such as an electronic record of duty file). In some implementations, the electronic record of duty file stored in the memory module <b>116</b> of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>may be copied to the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>(e.g., via the wireless link <b>114</b><i>a</i>) for subsequent access by a third party such as the vehicle inspector <b>154</b>. For example, under some jurisdictions law enforcement or regulatory inspectors may be authorized to request a copy of the data <b>206</b> in order to inspect the driver's record of duty to determine whether the driver is in compliance with laws that regulate the number of consecutive or cumulative hours the driver is permitted to be on duty in a given period. Thus, in some circumstances, the electronic record of duty file can be generated by and stored in the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>, and this electronic report can be wirelessly communicated to the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>prior to exporting the electronic record of duty file via the output data port <b>302</b> of the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. In some embodiments in which a copy of the electronic record of duty file is stored in both the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>, and the copies of these files can be updated or sync prior to exporting the electronic record of duty file via the output data port <b>302</b> of the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the illustrated example, the vehicle inspector <b>154</b> can request that a copy of the data <b>206</b> be copied to the inspector's computer device <b>150</b> or the inspector's portable storage device <b>152</b>. To facilitate communication between the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the computer device <b>150</b> of the portable storage device <b>152</b>, the computer device <b>150</b> or the portable storage device <b>152</b> can be plugged into the data output port <b>302</b> of the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. As previously described, the data output port <b>302</b> may be a USB port adapted to accept a USB connector <b>304</b> provided by any of the computer device <b>150</b> and the portable storage device <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments, the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can control the transfer of the electronic record of duty file or other data from the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>to the inspector's computer device <b>150</b> or the inspector's portable storage device <b>152</b>. For example, the electronic record of duty file or other data stored on the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be protected from exporting via the data port <b>302</b> until the user provides approval for the data transfer via the user interface <b>208</b> of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>. In such circumstances, the data stored on the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be protected from unauthorized users, and furthermore, the data files stored on the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>may be updated or synced with the data files stored on the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>prior to any file exporting operation via the data port <b>302</b>. In this embodiment, the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>presents the user interface <b>208</b> that prompts the user to initiate the file transfer process from the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>to the inspector's computer device <b>150</b> or the inspector's portable storage device <b>152</b>. The user interface <b>208</b> of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can provide, for example, at least one control button <b>306</b> that receives the user input indicative of a command to initiate the file transfer process. In some implementations, the user control button <b>306</b> can be a physical button, a touchscreen button, a selectable menu item, or any other user control mechanism on the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>. In other implementations, the control button <b>306</b> can be replacement with an input to detect a user gesture, a spoken command (e.g., speech recognition), or any other appropriate user action that the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can detect as a user command.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In response to activation of the user control button <b>306</b>, the system <b>110</b><i>a </i>initiates a process in which the electronic record of duty file or other data file is at least partially transferred to the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>for purposes of storing a copy of the file at the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>or otherwise updating an older version of the file stored at the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. After the current version of the electronic record of duty file or other data file is stored at both the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>, the electronic record of duty file or other data file can be exported via the data port <b>302</b> of the electronic record of duty file or other data file. The operation for transferring the electronic record of duty file or other data file to the computer device <b>150</b> or to the portable storage device <b>152</b> can be an automatic process that requires no further user input on the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>and the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. For example, after the initial user input on the control button <b>306</b> of the user interface <b>208</b>, the electronic record of duty file or other data file will be automatically transferred via the data port <b>302</b> upon a proper connection with the computer device <b>150</b> or to the portable storage device <b>152</b>. As such, the driver or the inspector <b>154</b> can plug the inspector's device <b>150</b> or <b>152</b> into the communication port <b>302</b> either before or after the driver activates the user control button <b>306</b>, in which case a copy of the electronic record of duty file from the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>is transferred via the data port <b>302</b> to the inspector's device <b>150</b> or <b>152</b>. When finished, the inspector's device <b>150</b> or <b>152</b>, with the electronic record of duty file or other data file stored in the memory thereof, can then be disconnected from the communications port <b>302</b> and used by the vehicle inspector <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref>, the mobile communication device <b>112</b> can provide the user interface for the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>) and can be configured to display a variety of vehicle and driver-related information in response to wirelessly receiving vehicle usage information from the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the mobile communication device <b>112</b> that presents an example user interface screen <b>402</b> that summarizes the driver duty information for display during operation of the vehicle. In some implementations, the mobile communication device <b>112</b> can be any one of the mobile communication devices <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<b>112</b><i>c </i>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the user interface screen <b>402</b> can be accessed from a menu selection on the user interface <b>208</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment, the user interface <b>402</b> includes a driver name display area <b>404</b> which displays the name of the driver or other identification information associated with driver.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a collection of status indicators <b>406</b><i>a</i>-<b>406</b><i>d </i>provides visual indications of several operational parameters of the mobile communication device <b>112</b> and/or an associated electronic onboard recorder unit (e.g., the electronic onboard recorder units <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c</i>). For example, the status indicator <b>406</b><i>a </i>can display a visual indication of whether the mobile communication device <b>112</b> is connected to the transceiver <b>122</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by one of the communication links <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c</i>.

The status indicator <b>406</b><i>c </i>can display a visual indication of whether the mobile communication device <b>112</b> is receiving the GPS signals <b>108</b> form the GPS satellites <b>110</b>. The status indicator <b>406</b><i>d </i>can display a visual indication of whether the mobile communication device <b>112</b> is connected to an associated ECM, such when the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>is connected to the ECM <b>206</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by the data bus <b>204</b>.</p>

As such, the download button <b>408</b> may operate similarly to the previously described control button <b>306</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, the user interface <b>402</b> provides a number of inputs for the driver to alter his or her duty status, thereby affecting the driver's hours of service and the aforementioned electronic record of duty file. For example, the driver may interact with a user control <b>410</b><i>a </i>to indicate that he or she is in an &#x201c;off duty&#x201d; status. The driver can interact with a user control <b>410</b><i>b </i>to indicate that he or she is in a &#x201c;sleeper berth&#x201d; status (e.g., the driver is resting in a sleeper unit associated with his vehicle). The driver can interact with a user control <b>410</b><i>c </i>to indicate that he or she is operating his vehicle.

In some implementations, the user controls <b>410</b><i>a</i>-<b>410</b><i>d </i>can change their visual appearance to indicate the status currently selected by the driver. For example, the user control <b>410</b><i>a </i>may be displayed with a brighter color than the user controls <b>410</b><i>b</i>-<b>410</b><i>d </i>when the driver is in an &#x201c;off duty&#x201d; status.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the interface <b>402</b> of the mobile communication device <b>112</b> can also display indicators related to the driver's hours of service. For example, an indicator <b>412</b> displays the amount of time the driver has left before he or she is in violation of a predetermined drive time limit. An indicator <b>414</b> displays the amount of time the driver has left before he or she is in violation of a predetermined on duty time limit. An indicator <b>416</b> displays the consecutive amount of time the driver has been off duty.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, an indicator <b>420</b> displays the amount of drive time the driver has accrued in a given day, which (in this embodiment) has an upper limit of &#x201c;11 hours&#x201d; of total drive time before he or she is in violation of a predetermined drive time limit. Thus, the time values in indicators <b>412</b> and <b>420</b> will add up to the maximum drive time limit (&#x201c;11 hours&#x201d; in this embodiment). When the driver's total drive time in indicator <b>420</b> exceeds the upper limit, the indicator may change colors, for example, to a red color to warn the driver of the violation. Optionally, an indicator <b>422</b> displays the amount of on-duty time the driver has accrued in a given day, which (in this embodiment) has an upper limit of &#x201c;14 hours&#x201d; of total on-duty time before he or she is in violation of a predetermined on-duty time limit. Thus, the time values in indicators <b>422</b> and <b>414</b> will add up to the maximum on-duty time limit (&#x201c;14 hours&#x201d; in this embodiment). When the driver's total drive time in indicator <b>422</b> exceeds the upper limit, the indicator may change colors, for example, to a red color to warn the driver of the violation. Further, an indicator <b>424</b> displays the amount of total on-duty time the driver has accrued in a period of consecutive days (e.g., &#x201c;8 days&#x201d; in this embodiments). For example, the total on-duty time the driver has accrued in an eight-day period may have an upper limit of &#x201c;70 hours&#x201d; in this embodiment. When the driver's total drive time in indicator <b>424</b> exceeds the upper limit, the indicator may change colors, for example, to a red color to warn the driver of the violation.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, some embodiments for a process <b>500</b> can be performed to transferring an electronic report from an electronic onboard recorder unit (such as unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to an external computer or storage device (such as the inspector's device <b>150</b> or <b>152</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The process <b>500</b> may include an operation <b>510</b> in which a driver summary electronic report (e.g., an electronic record of duty file) in memory module of a handheld wireless display unit (e.g., the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). For example, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can collect the vehicle usage information over a period of time when a particular driver is using the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>, and the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can periodically transfer this vehicle usage information to the corresponding mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>linked thereto via the Bluetooth connection <b>114</b><i>a</i>. The mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can access the vehicle usage information along with other driver-specific information (e.g., driver identification information and the like) so as to generate the electronic record of duty file for storing on the memory of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The process <b>500</b> may also include an operation <b>520</b> in which a wireless communication from the handheld wireless display unit (e.g., the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>in this embodiment) is received to indicate that the driver summary electronic report (e.g., the electronic record of duty file in this embodiment) is approved for exporting from the electronic onboard recorder unit. For example, the driver can activate the user control button <b>306</b> as depicted <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> so that the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can prepare the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>for exporting the driver summary electronic report (e.g., the electronic record of duty file in this embodiment).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At operation <b>530</b> in the process <b>500</b>, the driver summary electronic report is also stored in a memory module of an electronic onboard recorder unit, which is wirelessly linked to the handheld wireless display unit. For example, the driver summary electronic report (e.g., the electronic record of duty file in this embodiment) can be wirelessly communicated via the Bluetooth link <b>114</b><i>a </i>from the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>to the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. This operation <b>530</b> may be performed in response to operation <b>520</b>. It should be understood from the description herein that the process <b>500</b> can be achieved by performing operation <b>530</b> either before or after the operation <b>520</b>. If operation <b>530</b> is performed before operation <b>520</b>, then operation <b>520</b> may cause the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>to update the driver summary electronic report (e.g., the electronic record of duty file in this embodiment) stored on the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>with a more recent version of the file.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At operation <b>540</b>, the electronic onboard recorder unit removably receives a USB connection device at a USB port arranged along the housing of the electronic onboard recorder unit. For example, as previously described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be equipped with a USB port <b>302</b> that is configured to removably receive the USB connector <b>304</b> from an inspector's portable computer <b>150</b> or portable storage device <b>152</b>. In such circumstances, the vehicle inspector <b>154</b> can conveniently plug the external computer device <b>150</b> or the portable storage device <b>152</b> into the USB port <b>302</b> provided by the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>to facilitate a transfer of the requested data from the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The process <b>500</b> may also include operation <b>550</b> in which the driver summary electronic report (e.g., the electronic record of duty file in this embodiment) is automatically transferred to via the USB port of the electronic onboard recorder unit to a portable external unit. For example, in response to the user input at operation <b>520</b> and the receipt of the USB connection device at operation <b>540</b>, the electronic record of duty file may automatically transferred via the USB port <b>302</b> the inspectors device <b>150</b> or device <b>152</b> without any further user input at the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>or its corresponding mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>. As such, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can be configured to output the electronic record of duty file directly to a temporarily connected external computer device <b>150</b> (e.g., a notebook computer) or a portable storage device <b>152</b> (e.g., a USB thumb drive, a portable hard drive) provided by a vehicle inspector <b>154</b> (e.g., a law enforcement official, a regulatory inspector, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The process <b>500</b> may optionally include operation <b>560</b> in which a signal is automatically received by the electronic onboard recorder unit indicating that the USB connection to the portable external unit is removed. For example, the USB connection device <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) can be removed from the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a</i>. When a USB device (sometimes referred to as a slave) is connected to or disconnected from a USB host (e.g., the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>in this embodiment), there is a change on these USB data lines. It is this change that the USB host can use to automatically detect that a device has been connected or removed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, some embodiments of a process <b>600</b> can be performed to communicate a driver summary electronic report via a cellular link established by a handheld wireless display unit (e.g., the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The process <b>600</b> may include an operation <b>610</b> in which vehicle usage information is wirelessly received at the handheld wireless display unit from an electronic onboard recorder unit mounted in a vehicle. For example, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can collect the vehicle usage information over a period of time when a particular driver is using the vehicle <b>102</b><i>a</i>, and the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>can periodically transfer this vehicle usage information to the corresponding mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>linked thereto via the Bluetooth connection <b>114</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In operation <b>620</b>, a driver summary electronic report (e.g., the electronic record of duty file in this embodiment) is stored in a memory module of a handheld wireless display unit, which is in wireless communication with the electronic onboard recorder unit. For example, the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can access the vehicle usage information along with other driver-specific information (e.g., driver identification information and the like) so as to generate the electronic record of duty file for storing on the memory of the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The process may also include operation <b>630</b> in which a cellular connection is established to a network for communication between the handheld wireless display unit and a control center. For example, the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can establish the wireless connection <b>120</b><i>a </i>with the transceiver <b>122</b>, which is in communication with the control center <b>104</b> through the base station <b>124</b> and the network <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In operation step <b>640</b>, the driver summary electronic report (e.g., the electronic record of duty file in this embodiment) is transmitted from handheld wireless display unit to the control center. For example, the electronic report and other data related to the driver or vehicle, which is stored on the mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a</i>, can be communication via the cellular link <b>120</b><i>a </i>to the network <b>130</b> and to the control center <b>104</b> for review and archival purposes. Thus, in some embodiments, the electronic onboard recorder unit <b>106</b><i>a </i>and the corresponding mobile communication device <b>112</b><i>a </i>can each individually operate to output the driver summary electronic report.</p>
