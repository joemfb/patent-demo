<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention allows travel organizations to ensure that basic group, or &#x201c;Core,&#x201d; travel medical coverage is in effect for their travelers while allowing travelers the ability to upgrade the &#x201c;Core&#x201d; insurance if needed or desired. Thus, the organization need not purchase excess insurance, thereby reducing the organization's liability for their group purchase decision. Until now, combining group and individual travel medical insurance has been impossible. Individual travel medical insurance policies could be customized, but travelers covered by a group policy had to accept the coverage their organizations chose. The present invention allows travelers with different needs and tastes from around the world to customize group travel insurance coverage according to their needs and desires. By offering choice, the present invention reduces the likelihood that travelers can successfully claim later that insurance required under the group program was inadequate.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Application is based upon but does not claim the benefit of Provisional Application No. 61/110,982, filed in the US Patent and Trademark Office on 3 Jun. 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a system and method of allowing travelers <b>150</b> who are traveling with a group such as an international organization, including but not limited to international volunteers with charitable organizations and international travelers <b>150</b> associated with a commercial traveling group, to combine group and individual travel insurance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Today's group travel sponsoring organizations and individual travelers <b>150</b> are more concerned than ever about personal safety and security. Not only is physical safety more in question when traveling than it has ever been, the safety and proper delivery of a traveler's items is also less reliable than it has been in the past. Travelers <b>150</b> can need help in getting out of situations such as natural disasters or political unrest, and travelers <b>150</b> may want their insurance to link together travel programs and personal voyages. With these increasing demands for personal security and security of the traveler's belongings, traveler's insurance, especially for international travel, is now virtually required for each traveler to carry.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Persons traveling as volunteers for nonprofit or government-funded organizations may not have any life or accident insurance whatsoever, or the insurance they have in their home country may not respond well to incidents that occur outside of their home country. The volunteer may be a recent graduate from a high school, college or university, a member of a religion-based volunteer group, a member of a volunteer medical team, a corporate executive, or any other person who travels for volunteer purposes. Insureds may also be travelers <b>150</b> on educational or travel programs that do not include volunteering. The organization may be for-profit or non-profit. These travelers <b>150</b> don't usually buy travel insurance on their own, but generally rely on the travel organization to provide insurance for them.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If a traveler travels with an established group, such as a tour group, travel insurance is provided, with very favorable terms, in the cost of the tour. That level of travel insurance is generally not determined by the individual traveler. The benefit levels and terms for travel insurance are set for groups, and individuals have not been able to customize the limits or kinds of insurances they want. In general, travel insurance for individuals is not used by most travel groups because it does not provide enough benefits for risk management and cost; the organizations commonly use group coverage for volunteers and participants.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Upgrade <b>195</b> options have not been available to people insured under a group travel program in the way that they are available to individual travelers <b>150</b> who purchase individual travel insurance.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The term &#x201c;risk-taker&#x201d; is used herein to mean these various potential insurers and insurance mechanisms that are available to the traveler and the travel organization; this term may comprise a traditional insurance company, a self-insurance plan, or any other mechanism that accepts the risk and responsibility of payment of all or part of a client's medical expense <b>100</b> as.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a system and method for an individual to convert group travel insurance to an individual insurance plan while still using both. The present invention does not describe a portability plan; an individual can, under the present invention, add an individual insurance component onto a group travel insurance plan as an enhancement.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The organization that sponsors the travel purchases a basic amount of coverage for their travelers <b>150</b>. Then each individual traveler is directed to a website <b>160</b> or other e-commerce means (including Web 2.0, USENET, e-mail, telephone <b>720</b>, fax <b>705</b><i>e</i>, and FTP) where he or she can choose customized upgrade <b>195</b> options for him-or herself and/or family members and traveling companions such as wards or children under the program.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also provides systems and methods to design individual traveler insurance products for a traveler in a manner that provides the individual traveler with the benefits of group traveler insurance plans and rates.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention allows travel organizations to ensure that basic group, or &#x201c;Core,&#x201d; travel medical coverage is in effect for their travelers while allowing travelers the ability to upgrade the &#x201c;Core&#x201d; insurance if needed or desired. This means the organization does not have to buy too much insurance and the organization's liability for their group purchase decision is reduced. Until now, it has not been possible for travelers to combine group and individual travel medical insurance. Travelers buying individual travel medical insurance could customize their policies, but if the travelers were part of a group policy, they had to accept the coverage their organizations chose for them. The present invention allows travelers with different needs and tastes from around the world to customize group travel insurance coverage according to their needs and desires. By offering choice, the present invention reduces the likelihood that travelers can successfully claim later that insurance required under the group program was inadequate.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a group sponsor <b>105</b> arranges group insurance coverage (referred to herein as &#x201c;Core Coverage&#x201d;) with a risk taker <b>110</b> that provides travel medical insurance or insurance of a similar nature through an insurance broker <b>120</b> or through the risk taker <b>110</b> directly. It is also within the scope of the invention for the Core Coverage <b>100</b> plan to be a self-insurance plan or a high-retention or captive plan.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the group sponsor <b>105</b> purchases a basic, or &#x201c;Core,&#x201d; coverage that all persons traveling <b>150</b> with the group must carry;</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the individual traveler <b>150</b> has the choice to upgrade <b>195</b> his or her insurance package or to carry only the &#x201c;Core&#x201d; coverage <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the risk taker <b>110</b>, the insurance carrier, or the organization <b>105</b> or the Core program <b>100</b> manager <b>170</b> or administrator <b>180</b> relays the availability of the individual choice option to the individual travelers <b>150</b> and refers them to a website <b>160</b> designed for adding individual upgrades <b>195</b> to the &#x201c;Core&#x201d; insurance <b>100</b> purchased by the organization <b>105</b>. The term &#x201c;administrator&#x201d; <b>180</b> or &#x201c;program manager&#x201d; <b>170</b> may refer to service provided by the risk taker <b>110</b>. The term &#x201c;website&#x201d; <b>160</b> may refer to a social networking or e-commerce website. The website <b>160</b> is, in the current embodiment, provided by the Core Travel Program manager <b>170</b>; however, it is within the scope of the invention for the upgrade website <b>160</b> or other e-commerce means to be provided by the international travel organization <b>105</b> or broker <b>120</b>. In that embodiment, the international travel organization or broker <b>120</b> would collect the data regarding individual upgrades <b>195</b> and payment information <b>405</b> and forward that information <b>195</b>, <b>405</b> to the insurance carrier or broker <b>120</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the upgrade website <b>160</b> or other e-commerce means may be provided by the risk-taker <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, those travelers <b>150</b> who choose to do so can make upgrade purchases <b>195</b> directly on the website <b>160</b> or through other e-commerce means and receive a confirmation of upgrade <b>510</b> coverage from the website <b>160</b> or from the administrator <b>180</b> or Core program manager <b>170</b> or risk taker <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the premiums <b>610</b> for individual upgrades <b>195</b> are sent to the same risk taker <b>110</b> who provides the Core policy <b>100</b> to the group, and who upgrades <b>195</b> that individual's <b>150</b> insurance package <b>100</b> based on his or her choices for upgrades <b>195</b>. The website <b>160</b> or other e-commerce means may provide a commercially available mechanism that allows the traveler <b>150</b> to pay <b>405</b> for the additional coverage <b>195</b> online; alternatively, the traveler <b>150</b> may choose to pay the premiums <b>610</b> for coverage by mailing payment to the international travel organization <b>105</b> or to the risk taker <b>110</b> or the broker <b>120</b>, either of which may be the designated payee for the purpose of purchasing additional coverage <b>195</b>. Upgrades <b>195</b> occur before premiums <b>610</b> are sent; they do not occur, however, until after purchases <b>195</b> are confirmed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the individual traveler receives a communication <b>705</b> from the risk taker <b>110</b>, the risk taker <b>110</b>'s computer system, the travel group <b>105</b>, or the administrator <b>180</b> confirming and binding the coverage.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a travel group sponsor <b>105</b> arranges &#x201c;Core Coverage&#x201d; <b>100</b> with a travel risk taker <b>110</b> through a broker <b>120</b> or agent <b>130</b> or through the risk taker <b>110</b> directly.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The risk taker <b>110</b> is not a party to this invention and the choice of insurance carrier is interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">International travel organizations <b>105</b> may serve as travel group sponsors <b>105</b> and purchase &#x201c;Core&#x201d; insurance coverage <b>100</b> for travelers <b>150</b> planning to travel on programs that may include educational or volunteer programs sponsored by the travel group sponsor <b>105</b>. The &#x201c;Core&#x201d; coverage <b>100</b> is generally an assortment of benefits that may include medical expense <b>100</b><i>a</i>, medical evacuation <b>100</b><i>b</i>, death benefit <b>100</b><i>c</i>, disability <b>100</b><i>d</i>, cancellation <b>100</b><i>e</i>, &#x201c;tail medical&#x201d; <b>100</b><i>f</i>, trip interruption <b>100</b><i>g</i>, and/or reunion benefits <b>100</b><i>h</i>. In addition, there can be evacuation extension for natural disaster and political instability <b>100</b><i>i</i>, for which the participant need not experience accident or illness for the benefit to apply. In addition, baggage <b>100</b><i>j</i>, personal property <b>100</b><i>k </i>and, automobile-related <b>1001</b> benefits may be included, including collision and personal injury insurance. Specifically, automobile-related <b>1001</b> &#x201c;Core&#x201d; coverage <b>100</b> may also include coverage for being the driver of an automobile <b>100</b><i>m</i>, coverage for third-party liability <b>100</b><i>n</i>, or trip delay and expanded travel coverages <b>100</b><i>o</i>. The plan type may be a self-insurance plan, a high-retention plan, or a captive plan. Coverage can be provided for individual travelers, the individual traveler's family members, and the individual traveler's traveling companions (the traveler's children and the traveler's wards).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The &#x201c;Core&#x201d; benefits <b>100</b> apply automatically to each traveler <b>150</b>. The assortment is not fixed and is negotiated with the broker <b>120</b> and/or the risk-taker <b>110</b> for each sponsoring group <b>105</b>. The enrollment is sent to a website <b>160</b> for download by the organization <b>105</b>, the program manager <b>170</b>, the administrator <b>180</b>, or by use of an Application Programming Interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The broker <b>120</b> or &#x201c;Core&#x201d; program manager <b>170</b> provides the travel group sponsor <b>105</b> with information about how travelers <b>150</b> can upgrade their individual benefits <b>195</b> on the website <b>160</b>, and the organization <b>105</b> chooses the upgrade assortment <b>195</b> it wishes to allow travelers <b>150</b> to access. Travelers <b>150</b> can optionally extend the dates covered by the existing coverage <b>100</b>, improve the limits of the existing coverage <b>100</b>, and/or add new coverage <b>195</b>. New coverage <b>195</b> comprises any travel- and/or medical-related coverage that is offered by the risk taker <b>110</b> and the sponsoring organization <b>105</b>, but is not included by the sponsoring organization <b>105</b> in the &#x201c;Core&#x201d; coverage <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The organization <b>105</b> tells their travelers <b>150</b> of the upgrade option <b>195</b> using any available means of communication including print, telephonic, and/or electronic, and refers the travelers <b>150</b> to the website <b>160</b> or other e-commerce means provided by the program manager <b>170</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the website <b>160</b> or other e-commerce solution may be provided by the risk-taker <b>110</b>. In yet an alternate embodiment, the website <b>160</b> or other e-commerce means may be provided by the sponsoring organization <b>105</b> or broker <b>120</b> for the purpose of allowing the traveler <b>150</b> to upgrade <b>195</b> Core insurance coverage <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Travelers <b>150</b> can optionally make upgrade <b>195</b> purchases directly on the website <b>160</b> or alternate e-commerce means, and receive a confirmation <b>705</b> of upgraded coverage <b>195</b>. The upgrade <b>195</b> is automatically recorded on the traveler's <b>150</b> enrollment information, usually in a database <b>165</b>.

<p id="p-0038" num="0056">The upgrade <b>195</b> is independent of the travel organization <b>105</b> and upgrades <b>195</b> play no role in the travel group <b>105</b> administration. At times when the newly insured traveler's <b>150</b> name is not in the database <b>165</b>, the organization <b>105</b> can be asked to confirm that insured's <b>150</b> eligibility for coverage, either to a requestor or by downloading the traveler's <b>150</b> information.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0057">In the present embodiment, the same risk taker <b>110</b> that provides the Core coverage <b>100</b> provides the upgrade benefits <b>195</b>; it is, however, within the scope of the invention for a risk-taker <b>620</b> that does not provide the Core coverage <b>100</b> to provide the upgrade benefits <b>195</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0058">The upgrade <b>195</b> process can also be accomplished through the use of a paper-based or telephone-based system.

The communication <b>705</b> contains the name of the insured person <b>150</b>, the coverages <b>100</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>extended, improved, or added, a contact telephone number <b>720</b> and email address <b>730</b>, the name of the risk taker <b>110</b>, the policy number <b>740</b>, travel assistance information <b>750</b>, and a limitations statement <b>760</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0066">It is within the scope of the invention for the system or an employee or agent <b>130</b> of the risk taker <b>110</b> to confirm and bind coverage <b>705</b> using an email <b>705</b>a, a SMS text message <b>705</b><i>b</i>, a paper letter <b>705</b><i>c</i>, a downloaded confirmation communication <b>705</b><i>d</i>, or a fax <b>705</b><i>e </i>to the traveler <b>150</b> who has upgraded <b>195</b> his or her Core overage <b>100</b>. The communication <b>705</b> contains the name of insured person <b>150</b>, the coverages <b>100</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>extended, improved, or added, a contact telephone number <b>720</b> and email address <b>730</b>, the name of the risk taker <b>110</b>, the policy number <b>740</b>, travel assistance information <b>750</b>, and a limitations statement <b>760</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, participants can print individualized insurance Identification cards <b>805</b> from their organization's customized website <b>160</b>. The Identification card <b>805</b> contains the relevant information about the participant <b>150</b> that reflects information pulled from the Core Travel database <b>165</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0068">It is also within the scope of the invention for an individualized insurance Identification card <b>805</b> to be printed and distributed to the traveler <b>150</b> by the risk taker <b>110</b> or by the travel group <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0069">It is within the scope of the invention that, rather than an email <b>705</b><i>a</i>, the traveler is sent a hard-copy confirmation letter <b>705</b><i>c </i>that binds the coverage. The traveler <b>150</b> receives a letter <b>705</b><i>c </i>sent from the insurer that confirms and binds coverage. The letter <b>705</b><i>c </i>contains the name of the insured person <b>150</b>, the coverages <b>100</b><i>a</i>-<i>p </i>extended, improved, or added, a contact telephone number <b>720</b> and email address <b>730</b>, the name of the risk taker <b>110</b>, the policy number <b>740</b>, travel assistance information <b>750</b>, and a limitations statement <b>760</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0070">It is a benefit of this invention that it could be licensed to insurance companies or brokers. This invention is particularly useful to organizations that have insured travelers originating from all around the world and traveling worldwide. Often these travelers do not pass through the United States and thus need access to an international venue for insurance purchase. These organizations are often at a loss to provide group travel insurance that fits the cultural, operational or personal demands of all their travelers. People going to Western countries often want higher medical expense limits, while people going to developing countries do not request this. People from certain parts of the world value higher death benefits. Some travelers require trip cancellation and baggage insurance, while others eschew it. Some travelers want to travel just before or after their official program and need to extend their coverage. Organizations can use Core travel insurance to cater to these different constituencies. It satisfies demand, keeps premium costs low, and lowers liability risk associated with buying group travel medical insurance that does not work as the traveler wishes.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0071">It is a benefit of this invention that the Core insurance program is easy for travelers to use and carries no administrative burden for the organization purchasing the Core coverage. The introduction of the website or other e-commerce means as a medium for managing individual upgrades makes the product highly workable for the traveler, the travel organization, and the risk taker. Travel insurance upgrades are, in the present embodiment, accomplished through a website and the website's database. In an alternate embodiment, another e-commerce means may substitute for the website; examples include an FTP site, a USENET site, e-mail, and Web 2.0 functionality. The database may be a commercially available database product or a custom-designed database <b>165</b>. It is populated through the use of an application wizard program associated with the website <b>160</b> or other e-commerce means. The application wizard incorporates questions that are asked of the traveler; the responses are put into a series of fields; the fields may comprise, but are not limited to:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0072">An individual traveler's name (this is known to the system if the traveler logs in to upgrade his or her coverage)</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0073">The individual traveler's permanent address (this is known to the system if the traveler logs in to upgrade his or her coverage)</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0074">The individual traveler's address while traveling (if known) (this is known to the system if the traveler logs in to upgrade his or her coverage)</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0075">The individual traveler's upgrade coverage options, including upgraded medical coverage, upgraded lost baggage coverage, upgraded extended-trip coverage, coverage for being the driver of an automobile, third party liability, trip delay and expanded travel coverages, and upgraded trip cancellation coverage, upgraded lost baggage coverage, upgraded extended-trip coverage, and upgraded trip cancellation coverage;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0076">The individual traveler's upgrade coverage price;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0077">The individual traveler's credit card or other payment information;</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0007" num="0078">The individual traveler's destination (this is known to the system if the traveler logs in to upgrade his or her coverage);</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0008" num="0079">The individual traveler's country of origin (this is known to the system if the traveler logs in to upgrade his or her coverage); and</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0009" num="0080">The individual traveler's travel dates (this is known to the system if the traveler logs in to upgrade his or her coverage).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0081">In the present embodiment of the invention, the traveler must log in to the system to upgrade his or her coverages. However, it is within the scope of the invention that the traveler may be able to upgrade his or her insurance coverages merely with an identifier such as social security number, driver's license number, organization-issued identification number, or other unique identifier. There may also be electronic means by which traveler's information may be automatically downloaded to the carrier by groups or website <b>160</b><i>s </i>using electronic systems such as API. The traveler may be required to enter a pair of identifiers, such as social security number and zip code for example; other identifier pairs are also within the scope of the invention. This identifier may or may not provide access to the traveler's complete profile, but the identifier does link to the profile such that additional coverage is assigned to that traveler when additional coverage is purchased.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0082">It is also within the scope of the invention for the traveler to upgrade his or her insurance by communicating his or her wishes via letter, email, fax, or voice to an agent or employee of the risk-taker or travel company. In this case, the agent or employee inputs the traveler's information, accepts payment, and issues the upgrade or upgrades. The agent or employee then sends a communication using email, fax, downloadable written communication, or hard-copy (postal) delivery, or any combination, to the traveler confirming and binding the coverages. The communication contains the name of the insured person, the coverages extended, improved, or added, a contact telephone number and email address, the name of the risk taker, the policy number, travel assistance information, and a limitations statement.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0086">The program can provide coverage for travelers going from the US to any country covered by the carrier's traveler's insurance; it can also provide coverage for travelers traveling from any non-US country to the US or any other country, depending on the limitations of the carrier's traveler's insurance.
