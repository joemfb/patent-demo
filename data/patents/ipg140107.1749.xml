<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-010576 filed with the Japan Patent Office on Jan. 21, 2010, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a medical guidewire.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There have conventionally been proposed a variety of medical guidewires for guiding a medical equipment such as a catheter which is used by being inserted into tubular organs such as blood vessels, digestive tracts and ureters, and intracorporeal tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a medical guidewire described in Patent Literature 1 (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2008-307367) is made up of a wire body, a coil, a resin coating layer coated on this coil, and an annular member. The wire body has a certain diameter in a portion closer to the rear end than a tip portion, which is formed in tapered shape. The coil is a spiral coil that is wound around the tip portion of the wire body. The annular member is filled in a stepped space between a proximal end portion of the resin coating layer and the wire body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, a hydrophilic lubricating layer is formed on the outer surface of the resin coating layer and the outer surface of the annular member in the medical guidewire described in Patent Literature 1.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is described in Patent Literature 1 that in the case of using the medical guidewire and medical equipment in combination, the medical guidewire is prevented from getting caught in the medical equipment according to the invention described in this literature.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the medical guidewire described in Patent Literature 1, the outer surface of the resin coating layer and the outer surface of the annular member are coated with the hydrophilic lubricating layer. However, there has been a problem with this medical guidewire in that in a curved area of a guiding catheter, the sliding resistance between the medical guidewire and the guiding catheter increases.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, during an operation by a physician, the medical guidewire and the guiding catheter continuously slide. It has thus been necessary to consider the durability of the medical guidewire which can keep the sliding resistance between the medical guidewire and the guiding catheter reduced as long as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, in the medical guidewire described in Patent Literature 1, the annular member is filled in the stepped space between the proximal end portion of the resin coating layer and the wire body. However, a depressed portion with a corner is formed between the wire body and the annular member. There has thus been a problem in that the resistance generated at the time of manipulating the medical guidewire also increases due to this depressed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, since the depressed portion of the medical guidewire described in Patent Literature 1 has the corner, there has been a problem in that blood or bodily fluid may be accumulated in this depressed portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances. A first object of the present invention is to provide a medical guidewire reduced in resistance generated in the case of curving a guiding catheter. Further, a second object of the present invention is to provide a medical guidewire improved in durability that can keep the resistance reduced for a long time. Moreover, a third object of the present invention is to provide a medical guidewire which does not inhibit the flow of blood or bodily fluid at the time of manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A medical guidewire of the present invention is a medical guidewire including a core shaft and a coiled body that covers at least a tip portion of the core shaft, wherein especially the core shaft has a cylindrical part, with a smaller diameter than that of the coiled body, on a proximal end side of the coiled body, and the cylindrical part is coated with a hydrophilic material.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A first aspect of the invention is a medical guidewire including a core shaft and a coiled body that covers at least a tip portion of the core shaft, wherein especially the core shaft has a cylindrical part, with a smaller diameter than that of the coiled body, on a proximal end side of the coiled body, and the cylindrical part is coated with a hydrophilic material.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, a second aspect of the invention is the medical guidewire according to the first aspect, wherein the coiled body is also coated with the hydrophilic material, and a thickness of the hydrophilic material coated on the cylindrical part is larger than that of the hydrophilic material coated on the coiled body.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, a third aspect of the invention is the medical guidewire according to the second aspect, wherein a diameter of the cylindrical part including the hydrophilic material is smaller than that of the coiled body including the hydrophilic material.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, a fourth aspect of the invention is the medical guidewire according to any one of the first to third aspects, wherein an area from a proximal end portion of the coiled body to the cylindrical part is formed in streamlined shape.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, a fifth aspect of the invention is the medical guidewire according to the fourth aspect, wherein a middle area from the proximal end portion of the coiled body to the cylindrical part is formed in linear shape.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, a sixth aspect of the invention is the medical guidewire according to any one of the first to fifth aspects, wherein the cylindrical part is provided within a range of 50 to 350 mm from the tip of the core shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the first aspect of the invention, the core shaft of the medical guidewire has the cylindrical part, with a smaller diameter than that of the coiled body, on the proximal end side of the coiled body. Further, the cylindrical part is coated with the hydrophilic material. It is thus possible to ensure a space between the guiding catheter and the cylindrical part of the medical guidewire inserted inside the guiding catheter. Moreover, this core shaft is provided with the cylindrical part having a certain diameter. Therefore, even in the case of the inner surface of the guiding catheter and the outer surface of the guidewire coming into contact with each other when the guiding catheter is curved, the manipulability of the guidewire remains unchanged. Furthermore, the cylindrical part is coated with the hydrophilic material. It is thus possible to further reduce the sliding resistance between the guiding catheter and the medical guidewire. Hence it is possible to provide a medical guidewire with favorable manipulability for a physician who performs an operation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, according to the second aspect of the invention, the coiled body is also coated with the hydrophilic material, and the thickness of the hydrophilic material coated on the cylindrical part is larger than that of the hydrophilic material coated on the coiled body. Therefore, in addition to the effect of the first aspect, even in the case of the physician continuing the operation for a long period of time, it is possible to keep the resistance between the guiding catheter and the medical guidewire reduced. That is, the durability of the medical guidewire can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Further, according to the third aspect of the invention, the diameter of the cylindrical part including the hydrophilic material is smaller than that of the coiled body including the hydrophilic material. Therefore, in addition to the effect of the second aspect, it is possible to provide a medical guidewire with further favorable manipulability for the physician who performs the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, according to the fourth aspect of the invention, the area from the proximal end portion of the coiled body to the cylindrical part is formed in streamlined shape. Therefore, in addition to the effect of the first aspect, the sliding resistance can be reduced in the case of pulling the medical guidewire inside the catheter, a tubular organ or an intracorporeal tissue. Hence it is possible to provide a medical guidewire with further favorable manipulability for the physician who performs the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the fifth aspect of the invention, the middle area from the proximal end portion of the coiled body to the cylindrical part is formed in linear shape. Therefore, in addition to the effect of the fourth aspect, the blood or the bodily fluid is not accumulated, and the flow of the blood or the bodily fluid is not inhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, according to the invention in accordance with the sixth aspect of the invention, the cylindrical part is provided within the range of 50 to 350 mm from the tip of the core shaft. It is thus possible to provide the medical guidewire particularly suitable for a curved shape that occurs in the case of applying the guiding catheter to the heart.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Hereinafter, the medical guidewire of the present invention will be described based on preferred embodiments illustrated in the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an overall view of a medical guidewire according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is to be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a description is given with the left side defined as a &#x201c;proximal end&#x201d;, and the right side defined as a &#x201c;tip&#x201d; for convenience of description.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the medical guidewire is reduced in length direction, and illustrated in an overall schematic manner for the sake of easy understanding. An overall size illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is thus different from an actual size.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a medical guidewire <b>1</b> is made up of a core shaft <b>3</b> and a coiled body <b>5</b> that covers a tip portion of the core shaft <b>3</b>. The tip portion of the core shaft <b>3</b> and a tip portion of the coiled body <b>5</b> are fixed to each other at an extreme tip portion <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A material for the core shaft <b>3</b> is not particularly limited. In the present embodiment, stainless steel (SUS304) is used as the material for the core shaft <b>3</b>. Other than that, a material such as a super elastic alloy like an Ni&#x2014;Ti alloy, a piano wire, or a tungsten wire may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As a whole, the core shaft <b>3</b> has a shape tapering down from the proximal end side toward the tip side. The core shaft <b>3</b> includes: a first cylindrical part <b>21</b> located in a position with a predetermined distance from the proximal end; a first taper part <b>27</b> adjacent to the tip side of the first cylindrical part <b>21</b>; a second cylindrical part <b>11</b> (corresponding to the cylindrical part of the present invention) adjacent to the tip side of the first taper part <b>27</b>; a second taper part <b>25</b> adjacent to the tip side of the second cylindrical part <b>11</b>; a third cylindrical part <b>19</b> adjacent to the tip side of the second taper part <b>25</b>; a third taper part <b>29</b> adjacent to the tip side of the third cylindrical part <b>19</b>; a fourth cylindrical part <b>31</b> adjacent to the tip side of the third taper part <b>29</b>; a taper press part <b>33</b> adjacent to the tip side of the fourth cylindrical part <b>31</b>; and a cylindrical press part <b>35</b> adjacent to the tip side of the taper press part <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is to be noted that the taper press part <b>33</b> is one with its side section formed in taper shape by pressing. The cylindrical press part <b>35</b> is one with its side section formed in cylindrical shape by pressing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The second cylindrical part <b>11</b> is formed in a range of 50 to 350 mm from the tip of the medical guidewire <b>1</b>. Herein, the range of 50 to 350 mm is a range corresponding to an area where the medical guidewire <b>1</b> is curved by a relatively large amount when used along with a guiding catheter disposed in an area from a femoral artery to a heart.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Herein, an operation of using the medical guidewire <b>1</b> and the guiding catheter as medical equipment in combination will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref> each illustrate an explanatory drawing of the state of a guiding catheter <b>51</b> as medical equipment disposed in the area from the femoral artery to the heart, and the medical guidewire <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a state where the tip of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> has reached a left main trunk <b>61</b> of a left coronary artery <b>67</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a state where the tip of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> has reached a stenosis part <b>71</b> located in a left anterior descending artery <b>63</b> of the left coronary artery <b>67</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a state where the tip of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> has reached a distal part of the left anterior descending artery <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this operation, first, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a tip portion of the guiding catheter <b>51</b> is made to proceed from the femoral artery to a descending aorta <b>57</b>, an aortic arc <b>55</b> and an ascending aorta <b>65</b>. This tip portion is then fixedly placed in a right coronary artery <b>59</b> just before an aortic valve <b>53</b> or at one inlet of the left coronary artery <b>67</b> (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the guiding catheter <b>51</b> is fixedly placed at the inlet of the left coronary artery <b>67</b>). The medical guidewire <b>1</b> is then inserted inside the fixedly placed guiding catheter <b>51</b>, and protruded from the tip portion of the guiding catheter <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is to be noted that the left coronary artery <b>67</b> is made up of the left main trunk <b>61</b>, a left circumflex artery <b>69</b> and the left anterior descending artery <b>63</b>. The left main trunk <b>61</b> is located upstream of the artery. The left circumflex artery <b>69</b> is located downstream of one branch in the left main trunk <b>61</b>. The left anterior descending artery <b>63</b> is located downstream of the other branch in the left main trunk <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Herein, for example, in the case where the stenosis part <b>71</b> exists in a predetermined position of the left anterior descending artery <b>63</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the medical guidewire <b>1</b> is made to proceed to the position of the stenosis part <b>71</b>. Thereby, the portion formed with the stenosis part <b>71</b> in the artery is treated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the guidewire <b>1</b> can also be made to proceed to the distal part of the left anterior descending artery <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>, the fixedly placed guiding catheter <b>51</b> extends almost linearly from the femoral artery, and is curved in a first area <b>73</b> from the descending aorta <b>57</b> to the aortic arc <b>55</b>. Moreover, the guiding catheter <b>51</b> is curved in a second area <b>75</b> from the ascending aorta <b>65</b> to the left coronary artery <b>67</b>, with a smaller radius of curvature, and is curved in a third area <b>77</b> in the vicinity of the inlet of the left coronary artery <b>67</b>, with an even smaller radius of curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> is formed in the range of 50 to 350 mm from the tip of the medical guidewire <b>1</b>. This range corresponds to the third area <b>77</b>, the second area <b>75</b>, and the first area <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In such a manner, in the medical guidewire <b>1</b>, the range of 50 to 350 mm from the tip is formed in cylindrical shape as the second cylindrical part <b>11</b>. This is for making uniform the sliding resistance between the guiding catheter <b>51</b> and the medical guidewire <b>1</b> in the third area <b>77</b>, the second area <b>75</b> and the first area <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In contrast, when the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> is formed not in cylindrical shape but in, for example, tapered shape or conical shape, the sliding resistance may change in the third area <b>77</b>, the second area <b>75</b> or the first area <b>73</b>. Hence the manipulability of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> may decrease during an operation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the radii of curvature of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> in the second area <b>75</b> and the third area <b>77</b> are smaller than the radius of curvature in the first area <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Hence, the effect can also be obtained even when the formation range of the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> is restricted only to a range corresponding to the second area <b>75</b> and the third area <b>77</b>. In that case, the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> may be formed in a range of 50 to 250 mm from the tip of the medical guidewire <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">It is to be noted that in the present embodiment, the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> is formed based on the shape of the guiding catheter <b>51</b> disposed in the area from the femoral artery to the heart. However, a curved position varies depending on the site in the body where the guiding catheter <b>51</b> is used. Therefore, in the case of using the guiding catheter <b>51</b> in another site in the body, the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> is preferably formed in accordance with a curved position of that site in the body.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Moreover, in the case of using the medical guidewire <b>1</b> and a medical equipment other than the guiding catheter in combination, the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> is preferably formed in accordance with a curved shape of the medical equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">However, in any case, common points are to form the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> in cylindrical shape, to form the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> on the side closer to the proximal end than the coiled body <b>5</b>, and to form the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> with a smaller outer diameter than that of the coiled body <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Forming the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> on the proximal end side of the coiled body <b>5</b>, with the smaller outer diameter than that of the coiled body <b>5</b>, exerts the following effect.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">That is, when the coiled body <b>5</b> including the extreme tip portion <b>9</b> of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> is inserted inside the body, the coiled body <b>5</b> passes through the inside of the body. Hence, in the body, a cavity corresponding to the outer diameter of the coiled body <b>5</b> is formed on the proximal end side of the coiled body <b>5</b>. The second cylindrical part <b>11</b> is formed, with a smaller outer diameter than that of the coiled body <b>5</b>, on the proximal end side of the coiled body <b>5</b>. For this reason, a space is generated between the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> and an inner wall of the cavity formed by passage of the coiled body <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Generation of this space can reduce the sliding resistance between the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> and the inner wall of the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, as illustrated using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>, when the guiding catheter <b>51</b> is curved, or even when the medical guidewire <b>1</b> itself is solely curved in the body, it is possible to reduce the sliding resistance between the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> and the cavity formed by passage of the coiled body <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A material for the coiled body <b>5</b> is not particularly limited. In the present embodiment, stainless steel (SUS304) is used as the material for the coiled body <b>5</b>. Other than that, similarly to the core shaft <b>3</b>, a material such as a super elastic alloy like an Ni&#x2014;Ti alloy, a piano wire, or a tungsten wire may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The coiled body <b>5</b> is wound in coiled shape around the tip portion of the core shaft <b>3</b>. The coiled body <b>5</b> is fixed by brazing to the tip portion of the core shaft <b>3</b> in a plurality of places, including a coil-tip brazed portion <b>15</b> continued to the extreme tip portion <b>9</b>, a plurality of coil-middle brazed portions that are located on the proximal end side of the coil-tip brazed portion <b>15</b> and include a coil-middle brazed portion <b>17</b>, and a coil-base-end brazed portion <b>13</b> located at the proximal end of the coiled body <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only one coil-middle brazed portion <b>17</b> is illustrated, and the other coil-middle brazed portions are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the vicinity of the extreme tip portion <b>9</b>, the coiled body <b>5</b> is wound so as to generate a space between adjacent wires of the coiled body <b>5</b>. On the other hand, on the proximal end side from the coil-middle brazed portion <b>17</b> that is adjacent to the proximal end side of the coil-tip brazed portion <b>15</b>, the coiled body <b>5</b> is wound such that adjacent wires of the coiled body <b>5</b> are in contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is to be noted that diameters of the wires of the coiled body <b>5</b> in the present embodiment are uniform. However, the diameters of the wires of the coiled body <b>5</b> may be decreased gradually from the proximal end toward the tip of the coiled body <b>5</b>. Further, the diameters of the wires of the coiled body <b>5</b> on the side closer to the tip than the coil-middle brazed portion <b>17</b> may be made smaller than those of the other wires of the coiled body <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Decreasing the diameters of the wires of the coiled body <b>5</b> gradually from the proximal end toward the tip of the coiled body <b>5</b> can gradually enhance the flexibility of the tip portion of the medical guidewire <b>1</b>. This is effective in the case of curving the entire coiled body <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Meanwhile, making smaller the diameters of the wires of the coiled body <b>5</b>, provided on the side closer to the tip than the coil-middle brazed portion <b>17</b>, than those of the other wires of the coiled body <b>5</b> can enhance the flexibility of a portion on the side closer to the tip than the coil-middle brazed portion <b>17</b>. This is effective in the case of curving the area on the side closer to the tip than the coil-middle brazed portion <b>17</b>, with a relatively small radius of curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, the outer surfaces of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> from the extreme tip portion <b>9</b> to the coiled body <b>5</b> and the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> are coated with a hydrophilic material <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Examples of the hydrophilic material may include a cellulose-based polymer, a polyethylene oxide-based polymer, a maleic anhydride-based polymer (e.g., maleic anhydride copolymer such as methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer), an acrylamide-based polymer (e.g., polyacrylamide, polyglycidyl methacrylate-dimethylacrylamide block copolymer), water-soluble nylon, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and hyaluronate.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is to be noted that the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> in the present embodiment is hyaluronate.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The hydrophilic material <b>7</b> coated on the medical guidewire <b>1</b> reduces the sliding resistance of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> inside the catheter, the tubular organ or the intracorporeal tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">By coating the second cylindrical part <b>11</b>, with a smaller outer diameter than that of the coiled body <b>5</b>, with the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> in the present embodiment, it is possible to significantly reduce the sliding resistance between the guiding catheter and the medical guidewire <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">By applying the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> onto the outer surfaces of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> from the extreme tip portion <b>9</b> to the coiled body <b>5</b> and the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> such that the thickness is made uniform, it is possible to sufficiently reduce the sliding resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It should be noted that the number of sliding of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> and the guiding catheter increases when a long period of time is required for the physician to perform the operation. In the present embodiment, consideration is also given in that respect.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a partially enlarged view of the second cylindrical part of the core shaft in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> coated on the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> is formed with a larger thickness than that of the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> coated on the coiled body <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">That is, the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> is formed on the surface of the core shaft <b>3</b> such that a distance from the outer surface of the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> to the outer surface of the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> is longer than a distance from the outer surface of the coiled body <b>5</b> to the outer surface of the hydrophilic material <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> coated on the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> is formed with a larger thickness than those of the hydrophilic materials <b>7</b> coated on the first taper part <b>27</b> and the second taper part <b>25</b> which are adjacent to the second cylindrical part <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>, even when the medical guidewire <b>1</b> is slid for a long period of time with the guiding catheter curved, the sliding resistance in the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> does not increase.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the diameter of the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> including the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> is desirably smaller than that of the coiled body <b>5</b> including the hydrophilic material <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Making smaller the diameter of the second cylindrical part <b>11</b> including the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> than that of the coiled body <b>5</b> including the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> can generate a space between a cavity, formed by passage of the coiled body <b>5</b> through the inside of the guiding catheter, the tubular organ or the intracorporeal tissue, and the second cylindrical part located on the proximal end side of the coiled body <b>5</b>. Thereby, even when the medical guidewire <b>1</b> is slid for a long period of time with the guiding catheter curved, the sliding resistance between the guiding catheter and the medical guidewire <b>1</b> can be kept low.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Meanwhile, it is also preferable to reduce the sliding resistance of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> not only in the case of pushing the medical guidewire <b>1</b> but also in the case of pulling the medical guidewire <b>1</b>. In the present invention, consideration is also given in that respect.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a partially enlarged view of the state of connection between the core shaft and the coiled body in the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> is applied so as to form a streamlined shape in the area from the proximal end portion of the coiled body <b>5</b> to the second taper part <b>25</b>. It is thus possible to reduce the sliding resistance of the medical guidewire <b>1</b> at the time of pulling the medical guidewire <b>1</b> inside the guiding catheter, the tubular organ or the intracorporeal tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the present embodiment, the hydrophilic material <b>7</b> is applied so as to form the streamlined shape in the area from the proximal end portion of the coiled body <b>5</b> to the second taper part <b>25</b>. However, this hydrophilic material <b>7</b> may be applied so as to form the streamlined shape in the area from the proximal end portion of the coiled body <b>5</b> to the second cylindrical part <b>11</b>.
