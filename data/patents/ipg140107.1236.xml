<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a frontal airbag arrangement for the protection of seat occupants in a motor vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Airbags have been credited for saving lives by damping impact of a motor vehicle crash on a vehicle occupant. Not only frontal impact airbags are in use, but also side impact airbags, such as side curtain airbags expanding from the roof line of a vehicle or airbags arranged in a center console or armrest between two car seats. After the gas generator is triggered, the airbag unfolds and provides energy absorption for the seat occupant. An airbag arranged in an armrest pushes itself between the seats and between seat occupants sitting next to each other. Another known airbag design provides an airbag in the vicinity of the center tunnel of the vehicle that inflates above the heads of the vehicle occupants to protect the occupants in the event of a vehicle rollover or of an &#x201c;off-side&#x201d; impact.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Airbags are designed to provide a synergetic effect with seat belts that restrain seat occupants in a defined position. At least the front seats of a passenger vehicle and increasingly also the rear seats are provided with three-point seatbelts comprising a lap belt and a shoulder harness extending diagonally across a seat occupant's chest. The shoulder harness limits the forward movement of a seat occupant's upper body in the event of a frontal impact.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In contrast, aircraft passenger seats are usually only equipped with a two-point seatbelt, which is a lap belt without shoulder harness. Two-point seatbelts are more comfortable to wear than three-point seatbelts that limit the range of movement of a passenger's upper body. Thus, passengers may be less likely to keep three-point seatbelts fastened for the duration of a flight. Absent a shoulder harness, in the event of a high deceleration of an aircraft, for instance during an emergency landing or a collision, the torso of a passenger is catapulted forward. This constitutes a potentially dangerous situation, where a forward excursion may result in high head accelerations and possibly head injuries from a seat back of a seat located in front of the seat occupant.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Airbags of current designs pose packaging challenges, based in part on the assumption that a large inflated volume is needed in order to provide the airbag with the sufficient energy absorption during a crash due to the force of the occupant impact. However, problems have been noted to occur with airbags of current design in that they can often be difficult to install in vehicles such as small or compact models where space in the passenger compartment is at a premium.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, such large and bulky airbags often require complex gas generator units in order to guarantee that the airbag will promptly and properly inflate during a crash. These large and bulky gas generators create additional problems because not only do they further increase the size and complexity of the airbag system, but are often also very expensive. More importantly, multiple and complex gas generators can be very difficult to assemble, install, or repair.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an airplane with possibly hundreds of seats, large gas generators provided for every seat significantly increase the cost and weight of a passive safety system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the present invention, a frontal airbag has a first, a second, and a third inflatable section. The first section is connected to a gas generator. The second section is in fluid communication with both the first and the third section. The third section has an end remote from the second section that is attached to the first section. The first, second and third section form a triangular structure upon inflation of the airbag, wherein the third section is located above the first section.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one embodiment, at least two side tethers may be provided of which each is arranged on either lateral side of the airbag. Each side tether may be attached to the first section and one of the second and third sections or to a transitional bend between the second and third section, thereby limiting an enveloping volume of the airbag.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a further aspect of the invention, the first and third sections are directly attached to each other by a seam. The term seam in this context is not limited to sewn connection and includes attachments by adhesive or lamination.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first and third sections may further be attached to each other in portions that form uninflated areas.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Uninflated islands in the airbag may create increased structural stiffness of the airbag because a relative movement between opposing surfaces is restricted. They can also create folding lines for the airbag during deployment.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further details and benefits of the present invention become apparent from the following description of the accompanying drawings showing various preferred embodiments. The attached drawings are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a rear seat <b>50</b> located behind a front seat <b>50</b>. The seat <b>50</b> features a lap belt <b>62</b> securing a seat occupant <b>40</b> in the seat <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The seat back <b>60</b> of the front seat <b>50</b> includes an airbag <b>10</b> that is inflated toward the seat occupant <b>40</b> during a deceleration event before the seat occupant <b>40</b> can make contact with the seat back <b>60</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the airbag <b>10</b> is mounted in the lower half of the seat back <b>60</b> and expands to an enveloping volume <b>12</b> with a generally triangular cross-section. The enveloping volume <b>12</b> defines a volume that a conventional airbag would need to fill for providing outer surfaces that correspond to those of the shown embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The airbag <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> does not fill out the entire enveloping volume <b>12</b>. Airbag <b>10</b> rather extends along the perimeter of the triangular cross-section of the enveloping volume <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The airbag <b>10</b> has a low-volume structure with generally three sections, first section <b>14</b>, second section <b>16</b>, and third section <b>18</b>. The first, second, and third sections <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>18</b> substantially form a triangle around an empty space <b>22</b>. The airbag <b>10</b> has an outer fabric layer <b>32</b> and an inner fabric layer <b>34</b>. The outer fabric layer <b>32</b> is configured to make contact with the seat occupant <b>40</b> and defines the enveloping volume <b>12</b>, while the inner fabric layer <b>34</b> defines the empty space <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first section <b>14</b> is connected to a gas generator located inside the seat back <b>60</b>. The second section <b>16</b> is in fluid connection with the first section <b>14</b>, and the third section <b>18</b> is in fluid connection with the second section <b>16</b>. The third section <b>18</b> has an end portion <b>24</b> remote from the second section <b>16</b> that is in contact with and attached to the first section <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the left side and on the right side viewed from the perspective of the seat occupant <b>40</b>, the airbag <b>10</b> has a pair of side tethers <b>26</b>. These side tethers <b>26</b> are each attached with one end to a first attachment point <b>28</b> on the first section <b>14</b> and with the other end to a second attachment point <b>29</b> on the second section <b>16</b>. The side tethers <b>26</b> define a maximum distance between attachment points <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> and thus limit the extent to which the second section <b>16</b> can bulge toward the seat occupant <b>40</b>. Without any external force acting on the airbag, the inflated airbag <b>10</b> would retain the triangular shape, even if the side tethers were removed. When, however, the seat occupant <b>40</b> contacts the enveloping volume <b>12</b>, the side tethers <b>26</b> provide resistance against flattening of the airbag <b>10</b> by the inertial force exerted by the seat occupant <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates where the airbag <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be accommodated in the seat back <b>60</b> of the aircraft seat <b>50</b> that also features a foldable tray table <b>56</b> above a seat pocket <b>58</b>. A tear seam <b>54</b> extends horizontally across a seat cover <b>55</b> between the seat pocket <b>58</b> and tray table <b>56</b>. The airbag <b>10</b> is mounted as a rolled bundle behind the tear seam <b>54</b> with a generally horizontal roll axis.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Alternatively, a low-volume airbag, such as the airbag <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may be mounted in an aircraft bulkhead or a vehicle dashboard as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the seat <b>50</b> as a front passenger seat in an automotive vehicle. The seat <b>50</b> is located behind a dashboard <b>70</b>. The seat <b>50</b> features a three-point belt <b>62</b> securing a seat occupant <b>40</b> in the seat <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The dashboard <b>70</b> holds the airbag <b>10</b> that is inflated toward the seat occupant <b>40</b> during a deceleration event before the seat occupant <b>40</b> can make contact with the dashboard <b>70</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the airbag <b>10</b> expands to the enveloping volume <b>12</b> with the generally triangular cross-section previously discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The enveloping volume <b>12</b> defines a volume that a conventional airbag would need to fill for providing outer surfaces that correspond to those of the shown embodiment. The airbag <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> corresponds to the airbag <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> applies in analogy to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows details of the airbag of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a plan view of the deflated airbag <b>10</b> onto the inner fabric layer <b>34</b> before the third section <b>18</b> is attached to the first section <b>14</b> and before the side tethers <b>26</b> are attached to the second section <b>16</b> and the first section <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As evident from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the airbag <b>10</b> has an elongated shape with a first longitudinal end <b>36</b> being connected to a gas generator <b>38</b>. While a pyrotechnical gas generator is shown, the gas generator <b>38</b> is representative for any device suitable to inflate the airbag <b>10</b>. The gas generator <b>38</b> has an elongated, generally cylindrical shape with a cylinder axis x that extends substantially perpendicular to the longest dimension of the airbag <b>10</b>. When the airbag <b>10</b> is rolled up for storage, the greatest dimension of the gas generator <b>38</b> thus extends parallel to the roll axis and allows a compact shape of the resulting bundle.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The end portion <b>24</b> forms a second longitudinal end opposite the first end <b>36</b>. The end portion <b>24</b> is a flat portion that remains uninflated at all times. The outer fabric layer <b>32</b> remains attached to the inner fabric layer <b>34</b>, for example via a seam <b>42</b> that shuts off any fluid connection of the end portion <b>24</b> with the remainder of the airbag <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the outer and inner layers <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> may be connected by an adhesive, by interweaving, or by local laminating.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The airbag includes several other uninflated areas that form uninflated islands <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, and <b>48</b> that may have been formed by similar methods as the uninflated end portion <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Islands <b>44</b> have a substantially triangular shape and have a width corresponding to about a third of the width of the airbag <b>10</b>. The islands <b>44</b> define laterally extending bend axes <b>52</b> that form two corners of the substantially triangular inflated shape of the airbag <b>10</b>. The bend axes <b>52</b> extend in the same direction as the roll axis. The islands <b>44</b> are located between the first section <b>14</b> and the second section <b>16</b> as well as between the second section <b>16</b> and the third section <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The islands <b>46</b> form a pair of strips extending in the general area of the second section <b>16</b> in the longitudinal direction of the airbag <b>10</b>. The islands <b>46</b> thus create three longitudinal flow channels <b>62</b> that stiffen the second section <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The island <b>48</b> is located near the gas generator <b>38</b> in the first section <b>14</b> and has a size substantially corresponding to or larger than the end portion <b>24</b>. During assembly of the airbag <b>10</b>, the end portion <b>24</b> and the uninflated island <b>48</b> are sewn together or otherwise permanently attached to each other. If the end portion <b>24</b> is sewn onto the island <b>48</b>, the island <b>48</b> can be created during the sewing process by the same seam that attaches the end portion <b>24</b> to the first section <b>14</b>. Because the gas generator <b>38</b> is arranged closer to the first end <b>36</b> than the island <b>48</b>, the gas generator <b>38</b> can be fastened to a frame or bracket (not shown) inside the seat back <b>60</b> without interfering with the inflation of the airbag <b>10</b> into its triangular contour.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The side tethers <b>26</b> are indicated by broken lines as originating from attachment points <b>28</b> on the first section <b>14</b> and attachment points <b>29</b> on the second section <b>16</b>. Those side tethers <b>26</b> that are shown above each other in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are connected to each other or form a pair of unitary side tethers <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show an airbag <b>20</b> according to a second embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the airbag in the inflated state, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provides a plan view onto the inner fabric layer <b>34</b>. Airbag <b>20</b> is also based on the concept that the enveloping volume <b>12</b> is greater than the volume of the airbag itself, where the enveloping volume <b>12</b> defines a volume that a conventional airbag would need to fill for providing outer surfaces that correspond to those of the shown embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The outer contour of the enveloping volume <b>12</b> of airbag <b>20</b>, however, resembles a quadrilateral shape rather than a triangle. This is due to the end portion <b>24</b> being connected to the third section <b>18</b> via an intermediate uninflated portion <b>64</b>. This uninflated portion <b>64</b> acts like a tether that allows the third portion <b>18</b> to form a smaller angle relative to the first portion <b>14</b> and to extend nearly parallel to the first portion <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The side tethers <b>26</b> are attached to the attachment points <b>28</b> on the first section <b>14</b> as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The attachment points <b>29</b> are moved compared to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> to generally overlap with the bend axis <b>52</b> between the second section <b>16</b> and the third section <b>18</b>. Due to the intermediate uninflated portion <b>64</b>, the first section <b>14</b> and the second section <b>16</b> may be arranged at an obtuse angle relative to each other after inflation of the airbag <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the side tethers may be longer than in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> a third embodiment of an airbag <b>30</b> is shown in a plan view onto the inner fabric layer <b>34</b>. The airbag <b>30</b> has one of the uninflated islands <b>44</b> defining the bend axis <b>52</b> between the second section <b>16</b> and the third section <b>18</b>. The other bend axis <b>52</b> between the first section <b>14</b> and the second section <b>16</b> is defined by an uninflated island <b>66</b> that generally extends from a port area <b>68</b> to the bend axis <b>52</b> between the first section <b>14</b> and the second section <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The port area <b>68</b> is shown as bounded by a broken line that indicates a seam <b>76</b> that does not extend through both the outer fabric layer <b>32</b> and the inner fabric layer <b>34</b>. Instead, the port <b>70</b> is in fluid communication with the first section <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a similar manner, an end portion <b>74</b> on the third section <b>18</b> has a port <b>72</b> in fluid communication with the third portion <b>18</b>. Thus, the end portion <b>74</b> is not an uninflated area and is surrounded by seam <b>76</b> indicated by a broken line that does not extend through the outer fabric layer <b>32</b>. Seam <b>76</b> connects the port area <b>68</b> on the first section with the end portion <b>74</b> on the third section so that the ports <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are aligned in a substantially congruent manner and establish a flow path directly from the first section <b>14</b> to the third section <b>18</b>, thereby bypassing the second section <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thus, the airbag <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> provides a multi-throat fill concept with dual flow directions for simultaneous inflation of the second section <b>16</b> and the third section <b>18</b>. In addition to increasing the inflation speed, this concept also reduces local gas pressure by diverting the gas generated by the gas generator into multiple areas of the airbag <b>30</b>.</p>

It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise embodiments disclosed. Numerous modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings.
