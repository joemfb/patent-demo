<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods for allocating a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) to reduce a number of PDCCH candidates in a search space for carrier aggregation on a user equipment (UE) are disclosed. The method comprises the step of selecting a control channel element (CCE) aggregation level for a PDCCH allocation for each of a plurality of user equipments (UEs) at an evolved NodeB (eNB). The operation of identifying a transmission mode for each of a plurality of component carriers (CCs) associated with the PDCCH at the eNB follows. The next operation of the method is assigning each CC's downlink control information (DCI) into CCEs in a PDCCH search space in the PDCCH starting at a CCE location based on the CC's transmission mode and the CCE aggregation level for the UE receiving the CC.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless mobile communication technology uses various standards and protocols to transmit data between a base transceiver station (BTS) and a wireless mobile device. In the third generation partnership project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE) systems, the BTS is a combination of evolved Node Bs (eNode Bs or eNBs) and Radio Network Controllers (RNCs) in a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), which communicates with the wireless mobile device, known as a user equipment (UE). Data is transmitted from the eNode B to the UE via a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH). A physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) is used to transfer downlink control information (DCI) that informs the UE about resource allocations or scheduling related to downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH, uplink resource grants, and uplink power control commands. The PDCCH can be transmitted prior to the PDSCH in each subframe transmitted from the eNode B to the UE.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and then specific technology embodiments are described in further detail later. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. The following definitions are provided for clarity of the overview and embodiments described below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A system and method is provided for allocating a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) to reduce a number of PDCCH candidates in a search space for carrier aggregation on a user equipment (UE). A control channel element (CCE) aggregation level is selected for a PDCCH allocation for each of a plurality of user equipments (UEs) at an evolved NodeB (eNB). A transmission mode is identified for each of a plurality of component carriers (CCs) associated with the PDCCH at the eNB. Each CC's downlink control information (DCI) is assigned into CCEs in a PDCCH search space starting at a CCE location based on the CC's transmission mode and the CCE aggregation level for the UE receiving the CC. The eNode B can provide the allocation of the PDCCH and assignment of the CCEs to a search space using a transmission mode to create more search spaces for the CCs of the UE. Using the transmission mode can generate up to eight additional search space starting locations by partitioning the search space. The UE may use the carrier index (CI) or the DCI size along with the transmission mode to assign the CCEs to a PDCCH search space.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">After the CCEs are assigned to a PDCCH search space, the PDCCH can be transmitted to a UE. At the UE, the PDCCH can be searched by the UE for each of the UE's CC's DCI. The UE may use the transmission mode, the carrier index (CI), and/or the DCI size to efficiently search smaller PDCCH search spaces in the PDCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Data in wireless mobile communication can be transmitted on the physical (PHY) layer by the eNode B (also commonly denoted as an enhanced Node B, evolved Node B, or eNB) to the user equipment (UE) using a generic long term evolution (LTE) frame structure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A radio frame <b>100</b> of a signal used to transmit the data is configured to have a duration, T<sub>f</sub>, of 10 milliseconds (ms). Each radio frame can be segmented or divided into ten subframes <b>110</b><i>i </i>that are each 1 ms long. Each subframe can be further subdivided into two slots <b>120</b><i>a </i>and <b>120</b><i>b</i>, each with a duration, T<sub>slot</sub>, of 0.5 ms. The first slot (#<b>0</b>) <b>120</b><i>a </i>can include a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) <b>160</b> and a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) <b>166</b>, and the second slot (#<b>1</b>) <b>120</b><i>b </i>can include data using the PDSCH. Each slot for a component carrier (CC) used by the eNode B and the UE can include multiple resource blocks (RBs) <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b</i>, <b>130</b><i>i</i>, <b>130</b><i>m</i>, and <b>130</b><i>n </i>based on the CC frequency bandwidth. Each RB <b>130</b><i>i </i>can include twelve 15 kHz subcarriers <b>136</b> (on the frequency axis) and 6 or 7 orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols <b>132</b> (on the time axis) per subcarrier. The RB uses seven OFDM symbols if a short or normal cyclic prefix is employed. The RB uses six OFDM symbols if an extended cyclic prefix is used. The resource block can be mapped to 84 resource elements (REs) <b>140</b><i>i </i>using short or normal cyclic prefixing, or the resource block can be mapped to 72 REs (not shown) using extended cyclic prefixing. The RE can be a unit of one OFDM symbol <b>142</b> by one subcarrier (i.e., 15 kHz) <b>146</b>. Each RE can transmit two bits <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>of information in case of quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation. Other types of modulation may be used as well. For instance, when bi-phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation is used, then only a single bit of information is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In carrier aggregation (CA), CCs for a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network can be combined together to form a larger bandwidth for the UE, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, the UMTS may have a system bandwidth <b>210</b> of 100 MHz in a frequency spectrum <b>216</b> with each CC <b>212</b> having a 20 MHz bandwidth. Each CC may comprise a plurality of subcarriers <b>214</b>. Some UEs <b>230</b> may use the entire 100 MHz system bandwidth by aggregating five 20 MHz CCs together to achieve a 100 MHz UE bandwidth <b>220</b>. In another example, two UEs <b>232</b><i>a </i>and <b>232</b><i>b </i>each with a 40 MHz bandwidth capability may each use two 20 MHz CCs together to achieve a 40 MHz UE bandwidth <b>222</b> for each UE. In another example, each UE <b>234</b><i>a</i>, <b>234</b><i>b</i>, <b>234</b><i>c</i>, <b>234</b><i>d</i>, and <b>234</b><i>e </i>may use a single 20 MHz CC to achieve a 20 MHz UE bandwidth <b>224</b>. The CCs at an eNode B may be aggregated for some UEs while other UEs may use a single CC during the same interval. For example, one UE with a 40 MHz bandwidth may be configured while three UEs that each use a single 20 MHz CC are employed in a 100 MHz bandwidth system (not shown). Carrier aggregation allows the bandwidth for a UE to be adjusted and adapted based on the system limitations, the UEs capabilities and bandwidth requirements, the bandwidth available to the system and/or loading on the system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each UMTS may use a different carrier bandwidth, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For example, the LTE Release 8 (Rel-8) carrier bandwidths and Release 10 (Rel-10) CC bandwidths can include: 1.4 MHz <b>310</b>, 3 MHz <b>312</b>, 5 MHz <b>314</b>, 10 MHz <b>316</b>, 15 MHz <b>318</b>, and 20 MHz <b>320</b>. The 1.4 MHz CC can include 6 RBs comprising 72 subcarriers. The 3 MHz CC can include 15 RBs comprising 180 subcarriers. The 5 MHz CC can include 25 RBs comprising 300 subcarriers. The 10 MHz CC can include 50 RBs comprising 600 subcarriers. The 15 MHz CC can include 75 RBs comprising 900 subcarriers. The 20 MHz CC can include 100 RBs comprising 1200 subcarriers.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each subframe of a CC may include downlink control information (DCI) found in a PDCCH, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The PDCCH in the control region may include one to three columns of the first OFDM symbols in each subframe or RB. The remaining 11 to 13 OFDM symbols in the subframe may be allocated to the PDSCH for data. The control region can include Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH), physical hybrid automatic repeat request (hybrid-ARQ) indicator channel (PHICH), and the PDCCH. The control region has a flexible control design to avoid unnecessary overhead. The number of OFDM symbols in the control region used for the PDCCH can be determined by the control channel format indicator (CFI) transmitted in the Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH). The PCFICH is located in the first OFDM symbol of each subframe. The PCFICH and PHICH can have priority over the PDCCH, so the PCFICH and PHICH are scheduled prior to the PDCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The CFI and the PDCCH can be illustrated by the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Subframe A <b>110</b><i>a</i>, including slot #<b>0</b> <b>120</b><i>a </i>and slot #<b>1</b> <b>120</b><i>b</i>, has a CFI <b>410</b> equal to one indicating the first column of OFDM symbols in a CC's subframe A are used for the PDCCH <b>420</b> and the remaining 13 columns of OFDM symbols (in short cyclic prefixing) are used for the PDSCH <b>430</b>. Each CC includes a plurality of subcarriers <b>436</b> mapped to a plurality of RBs. Subframe B <b>110</b><i>b </i>has a CFI <b>412</b> equal to three indicating the first three columns of OFDM symbols in a CC's subframe B are used for PDCCH <b>422</b> and the remaining 11 columns of OFDM symbols (in short cyclic prefixing) are used for PDSCH <b>432</b>. Subframe C <b>110</b><i>c </i>has a CFI <b>414</b> equal to two indicating the first two columns of OFDM symbols in a CC's subframe C are used for PDCCH <b>424</b> and the remaining 12 columns of OFDM symbols (in short cyclic prefixing) are used for PDSCH <b>434</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the subframe A is followed by subframe B and subframe C in time <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">DCI can be mapped to the PDCCH using resource element groups (REGs) except both the PCFICH and PHICH, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. REGs can be used for defining the mapping of control channels to resource elements. A RB may include reference signal REs (reference signal OFDM symbols) <b>522</b> used for transmitting reference signals for a specific antenna port and unused REs (unused OFDM symbols) <b>520</b> not used for transmission on the specific port, which allow other antenna ports to transmit their reference signals. The number of reference signal REs and unused REs used in the RB can depend on the number of antenna ports. REGs can be used to map control channels to the remaining resource elements. REGs include a symbol quadruplet or four REs that do not include reference signal REs.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, a two antenna port configured RB <b>502</b> with a CFI=3 can include seven REGs <b>512</b> in the control region or seven REGs used for the PDCCH (if no REGs are used for PCFICH and PHICH), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. A four antenna port configured RB <b>504</b> with a CFI=3 can include six REGs in the control region or six REGs used for the PDCCH (if no REGs are used for PCFICH and PHICH), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The REGs in the control region of the RBs for a CC can comprise the PDCCH. Each CCE used in the PDCCH can include 9 REGs. The PDCCH can be formed with one or more successive CCEs. A plurality of PDCCHs can be transmitted in a single subframe.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The PDCCH in the control region of a subframe can provide DCI that informs the UE about scheduling on a CC related to downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH, uplink resource grants, and uplink power control commands. Each CC can provide scheduling in the PDCCH (in the control region) for the data in the PDSCH, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. A PDCCH in the control region <b>620</b><i>a </i>for CC <b>1</b> on CC <b>1</b> <b>600</b><i>a </i>can provide the scheduling for a PDSCH <b>630</b><i>a </i>for CC <b>1</b> in a subframe <b>610</b><i>a</i>. A PDCCH in the control region <b>620</b><i>b </i>for CC <b>2</b> on CC <b>2</b> <b>600</b><i>b </i>can provide the scheduling for a PDSCH <b>630</b><i>b </i>for CC<b>2</b>. A PDCCH in the control region <b>620</b><i>c </i>for CC <b>3</b> on CC <b>3</b> <b>600</b><i>c </i>can provide the scheduling for a PDSCH <b>630</b><i>c </i>for CC<b>3</b>. The subframes <b>610</b><i>a</i>, <b>610</b><i>b</i>, and <b>610</b><i>c </i>for the CC <b>1</b>, CC <b>2</b>, and CC <b>3</b> may represent the same time duration. Each CC can provide its own PDCCH for the PDSCH scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another example, one CC can provide the PDCCH for scheduling downlink resource assignments on the PDSCH of another CC, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. The DCI of one CC can be included or mapped to another CC's PDCCH. For example, the control region for CC <b>1</b> <b>622</b><i>a</i>, the control region for CC <b>2</b> <b>622</b><i>b</i>, and the control region for CC <b>3</b> <b>622</b><i>c </i>can be contained in the PDCCH on CC <b>1</b> <b>600</b><i>a</i>. The control region for CC <b>1</b> provides the scheduling for the PDSCH <b>632</b><i>a </i>on CC <b>1</b>, the control region for CC <b>2</b> provides the scheduling for the PDSCH <b>632</b><i>b </i>on CC <b>2</b>, and the control region for CC <b>3</b> provides the scheduling for the PDSCH <b>632</b><i>c </i>on CC <b>3</b>. 3GPP LTE systems can provide for cross carrier scheduling of the PDSCH where the PDCCH is transmitted on a CC different from the CC transmitting the PDSCH.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The eNode B may schedule the CCEs in the PDCCH and code the DCI based on a predetermined process, and the UE may receive the transmission and may search for the DCI in the PDCCH and decode the DCI based on the predetermined process. The PDCCH can be formed with one or more successive CCEs. The total number of CCEs in the PDCCH can vary in every subframe k, where k&#x3b5;{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, of a radio frame. The number of CCEs in the PDCCH can be represented by N<sub>CCE,k</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, the PDCCH <b>700</b> can include 86 CCEs <b>710</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Each CCE may include nine REGs <b>512</b><i>a</i>, <b>512</b><i>b</i>, <b>512</b><i>c</i>, <b>512</b><i>d</i>, <b>512</b><i>e</i>, <b>512</b><i>f</i>, <b>512</b><i>g</i>, <b>512</b><i>h</i>, and <b>512</b><i>i</i>. Each REG may include four REs <b>140</b><i>a</i>, <b>140</b><i>b</i>, <b>140</b><i>c</i>, and <b>140</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The PDCCH can provide control information to multiple UEs in a cell for each subframe k. The UE can perform blind decoding since the UE may be aware of the detailed control channel structure, including the number of control channels (CCHs) and the number of CCEs to which each control channel is mapped. Multiple PDCCHs can be transmitted in a single subframe k which may or may not be relevant to a particular UE. Because the UE does not know the precise location of the DCI information in a PDCCH, the UE searches and decodes the CCEs in the PDCCH until the DCI is found for the UE's CCs. The PDCCH can be referred to as a search space. The UE finds the PDCCH specific to the UE (or the UE's CCs) by monitoring a set of PDCCH candidates (a set of consecutive CCEs on which the PDCCH could be mapped) in a PDCCH search space in each subframe.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The UE can use a Radio Network Temporary Identifier (RNTI) assigned to the UE by the eNode B to try and decode candidates. The RNTI can be used to demask a PDCCH candidate's cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that was originally masked by the eNode B using the UE's RNTI. If the PDCCH is for a specific UE, the CRC can be masked with a UE unique identifier, for example a Cell-RNTI (C-RNTI). If no CRC error is detected the UE can determine that a PDCCH candidate carries the DCI for the UE. If a CRC error is detected then the UE can determine that PDCCH candidate does not carry the DCI for the UE and the UE can increment to the next PDCCH candidate. The UE may increment to the next PDCCH candidate in the search space based on the CCE aggregation level. The CCE aggregation level will be discussed more fully in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">To reduce the burden and improve the process performance of the UE, the PDCCH can be composed of a search space within the PDCCH to improve searching and decoding of the PDCCH candidates. Each search space can have a starting address determined by the RNTI. The PDCCH can be divided into a common search space <b>710</b>, which can provide scheduling information for system information received by a group of UEs in a cell, and a UE specific space <b>712</b> allocated to control information for a particular UE. The common search space can be composed of the first 16 CCEs (CCE <b>0</b> through CCE <b>15</b>) the remaining CCEs may to allocated to the UE specific space <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The number of CCEs used to transmit one piece of control information can be determined according to the receiving quality of the PDCCH allocated to a UE or the channel quality of the UE, and the number of CCEs is referred to as a CCE aggregation level or an aggregation level L&#x3b5;{1,2,4,8}. The aggregation level can be used to determine the size of a search space or the number of CCEs forming a search space, and/or the number of control channel (CCH) candidates in a search space, as illustrated in table <b>702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another example, if a search space <b>800</b> includes 8 CCEs <b>810</b>, <b>812</b>, <b>814</b>, <b>816</b>, <b>818</b>, <b>820</b>, <b>818</b>, and <b>820</b>, the total number of CCH candidates that can be decoded may be 15. Eight CCH candidates <b>830</b>, <b>832</b>, <b>834</b>, <b>836</b>, <b>838</b>, <b>840</b>, <b>842</b>, and <b>844</b> can represent the candidates that can be decoded with an aggregation level of one (L=1). The UE can increment through the search space by the aggregation level until the DCI for the CCs of the UE is found.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Four CCH candidates <b>846</b>, <b>848</b>, <b>850</b>, and <b>852</b> can represent the candidates that can be decoded with an aggregation level of two (L=2). Two CCH candidates <b>854</b> and <b>856</b> can represent the candidates that can be decoded with an aggregation level of four (L=4). One CCH candidate <b>858</b> can represent the candidates that can be decoded with an aggregation level of eight (L=8). Searching and decoding the CCH candidates (PDCCH candidates) for the DCI in each subframe can be referred to as blind decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each decode takes a certain amount of time to process. The UE may have a limited number of blind decodes (for the candidates in the PDCCH) available in the timeframe allotted for decoding before the PDSCH or next subframe is transmitted for processing. For example, a UE may be able to handle up to 44 blind decodes before the PDSCH or next subframe is transmitted for processing. When the number (e.g., 300) of CCH candidates for an aggregation level is greater than a blind decode limit for the UE, then the UE may fail to obtain the CCH information and fail to process the PDSCH. Reducing the number of potential search spaces can be used to assist the UE to find and decode the DCI in the PDCCH efficiently and within an available time limit.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The 3GPP transport stream (TS) 36.2211 V8.4.0 defines a PDCCH allocation procedure for a search space S<sub>k</sub><sup>(L)</sup>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The 3GPP TS 36.2211 V8.4.0 assignment procedure does not involve CC aggregation. 3GPP Rel-8 and Rel-9 do not support the scheduling of cross carriers and the UE is allocated one C-RNTI in CC aggregation. Using the RNTI and aggregation level of a UE maps the DCI of a UE to a single UE search space. As UE bandwidths increase, the number of PDCCH increase, the number of CCs increase, and the PDCCH search space sizes increase, then the number of decodes used to successfully decode PDCCH candidates will increase.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Instead of using a single search space for a UE, the search spaces may be further partitioned to decrease the search space size for a CC on a UE to reduce the number of blind decodes of PDCCH candidates and allow more efficient decoding of PDCCH candidates. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the starting address of a UE specific search space can utilize the partial or full combinations of the transmission (TX) modes (T<sub>c,m</sub>) for a carrier (c), the carrier index (CI) in the DCI format, and the DCI size (S) of different cross carriers. The total possible number of search spaces created using the method can be a product of the transmission (TX) modes (T<sub>c,m</sub>) for a carrier (c), the carrier index (CI) in the DCI format, and the DCI size (S).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The eNode B can identify at least one value associated with each CC's PDCCH, where the at least one value represents at least one of a transmission mode for the CC, the carrier index in the DCI format, and/or the DCI size. The eNode B can assign or map the CC's control information (e.g., DCI) into CCEs in a search space based on the at least one value associated with the CC. The UE can receive the transmitted control channel (e.g., PDCCH) from the eNode B. The UE can search for the selected CC's control information in a search space using the CC's value and the CCE aggregation level for the UE receiving the selected CC. The UE can decode each control channel candidate in the search space until a validly decoded control channel candidate is decoded or until all validly decoded control channel candidates in a search space are decoded. The CC's control information, such as the DCI, may be obtained from the validly decoded control channel candidate.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the eNode B can signal the transmission mode to the UE via a layer three communication link, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling, in advance of sending the PDCCH for a subframe. The transmission modes for PDSCH reception can include 8 modes: Mode <b>1</b> (single antenna port, port <b>0</b>), mode <b>2</b> (transmit diversity), mode <b>3</b> (large-delay Cyclic Delay Diversity (CDD)), mode <b>4</b> (closed-loop spatial multiplexing), mode <b>5</b> (multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MU-MIMO)), mode <b>6</b> (closed loop spatial multiplexing, single layer), mode <b>7</b> (single antenna port, UE-specific reference signal (RS) (port <b>5</b>)), and mode <b>8</b> (single or dual-layer transmission with UE-specific RS (ports <b>7</b> and/or <b>8</b>)). The transmission mode can be changed per subframe via RRC signaling. Usually the transmission changes slowly. Changes in the transmission mode may be based on changes in the environment that the UE is operating. Each CC used by the UE can have independent transmission modes from other CCs. For a system with eight available transmission modes, up to eight additional search spaces for each UE may be partitioned using the transmission modes for scheduling and searching. The DCI size, which can also be used for scheduling and searching, can be related to transmission modes and can be determined from the transmission mode.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The carrier index (CI) can be CIF values or the index of sorted CIF values at the ascending order. The eNode B can configure the CIF values of each CC to UE via Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling prior to the transmission of the PDCCH for the subframe. The CI can change depending on RRC reconfiguration. Other information transmitted by RRC signaling may also be used for scheduling and searching PDCCH search spaces.</p>
