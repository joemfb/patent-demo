<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a USB charging circuit <b>200</b> for a computer (not shown) includes a charging module <b>10</b>, a USB power terminal <b>30</b>, and a USB interface <b>20</b>. The USB interface <b>20</b> can be connected to a peripheral device(s) (not shown), and the charging module <b>10</b> can charge the connected peripheral device when the USB power terminal <b>30</b> is not available.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The charging module <b>10</b> includes a switch unit <b>40</b>, a control unit <b>50</b>, a power button <b>60</b>, an Integrated Circuit (IC) chip <b>70</b>, a system power terminal <b>80</b>, a standby power terminal <b>90</b>, and an indication unit <b>11</b>. In the present embodiment, the computer can go to different system power states (S<b>0</b>-S<b>5</b>) according the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification. In the system power state S<b>0</b>, the standby power terminal <b>90</b>, the system power terminal <b>80</b> and the USB power terminal <b>30</b> are available; in the system power state S<b>3</b>, the standby power terminal <b>90</b> and the USB power terminal <b>30</b> are available; in the system power state S<b>4</b> or S<b>5</b>, only the standby power terminal <b>90</b> is available. The IC chip <b>70</b> outputs no signal in the system power state S<b>0</b>, outputs a low voltage level to the control unit <b>50</b> in the system power state S<b>3</b>, and outputs a high voltage level to the control unit <b>50</b> in the system power state S<b>4</b> or S<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the computer is in ON state (system power state S<b>0</b>), the USB power terminal <b>30</b> and the system power <b>80</b> are available, and the IC chip <b>70</b> outputs no signal to the control unit <b>50</b>. The standby power terminal <b>90</b> is disconnected from the USB interface <b>20</b> when the system power <b>80</b> is available, and any peripheral device connected to the USB interface <b>20</b> is supplied with power by the USB power terminal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the computer is in sleep mode (system power state S<b>3</b>), the system power <b>80</b> is not available but the USB power terminal <b>30</b> is still available, and the IC chip <b>70</b> outputs a low voltage level to the control unit <b>50</b>. The standby power terminal <b>90</b> is disconnected from the USB interface <b>20</b> when the control unit <b>50</b> is receiving a low voltage level, and any peripheral device connected with the USB interface <b>20</b> is supplied with power by the USB power terminal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When the computer is in hibernation state (system power state S<b>4</b>) or in the OFF state (system power state S<b>5</b>), the USB power terminal <b>30</b> and the system power <b>80</b> are not available, and the IC chip <b>70</b> outputs a high voltage level to the control unit <b>50</b>. The control unit <b>50</b> controls whether the standby power terminal <b>90</b> is connected with the USB interface <b>20</b> according to the switch unit <b>40</b>. When the switch unit <b>40</b> is triggered to apply a first switch signal to the control unit <b>50</b>, the standby power terminal <b>90</b> is connected to the USB interface <b>20</b> to supply outward power. When the switch unit <b>40</b> is triggered to apply a second switch signal, the standby power terminal <b>90</b> is disconnected from the USB interface <b>20</b>, and the outward power to any peripheral device is discontinued.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When the power button <b>60</b> is depressed to bring the computer from the hibernating state or the OFF state to the ON state, the power button <b>60</b> generates a low voltage level signal to the control unit <b>50</b>. The standby power terminal <b>90</b> is disconnected from the USB interface <b>20</b> when the low voltage level is received, and any connected peripheral device can be charged by the USB power terminal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one present embodiment, the control unit <b>50</b> includes a flip-flop chip (U<b>2</b>), switches T<b>1</b>-T<b>7</b>, diodes D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, resistors R<b>3</b>-R<b>13</b>, and capacitors C<b>2</b>-C<b>5</b>. The flip-flop chip U<b>2</b> includes a power input (Vcc), a ground pin (GND), a preset input (PR), a clear input (CLR), a clock pulse input (CP), a data input (D), a first output Q<b>1</b>, and a second output Q<b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, the switches T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b> are bipolar junction transistors (BJT), and the other switches T<b>5</b>-T<b>7</b> are metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The switch unit <b>40</b> includes a switch button (S), a Schmitt trigger (U<b>1</b>) having a signal input (A) and a signal output (Y), a capacitor C<b>1</b>, and resistor R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>. The signal input of the Schmitt trigger is connected to the standby power terminal <b>90</b> (5V_SB) sequentially through the resistor R<b>2</b> and the switch button. The signal input of the Schmitt trigger is also connected to ground through the capacitor C, and is connected to ground sequentially through the resistors R<b>2</b> and R<b>1</b>. The signal output of the Schmitt trigger is connected to the clock pulse input of the flip-flop chip U<b>2</b>.</p>
