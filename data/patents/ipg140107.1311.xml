<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a positioning mechanism for a quick release device, and more particularly, to a positioning mechanism for quickly and securely connecting an instrument to a slide assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional positioning mechanism for quickly and securely connecting an instrument to a slide assembly generally includes a keyhole slot defined in the rail of the slide assembly and a resilient member is fixed to the rail and located corresponding to the keyhole slot. The keyhole slot includes an enlarged hole and a narrow hole which communicates with the enlarged hole. The resilient member extends to the keyhole slot and covers the enlarged hole. When assembling the instrument to the slide assembly, the fixing pin on one side of the instrument is located corresponding to the keyhole slot and inserted into the enlarged hole, and then the fixing pin is shifted into the narrow hole and positioned by being biased by the resilient member, such that the instrument is connected to the rail. Generally, the rail compared with other rails of the slide assembly can be pulled out from the slide assembly and the rails are connected to the two sides of the instrument in pairs. The instrument is connected to the slide assembly on the rack so that the instrument is supported on the rack by the slide assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, when installing the instrument to the rack, the instrument is pulled out and pushed into the rack, or the vibration from the site, the fixing pin and the resilient member may have compact to each other. If the resilient member cannot bear the impact, it is easily deformed and the positioning function of the resilient member fails.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 7,604,307 to Greenwald et al. discloses a &#x201c;telescoping slide assembly with quick-mount keyhole lock system&#x201d; which provides a positioning hole for the resilient member so that when the fixing pin is inserted into the keyhole slot and shifted to a pre-set position, the fixing pin extends into the positioning hole and is well positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,626,300 to Kaminski et al. discloses a &#x201c;rack assembly that does not require tools for coupling chassis to slide&#x201d;, wherein an end of the resilient member contacts against the fixing pin to be positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Obviously, the above-mentioned disclosures provide a positioning device for positioning the instrument or chassis to the slide assembly, but the problem of the deformation of the resilient member and the potential risk to the resilient member are not resolved. Therefore, a better design for avoiding the deformation of the resilient member under impact is necessary.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention relates to a positioning mechanism for a quick release device of a slide assembly and comprises a rail having an opening defined in the rail and a first contact portion located adjacent to the opening. The opening has an open potion and a reception portion which communicates with the open portion. A positioning member has a base, a resilient arm, a restriction portion and a second contact portion, wherein the positioning member is fixed to the rail by the base and located corresponding to the opening. The resilient arm is connected between the base and the restriction portion. The resilient arm is movably away from the rail to change position of the restriction portion. The restriction portion has a first contact end located corresponding to the reception portion. The second contact portion is connected to the restriction portion. An enclosed area is defined between the first contact end and the reception portion. The second contact portion contacts the first contact portion of the rail.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the first contact portion is a hole or a recessed area, and the second contact portion is a protrusion. The second contact portion is inserted into the first contact portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the first contact portion is a protrusion and the second contact portion is a hole or a recessed area. The first contact portion is inserted into the second contact portion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the first contact portion is a protrusion and the second contact portion is a protrusion. The first contact portion contacts the second contact portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the restriction portion has a bent plate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the bent plate has a second contact end and an operation end. The second contact end is located corresponding to the first contact end of the restriction portion and the operation end is located corresponding to the second contact end.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the bent plate has a protrusion located adjacent to the operation end and a gap is defined between the protrusion and a surface of the restriction portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, a window is defined between the resilient arm and the restriction portion. The window is located corresponding to the operation end of the bent plate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The primary object of the present invention is to provide a positioning mechanism for a quick release device wherein the structural strength of the resilient member is reinforced so as to prevent fail positioning.</p>
