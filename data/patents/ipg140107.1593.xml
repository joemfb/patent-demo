<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a terminal fitting connected to an electric wire and an electric wire equipped with the terminal fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, one described in, for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-339850 has been known as a terminal fitting connected to the terminal of an electric wire. The terminal fitting has a body portion connected with a mating conductor and, in the rear of the body portion, a crimping portion at which the terminal of a core wire in the coated electric wire is crimped and fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the coated electric wire is electrically connected to the terminal fitting, in a case where the core wires of the coated electric wire and the terminal fitting are made of different kinds of metals, if water exists at a portion where the two come in contact with each other, it is known that the metals both dissolve in water in the shape of ions to give rise to electric corrosion in which corrosion makes progress by electrochemical reaction. To inhibit occurrence of such electric corrosion, the terminal fitting disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2005-339850 has a water-tight structure in which the gap between the crimping portion and the coated electric wire is filled with a water-proof sealing agent (anti-corrosive agent).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a configuration where the coated electric wire is electrically connected by crimping the coated electric wire at the crimping portion of the terminal fitting, it is difficult to deform the crimping portion into a shape completely conforming to the outer circumferential portions of the coated electric wire and the core wires. That is, the coated electric wire and the core wires each have a substantially circular cross section, whereas the crimping portion has a substantially rectangular or a substantially U-shaped cross section. Therefore, in the right and left diametrical directions of the coated electric wire and the core wires, outer circumferential portions thereof and the side walls of the crimping portion come in close contact with each other, whereas a gap is formed between both ends of the bottom wall of the crimping portion, that is, bent portions and the outer circumferential portions of the coated electric wire as well as the core wires. As a result, an anti-corrosive agent dropped or sprayed from above the terminal fitting may not easily enter the gap between the crimping portion and the coated electric wire as well as core wires.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention was made in view of the foregoing circumstances. It is an object of the present invention to provide a terminal fitting configured to prevent the occurrence of electric corrosion at a portion to which an electric wire is connected. It is another object of the present invention to provide an electric wire equipped with the terminal fitting to which the terminal fitting is connected.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To solve the above problems, in a terminal fitting to be connected to a coated electric wire according to the present invention, the terminal fitting includes: a wire barrel to be crimped on an exposed terminal of a core wire included in the coated electric wire; an insulation barrel provided in a rear of the wire barrel; and a coupling portion coupling the wire barrel and the insulation barrel to each other. The insulation barrel is configured to fix the coated electric wire. The coupling portion has a lead-in groove on a surface that is in contact with the coated electric wire. The lead-in groove is configured to introduce an anti-corrosive agent. The lead-in groove extends in a direction intersecting with an axial direction of the coated electric wire such that at least one end portion thereof is opened at at least one side edge of the coupling portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this configuration, when an anti-corrosive agent is applied after the coated electric wire is crimped and fixed to the terminal fitting, the anti-corrosive agent enters an opening of the lead-in groove in the coupling portion. In this context, even when the coated electric wire is in close contact with the coupling portion of the terminal fitting, the anti-corrosive agent can enter the site below the coated electric wire at the coupling portion through the lead-in groove. Then, the anti-corrosive agent fills the lead-in groove to thereby form an anti-corrosive wall along the lead-in groove, that is, in a direction intersecting with the axial direction of the coated electric wire, in a manner to enclose the outer circumferential portion of the coated electric wire. Moreover, even when there is a gap partially between the coupling portion and the coated electric wire, the gap is filled with the anti-corrosive agent spilt over from the lead-in groove. In such a manner, the gap between the coated electric wire and (the lead-in groove in) the coupling portion can be securely filled with the anti-corrosive agent to prevent water content from entering from the side of the insulation barrel to the side of the wire barrel. Therefore, this configuration prevents the occurrence of electric corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of electric corrosion at a portion where the terminal fitting and the electric wire come in contact with each other.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 8</figref>. A terminal fitting <b>10</b> in the present embodiment is made of copper alloy and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, includes a square-tubular body portion <b>20</b> and a crimping portion <b>30</b> provided in the rear of the body portion <b>20</b>. The terminal of a coated electric wire <b>40</b> is crimped to the crimping portion <b>30</b> to configure an electric wire equipped with terminal fitting <b>50</b> as a whole. To the crimping portion <b>30</b> and a site of the coated electric wire <b>40</b> that is fixed to the crimping portion <b>30</b>, an anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> is applied. The anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> that is undiluted is dropped or sprayed from above the terminal fitting <b>10</b> after the coated electric wire <b>40</b> is crimped and fixed to the crimping portion <b>30</b> and left as it is for a predetermined time to become solidified. Although in the present embodiment, the terminal fitting <b>10</b> is exemplified as a female terminal fitting having the body portion <b>20</b>, for example, a tab-shaped male terminal fitting may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The coated electric wire <b>40</b> is made of aluminum and has a configuration where a core wire <b>42</b> obtained by twisting a plurality of metallic strands <b>41</b> is coated with an insulation coating (coating) <b>43</b> made of insulating synthetic resin. The metallic strands <b>41</b> may be made of any metal such as copper, copper alloy, aluminum, or aluminum alloy. The metallic strands <b>41</b> of the present embodiment are made of aluminum alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The body portion <b>20</b> includes a bottom surface portion <b>22</b>, a pair of side surface portions <b>23</b> rising from the respective side edges of the bottom surface portion <b>22</b>, and a ceiling portion <b>24</b> formed in a two-ply manner by bending the respective upper edges of the side surface portions <b>23</b> toward each other.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Inside the body portion <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a flexible contact piece <b>21</b> is formed by folding back from the front edge of the bottom surface portion <b>22</b> of the body portion <b>20</b>. In the body portion <b>20</b>, between the flexible contact piece <b>21</b> and a surface (lower surface <b>24</b>A of the ceiling portion <b>24</b>) facing the flexible contact piece <b>21</b>, a tab-shaped mating conductor (not shown) can be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The distance between the flexible contact piece <b>21</b> and the lower surface <b>24</b>A of the ceiling portion <b>24</b> is smaller than the plate thickness of the mating conductor. Therefore, when the mating conductor is inserted between the flexible contact piece <b>21</b> and the lower surface <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the ceiling portion <b>24</b>, the flexible contact piece <b>21</b> is gradually inserted as sagging downward until the mating conductor and the flexible contact piece <b>21</b> come in contact with each other elastically and are electrically connected to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the crimping portion <b>30</b> includes a wire barrel <b>31</b> where the terminals of the core wires <b>42</b> of the coated electric wire <b>40</b> are crimped, an insulation barrel <b>32</b> provided in the rear of the wire barrel <b>31</b> and to which the insulation coating <b>43</b> of the coated electric wire <b>40</b> is fixed, and a coupling portion <b>33</b> coupling the wire barrel <b>31</b> and the insulation barrel <b>32</b> to each other. The wire barrel <b>31</b>, the coupling portion <b>33</b>, and the insulation barrel <b>32</b> share a bottom wall <b>34</b> continuing from the bottom surface portion <b>22</b> of the body portion <b>20</b> and extending in the longitudinal direction (axial direction of the coated wire <b>40</b>) and including crimping segments <b>31</b>A and <b>32</b>A and side walls <b>33</b>A extending from the respective side edges of the bottom wall <b>34</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The wire barrel <b>31</b> is configured to crimp the core wires <b>42</b> by disposing the terminals of the core wires <b>42</b> along the longitudinal direction of the bottom wall <b>34</b> and crimping those terminals by using the pair of crimping segments <b>31</b>A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the wire barrel <b>31</b> in a crimped condition. When the core wires <b>42</b> come in contact with the inner surfaces of the crimping segments <b>31</b>A and the bottom wall <b>34</b> conductively, the core wire <b>42</b> is electrically connected to the wire barrel <b>31</b>. In the present embodiment, so-called heart-shape crimping is employed by which the outer circumference of the terminal of the core wire <b>42</b> is enclosed from the right and left sides while permitting the respective side edges of the two crimping segments <b>31</b>A of the wire barrel <b>31</b> to abut against each other. The wire barrel <b>31</b> has a rectangular shape elongated in the cross direction (orthogonal to the longitudinal direction) in the open state before the coated electric wire <b>40</b> is crimped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The insulation barrel <b>32</b> is configured to fix the coated electric wire <b>40</b> thereto by disposing the insulation coating <b>43</b> of the coated electric wire <b>40</b> along the longitudinal direction of the bottom wall <b>34</b> and crimping the insulation coating <b>43</b> by using the two crimping segments <b>32</b>A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. The insulation barrel <b>32</b> has a rectangular shape elongated in the cross direction (orthogonal to the longitudinal direction) in the open state before the coated electric wire <b>40</b> is crimped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the insulation barrel <b>32</b> in a crimped condition. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the present embodiment, so-called overlapping-type crimping is employed by which the two crimping segments <b>32</b>A of the insulation barrel <b>32</b> enclose the outer circumference of the insulation coating <b>43</b> from the right and left sides while overlapping respective side edges of the crimping segments <b>32</b>A with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the surface of the insulation barrel <b>32</b> that is in contact with the coated electric wire <b>40</b>, an auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> to introduce an anti-corrosive agent is formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>. The auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> continuously extends straightly (in a belt shape) over the bottom wall <b>34</b> and the crimping segments <b>32</b>A of this insulation barrel <b>32</b>. The auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> extends in a direction substantially orthogonal to the axial direction of the coated electric wire <b>40</b> and has openings <b>35</b>A provided at two end portions of the groove <b>35</b>. The openings <b>35</b>A open at the side edges of the two crimping segments <b>31</b>A of the insulation barrel <b>32</b>. The auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> has a depth about a half of the thickness of the bottom wall <b>34</b> and the two crimping segments <b>32</b>A and has a substantially rectangular cross section (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</figref>). The auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> may be formed by beating down or scraping out the corresponding site of the insulation barrel <b>32</b> or denting the site beforehand in metal molding. The anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> filling the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> forms an anti-corrosive wall in a manner to enclose the outer circumferential portion of the coated electric wire <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Moreover, below the coated electric wire <b>40</b>, that is, a gap <b>32</b>B between the insulation barrel <b>32</b> and the coated electric wire <b>40</b> is also filled with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> spilt over from the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The wire barrel <b>31</b> and the insulation barrel <b>32</b> are coupled to each other by the coupling portion <b>33</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>, the coupling portion <b>33</b> has a pair of side walls <b>33</b>A rising from the two side edges of the bottom wall <b>34</b> to sandwich the outer circumferential portion of the insulation coating <b>43</b> from the right and left sides and having a substantially U-shaped cross section as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>, in the surface of the coupling portion <b>33</b> coming in contact with the coated electric wire <b>40</b> (more specifically, the surface coming in contact with the insulation coating <b>43</b>), an lead-in groove <b>36</b> to introduce an anti-corrosive agent is formed. The lead-in groove <b>36</b> continuously extends straightly (in a belt shape) over the bottom wall <b>34</b> and the side wall <b>33</b>A of the coupling portion <b>33</b>. The lead-in groove <b>36</b> extends in a direction substantially orthogonal to the axial direction of the coated electric wire <b>40</b> and has openings <b>36</b>A provided at end portions of the groove <b>36</b>. The openings <b>36</b>A open at the side edges of the two side walls <b>33</b>A of the coupling proton <b>33</b>. The lead-in groove <b>36</b> has a depth about a half of the thickness of the bottom wall <b>34</b> and the two side walls <b>33</b>A and has substantially a rectangular cross section (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 7</figref>). The lead-in groove <b>36</b> may be formed by a method similar to a method of forming the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b>. The lead-in groove <b>36</b> is filled with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> and has an anti-corrosive wall formed in a manner to enclose the outer circumferential portion of the coated electric wire <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Moreover, below the coated electric wire <b>40</b>, that is, a gap <b>33</b>B between the coupling portion <b>33</b> and the coated electric wire <b>40</b> is also filled with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> spilt over from the lead-in groove <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the bottom wall <b>34</b> of the insulation barrel <b>32</b> and the coupling portion <b>33</b>, a coupling groove <b>37</b> is formed to couple the lead-in groove <b>36</b> and the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> to each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The coupling groove <b>37</b> is formed at the central portion in the cross direction of the bottom wall <b>34</b>. In addition, the coupling groove <b>37</b> has one end portion coupled to a central portion in the extending direction of the lead-in groove <b>36</b> and the other end portion coupled to a central portion in the extending direction of the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b>. The coupling groove <b>37</b> extends in the axial direction of the coated electric wire <b>40</b>. That is, the coupling groove <b>37</b> is connected to the lead-in groove <b>36</b> as well as the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> in a substantially perpendicular manner. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the coupling groove <b>37</b> has a depth about a half of the thickness of the bottom wall <b>34</b> and has a substantially rectangular cross section. The coupling groove <b>37</b> is filled with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> entered from the lead-in groove <b>36</b> or the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> into the terminal fitting <b>10</b>. The coupling groove <b>37</b> may be formed by a method similar to a method of forming the lead-in groove <b>36</b> and the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The actions and effects of the terminal fitting <b>10</b> of the present embodiment having the above configuration will now be described below in comparison to a conventional terminal fitting having no lead-in groove or auxiliary lead-in groove to introduce an anti-corrosive agent.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in a conventional terminal fitting <b>70</b>, when the coated electric wire <b>40</b> is crimped and connected, a close-contact portion <b>72</b> is formed between the outer circumferential portion of the coated electric wire <b>40</b> and a side wall <b>71</b>A in the right and left diametrical directions of the coated electric wire <b>40</b>. The coated electric wire <b>40</b> has a substantially circular cross section, whereas a bottom wall <b>73</b> and side walls <b>71</b>A of a coupling portion <b>71</b> have a substantially planar state and a U-shaped cross section as a whole. Therefore, a gap <b>71</b>B is formed between the corner of the bottom wall <b>73</b> of the coupling portion <b>71</b> and the coated electric wire <b>40</b>. As a result, the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> dropped or sprayed on the coupling portion <b>71</b> after the coated electric wire <b>40</b> is crimped is accumulated on the upper surface side of the coupling portion <b>71</b> and the coated electric wire <b>40</b>, but inhibited by the close-contact portion <b>72</b> from entering downward. Therefore, the gap <b>71</b>B is not filled with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To solve the problem, in the present embodiment, the lead-in groove <b>36</b> is formed in the coupling portion <b>33</b> coupling the wire barrel <b>31</b> and the insulation barrel <b>32</b> to each other. Because of the lead-in groove <b>36</b>, it is possible to form belt-shaped regions not directly coming in close contact with each other, between the coupling portion <b>33</b> and the coated electric wire <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> coming from the opening <b>36</b>A of the lead-in groove <b>36</b> can enter the site below the coated electric wire <b>40</b> at the coupling portion <b>33</b> through the lead-in groove <b>36</b>. Since the lead-in groove <b>36</b> extends in a direction substantially orthogonal to the axial direction of the coated electric wire <b>40</b>, the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> fills the lead-in groove <b>36</b> and then forms an anti-corrosive wall along this lead-in groove <b>36</b> in a manner to enclose the outer circumferential portion of the coated electric wire <b>40</b>. Moreover, even when there is a gap (denoted by <b>33</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) partially between the coupling portion <b>33</b> and the coated electric wire <b>40</b>, the gap <b>33</b>B is filled with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> spilt over from the lead-in groove <b>36</b>. In such a manner, since the gap between the coated electric wire <b>40</b> and (the lead-in groove <b>36</b> in) the coupling portion <b>33</b> can be securely filled with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b>, water content can be securely prevented from entering from the side of the insulation barrel <b>32</b> to the side of the wire barrel <b>31</b>, thereby preventing the occurrence of electric corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the present embodiment, the lead-in groove <b>36</b> has two end portions opened at the two side edges of the coupling portion <b>33</b>. Therefore, the anti-corrosive-agent <b>60</b> can smoothly enter the lead-in groove <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present embodiment, since the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> is formed in the insulation barrel <b>32</b>, even if the coated electric wire <b>40</b> is in close contact with the insulation barrel <b>32</b>, the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> from the opening <b>35</b>A enter the site below the coated electric wire <b>40</b> at the insulation barrel <b>32</b> through the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b>. Since the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> extends in a direction substantially orthogonal to the axial direction of the coated electric wire <b>40</b>, the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> filling the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> forms an anti-corrosive wall along the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> in a manner to enclose the outer circumferential portion of the coated electric wire <b>40</b>. Moreover, even when there is a gap (denoted by <b>32</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) partially between the insulation barrel <b>32</b> and the coated electric wire <b>40</b>, the gap <b>32</b>B is filled with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> spilt over from the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b>. In such a manner, since the gap between the coated electric wire <b>40</b> and (the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> in) the insulation barrel <b>32</b> can be securely filled with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b>, water content can be securely prevented from entering from the side of the insulation barrel <b>32</b> to the side of the wire barrel <b>31</b>, thereby preventing the occurrence of electric corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the present embodiment, the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> has two end portions opened at the two side edges of the insulation barrel <b>32</b>. Therefore, the anti-corrosive-agent <b>60</b> can smoothly enter the lead-in groove <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the present embodiment, since the coupling groove <b>37</b> extends to couple the lead-in groove <b>36</b> and the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> to each other, the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b> having entered either the lead-in groove <b>36</b> or the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> can enter from the lead-in groove <b>36</b> to the auxiliary lead-in groove <b>35</b> or vice versa through the coupling groove <b>37</b>. As a result, it is possible to securely fill the gap between each of the coupling portion <b>33</b> and the insulation barrel <b>32</b> and the coated electric wire <b>40</b> with the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Moreover, the electric wire equipped with terminal fitting <b>50</b> according to the present embodiment has a configuration where the terminal fitting <b>10</b> is crimped to the terminals of the core wires <b>42</b> in the coated electric wire <b>40</b> in which the core wires <b>42</b> are coated with the insulation coating <b>43</b>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of electric corrosion, thereby using the electric wire <b>50</b> well for a long time.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the present embodiment, the core wires <b>42</b> are made of aluminum alloy and the terminal fitting <b>10</b> is made of copper alloy. The core wires <b>42</b> of aluminum alloy allow the electric wire equipped with terminal fitting <b>50</b> to have lighter weight a whole. Further, by making the terminal fitting <b>10</b> of copper alloy, it can be stronger than the configuration where the terminal fitting <b>10</b> is made of aluminum. Therefore, the coated electric wire <b>40</b> can be fixed more strongly. Moreover, in a configuration where the core wires <b>42</b> and the terminal fitting <b>10</b> are made of different kinds of metals, electric corrosion, even though it easily occurs, can be prevented by the grooves <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>37</b> according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref>. A terminal fitting <b>11</b> of the present embodiment has a modified configuration of the lead-in groove <b>36</b> of the first embodiment. The other configurations, actions, and effects are the same as those of the first embodiment, and repetitive description on them will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the terminal fitting <b>11</b> according to the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 to 12</figref>, an lead-in groove <b>81</b> to introduce an anti-corrosive agent is formed by beating out a bottom wall <b>34</b> and side walls <b>33</b>A of a coupling portion <b>33</b> from the inner surface side (surface side coming in contact with a coated electric wire <b>40</b>) to the outside. As a result, the lead-in groove <b>81</b> has a configuration where a plate wall expands outward convexly at the bottom wall <b>34</b> and the side walls <b>33</b>A of the coupling portion <b>33</b>. Specifically, in the present embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the lead-in groove <b>81</b> is beaten out into a circular-arc shape. Therefore, openings <b>81</b>A have semi-circular cross sections opening at the two side edges of the side walls <b>33</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to this configuration, since the lead-in groove <b>81</b> is formed by beating out the coupling portion <b>33</b> formed of one sheet of metal segment, the lead-in groove <b>81</b> can be easily formed to contribute to cost saving. Further, since the depth of the lead-in groove <b>81</b> is not limited by the thicknesses of the bottom wall <b>34</b> and the side walls <b>33</b>A of the coupling portion <b>33</b>, it can be formed deeper than that of the first embodiment to permit the entrance of a larger amount of the anti-corrosive agent <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although the embodiments of the present invention have been described, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments defined by the above description and figures. For example, the following embodiments are also included in the technical scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although the above embodiment each has exemplified the configuration where the lead-in groove, the auxiliary lead-in groove, and the coupling groove are all formed, the present invention only requires a configuration where at least the lead-in groove is formed in the coupling portion.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although the above embodiments each has exemplified the configuration where the lead-in groove and the auxiliary lead-in groove have their end portions opened at the two side edges of the coupling portion and the insulation barrel, respectively, a configuration may be employed where at least one of the end portions is opened. In this configuration also, it is possible to permit the entrance of the anti-corrosive agent into the lead-in groove and the auxiliary lead-in groove.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Although the above embodiments each has exemplified the configuration where one lead-in groove and one auxiliary lead-in groove are provided, the number of each grooves is arbitrary and may be increased in order to enhance the water-proofing effects. Further, the depth of the grooves is also arbitrary.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although the above embodiments each has exemplified the lead-in groove and the auxiliary lead-in groove having the rectangular or semi-circular cross sections, those cross sections may be arbitrary, trapezoidal or polygonal cross section is also applicable, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although the above embodiments each has exemplified the lead-in groove and the auxiliary lead-in groove extending in a direction substantially orthogonal to the axial direction of the coated electric wire, they may extend in a direction intersecting with the axial direction of the coated electric wire. Accordingly, the lead-in groove and the auxiliary lead-in groove are formed in a manner to enclose the outer circumferential portion of the coated electric wire. Therefore, a preferred anti-corrosive wall can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The above embodiments each has exemplified the configuration where the wire barrel is crimped in the heart shape in which the outer circumference of the terminals of the core wires are enclosed from the right and left sides while permitting the respective side edges of the two crimping segments to abut against each other. However, other than the crimping configuration described above, the so-called overlapping-type crimping configuration may be employed by which, for example, the two crimping segments enclose the outer circumference of the terminals of the core wires from the right and left sides while overlapping their respective side edges with each other. Further, it is also applicable that only one crimping segment may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although the above embodiments each has exemplified the coated electric wire including the core wire composed of the plurality of metallic strands, the core wires may be formed of one metallic strand having a relatively large diameter, that is, the coated electric wire may be of the single core wire type, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present invention can be applied not only to the configuration where the copper alloy-made terminal fitting is connected to the aluminum-made electric wire exemplified in the above embodiments, but also to a wide range of the configurations where the core wire of the electric wire and the terminal fitting to be connected thereto may be made of the different types of metals. As the material of the terminal fitting, for example, copper excellent in strength is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The technology disclosed in the present description features a terminal fitting to be connected to a coated electric wire, the terminal fitting including: a wire barrel to be crimped on an exposed terminal of a core wire included in the coated electric wire; an insulation barrel provided in a rear of the wire barrel; and a coupling portion coupling the wire barrel and the insulation barrel to each other. The insulation barrel is configured to fix the coated electric wire. The coupling portion has a lead-in groove on a surface that is in contact with the coated electric wire. The lead-in groove is configured to introduce an anti-corrosive agent. The lead-in groove extends in a direction intersecting with an axial direction of the coated electric wire such that at least one end portion thereof is opened at at least one side edge of the coupling portion.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition to the configuration according to the first means, the lead-in groove may have two end portions opened at each side edge of the coupling portion.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to the configuration of the second means, openings formed at the respective end portions of the lead-in groove allow the anti-corrosive agent to smoothly enter the lead-in groove.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition to the configuration according to the first or second means, the insulation barrel may have an auxiliary lead-in groove on a surface that is in contact with the coated electric wire. The auxiliary lead-in groove may be configured to introduce an anti-corrosive agent. The auxiliary lead-in groove may extend in a direction intersecting with the axial direction of the coated electric wire such that at least one end portion thereof is opened at at least one side edge of the insulation barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the configuration of the third means, when an anti-corrosive agent is applied after the coated electric wire is crimped and fixed to the terminal fitting, the anti-corrosive agent enters an opening of the auxiliary lead-in groove at the coupling portion. In this context, even when the coated electric wire is in close contact with the insulation barrel of the terminal fitting, the anti-corrosive agent can enter the site below the coated electric wire at the insulation barrel through the auxiliary lead-in groove. Then, the anti-corrosive agent fills the auxiliary lead-in groove to thereby form an anti-corrosive wall along the auxiliary lead-in groove in the direction intersecting with the axial direction of the coated electric wire, that is, in a manner to enclose the outer circumferential portion of the coated electric wire. Moreover, even when there is a gap partially between the insulation barrel and the coated electric wire, the gap is filled with the anti-corrosive agent spilt over from the auxiliary lead-in groove. In such a manner, the gap between the coated electric wire and (the auxiliary lead-in groove in) the insulation barrel can be securely filled with the anti-corrosive agent. Therefore, water content is securely prevented from entering from the side of the insulation barrel to the side of the wire barrel also with the anti-corrosive wall formed in the lead-in groove, thereby preventing the occurrence of electric corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition to the configuration according to the third means, the auxiliary lead-in groove may have two end portions opened at each side edge of the insulation barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to the configuration of the fourth means, an opening formed at each of the two end portions of the auxiliary lead-in groove allows the anti-corrosive agent to smoothly enter the auxiliary lead-in groove.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition to the configuration according to the third or fourth means, the lead-in groove and the auxiliary lead-in groove are coupled to each other by a coupling groove, the coupling groove extending over a part of the coupling portion and a part of the insulation barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the anti-corrosive agent is applied to the terminal fitting, there may be a possibility that the anti-corrosive agent only enter either of the lead-in groove or the auxiliary lead-in groove. However, according to the configuration of the fifth means, the anti-corrosive agent entered either the lead-in groove or the auxiliary lead-in groove may enter from the lead-in groove to the auxiliary lead-in groove or vice versa through the coupling groove. As a result, it is possible to securely fill the gap between each of the coupling portion and the insulation barrel and the coated electric wire with the anti-corrosive agent.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, the technology disclosed in the present description may be applied to the electric wire equipped with a terminal fitting, including: a coated electric wire obtained by coating a core wire; and the terminal fitting according to any one of means 1 to 5, in which the terminal fitting is crimped on a terminal of the core wire included in the coated electric wire.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The electric wire equipped with terminal fitting according to the sixth means prevents the occurrence of electric corrosion, whereby the electric wire can be used well for a long time.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition to the configuration of the sixth means, the core wire may be made of one of aluminum and aluminum alloy and the terminal fitting may be made of one of copper and copper alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the seventh means, the core wires of aluminum alloy allow the electric wire equipped with terminal fitting to have lighter weight as a whole. Further, the terminal fitting of copper alloy can be stronger and fix the coated electric wire more strongly than a configuration where the terminal fitting is made of aluminum. Moreover, in a configuration where the core wires and the terminal fitting are made of different kinds of metals, the occurrence of electric corrosion can be prevented all the more effectively by each of the grooves at the places where the electric corrosion may occur easily.</p>
