<p id="p-0006" num="0053">One modern communication system is known as evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN, also referred to as UTRAN-LTE or as E-UTRA). The DL access technique is OFDMA, and the UL access technique is SC-FDMA.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0054">One specification of interest is 3GPP TS 36.300, V8.11.0 (2009-12), &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Access Network (EUTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2 (Release 8),&#x201d; incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This system may be referred to for convenience as LTE Rel-8. In general, the set of specifications given generally as 3GPP TS 36.xyz (e.g., 36.211, 36.311, 36.312, etc.) may be seen as describing the Release 8 LTE system. More recently, Release 9 versions of at least some of these specifications have been published including 3GPP TS 36.300, V9.1.0 (2009-9).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> reproduces Figure 4.1 of 3GPP TS 36.300 V8.11.0, and shows the overall architecture of the EUTRAN system (Rel-8). The E-UTRAN system includes eNBs, providing the E-UTRAN user plane (PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY) and control plane (RRC) protocol terminations towards the UE (not shown). The eNBs are interconnected with each other by means of an X2 interface. The eNBs are also connected by means of an S1 interface to an EPC, more specifically to a MME by means of a S1 MME interface and to an S-GW by means of a S1 interface (MME/S-GW). The S1 interface supports a many-to-many relationship between MMEs/S-GWs and eNBs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0056">The eNB hosts the following functions:</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">functions for RRM: RRC, Radio Admission Control, Connection Mobility Control, Dynamic allocation of resources to UEs in both UL and DL (scheduling);</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">IP header compression and encryption of the user data stream;</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">selection of a MME at UE attachment;</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">routing of User Plane data towards the EPC (MME/S-GW);</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">scheduling and transmission of paging messages (originated from the MME);</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">scheduling and transmission of broadcast information (originated from the MME or OAM); and</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">a measurement and measurement reporting configuration for mobility and scheduling.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0057">Also of interest herein are the further releases of 3GPP LTE (e.g., LTE Rel-10) targeted towards future IMT-A systems, referred to herein for convenience also simply as LTE-Advanced (LTE-A). Reference in this regard may be made to 3GPP TR 36.913, V9.0.0 (2009-12), 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Requirements for Further Advancements for EUTRA (LTE-Advanced) (Release 9). A goal of LTE-A is to provide significantly enhanced services by means of higher data rates and lower latency with reduced cost. LTE-A is directed toward extending and optimizing the 3GPP LTE Rel-8 radio access technologies to provide higher data rates at lower cost. LTE-A will be a more optimized radio system fulfilling the ITU-R requirements for IMT-Advanced while keeping the backward compatibility with LTE Rel-8.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0058">As is specified in 3GPP TR 36.913, LTE-A should operate in spectrum allocations of different sizes, including wider spectrum allocations than those of LTE Rel-8 (e.g., up to 100 MHz) to achieve the peak data rate of 100 Mbit/s for high mobility and 1 Gbit/s for low mobility. It has been agreed that carrier aggregation is to be considered for LTE-A in order to support bandwidths larger than 20 MHz. Carrier aggregation, where two or more component carriers (CCs) are aggregated, is considered for LTE-A in order to support transmission bandwidths larger than 20 MHz. The carrier aggregation could be contiguous or non-contiguous. This technique, as a bandwidth extension, can provide significant gains in terms of peak data rate and cell throughput as compared to non-aggregated operation as in LTE Rel-8.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0059">A terminal may simultaneously receive one or multiple component carriers depending on its capabilities. A LTE-A terminal with reception capability beyond 20 MHz can simultaneously receive transmissions on multiple component carriers. A LTE Rel-8 terminal can receive transmissions on a single component carrier only, provided that the structure of the component carrier follows the Rel-8 specifications. Moreover, it is required that LTE-A should be backwards compatible with Rel-8 LTE in the sense that a Rel-8 LTE terminal should be operable in the LTE-A system, and that a LTE-A terminal should be operable in a Rel-8 LTE system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows an example of the carrier aggregation, where M Rel-8 component carriers are combined together to form M times Rel-8 BW (e.g. 5*20 MHz=100 MHz given M=5). Rel-8 terminals receive/transmit on one component carrier, whereas LTE-A terminals may receive/transmit on multiple component carriers simultaneously to achieve higher (wider) bandwidths.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0061">One discussion in 3GPP has focused on the design of an eight transmit antenna DL channel codebook. As can be appreciated, this has a direct impact on the feedback signaling required to support DL MIMO extensions in LTE Rel-10.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0075">The exemplary embodiments of this invention relate generally to mobile wireless communication, such as 3GPP LTE-A. The exemplary embodiments of this invention relate more specifically to design aspects of DL MIMO operation in LTE-A, taking into account the extension(s) needed to support eight Tx antenna ports as well as enhanced MU-MIMO, a work item of enhanced DL MIMO.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0076">Taking as a basis a multi-granular CSI feedback approach, the exemplary embodiments focus on the design of UL control feedback signaling to support flexible, reliable and efficient DL single user (SU) and multi-user (MU) MIMO operation in LTE Rel-10, as well as in releases of LTE (releases beyond Rel-10).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0077">During the standardization of LTE Rel-10 in 3GPP there has been interest expressed by network operators to further improve the competitiveness of LTE DL MIMO operation as compared to what has been specified in Rel-8 and Rel-9. More specifically, the following aspects have been proposed for further work:</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">support for eight transmit antenna ports and up to 8-layer DL MIMO operation;</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">support for enhanced DL MU-MIMO operation;</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">support for UE-specific reference symbols (RSs) for transmission rank ranging from 1 to 8;</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">support for periodic CSI-RS; and</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">support for CoMP.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0078">An aspect of DL MIMO enhancement is the design of the precoding codebook and the corresponding feedback signaling provided to the eNB by the UE. Without accurate feedback those gains achievable from the use of advanced MIMO techniques would be diminished. Moreover DL MU-MIMO has received considerable interest. One important consideration is how to design efficient and unified UE <b>10</b> feedback in support of both DL SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO, which may be intrinsically tied together within the same DL transmission mode.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0079">In LTE Rel-8 the CSI feedback has three distinct components:</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">CQI&#x2014;which indicates the MCS/TBS the UE <b>10</b> can support without exceeding a given BLER target (10% BLER in Rel-8);</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">PMI&#x2014;the preferred precoding matrix index from a codebook known to both the eNB and the UE; and</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">RI&#x2014;the rank indicator, which is a UE suggestion to the eNB for the number of supported spatial layers/streams for DL transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0080">In the LTE Rel-8 precoding schemes the CQI and the PMI feedback are jointly encoded while the RI is encoded separately. This is due to the fact that the value of RI determines the payload of the remainder of the CSI.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0081">Several feedback schemes have been proposed in 3GPP RAN1 for LTE Rel-10. Some of the proposals are unrealistic (in terms of associated UL feedback overhead) and/or infeasible (due to a lack of testability and from an actual deployment perspective).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0082">Considering the needed support for 8-Tx closed loop (CL) MIMO, it can be shown that what is needed is the definition of a versatile feedback design that is able to cope with various scenarios and eNB antennas deployments (e.g., cross-polarized and uniform linear array (ULA) deployments), while providing a realistic balance between performance gains, UE complexity, testability, overall UL feedback and UL/DL signaling overhead.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0083">An agreed way forward from the 3GPP RAN WG1 meeting #60 held in February 2010 defined a framework for the feedback and codebook design. For example, 3GPP contribution R1-101683 indicates that implicit feedback (PMI/RI/CQI) is used also for Rel-10, where the UE spatial feedback for a subband represents a precoder, and CQI is computed based on the assumption that the eNB uses a specific precoder (or precoders), as given by the feedback, on each subband within the CQI reference resource (note that a subband can correspond to the entire system bandwidth).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0084">Contribution R1-101683 also indicated that a precoder for a subband is composed of two matrices. The precoder structure is applied to all Tx antenna array configurations. Further each of the two matrices belongs to a separate codebook (the codebooks themselves have been reserved for further study). These codebooks are known (or synchronized) at both the eNB and the UE, and the codebooks may or may not change/vary over time and/or over different subbands. That is, two codebook indices will together determine the precoder. One of the two matrices pertains to wideband and/or long-term channel properties, while the other matrix pertains to frequency-selective and/or short-term channel properties. A matrix codebook in this context can be interpreted as a finite enumerated set of matrices that for each RB is known to both the UE and to the eNB. The Rel-8 precoder feedback can be deemed as a special case of this structure.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0085">An important aspect of this agreement on the way forward was that the precoder is being constructed from two precoding matrices. These can be denoted as PMI<b>1</b> and PMI<b>2</b> for convenience. Each of PMI<b>1</b> and PMI<b>2</b> refer to precoding matrix indices within respective codebooks, denoted by W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b>, respectively. The resulting precoder is determined by PMI<b>1</b> and PMI<b>2</b> jointly. At least one of the two precoding matrices targets wideband and/or long-term channel properties while the other precoding matrix may target frequency-selective and/or short-term channel properties. The resulting precoder for each frequency subband can be considered to be a combination (e.g., the product) of the wideband precoder selected from codebook W<b>1</b> and the per subband precoder selected from codebook W<b>2</b>. This is a notable deviation from the codebook design principle in LTE Rel-8, where the precoder is composed of only one precoding matrix (denoted as PMI) belonging to a single codebook.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0086">From the agreement reached during the 3GPP RAN WG1 meeting #60 it should be appreciated that the feedback structure is also in need of modification, i.e., an efficient technique to feed back both PMI<b>1</b> and PMI<b>2</b> needs to be defined.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0087">Before describing in further detail the exemplary embodiments of this invention, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for illustrating a simplified block diagram of various electronic devices and apparatus that are suitable for use in practicing the exemplary embodiments of this invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> a wireless network <b>1</b> is adapted for communication over a wireless link <b>11</b> with an apparatus, such as a mobile communication device which may be referred to as a UE <b>10</b>, via a network access node, such as a Node B (base station), and more specifically an eNB <b>12</b>. The network <b>1</b> may include a network control element (NCE) <b>14</b> that may include the MME/SGW functionality shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and which provides connectivity with a further network, such as a telephone network and/or a data communications network (e.g., the internet). The UE <b>10</b> includes a controller, such as a computer or a data processor (DP) <b>10</b>A, a non-transitory computer-readable memory medium embodied as a memory (MEM) <b>10</b>B that stores a program of computer instructions (PROG) <b>10</b>C, and a suitable radio frequency (RF) transceiver <b>10</b>D for bidirectional wireless communications with the eNB <b>12</b> via one or more antennas. The eNB <b>12</b> also includes a controller, such as a computer or a data processor (DP) <b>12</b>A, a computer-readable memory medium embodied as a memory (MEM) <b>12</b>B that stores a program of computer instructions (PROG) <b>12</b>C, and a suitable RF transceiver <b>12</b>D for communication with the UE <b>10</b> via one or more antennas (typically several, such as up to eight, when multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) operation is in use). The eNB <b>12</b> is coupled via a data/control path <b>13</b> to the NCE <b>14</b>. The path <b>13</b> may be implemented as the S1 interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The eNB <b>12</b> may also be coupled to another eNB via data/control path <b>15</b>, which may be implemented as the X2 interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0088">For the purposes of describing the exemplary embodiments of this invention the UE <b>10</b> can be assumed to also include a MIMO-related CQI reporting unit or function <b>10</b>E that composes feedback signaling to the eNB <b>12</b>, as well as a plurality of precoding codebooks <b>10</b>F (designed as W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b>) that are stored in the memory <b>10</b>B. Each of precoding matrices PMI<b>1</b> and PMI<b>2</b> are associated with the separately defined precoding codebooks W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b>, respectively. At least one of the two precoding matrices pertains to wideband and/or long-term channel properties while the other precoding matrix may pertain to frequency-selective and/or short-term channel properties. The UE <b>10</b> also includes a precoder selector (Precoder S.) or estimator unit or function <b>10</b>G. The eNB <b>12</b> can be assumed to include a MIMO unit or function <b>12</b>E that interprets and responds to the feedback information output from the CQI reporting function <b>10</b>E of the UE <b>10</b> for controlling and managing DL MIMO transmissions to the UE <b>10</b>. As a part of this functionality the eNB <b>12</b> also includes a precoder <b>12</b>F, and the precoding thus takes place in the eNB <b>12</b>. In operation, the UE <b>10</b> estimates, based on DL reference symbols, the preferred precoding matrices PMI<b>1</b> and PMI<b>2</b> and send them as a feedback to the eNB <b>12</b>. The eNB <b>12</b> does not need to obey the recommendation, and it can basically freely select the precoder.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0089">The PROGs <b>10</b>C and <b>12</b>C are assumed to include program instructions that, when executed by the associated DP, enable the device to operate in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention, as will be discussed below in greater detail. That is, the exemplary embodiments of this invention may be implemented at least in part by computer software executable by the DP <b>10</b>A of the UE <b>10</b> and/or by the DP <b>12</b>A of the eNB <b>12</b>, or by hardware, or by a combination of software and hardware (and firmware).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0090">In general, the various embodiments of the UE <b>10</b> can include, but are not limited to, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) having wireless communication capabilities, portable computers having wireless communication capabilities, image capture devices such as digital cameras having wireless communication capabilities, gaming devices having wireless communication capabilities, music storage and playback appliances having wireless communication capabilities, Internet appliances permitting wireless Internet access and browsing, as well as portable units or terminals that incorporate combinations of such functions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0091">The computer-readable MEMs <b>10</b>B and <b>12</b>B may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment and may be implemented using any suitable data storage technology, such as semiconductor based memory devices, flash memory, magnetic memory devices and systems, optical memory devices and systems, fixed memory and removable memory. The DPs <b>10</b>A and <b>12</b>A may be of any type suitable to the local technical environment, and may include one or more of general purpose computers, special purpose computers, microprocessors, digital signal processors (DSPs) and processors based on multi-core processor architectures, as non-limiting examples.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0092">Turning now to a detailed description of the exemplary embodiments of this invention, there is provided a design of a feedback signaling framework that supports flexible, reliable and efficient DL SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO operation in LTE Rel-10, as well as in further releases of LTE, without mandating a major redesign of the UL control signaling structures. The exemplary embodiments define a CSI feedback signaling framework for PMI<b>1</b> and PMI<b>2</b> that maximizes the UE <b>10</b> implementation synergy with LTE Rel-8. As a result of this synergy the standardization effort related to the LTE-A feedback signaling is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0093">More specifically, the exemplary embodiments define the CSI signaling for the wideband precoding component (PMI<b>1</b> from the codebook W<b>1</b>) so that there is no need to signal the transmission rank (RI) explicitly. In other words, the transmission rank is signaled jointly/implicitly with the wideband/long term channel characteristics described by PMI<b>1</b>. This approach allows a mapping of the Rel-8 (and Rel-9) feedback signaling fields to the Rel-10 feedback signaling fields as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0094">The above described mapping makes it possible to reuse efficiently the signaling structures from LTE Rel-8, hence minimizing the need for changes in the standards or in the device and the network implementation. Exemplary implementation examples for the UL channels PUCCH and PUSCH are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0095">A prerequisite for the mapping is that the codebook structure of W<b>1</b> and W<b>2</b> allow for implicit/joint signaling of RI (i.e., the indication of RI is embedded in the signaling of PMI<b>1</b>). The generic structure of W<b>1</b> enables the above mentioned mapping because it is expected to fulfill the following properties.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0096">Assume that the codebook W<b>1</b> contains elements for up to transmission rank M (typically M=2, 4, or 8). The codebook W<b>1</b> contains multiple elements per transmission rank only for the N lowest ranks. The rank specific elements in the codebook W<b>1</b> for rank R&#x3e;N consist of fewer elements each than those of the N lowest ranks. One non-limiting assumption for the implementation of the exemplary embodiments of this invention is that the total number of codebook elements for all transmission ranks is low enough such that there is no need to signal the rank explicitly. In other words, RI may be signaled jointly with the precoder matrix indicator itself and, hence, just an indication of the precoding matrix index will suffice. This can be accomplished using, for example, about 4 bits to about 8 bits.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0097">Discussed first is signaling using the PUCCH. As was made apparent above, the exemplary embodiments reuse the existing signaling by defining a re-mapping between the control signaling fields. In LTE Rel-8 the RI is sent in different subframes than CQI and PMI, which are jointly encoded. All the fields are transmitted using the PUCCH formats 2/2a/2b. Reference with regard to PUCCH formats 2/2a/2b can be made to 3GPP TS 36.211 V9.1.0 (2010-03) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical Channels and Modulation (Release 9), Section 5.4.2, &#x201c;PUCCH formats 2/2a/2b&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0098">For completeness, it should be noted that alternatively block-spread DFT-S-OFDMA or multi-sequence modulation could be used. In such a case also tail-biting convolutional codes can be considered as the forward error correcting scheme. That is, the exemplary embodiments of this invention are not limited for use only with the existing PUCCH formats, and other techniques/formats can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0099">Based on the foregoing, the following principles can be defined for the transmission of PMI<b>1</b> and PMI<b>2</b>:</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">A) PUCCH formats 2/2a/2b can be used (as a non-limiting example);</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">B) the parameters periodicity and subframe offset are configured separately for the reports that contain PMI<b>1</b> or PMI<b>2</b>, similarly as for the RI and CQI/PMI in LTE Rel-8;</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">C) RI is not explicitly signaled;</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">D) PMI<b>1</b> is sent in the place of RI, and the same (20, N) Walsh-Hadamard block coding is used for forward error correction as in LTE Rel-8 and, additionally, a corresponding CQI (or possibly two CQIs when rank&#x3e;1) may be embedded into the report;</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">E) PMI<b>2</b> is sent in the place of PMI., otherwise the structure of the report is exactly as is defined for LTE Rel-8; and</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0100">F) the reporting modes defined in LTE Rel-8 with closed loop MIMO operation (mode 1-1 and 2-1 as defined in 3GPP TS 36.213 V9.1.0 (2010-03) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Physical layer procedures (Release 9).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0101">An exemplary diagram of the reporting assuming mode 1-1 is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Here the periodicity of the RI and CQI/PMI reporting is 10 subframes and 5 subframes, respectively. For simplicity the same periodicities are assumed for PMI<b>1</b> and CQI/PMI<b>2</b>. In the RRC configuration parameters the same signaling fields can be used as in the case of Rel-8.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0102">Discussed now is signaling using the PUSCH (periodic or aperiodic). The basic principle remains the same as in the case of the PUCCH, i.e., PMI<b>1</b> replaces RI and PMI<b>2</b> replaces PMI. In the case of PMI<b>2</b> there are no issues with applying the Rel-8 channel coding principles directly. Furthermore, the Rel-8 aperiodic reporting formats for closed loop MIMO operation (Aperiodic modes 1-2, 2-2, and 3-1 as defined in 3GPP 36 TS 36.213) can be used as already specified. As an example, in the where case multiple PMIs are included in the report, such as in mode 1-2, each of the Rel-8 subband specific PMIs can be replaced with a corresponding PMI<b>2</b> calculated assuming the same subband definitions as in Rel-8.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0103">However, the channel coding used for RI in LTE Rel-8 is either simple repetition coding (in the case of a 1-bit RI) or duplex coding (with a 2-bit RI). Neither of these two Rel-8 schemes are applicable as such for PMI<b>1</b> since the payload size is different (or at least they would be sub-optimal coding schemes if used for PMI<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0104">The use of the (32, N) Walsh-Hadamard block coding (used in LTE-Rel-8 when periodic CQI is transmitted on the PUSCH together with data) is one type of coding that can be used for PMI<b>1</b>. Alternatively the (20, N) Walsh-Hadamard block coding used on the PUCCH is another type of coding that can be used for PMI<b>1</b>. The exemplary embodiments of this invention are not, however, limited for use with only (32, N) Walsh-Hadamard block coding or (20, N) Walsh-Hadamard block coding.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0105">The number of resource elements for PMI<b>1</b> can be derived using the formulas defining UL control signals dimensioning in LTE Rel-8. Reference in this regard may be made to 3GPP TS 36.212 V9.1.0 (2010-03) Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Multiplexing and channel coding (Release 9), such as Section 5.2.2.6, Channel coding of control information</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0106">There are several alternatives/options for allocating the resource element (RE) positions for signaling the PMI<b>1</b>. One option is to use the same resources as for the RI in LTE Rel-8 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, in this approach the maximum number of REs may not be sufficient in all cases to guarantee sufficient reliability for signaling. Another option is to allocate a new set of resources for PMI<b>1</b> as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. One advantageous technique to accomplish this is to reserve the resources from the same positions as used for carrying CQI/PMI in Rel-8. In such a case the resources for PMI<b>2</b>/CQI can be placed following the resources for PMI<b>1</b>. The resources for PMI<b>2</b>/CQI are then followed by the resource for user data.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0107">Note that in this exemplary embodiment the subframe for signaling PMI<b>1</b> and the subframe for signaling PMI<b>2</b> do not need to be in the same frame. Further, they may also be signaled in the same subframe. This is also the case for joint signaling an RI and PMI. Any of the RIs or PMIs may be jointly signaled in the same frame or a separate frame from another RI and/or PMI.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0108">Discussed now is the codebook design. One desirable codebook structure for W<b>1</b> is that the number of codebook elements for the lowest ranks (e.g., ranks 2 or 4 and below) is significantly higher than that of higher ranks (e.g., above 4). This is compatible with the fact that in many generic codebook designs the lower ranks are given the most emphasis since they generally provide most precoding gain. This assumption holds for the dual codebook structure as well, i.e., the wideband precoding component (PMI<b>1</b> from the W<b>1</b> codebook) can be expected to yield the highest gains for transmission ranks lower than two or four, in many practical use case scenarios.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0109">The use of the exemplary embodiments of this invention provides a number of technical effects. For example, the use of the exemplary embodiments provides a way to feedback PMI<b>1</b> and PMI<b>2</b> utilizing the UL control signaling principles defined for LTE Rel-8. The use of the exemplary embodiments thus minimizes the standardization effort required to implement the LTE-Rel-10 CSI MIMO feedback. The use of the exemplary embodiments of this invention also simplifies the implementation by allowing a large reuse of existing baseband functionalities. Further, as it is well understood that the lowest ranks have the highest importance (e.g., with respect to precoding gain) there can be the highest number of codebook elements at low ranks, thereby making the joint signaling of RI and PMI<b>1</b> practical.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0110">Based on the foregoing it should be apparent that the exemplary embodiments of this invention provide a method, apparatus and computer program(s) to provide enhanced CSI feedback for DL MIMO operation in LTE Rel-10 and beyond Rel-10.</p>
