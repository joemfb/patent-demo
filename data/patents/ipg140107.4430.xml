<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;user agent&#x201d; and &#x201c;UA&#x201d; might in some cases refer to mobile devices such as mobile telephones, personal digital assistants, handheld or laptop computers, and similar devices that have telecommunications capabilities. Such a UA might consist of a UA and its associated removable memory module, such as but not limited to a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) that includes a Subscriber identity Module (SIM) application, a Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) application, or a Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM) application. Alternatively, such a UA might consist of the device itself without such a module. In other cases, the term &#x201c;UA&#x201d; might refer to devices that have similar capabilities but that are not transportable, such as desktop computers, set-top boxes, or network appliances. The term &#x201c;UA&#x201d; can also refer to any hardware or software component that can terminate a communication session for a user. Also, the terms &#x201c;user agent,&#x201d; &#x201c;UA,&#x201d; &#x201c;user equipment,&#x201d; &#x201c;UE,&#x201d; &#x201c;user device&#x201d; and &#x201c;user node&#x201d; might be used synonymously herein.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As telecommunications technology has evolved, more advanced network access equipment has been introduced that can provide services that were not possible previously. This network access equipment might include systems and devices that are improvements of the equivalent equipment in a traditional wireless telecommunications system. Such advanced or next generation equipment may be included in evolving wireless communications standards, such as long-term evolution (LTE). For example, an LTE system might include an enhanced node B (eNB), a wireless access point, or a similar component rather than a traditional base station. As used herein, the term &#x201c;access node&#x201d; will refer to any component of the wireless network, such as a traditional base station, a wireless access point, or an LTE eNB, that creates a geographical area of reception and transmission coverage allowing a UA or a relay node to access other components in a telecommunications system. In this document, the term &#x201c;access node&#x201d; may comprise a plurality of hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An LTE system can include protocols such as a Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol, which is responsible for the assignment, configuration, and release of radio resources between a UA and an access node or relay node or other LTE equipment. The RRC protocol is described in detail in the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Technical Specification (TS) 36.331. According to the RRC protocol, the two basic RRC modes for a UA are defined as &#x201c;idle mode&#x201d; and &#x201c;connected mode.&#x201d; During the connected mode or state, the UA may exchange signals with the network and perform other related operations, while during the idle mode or state, the UA may shut down at least some of its connected mode operations. Idle and connected mode behaviors are described in detail in 3GPP TS 36.304 and TS 36.331.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The signals that carry data between UAs, relay nodes, and access nodes can have frequency, time, and coding parameters and other characteristics that might be specified by a network node. A connection between any of these elements that has a specific set of such characteristics can be referred to as a resource. The terms &#x201c;resource,&#x201d; &#x201c;communications connection,&#x201d; &#x201c;channel,&#x201d; and &#x201c;communications link&#x201d; might be used synonymously herein. A network node typically establishes a different resource for each UA or other network node with which it is communicating at any particular time.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">&#x201c;TS&#x201d; is defined as &#x201c;technical specifications,&#x201d; which are mobile communications specifications called-for by the 3GPP (3<sup>rd </sup>generation partnership project) for implementing an LTE system.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Other acronyms that may appear herein are used and defined according to the technical specifications of the 3GPP standards.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the present disclosure relates to setting establishment causes (ECs) in the context of a CS fallback procedure in EPS-enabled devices. As a non-limiting aid in understanding the present disclosure, an EC, or &#x201c;establishment cause,&#x201d; refers to data that informs intervening protocol layers, as well as devices and software in a radio access network (RAN) an/or a core network (CN), as to the &#x201c;cause&#x201d; or &#x201c;reason&#x201d; why a communication is to be established. The &#x201c;reason&#x201d; for the communication can be used to manage new and established communications, and to assign communication resources to individual communications according to desired priorities. Thus, for example, if a particular communication has an establishment cause (EC) of &#x201c;emergency call,&#x201d; then the devices and software in the EPS can give highest priority to that call, possibly excluding other pending or existing communications in favor of the emergency call. Other non-limiting examples of ECs in an EPS include &#x201c;high priority access,&#x201d; &#x201c;MT access,&#x201d; MO signaling,&#x201d; &#x201c;MO data,&#x201d; and possibly others.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An EC is helpful to the efficiency of a mobile communication system because an EC prevents many intervening protocol stack layers within individual devices, as well as additional protocol stack layers in intervening RAN devices, from having to decode a data block to discover the reason for a communication. Instead, the EC may inform one or more intervening protocol stack layers, within a device initiating a communication but more importantly in RAN devices and CN devices, as to the reason for the communication without the intervening protocol stack layers having to decode a data block. Because a data block is decoded less frequently as it negotiates the protocol stack layers of various devices in the EPS, the transfer of the data block can occur more quickly and efficiently. Decoding a data block less frequently also lessens the costs of implementing those devices.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With this understanding of ECs, an understanding of a CS fallback procedure may also be helpful to understanding the present disclosure. As described above, a CS fallback procedure is a procedure in which, when implementing a communication, an evolved packet system (EPS) enabled device &#x201c;falls back&#x201d; to a circuit switched (CS) communication procedure. The &#x201c;CS fallback&#x201d; procedure is often used when an EPS-enabled device attempts to establish voice communication over a traditional mobile CS network, as opposed to data communication.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The details of how a CS communication procedure operates in mobile communication systems prior to LTE/EPS&#x2014;such as UMTS&#x2014;are known, and other than as described herein, are not necessary to an understanding of the present disclosure. However, it should be understood that both CS communication procedures and EPS communication procedures use ECs. It should also be understood that the ECs for CS communications in UMTS are entirely different from the ECs of EPS communications. In UMTS, communications call can have one of many ECs (over two dozen). EPS communications call for five ECs, leaving three spare ECs for later definition and use&#x2014;for a total of eight possible ECs. For future communication procedures, a similar problem may arise in that different numbers or different types of ECs may exist that cannot be readily mapped to ECs defined for older communication procedures. Thus, the embodiments described herein are not necessarily limited to specifying ECs for CS fallback procedures in EPS systems, to the eight currently available ECs, or to other ECs that may be available. Further, the available ECs in UMTS are not all for CS communications; rather, these ECs are for all types of communications in UMTS, of which CS communications are one technique.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For reasons described further below, the ECs for CS communications cannot be simply mapped to the ECs for EPS communications. Thus, previously, when a UA desired to implement a communication using a CS procedure, no mechanism existed for the EPS-enabled device to set the proper CS fallback-defined EC. The present disclosure is directed to this issue and resolves this problem in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular, the present disclosure provides for three or more solutions or techniques for resolving this issue. In a first embodiment, a strict mapping is provided between a CS fallback procedure and an EPS EC. In a second embodiment, a service type of the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message transmitted by an EPS-enabled device has a value that sets the appropriate CS EC. In a third embodiment, one of the three spare ECs in the EPS communication procedure is used to set the EPS EC. Other embodiments and variations exist, as described below and as appreciated by those in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> describe an exemplary procedure of how a UA establishes communication with a CN in an EPS. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> describe exemplary details of the protocol stacks in a UA, a RAN device, and a CN device. Generally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> provide a context for understanding ECs in an EPS, and the issue of defining ECs in the context of a CS fallback procedure in an EPS-enabled device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> describe exemplary solutions to the issues described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, though exemplary solutions to these issues are also understood within the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a UA communicating with a core network via a radio access network, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a path taken by a data block from a UA to a core network, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> have similar components that have similar functions; thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> share similar reference numerals and are described together.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an illustrative embodiment, a UA <b>100</b> attempts to establish a connection with a CN <b>102</b>. Such an attempt can be referred to as a mobile originating call, or MO, because the UA initiates the connection attempt. However, the following processes can also apply to a mobile terminating (MT) call, wherein the CN <b>102</b> initiates the connection attempt.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To initiate the connection attempt, the UA NAS <b>104</b> sends a request message, e.g., a SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST, to the CN NAS <b>106</b> via a radio access network (RAN) <b>108</b>. The UA NAS <b>104</b> initiates the request and, within the UA <b>100</b>, transmits the request to the UA access stratum (AS) <b>110</b>. In turn, the AS <b>110</b> transmits the request over a physical layer, such as radio waves as shown by arrow <b>112</b>, to the RAN <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The RAN AS <b>114</b> receives the request, and allocates preliminary resources to the UA <b>100</b> and then communicates the request to interworking functions <b>116</b> of the RAN <b>108</b>. Interworking functions may include managing the request relative to other requests, as well as other functions. Interworking functions <b>116</b> also communicate with CN to RAN controllers <b>118</b>, which control communications between the RAN <b>108</b> and the CN <b>102</b>. The actual communication of the request between the RAN <b>108</b> and the CN <b>102</b> is transmitted along a physical layer, which may be wires or cables, for example, as shown by arrow <b>120</b>. The physical layer <b>120</b> can also be implemented as a wireless backhaul.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Within the CN <b>102</b>, CN to RAN controllers <b>122</b> receive the request and transmit the request to the CN NAS <b>106</b>. The CN NAS <b>106</b> then decodes the data within the request, and takes an appropriate action to allocate additional or necessary mobile resources to the UA <b>100</b> for that wireless communication. The CN NAS <b>106</b> transmits such information to the UA <b>100</b> via the RAN <b>108</b> in a manner similar to the process described above, but in the other direction.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another embodiment, the CN initiates a MT (mobile terminating) call. The process described above occurs from CN NAS <b>106</b> to UA NAS <b>104</b> in a process similar to that described above.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the same process in more detail in order to describe the use of an EC in an EPS communication in accordance with one embodiment. Again, in an embodiment, the UA NAS <b>104</b> initiates a communication to CN NAS <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">EC <b>204</b> is data that informs intervening protocol layers, as well as devices and software in RAN <b>108</b> and CN <b>102</b>, as to the &#x201c;cause&#x201d; or &#x201c;reason&#x201d; why a communication is to be established. EC <b>204</b> allows such intervening protocol layers to know the reason for the transmission of data block <b>200</b> without having to decode or open data block <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At number <b>1</b> <b>202</b>, UA NAS <b>104</b> transmits a data block <b>200</b> with EC <b>204</b> to UA AS <b>110</b>, with the ultimate intended destination of data block <b>200</b> being CN NAS <b>106</b>. UA AS <b>110</b> then begins the work of transmitting the data block <b>200</b>. Again, UA AS <b>110</b> does not decode data block <b>200</b>, but rather uses EC <b>204</b> to know the reason for transmission of data block <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At number <b>2</b> <b>206</b>, the UA AS <b>110</b> transmits a RRC CONNECTION REQUEST and EC <b>204</b> to RAN AS <b>114</b>. RAN AS <b>114</b> responds with a RRC CONNECTION SETUP command. Knowing the EC <b>20</b>, RAN AS <b>114</b> allocates initial preliminary resources to the UA <b>100</b>, as shown at number <b>3</b> <b>208</b>. If successful, the UA AS <b>110</b> responds with a RRC CONNECTION SETUP COMPLETE signal, together with data block <b>200</b>, as shown at number <b>4</b> <b>210</b>. As a result, data block <b>200</b> is transmitted from UA AS <b>110</b> to RAN AS <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At number <b>5</b> <b>212</b> the RAN AS <b>114</b> transmits data block <b>200</b> and the EC <b>204</b> to interworking functions <b>116</b> of the RAN <b>108</b>. The interworking functions <b>116</b> prioritize processing of data block <b>200</b>, as well as perform other functions. At this point, further transmission of the EC is optional. Additionally, the EC may not have been transmitted after execution of number <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When processing is complete, the interworking functions <b>116</b> transmits data block <b>200</b>, and may also optionally provide EC <b>204</b> to CN to RAN controllers <b>118</b>, as shown at number <b>6</b> <b>214</b>. In turn, as shown at number <b>7</b> <b>216</b>, the CN to RAN controllers <b>118</b> transmit data block <b>200</b>, optionally with the EC <b>204</b> if available from number <b>6</b> <b>214</b>, and a CONNECTION REQUEST to the CN to RAN controllers <b>122</b> of the core network. The CN to RAN controllers <b>122</b> then transmits the data block <b>200</b> and optionally the EC if available from number <b>7</b> <b>216</b> to the CN NAS <b>106</b>, as shown at number <b>8</b> <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Throughout <b>202</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> and <b>218</b>, none of the intervening devices and software of the protocol layers between UA AS <b>110</b> and CN to RAN controllers <b>122</b> have decoded data block <b>200</b> to either determine the contents of data block <b>200</b> or to determine a cause for the communication of data block <b>200</b>. However, some or all of these intervening protocol stack layers in one or more of UA <b>100</b>, RAN <b>108</b>, and CN <b>102</b> have used EC <b>204</b> to aid in determining the priority and processing to apply to data block <b>200</b>. However, at the final stage, the CN NAS <b>106</b> decodes the data block <b>200</b> and processes the data contained therein.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an embodiment, the CN NAS<b>106</b> decodes the data block <b>200</b> and finds that data block <b>200</b> comprises a SERVICE REQUEST or an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST. These requests indicate to the CN NAS <b>106</b> that UA <b>100</b> desires mobile communication resources to establish communication with some other device via the CN <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After processing the data in data block <b>200</b>, the CN NAS <b>106</b> determines an appropriate response, such as to allocate the mobile communication resources to UA <b>100</b>. The CN NAS <b>106</b> then transmits data regarding such resources back to the UA <b>100</b> using a process similar to that described above, except in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Otherwise stated, UA NAS <b>104</b> is communicating a SERVICE REQUEST or an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST to CN NAS <b>106</b>. The signaling and protocol controllers that allow this communication are implemented as layers of protocol. For each layer, peer-to-peer entities signal and communicate with each other to enable and realize functions so that service can be provided. These concepts are explained in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of a control plane between a user agent, radio access network, and core network, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram of a control plane between a user agent, radio access network, and core network, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> have similar components that have similar functions; thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> share similar reference numerals and are described together. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show additional detail in the relationship amongst the protocol stack layers among UA <b>100</b>, RAN <b>108</b>, and CN <b>102</b>. The description of communication of data from UA <b>100</b> to CN <b>102</b> and back again is provided with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, which also applies to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As described above, one or more of the network layer signaling and protocol controllers of the UA AS <b>110</b>, RAN <b>108</b>, and CN NAS <b>106</b> may communicate with one another through communications links established by the underlying RAN controllers. In UMTS and 3GPP terminologies, the network layer between the UA <b>100</b> and the CN <b>102</b> is termed the non-access stratum (NAS). UA <b>100</b> has UA NAS <b>104</b> and CN <b>102</b> has CN NAS <b>106</b>; however, RAN <b>108</b> may not have a NAS in the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The radio access layers in the UA <b>100</b> and RAN <b>108</b> are termed the access stratum (AS). UA AS <b>110</b> includes several protocol layers in UA <b>100</b>, and RAN AS <b>114</b> includes several protocol layers in RAN <b>108</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In each protocol stack, an underlying layer provides services to the layer above. Thus, for example, the UA AS <b>110</b> of UA <b>100</b> provides services to the UA NAS <b>104</b>. One of the services provided by UA AS <b>110</b> is to establish a signaling connection for the UA NAS <b>104</b> of the UA <b>100</b>. The signaling connection allows the UA NAS <b>104</b> to communicate with the CN NAS <b>106</b>. In LTE/SAE (system architecture evolution)/EPS networks, the CN NAS <b>106</b> can be referred to as the enhanced packet core (EPC). The process of establishing a signaling connection is described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. More details regarding the signaling connection can be found in 3GPP TS 36.331 and in 3GPP TS 25.331.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As part of the establishment of the signaling connection, the RRC of the UA <b>100</b> provides to the RAN AS <b>114</b> an indication of the reason for requesting the connection. This EC is built into the RRC signaling protocol, as further described in 3GPP TS 36.331.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As also described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the EC serves the purpose of indicating to the destination nodes, such as the eNBJE-UTRAN and perhaps even for the EPC, the reason for the establishment of the signaling connection. Thus, these devices and software can allocate appropriate resources for the signaling connection, and subsequent usage of the signaling connection. The EC can also be used to discriminate or determine how much to charge a user of UA <b>100</b> for use of the mobile communication service.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In UMTS, and now in EPS, the EC that the RRC provides to the network in an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST MESSAGE is taken from the inter-layer request from the UA NAS <b>104</b>. See, for example, the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST field descriptions in 3GPP TS 36.331.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In UMTS, the ECs can take one of many values. The possible values for ECs in UMTS are given in 3GPP TS 25.331. Currently, more than 20 possible values exist for ECs in UMTS.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In summary, then, the RRC EC that the UA AS <b>110</b> provides in the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST comes from UA NAS <b>104</b>. The UA NAS <b>104</b> also determines the EC to be used. In UMTS, the UA NAS <b>104</b> chooses the EC in accordance to the rules provided in UMTS Annex L of 3GPP TS 24.008. These rules set down the mapping of the NAS procedure to the RRC EC.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">With the above description of how mobile communications operate, the following solutions and techniques provided by the present disclosure can now be properly understood. In EPS, the equivalent list of ECs for UMTS (described in 3GPP TS 36.331) is not available. Instead, in EPS, there have been established five set ECs and three spare ECs. The five set ECs are &#x201c;emergency call,&#x201d; &#x201c;high priority access,&#x201d; &#x201c;mobile terminating (MT) access,&#x201d; &#x201c;mobile originating (MO) signaling,&#x201d; and &#x201c;MO data.&#x201d; Spare ECs have not been defined, but have been reserved for later definition.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Thus, in EPS, when the UA NAS <b>104</b> attempts to establish an RRC connection, the UA NAS <b>104</b> will set one of the five ECs described above. This procedure may be used in most if not all EPS communications.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">However, for some types of communications, particular voice calls, use of the conventional UMTS system may be desirable. Thus, a procedure has been implemented wherein an EPS-enabled device can use the conventional UMTS procedures, devices, and software. This procedure is known as a &#x201c;CS fallback,&#x201d; which stands for &#x201c;circuit-switched fallback.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The EPS-enabled device is programmed to use the EPS ECs when transmitting data over an EPS network, and the EPS network expects to see EPS ECs. However, EPS ECs have to be used when the EPS-enabled device, while in EPS, wishes to initiate a CS fallback service that will lead to using the UMTS procedures. EPCs should be used in this circumstance because the UA NAS <b>104</b> initiates such a CS fallback in the EPS.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At first glance it may appear that one could inherit the UMTS ECs from 3GPP TS 24.008 into the EPS NAS specification. However, EPS NAS procedures have changed, and improved functionalities have been implemented such that the conventional UMTS mapping cannot apply. Furthermore, the RRC ECs indicated for the EPS are quite different from those used in UMTS; thus, again, a copy over of the UMTS ECs, or one-to-one mapping, is not possible. Still further, very few ECs are used in the EPS, relative to the UMTS systems. Yet further, some EPS NAS procedures realized by the new NAS messages do not exist in UMTS. For example, the NAS in the EPS uses either a SERVICE REQUEST message or an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, but the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST is not used in UMTS.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The issue of mapping EPS-related ECs to UMTS-related ECs has been addressed, partially only, with regard to a general mapping of NAS procedures to an EPS RRC EC. See, for example, document C1-083834 promulgated by CT1, which is hereby incorporated by reference. However, this proposed solution does not address all of the issues described above. In particular, this proposed solution does not work in the case of a CS fallback communication because, in EPS systems, the service request procedure is also used to realize CS fallback communications. Additionally, through a CS fallback procedure, the UA can initiate an emergency call in the CS domain. Still further, the existence in EPS of the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message as a signaling message of the service request procedure is not accounted-for in existing documentation, such as C1-083834. The following figures and description provide solutions and techniques in this regard.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a table illustrating a strict mapping between a CS fallback invoked telephony service and an EPS RRC establishment cause, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. Table <b>500</b> illustrates one embodiment of addressing the limitations described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The embodiments described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> provide for a strict mapping between the CS fallback invoked telephony service, such as an MO call, a MT call, or an emergency call, to an EPS RRC EC. This strict mapping can be, for example, in the form provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, though other mappings could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Row <b>502</b> shows the titles for the columns, including &#x201c;Telephony service for which CS fallback is initiated&#x201d; and &#x201c;RRC establishment cause to use.&#x201d; Rows <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, and <b>508</b> show the mappings to be used by row. Thus, as shown in row <b>504</b>, for a service request procedure triggered by CS fallback to initiate a CS MO call, the EPS EC &#x201c;MO signaling&#x201d; can be used. Alternatively, the EPS EC &#x201c;MO data&#x201d; can be used. As shown in row <b>506</b>, for a service request procedure triggered by CS fallback to receive a CS MT call, the EPS EC &#x201c;MO signaling&#x201d; can be used. Alternatively, the EPS EC &#x201c;MT access&#x201d; can be used. In yet another embodiment, the EPS EC &#x201c;MO data&#x201d; can be used. As shown in row <b>508</b>, for a service request procedure triggered by CS fallback to initiate a CS MO emergency call, the EPS EC &#x201c;emergency call&#x201d; can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In an embodiment, a processor can be configured to set an establishment cause (EC) to &#x201c;MO signaling&#x201d; if a SERVICE REQUEST requests resources for UL (uplink) signaling. In another embodiment, a processor can be configured to set an establishment cause to &#x201c;MO data&#x201d; if a SERVICE REQUEST requests user plane radio resources. In yet another embodiment, a processor configured can be configured to set an establishment cause to &#x201c;MT access&#x201d; if a CN domain indicator is set to PS (packet switched).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process of determining an RRC establishment cause of an EPS NAS procedure during a CS fallback communication, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is another technique provided to address the issues described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be implemented entirely in a UA, but may be initiated in a UA and then additionally processed in part in a RAN. In additional optional embodiments, the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may be implemented entirely in a CN, but may be initiated in a CN and then additionally processed in part in a RAN. In still further optional embodiments, the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can be initiated in a RAN and then processed in either the UA or CN, though in this case the RAN device should have an NAS layer or some other functionality for generating the EC.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> takes advantage of the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message used in EPS communications. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> specifically discloses using an information element associated with the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST, known as a &#x201c;service type.&#x201d; The service type can be provided with one or more decode values that reflect a cause for the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST that is being attempted. Thus, in this embodiment, the decode value or values of the service type used in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST is used to provide the mapping to which the RRC EC is to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In an embodiment, the process begins with a processor initiating a circuit switched (CS) fallback service over a tangible device of an evolved packet system (EPS) (block <b>600</b>). The tangible device may be a UA, or optionally or a CN. In the case of a UA or CN, the tangible device further comprises a protocol layer having a non-access stratum (NAS).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">After initiating the CS fallback service, NAS processes an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST having a service type with a decode value (block <b>602</b>). The decode value can be used to identify an EPS-defined radio resource control (RRC) establishment cause (EC) (block <b>604</b>). For whichever of the UA or the CN that initiated the communication, the various devices and protocol layers within the EPS system then use the EPS-defined RRC EC during processing of the CS fallback service (block <b>606</b>). The process terminates thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The process described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can also be expanded. For example, in an embodiment the NAS can generate the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST. In this case, the NAS of the UA determines the decode value and causes the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST to be transmitted to realize the CS fallback service. In contrast, the NAS of the UA could receive the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST. In this case, an access stratum (AS) of the tangible device processes the decode value.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A number of specific examples of service types and corresponding RRC ECs are provided herein. In a first example, the service type comprises &#x201c;mobile originating (MO) CS fallback.&#x201d; In this case, the RRC EC comprises one of &#x201c;MO signaling&#x201d; or MO data.&#x201d; In a second example, the service type comprises &#x201c;mobile terminating (MT) CS fallback.&#x201d; In this case, the RRC EC comprises one of &#x201c;MT access&#x201d; or &#x201c;mobile originating (MO) signaling&#x201d; or &#x201c;MO data&#x201d;. In a third example, the service type comprises &#x201c;mobile originating (MO) CS fallback emergency call.&#x201d; In this case, the RRC EC comprises &#x201c;emergency call.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one embodiment, messages other than the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message may have a service type information element. This service type information element may indicate a type of service requested. Thus, an EC may be determined based upon the service type in associated with messages other than the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message. For example, a future system may have a video network-socializing service. A message may be sent to request the video network-socializing service. The EC based on service type may be associated with the request message and may indicate that video service is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process of determining an RRC establishment cause of an EPS NAS procedure during a CS fallback communication, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is yet another way for addressing the issues described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be implemented in a tangible device enabled for a circuit switched (CS) fallback service in an evolved packet system (EPS). The tangible device may be a UA, or optionally a CN. In the case of a UA or CN, the tangible device further includes a protocol layer having a non-access stratum (NAS).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The process begins as the NAS generates an EPS-defined radio resource control (RRC) establishment cause (EC) (block <b>700</b>). The NAS defines the EPS RRC EC for a given type of CS fallback service (block <b>702</b>). The process terminates thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In an embodiment, all possible EPS-defined RRC ECs include five defined RRC ECs and three spare RRC ECs. In this case, the RRC EC defined for the given type of CS fallback service replaces one of the three spare RRC ECs. In an embodiment, the replaced RRC EC can be &#x201c;CS fallback services.&#x201d; In another embodiment, the replaced RRC EC can be &#x201c;CS emergency call.&#x201d; In yet another embodiment, two of the three spare RRC ECs can be replaced, a first one being &#x201c;CS fallback services,&#x201d; and a second being &#x201c;CS emergency call.&#x201d; In different embodiments, different names for these formerly spare RRC ECs can be used while the functions of the formerly spare RRC ECs remain substantially the same. The functions include indicating that the RRC connection request is for CS fallback services, or, if appropriate or desired, a CS emergency call.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process of determining an RRC establishment cause of an EPS NAS procedure during communication to realize a CS fallback service, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is yet another technique for resolving the issues described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> corresponds to the solution described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The process begins as a circuit switched (CS) fallback service is initiated in an evolved packet system (EPS)-enabled device (block <b>800</b>). The EPS-enabled device includes a protocol layer having a non-access stratum (NAS). The EPS-enabled device then identifies a type of CS fallback service request being initiated (block <b>802</b>). The NAS of the EPS-enabled device then processes an EPS-defined radio resource control (RRC) establishment cause (EC) that corresponds to the type of CS fallback service (block <b>804</b>). The term &#x201c;corresponds to&#x201d; means that a particular type CS fallback service has a corresponding particular RRC EC. The process terminates thereafter. This process can be performed during either one of generating the RRC EC or receiving the RRC EC.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The mapping of types of CS fallback service requests to EPS-defined RRC ECs can take different forms. In a first example, when the type of CS fallback service request comprises a CS mobile originating (MO) call, the corresponding RRC EC may be one of &#x201c;MO signaling&#x201d; or &#x201c;MO data.&#x201d; In a second example, when the type of CS fallback service request comprises a CS mobile terminating (MT) call, the corresponding RRC EC may be one of &#x201c;mobile originating signaling&#x201d; or &#x201c;MO data&#x201d; or &#x201c;MT access.&#x201d; In a third example, when the type of CS fallback service request comprises a mobile originating emergency call, the corresponding RRC EC may be an &#x201c;emergency call&#x201d;.</p>
