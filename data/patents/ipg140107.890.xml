<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of pending International patent application PCT/EP2008/001571 filed on Feb. 28, 2008 which designates the United States, and which claims priority of German patent application No. 10 2007 011 084.9 filed on Feb. 28, 2007.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention generally relates to valve devices for connecting two conduits in a unit for conducting a product.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention also relates to a unit for conducting a product in which at least two conduits are connected to one another via a valve device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention furthermore relates to a method for operating such a unit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a valve device is used in a unit, for example a food processing unit, a pharmaceuticals processing unit or a gene engineering unit, for connecting two conduits to each other in order to reliably separate the processes running in both of the conduits from each other, or else to transfer the process running in the one conduit into the other conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a food processing unit, a food product, for example milk or a milk product, can flow, for example, in one conduit and a cleaning medium can flow in the other conduit, the cleaning medium being used to clean the other conduit. In the latter case, it is particularly important for the two shut-off members to reliably separate the opposing media flowing in the two conduits from each other because, for example, mixing of the food product flowing in the one conduit with the cleaning medium flowing in the other conduit would spoil the food product.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The leakage space between the two shut-off members serves to make a leakage of one or both shut-off members apparent by the leakage space being monitored with regard to a leakage of medium from one of the two conduits into the leakage space, for example by means of a sensor or simply by visual checking.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The valve device known from DE 42 43 111 A1 is an aseptic double seat valve which ensures that the requirements of reliably separating different processes in the two conduits from each other are met and also satisfies aseptic conditions. Nevertheless, said known valve device has the following disadvantages.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first disadvantage arises during the cleaning of one of the two shut-off members. For example, when the second shut-off member is cleaned, it is opened such that cleaning medium supplied through the second conduit cleans the second shut-off member and the leakage space. However, it is then not possible, at least under the strict regulations of the Process Milk Ordinance (PMO) standard to allow a product to flow in the first conduit while the second shut-off member is being cleaned. This is because the abovementioned PMO standard requires the presence of a steam barrier between the cleaning process and the product process, at least if the latter is an aseptic product process, said steam barrier additionally separating the product process from the cleaning process. Under these strict regulations, it is therefore compulsory to interrupt the product process in the other conduit for the duration of the cleaning process. This leads to the disadvantage of reduced productivity and economic efficiency of the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further disadvantage of the known valve device is that an existing unit for conducting a product and having the known valve device can be expanded only with limited functionality. This is explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>) to <i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) shows a prior art unit for conducting a product <b>100</b>&#x2032;, which unit is installed, for example, in a food processing factory.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In its starting state as per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>), the unit for conducting a product <b>100</b>&#x2032; has, for example, a single sterilizer <b>102</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, an aseptic buffer tank <b>104</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>and a filling group <b>106</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>with two filling stations F<sub>11 </sub>and F<sub>12</sub>. A conduit <b>108</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>leads away from the buffer tank <b>104</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>and is connected to a conduit <b>110</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, which, in turn, is connected to the sterilizer <b>102</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, and to a conduit <b>112</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>which leads to the filling group <b>106</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>. At a first junction point <b>114</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, the conduit <b>108</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>is connected to the conduit <b>112</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>via a known valve device, as described above, and, at a junction point <b>116</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, the conduit <b>108</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>is likewise connected to the conduit <b>110</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>via a known valve device as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The filling group <b>106</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>is designed, for example, for filling a product into containers made of multi-layered material. The functionality of the unit <b>100</b>&#x2032; as per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>) consists in the sterilizer <b>102</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>transferring a product via the conduits <b>110</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, <b>108</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>and <b>112</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>to the filling group <b>106</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>, it being possible for the product to be temporarily stored in the buffer tank <b>104</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>depending on the balance between supply and demand at the filling group <b>106</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In contrast to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>), a valve matrix <b>120</b>&#x2032; comprising conventional valve devices was additionally installed here between the buffer tanks <b>104</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>to <b>104</b>&#x2032;<i>d </i>and the filling groups <b>106</b>&#x2032;<i>a</i>-<i>c </i>such that product can be supplied from each buffer tank <b>104</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>to <b>104</b>&#x2032;<i>d </i>into each filling group <b>106</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>to <b>106</b>&#x2032;<i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">However, said valve matrix <b>120</b>&#x2032; does not solve the problem of the two sterilizers <b>102</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>and <b>102</b>&#x2032;<i>b </i>continuing to be connected only to certain of the buffer tanks <b>104</b>&#x2032;<i>a </i>to <b>104</b>&#x2032;<i>d</i>, as a result of which the full functionality of the unit <b>100</b>&#x2032; continues not to be achieved yet.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">On account of the abovementioned disadvantages, there continues to be a demand for a valve device which, firstly, makes it possible to reliably separate processes in the two conduits, which it connects, without, when there is a cleaning process on one side of the valve device, a product process on the other side of the valve device having to be interrupted, and, in particular if an existing unit for conducting a product is expanded, the valve device also permits the greatest possible functionality of the expanded unit without the use of an additional valve matrix.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Therefore, the invention is based on the object of developing a valve device of the type mentioned at the beginning to the effect that the abovementioned requirements are met.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention is furthermore based on the object of providing a unit for conducting a product with such a valve device, and a method for operating such a unit.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an aspect of the invention, a valve device for connecting two conduits in the unit for conducting a product is provided, comprising: a first double seat valve having a first shut-off member and a second shut-off member, and a first leakage space between said first and said second shut-off members, a first connection for one of said two conduits on a side of said first shut-off member facing away from said first leakage space, a second double seat valve having a third shut-off member and a fourth shut-off member, and a second leakage space between said third and fourth shut-off members, a second connection for the other of said two conduits on the side of said fourth shut-off member facing away from said second leakage space, said first double seat valve and second double seat valve being arranged head to head with respect to one another, and an intermediate third leakage space arranged between said second shut-off member and said third shut-off member, which is sealed off from said first and second leakage spaces in the closed state of the second and third shut-off member.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The valve device according to the invention therefore has four shut-off members and three leakage spaces between the two conduits, which it connects. The valve device according to the invention therefore corresponds to two conventional valve devices arranged head to head, but, in addition, a further central leakage space is arranged between said two valve devices arranged head to head. If the valve device according to the invention is used in an aseptic unit for conducting a product, an aseptic process in one conduit can therefore be reliably separated, for example, from a cleaning process in the other conduit without the aseptic process having to be interrupted for this purpose. There is therefore even the possibility of, for example, opening the third and fourth shut-off members when the first and second shut-off members are closed and of thoroughly cleaning the third and fourth shut-off members at the same time with a cleaning medium while the first leakage space reliably separates the cleaning process from the process in the first conduit. The same applies to the operation the other way around when the first and second shut-off members are opened in order for them to be cleaned while a product can then be conducted in the second conduit, said product then being reliably separated via the second leakage space from the cleaning process in the first leakage space. In both cases, the third central leakage space in each case permits the thorough cleaning of the first and second or third and fourth shut-off members from all sides because the third central leakage space namely participates in the cleaning process.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a preferred refinement, at least the first and the second leakage spaces each have a separate steam inlet in order for sterilizing steam to be admitted to the respective leakage space.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this refinement, the valve device according to the invention even complies with the strict PMO standard which, as explained above, requires a steam barrier to be present between a cleaning process and an aseptic product process. If, for example, the first and second shut-off members are opened for a cleaning process, steam is admitted to the second leakage space between the closed third and fourth shut-off members such that a steam barrier is present between the cleaning process in the first and central third leakage spaces and the conducting of a product in the second conduit. Therefore, even under said strict PMO standard, the conducting of a product in the second conduit advantageously does not have to be interrupted during the cleaning process in the first conduit, the first leakage space and the central third leakage space.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this case, it is furthermore preferred if the respective steam inlet is respectively provided with a controllable steam inlet valve.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this connection, it is advantageous that the steam barrier can be controlled and monitored via the control of the respective steam inlet valve.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In both abovementioned refinements, a steam barrier is preferably also assigned to the third central leakage space. Depending on the operating mode, the preferably three steam barriers can be jointly acted upon by steam via the respective controllable steam inlet valve, or steam can also be admitted to only one of the leakage spaces while the other steam inlet valves are closed, and therefore steam is not admitted to the associated leakage spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a further preferred refinement, a separate outlet leading away downward from the respective leakage space is arranged in each case at least on the first and second leakage spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this connection, it is advantageous that the sterilizing steam supplied via the respective steam inlet can be removed again through the outlet, but leakage can also be removed from the respective leakage space through the respective outlet, or, as described in more detail below, the respective leakage space can be flooded in a reverse flow through the respective outlet with condensate for cooling the shut-off members in order to avoid an undesirable excessive thermal loading of a product during the subsequent conduction thereof through the respective leakage space.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Also within the scope of the abovementioned refinement, it is preferred if the respective outlet is respectively provided with an outlet valve.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As in the case of the steam inlets, there is therefore the advantage of the respective outlet being controlled and monitored independently of one another.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a further preferred refinement, the steam inlets are at an angular offset relative to one another that is smaller than approximately 30&#xb0;, and/or the outlets are at an angular offset relative to one another that is smaller than approximately 30&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">This measure ensures an axially compact configuration of the valve device according to the invention because the angular offset of the steam inlets and/or outlets enables the respective valve control heads to be able to find room next to one another even over a short axial constructional length. In this case, the restriction of the angular offset to a maximum of approximately 30&#xb0; ensures that, when the valve device according to the invention is fitted in a horizontal position, the outlets enclose an angle of at maximum 15&#xb0; with respect to the vertical such that the running of, for example, leakage or condensate out of the respective leakage space continues to be ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a further preferred refinement, the shut-off members and the intermediate third leakage space are arranged in a common, single-piece housing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">This measure likewise advantageously contributes to an axially compact construction because connecting flanges between individual housing sections, which connecting flanges would be required between the first and second leakage spaces in the case of a multi-part configuration of the region of the housing, are avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this case, it is furthermore preferred if the first connection for the one conduit and/or the second connection for the other conduit lead/leads tangentially on a bottom side into the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If the valve device according to the invention is fitted horizontally, this measure has the advantage that a sump, which would then be difficult to remove because it does not automatically run out of the housing section, cannot form in the housing section into which the respective conduit leads. It is important for there to be complete emptying, in particular if the conduit has been previously cleaned with cleaning medium, since a cleaning medium sump in the housing section may contaminate the product conducted through subsequently.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a further preferred refinement, the first shut-off member has a first valve disk and a first valve seat, the second shut-off member has a second valve disk and a second valve seat, and the third shut-off member has a third valve disk and a third valve seat, and the fourth shut-off member has a fourth valve disk and a fourth valve seat.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this refinement, the valve device according to the invention constitutes a twin double seat valve, i.e. two double seat valves are arranged head to head, with a third leakage space additionally being present between the two leakage spaces of the individual double seat valves. In this refinement, the valve device according to the invention is suitable in particular for aseptic units for conducting a product.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a preferred refinement of the abovementioned development, the first and second valve disks and the third and fourth valve disks are each actuable independently of one another.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">This functionality, which is already known in conventional double seat valves, also leads, in the valve device according to the invention, to increased security of the valve device because should, for example, the first valve disk fail, the second can reliably continue to take on the shut-off function.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a further preferred refinement, the arrangement comprising the first and second shut-off members can be opened and closed independently of the arrangement comprising the third and fourth shut-off members.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">This refinement advantageously permits a multiplicity of process functions which will be explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another preferred refinement, the valve device according to the invention is aseptic.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this refinement, the valve device according to the invention can advantageously be used in an aseptic unit for conducting a product.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to another aspect of the invention, a unit for conducting a product is also provided, the unit comprising at least two conduits which are connected via a valve device according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The unit preferably has a multiplicity of conduits, of which a first number of conduits are product-supplying and a different number of conduits are product-discharging, wherein each product-supplying conduit is connected to each product-discharging conduit by a valve device according to the invention as per more than one of the abovementioned refinements.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to still another aspect of the invention, a method for operating a unit for conducting a product is provided, said unit comprising a valve device according to the invention, wherein, in a first operating mode, the first, second, third and fourth shut-off members are opened, and therefore product is transferred from the first conduit through the first, second and third leakage spaces into the second conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this operating mode, product can therefore be transferred from a product-supplying conduit into a product-removing conduit, the product passing through the three leakage spaces. The product-supplying conduit can come, for example from a sterilizer, and the product-removing conduit can lead, for example, to a filling group.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the abovementioned first operating mode, it is furthermore preferred if sterilizing steam is present at at least one, preferably at all of the steam inlets of the leakage spaces when the steam inlet valve is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">This measure has the advantage that the valve device can be checked for malfunctions of the steam inlet valves by the sterilizing steam which is present but which is not admitted into the leakage spaces. Should sterilizing steam penetrate therein despite the steam inlet valves being closed, this is made noticeable by an increase of the temperature in the discharging conduit in which a corresponding temperature sensor can be provided for monitoring the temperature, or by a drop in pressure in the steam supply line, which can be detected by a corresponding pressure sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a further preferred refinement of the first operating mode, in order to briefly interrupt the transfer of product from the first conduit into the second conduit, the first, second, third and fourth shut-off members are closed, and then steam is admitted to the first, second and third leakage spaces by opening of at least one of the steam inlet valves.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this connection, it is advantageous that, during a process-induced interruption to the transfer of product from the first conduit to the second conduit, the remaining product can be removed from the leakage spaces via one outlet, preferably via all of the outlets, after which the leakage spaces can be sterilized by means of sterilizing steam so that, after the interruption, the leakage spaces are again sterile for the subsequent transfer of product.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a further preferred refinement, in order to interrupt the transfer of product from the first conduit into the second conduit for a longer time, the first, second, third and fourth shut-off members are closed while the first, second and/or third leakage spaces are flooded with sterile condensate through at least one, preferably all of the outlet valves which are opened to the surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this connection, it is advantageous if, after the above-described sterilization of the leakage spaces, the latter are cooled via sterile condensate collecting in the leakage spaces such that, during a subsequent continuation of the product flow through the leakage spaces, the product is not subjected to an increased temperature which may damage the product.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a further preferred refinement, in a second operating mode, when the first and second shut-off members are closed, product flows through the first conduit while, when the third and fourth shut-off members are opened, a cleaning medium is conducted through the second conduit into the second and third leakage spaces, and sterilizing steam is admitted to the first leakage space.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a third operating mode which is the other way around to the second operating mode, when the third and fourth shut-off members are closed, product flows through the second conduit while, when the first and second shut-off members are opened, a cleaning medium is conducted into the first and third leakage spaces through the first conduit, and sterilizing steam is admitted to the second leakage space.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In these two abovementioned refinements, the one pair of shut-off members assigned to the one conduit can therefore advantageously be thoroughly cleaned by supplying a cleaning medium through said conduit while a product can continue to flow in the other conduit, said product being reliably separated from the cleaning process in the two other facing away leakage spaces by the steam barrier in the facing leakage space.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In a further preferred refinement, in a fourth operating mode, when the first, second, third and fourth shut-off members are closed, steam is admitted to the first, second and/or third leakage spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In this fourth operating mode, the three leakage spaces can advantageously be sterilized when the two conduits are not product-conducting, with it also being possible, as has been described above in the case of a short interruption of a process, for product to flow in the two conduits.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a further preferred refinement, in a fifth operating mode, when the first, second, third and fourth shut-off members are closed, product flows in one of the two conduits, wherein at least one, preferably all of the steam inlet valves are opened while the first, second and/or third leakage spaces are flooded with sterile condensate through at least one, preferably all of the outlet valves which are opened to the surroundings.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">This fifth operating mode in turn advantageously cools the leakage spaces, which have been sterilized beforehand with hot sterilizing steam, and the associated shut-off members.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further advantages and features emerge from the description below and the attached drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It goes without saying that the features mentioned above and those which have yet to be explained below can be used not only in the respectively stated combination but also in different combinations or on their own without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the refinement shown, the valve device <b>10</b> is fitted horizontally, i.e. with its longitudinal axis <b>51</b> horizontal. For this purpose, the connections <b>32</b> and <b>44</b> lead tangentially on a bottom side <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> into the housing <b>16</b>, as indicated by circles <b>47</b><i>a </i>and <b>49</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">While, as per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the connections <b>32</b> and <b>44</b> run parallel to each other, they may also be at an angular offset of, for example, 90&#xb0; with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further details of the valve device <b>10</b> are described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> which shows a cutout of the valve device <b>10</b> on a larger scale than <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The first leakage space <b>30</b> has a steam inlet <b>52</b> which can be closed and opened by a controllable steam inlet valve <b>54</b>. The steam inlet valve <b>54</b> has a shut-off member <b>56</b> in the form of a valve disk which can be actuated by a drive <b>58</b> between a closed position, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, and an open position. An outlet <b>60</b> which can be opened and closed by an outlet valve <b>62</b> faces the steam inlet <b>52</b>. The outlet valve <b>62</b> has a shut-off member <b>64</b> in the form of a valve disk which can be lifted off from its corresponding valve seat or can be pressed thereagainst by means of a drive <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A pressurized, hot sterilizing steam can be admitted through the steam inlet <b>52</b> to the first leakage space <b>30</b> while steam, condensate or leakage can be discharged out of the leakage space <b>30</b> through the outlet <b>60</b>. Furthermore, in a certain operating mode, the outlet <b>60</b> serves to flood the leakage space <b>30</b> with condensate in order to cool the leakage space <b>30</b> and the shut-off members <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> therein, as is described further on.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the same manner, the second leakage space <b>42</b> is assigned a steam inlet <b>68</b> with a steam inlet valve <b>70</b> and an outlet <b>72</b> with an outlet valve <b>74</b>. The third leakage space <b>46</b> also has a steam inlet <b>76</b> with a steam inlet valve <b>78</b> and an outlet <b>80</b> with an outlet valve <b>82</b>, the respective drives of the steam inlet valve <b>78</b> and of the outlet valve <b>82</b> not being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3A</figref> but they can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The steam inlet valves <b>70</b>, <b>78</b> and the outlet valves <b>74</b>, <b>82</b> are designed in the same manner as the steam inlet valve <b>54</b> and the outlet valve <b>62</b>, and therefore reference is made to the above description in this regard.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As revealed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the steam inlets <b>52</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> and the associated steam inlet valves <b>54</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>78</b> thereof are arranged in the circumferential direction relative to one another by an angular offset which is smaller than approximately 30&#xb0;. If the valve device <b>10</b> is fitted in a horizontal position, the steam inlets <b>52</b>, <b>68</b> and <b>76</b> are located at the top and are at an angle of approximately 10&#xb0; to 15&#xb0; with respect to the vertical. The outlets <b>60</b>, <b>72</b> and <b>80</b> and the associated outlet valves <b>62</b>, <b>74</b> and <b>82</b> are also offset correspondingly relative to one another, are located at the bottom and, if the valve device <b>10</b> is fitted horizontally, form an angle within the range of approximately 10&#xb0; to 15&#xb0; with the vertical such that the leakage spaces <b>30</b>, <b>42</b> and <b>46</b> can be drained when the outlet valves <b>62</b>, <b>74</b> and <b>82</b> are opened.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As will be described further on, steam barriers can be erected in the first leakage space <b>30</b> and in the second leakage space <b>42</b>, in each case independently of each other, by the introduction of sterilizing steam, said steam barriers reliably separating from one another the process running in the conduit <b>12</b> or <b>14</b>, for example conducting of a product, from the process running in the other conduit <b>12</b> or <b>14</b>, for example a cleaning process, in a manner complying with the requirements of the PMO standard.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The unit <b>100</b> therefore corresponds to the third expansion stage of the unit <b>100</b>&#x2032;.

Another difference over the conventional unit <b>100</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d</i>) is that the valve matrix <b>120</b>&#x2032; is not required, and also the two sterilizers <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>can now serve to operate each of the buffer tanks <b>104</b><i>a </i>to <b>104</b><i>d</i>.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">This greater functionality of the unit <b>100</b> is made possible by the configuration of the valve device <b>10</b> with four shut-off members and three leakage spaces which can furthermore be used as steam barriers such that processes which must not be mixed can run at the same time in the two conduits which are connected by a valve device <b>10</b>.</p>
