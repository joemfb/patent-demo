<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In modern wireless access networks, mobile stations (MSs) can be any type of portable communication or computer device that is assigned a network address to facilitate communications between the customer and the service provider. The network address is needed to ensure the transportation and delivery of data to the specified customer. In the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) network layer protocol, network addresses are 128 bits in length, where the first 64 bits are referred to as a prefix and the remaining 64 bits are referred to as an interface identifier. The prefix is typically assigned by the access router (AR) to which the MS is connected, while the interface identifier is created by the MS. A duplicate address detection (DAD) process may be implemented to prevent duplicate address assignments to multiple MSs in the network. Once the uniqueness of the address has been verified, the MS may use the address to communicate with other networks or MSs. When the MS moves to a new AR, a new prefix is assigned and the DAD process may be repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While the existing address assignment methods are suitable for low Quality of Service (QoS) applications, such as web browsing, they may be insufficient for higher QoS applications, such as Voice over IP (VoIP). Specifically, the task of assigning and managing address prefixes increases the processing load of the AR. The bandwidth reduction may degrade the service to the MS when multiple MSs are connected to the AR. In addition, the duplicate address detection scheme causes communication delays that may not be tolerable in some time-critical mobile applications, such as VoIP. Thus, there is a need for improving address assignment in wireless networks.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be understood at the outset that although an illustrative implementation of one or more embodiments are provided below, the disclosed systems and/or methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, including the exemplary designs and implementations illustrated and described herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Disclosed herein is an improved address assignment method for MSs in a wireless access network. Specifically, a prefix issuing party assigns the prefixes to each MS, which decreases the workload on the AR. If desired, the prefix may be a home network prefix. In such a case, the prefix assignment process can be conducted by a Home Agent using Proxy Mobile IPv6. Once the prefix is assigned to the MS, the MS may create an address by combining the prefix with its interface identifier. The uniqueness of the address may be verified using an enhanced DAD method. Briefly, the enhanced DAD method compares the address to an address cache, makes a positive determination as to whether the address is unique, and sends a router advertisement to the MS indicating the uniqueness of the address. The improved address assignment method may be faster, less resource intensive, and/or less cumbersome than previous address assignment methods.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a system <b>100</b> that assigns addresses in a wireless access network. The system <b>100</b> comprises a plurality of MSs <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>102</b>C, <b>102</b>D (collectively, <b>102</b>), a plurality of Basic Stations (BS) <b>104</b>A, <b>104</b>B (collectively, <b>104</b>), an AR <b>106</b>, a Network <b>108</b>, a Prefix Issuing Party (PIP) <b>110</b>, an Address Cache <b>112</b>, and a Home Agent <b>114</b>. The MSs <b>102</b> may communicate with the BSs <b>104</b> via wireless links, while the BSs <b>104</b>, the AR <b>106</b>, the Network <b>108</b>, the PIP <b>110</b>, and the Home Agent <b>114</b> may communicate with each other via fixed links. It should be recognized that while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates the system <b>100</b> with four MSs <b>102</b>, two BSs <b>104</b>, and one AR <b>106</b>, the system <b>100</b> could accommodate any number of MSs <b>102</b>, BSs <b>104</b>, and ARs <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, the MSs <b>102</b> may be any mobile devices, components, or networks that use the AR <b>104</b> to access the Network <b>108</b> and/or a third party. Specifically, the MSs <b>102</b> may be mobile user-oriented devices that communicate with the AR <b>104</b> via the BSs <b>104</b>. For example, the MSs <b>102</b> may be cellular phones, notebook computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or any other wireless devices. Alternatively, the MSs <b>102</b> may be mobile nodes that pass data from the Network <b>108</b> to an external network, such as wireless routers (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, the BSs <b>104</b> may be any devices, components, or networks that connect to the MSs <b>102</b> to the AR <b>106</b>. For example, the BSs <b>104</b> may be fixed devices that are connected to the AR <b>106</b> via an Ethernet link and to the MSs <b>102</b> via a wireless link. The BSs <b>104</b> may also manage connectivity and transport data between the MSs <b>102</b> and the AR <b>106</b>. Specifically, the BSs <b>104</b> may relay Neighbor Solicitation (NS) messages from the MSs <b>102</b> to the AR <b>106</b>, and relay Router Advertisement (RA) messages from the AR <b>106</b> to the MSs <b>102</b>. The BSs <b>104</b> may also relay other types of messages between the MSs <b>102</b> and the AR <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, the AR <b>106</b> is a device, component, or network that allows the MSs <b>102</b> to communicate with the Network <b>108</b> and/or a third party network. Specifically, the AR <b>106</b> may be the first Internet Protocol (IP) router that the MSs <b>102</b> encounter, such as a Broadband Remote Access Service (BRAS), a Media Access Gateway (MAG), or an Access Service Network Gateway (ASN-GW). The AR may be a Packet Data Servicing Node (PDSN) in a 3GPP2 network, or a Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) in a 3GPP network. In another embodiment, the AR <b>106</b> may be a node that forwards IPv6 packets that are not explicitly addressed to the AR <b>106</b>. The AR <b>106</b> may also be any fixed point that provides wireless access network coverage to the MSs <b>102</b>. The AR <b>106</b> may communicate with the MSs <b>102</b> through a fixed link to the BSs <b>104</b>, or may communicate directly with the MSs <b>102</b> via a wireless link. The AR <b>106</b> may also communicate with the Network <b>108</b> and/or a third party network using a fixed link. Specifically, the AR <b>106</b> may receive a prefix request from one of the MSs <b>102</b> that wishes to join the network, and may relay the prefix request to the PIP <b>110</b>. The AR <b>106</b> may also receive prefixes from the PIP <b>110</b>, and forward the prefixes to the MSs <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, the Network <b>108</b> may be any of various types of networks that exchange data between the AR <b>106</b>, the Home Agent <b>114</b>, and the PIP <b>110</b>. For example, the Network <b>108</b> may be a Packet Switched Network (PSN), an Intranet, an Internet, a local area network (LAN), a public switched telephone network (PSTN), or any other network. The Network <b>108</b> may also be an Ethernet transport network, a backbone network, an access network, an optical network, a wire-line network, an IEEE 802 network, or a wireless network, such as a cellular network. Persons of ordinary skill in the art are aware of other embodiments of the Network <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment, the PIP <b>110</b> may be any device, component, or network that has the authority to delegate IP address prefixes to the MSs <b>102</b>. The PIP <b>110</b> may assign prefixes to the MSs <b>102</b> globally, or the PIP <b>110</b> may be limited to assigning prefixes to MSs <b>102</b> within a specified network. In a specific embodiment, the PIP <b>110</b> may be a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server that communicates with the AR <b>106</b> using a DHCP protocol, such as DHCPv6 or any other DHCP protocol. In such a case, the PIP <b>110</b> may use DHCPv6 to receive prefix requests from the AR <b>106</b>, assign address prefixes to the MSs <b>102</b>, and send the address prefixes to the AR <b>106</b>. Alternatively, the PIP <b>110</b> may be an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server that communicates with the AR <b>106</b> using an AAA protocol, such as RADIUS, DIAMETER, or any other AAA protocol. In such a case, the PIP <b>110</b> may use the AAA protocol to receive AAA Access-Request (AA-Request) messages from the AR <b>106</b>, assign address prefixes to the MSs, and send the address prefixes to the AR <b>106</b> using Access-Accept (AA-Answer) messages.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The system <b>100</b> may also contain an Address Cache <b>112</b>. The Address Cache <b>112</b> may be a database, cache, or memory storage containing the IP address information for the MSs <b>102</b> and any other IP nodes in communication with the AR <b>106</b>. The address information may include all of the global IP addresses, may be limited to the IP address with a network, or may be limited to the IP addresses associated with the AR. The Address Cache <b>112</b> may be managed by the AR <b>106</b> or a Neighbor Discovery (ND) node. In an embodiment, the entries in the Address Cache <b>112</b> may be maintained using information that passes through the AR <b>106</b> or ND node, such as DAD NS or RA messages. Specifically, an entry in the Address Cache <b>112</b> may be created when one of the MSs <b>102</b> is assigned a unique address. Similarly, an entry in the Address Cache may be deleted when the MS <b>102</b> is no longer associated with the AR <b>106</b>, such as when the AR <b>106</b> receives a deregistration message from one of the MSs <b>102</b> or another entity that is authorized to deregister the MS <b>102</b>. Alternatively, the Address Cache <b>112</b> may be created and modified by any other methods known to persons of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment, the Home Agent <b>114</b> may be any IPv6 device, component, or network that may manage at least some of the AR's responsibilities. Specifically, the Home Agent <b>114</b> may be a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) of Proxy Mobile IPv6, a PDSN in a 3GPP network, or a GGSN in a 3GPP2 network. The Home Agent <b>114</b> may act as a DHCP client or an AAA client, instead of the AR <b>106</b>. The Home Agent <b>114</b> may also contain the Address Cache <b>112</b>. In addition, the Home Agent <b>114</b> may handle IP routing for the MSs <b>102</b> that may roam into a foreign network. In an embodiment, the Home Agent <b>114</b> may establish a direct connection or indirect connection with the AR <b>106</b> through the Network <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The components described above may communicate with each other via fixed and/or wireless links using a variety of technologies. The wireless links may be created dynamically when one of the MSs <b>102</b> attaches to the AR <b>106</b> directly or through the BSs <b>104</b>. Examples of wireless link technologies include Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Wideband CDMA (WCDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution (EDGE), Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems (UMTS), Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS), one of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802 wireless networks such as 802.16d/e, or any other wireless network. The remaining components may be coupled together via fixed links, such as electrical or optical links. Examples of fixed link technologies include Ethernet, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Synchronous Optical Network (SONET), and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH). The fixed and wireless links may have a fixed bandwidth such that a fixed amount of data is transported over the link, or may have a variable-sized bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a specific embodiment of the Proxy Mobile IPv6 system. Proxy Mobile IPv6 provides network based mobility support to mobile nodes, and comprises the MAG and the LMA. The MAG is an AR that performs mobility signaling on behalf of MS. The LMA is Mobile IPv6 Home Agent with some extensions. In Proxy Mobile IPv6, MS is not aware of any mobility signaling. The MS makes an address request possibly using DHCP Request. The network provides a per-MS prefix for the MS from MS's home link where LMA resides. A home address is assigned to MS from this home network prefix and a tunnel is established between MAG and LMA. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the MS's traffic is tunneled back and forth to the LMA, so the MAG assures that MS is virtually on its home link.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an embodiment of an address format <b>200</b> that may be assigned to a MS or any other IP network node. The address may comprise a 64-bit prefix <b>202</b> and a 64-bit interface identifier <b>204</b>. The prefix <b>202</b> may be issued by the PIP, and may be globally unique, unique to the PIP, unique to the AR, or not unique. The interface identifier <b>204</b> is typically generated by or associated with the MS, although a plurality of interface identifiers <b>204</b> may be associated with a single MS. The prefix <b>202</b> and/or the interface identifier <b>204</b> may be static or dynamic, and may be similar to medium access control (MAC) addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The PIP may delegate the prefix <b>202</b> using a point-to-point model or a shared prefix model. In the point-to-point model, each prefix <b>202</b> is assigned to only one MS; however, each MS may be assigned multiple prefixes <b>202</b>. In the shared prefix model, a single prefix <b>202</b> may be shared by all of the MSs associated with a single AR. In either case, the PIP may manage prefix assignment for incoming MSs, renew prefixes for existing MSs, and release prefixes for departing MSs. Moreover, the AR or Home Agent may act as a relay between the PIP and the MSs.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Alternatively or additionally, the MSs may be assigned addresses <b>200</b> using a stateless or a stateful address configuration model. Stateless configuration may require no manual configuration of MSs, minimal configuration of the AR, and no additional servers. The stateless mechanism allows a MS to generate its own addresses using a combination of locally available information and information advertised by ARs. ARs advertise prefixes that identify the subnet(s) associated with a link, while MSs generate an interface identifier that uniquely identifies an interface on a subnet. An address is formed by combining the two. In the stateful configuration model, MSs obtain interface addresses and/or configuration information and parameters from a server, such as the PIP. The servers maintain a cache or database that keeps track of which prefixes and/or addresses have been assigned to which MSs. The stateful configuration protocol allows MSs to obtain addresses, other configuration information, or both from a server. In both address configuration models, the AR acts as a relay in that it relays prefix requests and responses between the MSs and the PIP. In addition, a DAD procedure may be used to verify the uniqueness of the MS address in a stateless or a stateful addressing scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a prefix assignment process. Rather than the AR assigning the prefix to the MS, the PIP assigns the prefix to the MS and sends to the prefix to the MS via the AR. In an embodiment, the prefix assignment process may be started when the MS enters the network, such as when the MS performs the initial network entry and authentication procedures with the AR. Alternatively, the prefix assignment process may begin when the MS sends the AR a prefix request, such as a NS message. After the MS enters the network or upon receipt of the NS message, the AR may obtain the prefix for the MS from the PIP using the PIP's protocol, e.g. DHCPv6, RADIUS, DIAMETER, or another suitable protocol. Specifically, when the PIP is a DHCP server, the AR and the PIP may engage in the four-part Solicit, Advertise, Request, and Reply process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. If the PIP is an AAA server, the AR may send an AA-Request message to the AAA server, and the AAA server may send an AA-Answer message to the AR. In either case, the final message to the AR, e.g. the DHCP Reply or the AA-Answer, will contain the prefix assigned by the PIP.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, each AR may be assigned a /32 or /48 prefix and each MS may be assigned a /64 prefix, where the /64 prefix is an extension of the /48 prefix. For example, when an AR's /48 prefix is 3FFE:FFFF:0::/48, an MS is assigned the 3FFE:FFFF:0:2::/64 prefix. The AR may then only broadcast its /48 prefix information to the Internet. In such cases, the messages sent to the PIP may include a hint that the AR prefers a certain type of prefix, for example a /48 prefix. In such cases, the PIP may delegate a /64 prefix that is an extension of the /48 prefix.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A transport connection may then be established between the AR and the MS. The AR may then forward the prefix to the MS using either ND, e.g. an RA message, or the PIP's protocol, e.g. DHCP, RADIUS, or DIAMETER. If the PIP is a DHCP server, the prefix may be delivered to the MS using a DHCP Identity Association for Prefix Delegation (IA_PD) Prefix option and a RA Prefix Information option. An AR may be assigned a plurality of IA_PDs, each of which has an Identity Association Identifier (IAID). The use of the two protocols may increase the efficiency of the network by moving the complicated prefix management to a dedicated network entity, such as the PIP. The AR may also use the prefix to update its Address Cache. The MS may then construct a solicited node multicast address for the corresponding local link address and send the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Join request for the solicited node multicast address. Finally, the MS may verify the address uniqueness using a DAD NS message, as described in further detail below. If the prefix has a predetermined expiration time, the MS may periodically send a renew message to the PIP or another party so that the predetermined time period can be extended or a new prefix can be issued to the MS.</p>

In such a case, the communications between the MS and the Home Agent are relayed through the AR and optionally the BS.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a specific embodiment of the stateless proxy mobile IPv6 home network prefix assignment process using the Home Agent. In the present embodiment, the AR is a MAG, the Home Agent is a LMA, and the PIP is a DHCP server. Unlike some embodiments discussed below, the present embodiment does not use a policy profile or policy store. The process may begin when a MS solicits a RA. The MAG may then send a Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to the LMA, which contains a Home Network Prefix (HNP) set to zero. The LMA may then request a prefix for the MS by creating and sending a DHCP Solicit message to the DHCP server. The LMA may include an IA_PD or an IAID in the Solicit message.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The DHCP server may then send a DHCP Advertise message to the LMA. The LMA may then use the messages to obtain or update the prefix from the DHCP server. Specifically, the LMA and the DHCP server may use the IA_PD Prefix option to exchange information about the prefix in much the same way as IA Address options are used for assigned addresses, e.g. using the Request and Reply messages. The LMA may store the prefix information it receives in the Reply message. The LMA may then reply to the PBU with a Proxy Binding Acknowledgement (PBA) containing the MS's prefix in the HNP field. The MAG may then advertise the prefix to the MS with a RA. The MAG may update the Address Cache, if desired. Finally, the MS verifies the address uniqueness by sending a DAD NS. In the present embodiment, the LMA may have a DHCP client, and the DHCP server may be directly connected to the LMA. Also, the DHCP messages may be relayed using the DHCP relay function in the LMA if the LMA and DHCP server are not directly connected.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the stateless proxy mobile IPv6 home network prefix assignment process using the Home Agent. In the present embodiment, the AR is a MAG, the Home Agent is a LMA, and the PIP is an AAA server. The present embodiment does not use a policy profile or policy store. The process may begin when the MS solicits a RA. The MAG may then send a PBU to the LMA with the HNP set to zero. The LMA, as an AAA Protocol client, may send an AA-Request message with the MS's information to the AAA server. If the MS passes the authentication, the AAA server may send the AA-Answer message with the prefix information to the LMA. The delegated IPv6 prefix attribute may appear in an AA-Request packet as a hint by the LMA that it would prefer a specific type of prefix, for example, a /48 prefix. The AAA server may delegate a /64 prefix which is an extension of the /48 prefix in an AA-Request message containing a Delegated-IPv6-Prefix attribute. The attribute may appear multiple times when the AAA server assigns multiple prefixes to the MS. The remaining steps are as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the stateless proxy mobile IPv6 home network prefix assignment process using the Home Agent. In the present embodiment, the AR is a MAG, the Home Agent is a LMA, and the PIP is a DHCP server. The present embodiment also uses a policy profile or store. The process may begin when an MS boots up in the network and goes through the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) exchanges. The DHCP server may not be involved in the network entry procedures. The network may then ask the Home Agent/LMA for the home network prefix for the MS. The LMA and DHCP server may then perform the DHCP Solicit, Advertise, Request, and Reply process described above. The LMA may then reply with MS's prefix, at which point the successful network entry may terminate, and the MAG may get the HNP. The MAG may update the Address Cache, if desired. The MAG may then advertise the prefix to the MS using a RA. The MS may then verify the address uniqueness by sending a DAD NS. The MAG may then send a PBU with the assigned HNP to the LMA. Finally, the LMA may reply with a PBA, and establish a MAG-LMA tunnel.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the stateless proxy mobile IPv6 home network prefix assignment process using the Home Agent. In the present embodiment, the AR is a MAG, the Home Agent is a LMA, and the PIP is an AAA server. The present embodiment also uses a policy profile or store. The process may begin when the MS boots up in the network and goes through the EAP exchanges. The network may then ask the home agent/LMA for the home network prefix hint for the MS. The LMA and AAA server may then perform the AA-Request and AA-Answer process described above. The LMA may then confirm MS's prefix, at which point the successful network entry may terminate, and the MAG may get the HNP. The MAG may update the Address Cache, if desired. The MAG may then advertise the prefix to MS with a RA. If stateful address configuration is used, the MAG may send the DHCP reply with the MS's home address assigned from the home network prefix. The MS may then verify the address uniqueness by sending a DAD NS. The MAG may then send a PBU with the assigned HNP. Finally, the LMA may reply with a PBA and establish the MAG-LMA tunnel.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> illustrates a specific embodiment of the stateful proxy mobile IPv6 home network prefix assignment process using the Home Agent. In the present embodiment, the AR is a MAG, the Home Agent is a LMA, and the PIP is a DHCP server. The process may begin as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> above, that is the MS may enter the network and the LMA may assign its HNP using DHCPv6. The MAG may update the Address Cache, if desired. The MS may then request an address from the local DHCP proxy/server co-located in the MAG. The MAG may then send a PBU to the LMA with the HNP set to zero. The LMA may reply with a PBA and may set its HNP parameter. Finally, the DHCP Proxy may assign a MS-Home Address (HoA) from this prefix, and may send it to the MS in the DHCP Reply.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the stateful proxy mobile IPv6 home network prefix assignment process using the Home Agent.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3H</figref> illustrates a specific embodiment of the prefix Mobile IPv6 per-MS assignment process using the Home Agent and IP security. The Home Agent may use the per-MS home network prefix to avoid multi-link subnet issues, for example, when prefix management becomes an issue for the Home Agent. DHCPv6 or AAA based prefix delegation can be used for this purpose. The process may begin when the MS solicits a security association establishment using Internet Key Exchange (IKE) v2. The Home Agent may then get the configuration request message. The LMA and DHCP server may then perform the DHCP Solicit, Advertise, Request, and Reply process described above. The Home Agent may then send back the reply to the configuration request, which contains the HoA. The MS may then use the HoA to send a Binding Update (BU) message to register its care of address. The MAG may update the Address Cache, if desired. The AR may then send the MS a RA with the care of address configuration. Finally, the MS may send the DAD NS with the care of address configuration to the AR. In this process, the home address can be assigned during the bootstrapping process and downloaded into the AR as part of the policy store. The Home Agent may be triggered by the Home AAA (HAAA)-Home Agent protocol, and the Home Agent may get a per-MS prefix from the DHCP server using the DHCP Solicit, Advertise, Request, and Reply process. The Home Agent may assign the HoA from this prefix. The MS may receive the bootstrapping parameters by sending a DHCP Info-Request message and receiving a DHCP Info-Reply message. The MIPv6 per-MS prefix delegation procedure using the AAA is similar to the process described above, with the exception that the DHCP Solicit, Advertise, Request, and Reply process is replaced with the AA-Request and AA-Answer process.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a prefix release process. Generally, the prefix may be released when the prefix ages a predetermined amount of time or when the prefix is released. In one embodiment, the prefix is assigned a predetermined validity period by the PIP, after which the MS no longer uses the prefix, and the prefix is released for use by other MSs. In another embodiment, the prefix release process may be initiated when the MS triggers a prefix release procedure using a detachment signal, such as switch-off or handover. Alternatively, the prefix release process may be initiated when deregistration is requested by the MS, one of the network components, or an authorized party. The PIP may then respond to the AR with a reply message that indicates the prefix has been released. The reply message may be in the PIP's protocol. The AR may then update its Address Cache by deleting the prefix information.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an alternative embodiment, the prefix release may be routed through the Home Agent. In such a case, the communications between the MS and the Home Agent are relayed through the AR and optionally the BS using the MS's or another suitable protocol. The Home Agent then performs the AR's prefix management functions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Specifically, the Home Agent may communicate with the PIP in the PIP's protocol to release the prefix assigned to the MS. The Home Agent may also update its Address Cache by deleting the prefix information. Several specific embodiments of this process are illustrated below.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates a specific embodiment of the prefix release process using a Home Agent. In the present embodiment, the AR is a MAG, the Home Agent is a LMA, and the PIP is a DHCP server. Specifically, the LMA may release the prefix to the DHCP server when it is not directly connected to the LMA. The process may begin when triggered by the MS's detachment signaling, such as switch-off or handover. The MAG may then send a PBU with a lifetime set to zero to the LMA. The LMA may then reply to the MAG with a PBA, and may initiate a release message to give the prefix back to the DHCP server. The DHCP server may then respond with a Reply message, after which the prefix can be reused by another MS. Finally, the MAG may update the Address Cache, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the prefix release process using a Home Agent and a DHCP server as the PIP. In the present embodiment, the Home Agent may release the MS's home link prefix when the MS returns home and sends a BU message with the lifetime set to zero. The Home Agent may respond with a Binding Acknowledgement (BA) message, and then the process proceeds as described above. When the PIP is an AAA server, the LMA may release the MS's prefix using an Accounting Stop message or an Accounting Request message when the MS exits the network. The MAG may advertise the prefix to the MS in a RA message. Finally, the MAG may update the Address Cache, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">After the MS receives the prefix, the MS combines the prefix with its interface identifier to make the address. If the prefix and/or the interface identifier are globally unique, then the address will also be unique and there is no need to verify the addresses uniqueness, for example, using the DAD method. However, if the prefix or interface identifier is not globally unique, the address is referred to as a temporary address (TA), and the DAD method may be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart of one embodiment of a DAD method <b>300</b>. The DAD method <b>300</b> is a process by which the uniqueness of a requesting MS's TA may be verified. Specifically, the DAD method <b>300</b> may authenticate the uniqueness of an address created under the shared prefix model, the point-to-point model, the stateful model, or the stateless model. Specifically, in a point-to-point model that includes a plurality of PIPs that may not share address information, the DAD method <b>300</b> may be used to verify the uniqueness of the TA. The DAD method <b>300</b> may be implemented by an AR, a Home Agent, or a ND node.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At block <b>302</b>, the DAD request is received from the MS. The DAD request may be in the form of a NS message, and may contain the TA. The NS request may be initiated by the requesting MS and relayed by the AR, or the NS message may be sent via a direct link from the requesting MS node to the ND node. The DAD method <b>300</b> then proceeds to block <b>304</b>, where the DAD method <b>300</b> determines whether the TA is unique. Specifically, the AR, Home Agent, or ND node may access an Address Cache and compare the TA with existing MS addresses. The TA will be unique if the TA is not being used by another MS or other node. If the TA is unique, the DAD method <b>300</b> proceeds to block <b>306</b>. If the TA is not unique, the DAD method <b>300</b> proceeds to block <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At block <b>306</b>, the DAD method <b>300</b> may use a router advertisement to indicate the uniqueness of the TA. Other DAD methods may broadcast the TA to all of the MSs and wait for the other MSs to indicate whether they are using the TA. If one of the MSs is using the TA as its address, then the MS notifies the requesting MS and a collision resolution method is initiated. If none of the MSs respond within a predetermined amount of time, e.g. 1,000 milliseconds, then the requesting MS may assume that the TA is unique. In contrast with this procedure, the DAD method <b>300</b> may generate a RA message that indicates that the TA is unique, which may be immediately sent to the MS. The generation of the RA message provides a positive determination as to the uniqueness of the TA, and may reduce the time for the requesting MS to determine whether its TA is unique. If the RA message is generated by the Home Agent, the RA message may be relayed through the AR to the MS. The DAD method <b>200</b> then ends.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At block <b>308</b>, the DAD method <b>300</b> resolves the collision between the TA and the existing address. In one embodiment, the DAD method <b>300</b> may generate a message indicating that the TA is not unique, and send such a message to the requesting MS. The requesting MS may then select a new TA comprising a new prefix and/or interface identifier. Alternatively, the AR may select a new TA for the requesting MS. The new TA may contain a new prefix obtained, for example, from the PIP and/or a new interface identifier obtained, for example, from the requesting MS or the AR. The uniqueness of the new TA may be verified by comparing the new TA to the Address Cache. In another embodiment, the DAD method <b>300</b> may resolve the collision by forwarding the TA to the MS with the existing address. The MS with the existing address may then resolve the conflict by sending a message to the AR specifying that the requesting MS needs to select another address. The DAD method <b>200</b> then ends.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an illustration of another embodiment of the DAD method. Initially, MS<b>1</b> may construct an IPv6 address, for example, as described above. MS<b>1</b> then constructs a solicited node multicast address for the corresponding IPv6 address, e.g. the TA, and send a MLD Join request of the solicited node multicast address. A NS message is then sent to the AR, Home Agent, or other party that contains the Address Cache. The message may be transported directly to the AR via a wireless link or through another node such as a BS. If the TA is unique, the AR forwards a RA message back to the MS with an indication that the address is unique. If the address is not unique, the AR may relay the DAD to the address owner, MS<b>2</b>. MS<b>2</b> then sends a DAD NA indicating the non-uniqueness of the address to MS<b>1</b> via the AR. Alternatively, the AR may send a RA message containing a negative tag that indicates the use of the address by another MS, e.g. MS<b>2</b>. In either case, MS<b>1</b> may discard the TA and repeat the DAD method using another TA. The DAD method may also conclude if MS<b>1</b> does not receive any RA messages regarding the address uniqueness within a predetermined time, e.g. 1,000 milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an illustration of one embodiment of a NS message <b>400</b> format.
