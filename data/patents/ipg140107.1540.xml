<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This U.S. National stage application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-193277, filed in Japan on Jul. 25, 2007, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a scroll compressor, and particularly to a scroll compressor capable of regulating its suction capacity.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past, a technique has been introduced for providing a scroll compressor in which a suction capacity regulating mechanism is installed in an end plate of a fixed scroll (see Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2007-154761, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This suction capacity regulating mechanism is primarily composed of a through hole which penetrates through the end plate of the fixed scroll and opens at the bottom of a spiral groove of the fixed scroll, a fluid introducing passage which connects to the through hole, a piston which is inserted into the through hole, a biasing member which biases the piston toward a side of the fluid introducing passage in the through hole, and a metal piston ring which is fitted into an annular groove of the piston and which has a right-angled fitting end. The suction capacity regulating mechanism regulates a suction capacity of a scroll compressing mechanism by switching between a regulating operation condition involving a connection between &#x201c;a first compression chamber formed between an inner circumferential surface of a wrap of the fixed scroll and an outer circumferential surface of a wrap of a movable scroll&#x201d; and &#x201c;a second compression chamber formed between an outer circumferential surface of the wrap of the fixed scroll and an inner circumferential surface of the wrap of the movable scroll&#x201d; and a normal operation condition of shut-off between the first compression chamber and the second compression chamber (a condition that utilizes 100% of the suction capacity). Specifically, when a fluid that applies a pressure larger than biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing passage, the piston is pushed down and a space at a lower end of the through hole is shut. The suction capacity regulating mechanism is turned to a condition of shut-off between the first compression chamber and the second compression chamber, that is, a normal operation condition. On the other hand, when a fluid that applies a pressure lower than biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing passage, the piston is pushed up and the space at the lower end of the through hole is open. The suction capacity regulating mechanism is turned to a condition involving a connection between the first compression chamber and the second compression chamber, that is, a regulating operation condition.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the above suction capacity regulating mechanism, a minute gap exists between the through hole and the piston. Therefore, when a high-pressure fluid is introduced into the fluid introducing passage, the high-pressure fluid may undesirably flow into the compression chamber through the gap and the power of the scroll compressor under the normal operation may be reduced. In order to address this problem, in this suction capacity regulating mechanism, the metal piston ring which has a right-angled fitting end is fitted into the annular groove of the piston. This piston ring is tightly in contact with a wall surface of the through hole due to its resilient force so as to prevent the high-pressure fluid introduced into the fluid introducing passage from flowing into the compression chamber. However, in the metal piston ring having a right-angled fitting end, in a state that the piston ring is inserted into the through hole along with the piston, a slight gap exists at a part of the fitting end. Therefore, the above structure cannot perfectly prevent the high-pressure fluid introduced into the fluid introducing passage from flowing into the compression chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to further suppress the flow of high-pressure fluid from the fluid introducing passage into a compression chamber and to suppress a power reduction of the scroll compressor under a normal operation, in a scroll compressor in which a suction capacity regulating mechanism is installed in an end plate of a fixed scroll.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A scroll compressor according to a first aspect of the present invention comprises a first scroll member, a second scroll member, a casing, a fluid introducing pipe, a piston, and a piston ring having a step-like fitting end. The first scroll member has a first flat plate part, a first spiral wall part, a fluid inlet, and a first through hole. The first spiral wall part extends from a first plate surface of the first flat plate part toward a direction substantially perpendicular to the first plate surface while keeping a spiral shape. The fluid inlet is formed near an end of the first spiral wall part. Note that this fluid inlet may be provided in the first flat plate part. The first through hole is formed in the first plate surface and extends so as to penetrate through the first flat plate part from a first opening which opens at a part of the first plate surface located at a position apart from the fluid inlet for a predetermined length. The first through hole is sandwiched between a most outer wall of the first spiral wall part and an inner circumferential wall which is opposite to the most outer wall. The second scroll member has a second flat plate part and a second spiral wall part. The second spiral wall part extends from a second plate surface of the second flat plate part toward a direction substantially perpendicular to the second plate surface while keeping a spiral shape. And, the second spiral wall part meshes with the first spiral wall part. The casing houses the first scroll member and the second scroll member. The fluid introducing pipe penetrates and extends through the casing from an opening formed at a side opposite to the first opening of the first through hole. And, an inner space of the fluid introducing pipe connects to the first through hole. The piston has an annular groove and a second through hole. The annular groove is formed on a side surface of the piston. The second through hole opens on an end surface of the piston at a side of the fluid introducing pipe and a bottom surface of the annular groove. Note that in the second through hole, the number or arrangement of openings which open at an end surface of the piston on the side of the fluid introducing pipe, as well as the number or arrangement of openings which open at the bottom surface of the annular groove, can be appropriately determined. Moreover, a cross-sectional area of the second through hole is preferably larger than a cross-sectional area of a gap between the piston and the first through hole. And, this piston is biased to a side of the fluid introducing pipe in the first through hole by a biasing member. This piston is configured so that the piston shuts the first opening when a fluid that applies a pressure larger than biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing pipe and so that the piston forms a gap space on an upper part of the first opening when a fluid that applies a pressure smaller than the biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing pipe. The piston ring having the step-like fitting end is fitted into the annular groove of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this scroll compressor, the annular groove and the second through hole are formed in the piston, and further, the piston ring having the step-like fitting end is fitted into the annular groove. Therefore, in this scroll compressor, when a fluid that applies a pressure larger than biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing pipe and the first opening is shut by the piston, the high-pressure fluid passes through the second through hole of the piston and pushes the piston ring having the step-like fitting end against a wall of the second through hole. Note that the piston ring expands slightly at this time; however, since the fitting end has a step-like structure, a gap is not formed in the piston ring and it is able to avoid a leak of the high-pressure fluid effectively. Further, at this time, the high-pressure fluid flows through a minute gap between the piston and the second through hole. Thus, the piston ring is pushed against a side of the first opening. Therefore, in this scroll compressor, when a fluid that applies a pressure larger than biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing pipe, it is able to effectively suppress the high-pressure fluid flowing into compression chambers formed by the first scroll member and the second scroll member. Therefore, in this scroll compressor, it is able to suppress a power reduction of the scroll compressor under a normal operation (at the time of an operation utilizing 100% of the suction capacity).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A scroll compressor according to a second aspect of the present invention is the scroll compressor according to the first aspect of the present invention, wherein the first scroll member further has a third through hole which connects to the first through hole. Furthermore, the third through hole causes the first through hole to connect to a low-pressure space of the scroll compressor. And the piston shuts the first opening as well as an opening of a side of the piston in the third through hole when a fluid that applies a pressure larger than biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing pipe. And, the piston connects the gap space and the third through hole when a fluid that applies a pressure smaller than the biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing pipe.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The scroll compressor according to the present invention, when a fluid that applies a pressure larger than biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing pipe, is able to effectively suppress the flow of the high-pressure fluid into the compression chamber formed by the first scroll member and the second scroll member. Therefore, in this scroll compressor, a power reduction of the scroll compressor under a normal operation (at the time of an operation utilizing 100% of the suction capacity) can be suppressed.</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The high pressure dome-type scroll compressor <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment can be used together with an evaporator, a condenser, an expansion mechanism, and the like to constitute a refrigerant circuit. The high pressure dome-type scroll compressor <b>1</b> takes on a role of compressing a low pressure gas refrigerant in the refrigerant circuit so as to produce a high pressure gas refrigerant, and is primarily composed of a hermetically sealed dome-type casing <b>10</b>, a scroll compression mechanism <b>20</b>, a suction capacity regulating mechanism <b>30</b>, a drive motor <b>45</b>, a crank shaft <b>40</b>, a lower main bearing <b>48</b>, a suction tube <b>14</b>, and a discharge tube <b>15</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The constituent elements of the high pressure dome-type scroll compressor <b>1</b> will be respectively described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">&#x3c;Details of Constituent Elements of High Pressure Dome-Type Scroll Compressor&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">(1) Casing</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The casing <b>10</b> includes a substantially cylindrical trunk shell <b>11</b>, a bowl-shaped lid portion <b>12</b> which covers an upper end of the trunk shell <b>11</b>, and a bowl-shaped bottom portion <b>13</b> which covers a lower end of the trunk shell <b>11</b>. Furthermore, the trunk shell <b>11</b> and the lid portion <b>12</b>, as well as the trunk shell <b>11</b> and the bottom portion <b>13</b>, are welded in an airtight manner and thereby integrated so as to prevent a gas refrigerant from leaking. And, primarily accommodated in the casing <b>10</b> are the scroll compression mechanism <b>20</b> for compressing a gas refrigerant, and the drive motor <b>45</b> disposed below the scroll compression mechanism <b>20</b>. Furthermore, the scroll compression mechanism <b>20</b> and the drive motor <b>45</b> are connected by the crank shaft <b>40</b> disposed so as to extend in the vertical direction inside the casing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">(2) Scroll Compression Mechanism</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The scroll compression mechanism <b>20</b> is primarily composed of a housing <b>23</b>, a fixed scroll <b>21</b> provided in close contact above the housing <b>23</b>, a movable scroll <b>22</b> for meshing with the fixed scroll <b>21</b>, and an Oldham ring <b>24</b> for preventing the movable scroll <b>22</b> from rotating as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The constituent elements of this scroll compression mechanism <b>20</b> will be respectively described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">a) Housing</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The housing <b>23</b> is constructed primarily with a flange part <b>23</b><i>a</i>, a main body part <b>23</b><i>b</i>, and a bearing part <b>23</b><i>c</i>. The main body part <b>23</b><i>b </i>is designed to fit into the trunk shell <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b> and to couple with it. The flange part <b>23</b><i>a </i>protrudes radially outward from the main body part <b>23</b><i>b </i>at an upper end of the main body part <b>23</b><i>b</i>. The bearing part <b>23</b><i>c </i>is formed so as to have a smaller diameter than that of the main body part <b>23</b><i>b </i>and protrudes downward from a lower surface of the main body part <b>23</b><i>b</i>. This bearing part <b>23</b><i>c </i>rotatably supports a main shaft part <b>41</b> of the crank shaft <b>40</b> via a slide bearing <b>23</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">b) Fixed Scroll</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The fixed scroll <b>21</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, constructed primarily with an end plate <b>21</b><i>a </i>formed in a substantially disk-shape, a spiral (an involute-shaped) wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>which is formed on a lower surface of the end plate <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and an edge portion <b>21</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A discharge passage <b>26</b> that is in connection with a compression chamber formed by the fixed scroll <b>21</b> and the movable scroll <b>22</b>, an enlarged concave portion <b>21</b> g that is in connection with the discharge passage <b>26</b>, and a communication hole <b>32</b> which is needed to constitute the suction capacity regulating mechanism <b>30</b> are formed in the end plate <b>21</b><i>a. </i>The discharge passage <b>26</b> is formed so as to extend in the vertical direction in a center portion of the end plate <b>21</b><i>a</i>. The enlarged concave portion <b>21</b><i>g </i>is formed from a concavity that is open on an upper surface of the end plate <b>21</b><i>a</i>. A lid body <b>27</b> is fastened and fixed on an upper surface of the fixed scroll <b>21</b> by a bolt (not shown) so as to close the opening of the enlarged concave portion <b>21</b><i>g</i>. The lid body <b>27</b> covers the enlarged concave portion <b>21</b><i>g, </i>thereby forming a discharge space <b>28</b>. Furthermore, the end plate <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the lid body <b>27</b> are sealed together by being firmly joined together via a packing which is not shown. Furthermore, a gas refrigerant discharged to the above-mentioned discharge space <b>28</b> is introduced into a high-pressure space <b>16</b> in a lower portion of the housing <b>23</b> through a gas passage (not shown) formed on the fixed scroll <b>21</b> and the housing <b>23</b>, and is then discharged from the discharge tube <b>15</b> to the outside of the casing <b>10</b>. Further, in the casing <b>10</b>, a space in a lower portion of the housing <b>23</b> corresponds to the high-pressure space <b>16</b>, and a space in an upper portion of the housing (a space around the compressing mechanism <b>20</b>) corresponds to a low-pressure space <b>17</b>. The communicating hole <b>32</b> is a hole which penetrates through the end plate <b>21</b><i>a </i>along a direction of thickness of the end plate <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and comprises a large diameter hole portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>and a small diameter hole portion <b>32</b><i>b</i>. The large diameter hole portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>opens at an upper surface of the end plate <b>21</b><i>a</i>. The small diameter hole portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>opens at the bottom of a spiral groove <b>21</b><i>g </i>located at a location which is shifted spirally inward for a predetermined distance from an end of the spiral groove <b>21</b><i>g </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b>. Note that the opening of this small diameter hole portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>at the bottom of the spiral groove <b>21</b><i>g </i>is a circular hole having a larger diameter than a thickness of the wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable scroll <b>22</b>. The suction capacity regulating mechanism <b>30</b> is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The number of turns of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>is about a half-turn greater than that of the wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable scroll <b>22</b> (that is, it constitutes an asymmetrical spiral structure). However, the outmost turn of this wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>is not formed with an outer circumferential surface. This portion of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>without the outer circumferential surface connects with the edge portion <b>21</b><i>c </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b>. And, the fixed side wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>ends in a way such that an end portion of an outer circumferential surface thereof and an end portion of an inner circumferential surface thereof, located at a location where the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>continues for one more turn than the end portion of the outer circumferential side, face each other across the spiral groove <b>21</b><i>g</i>. An end portion of an outer circumferential surface (the end of the wrap) of the movable side wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>is located near the end of the fixed side wrap <b>21</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The edge portion <b>21</b><i>c </i>comprises a wall-like portion, which extends downward from an outer circumferential edge portion of the end plate <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and a flange-like portion, which protrudes radially outward from a lower end part of the wall-like portion and which is fastened to an upper surface of the flange part <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the housing <b>23</b> by a bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, in this fixed scroll <b>21</b>, a suction port <b>29</b> is formed near the end of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b</i>. And, the suction tube <b>14</b> is fitted into this suction port <b>29</b>. Moreover, a check valve (not shown) is disposed in this suction port <b>29</b>. This check valve allows refrigerant to flow into the compression chamber formed by the fixed scroll <b>21</b> and the movable scroll <b>22</b> and shuts off a reverse flow of the refrigerant.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">c) Movable Scroll</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The movable scroll <b>22</b> is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, primarily composed of an end plate <b>22</b><i>a</i>, a spiral-shaped (an involute-shaped) wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>formed on the upper surface of the end plate <b>22</b><i>a</i>, a bearing portion <b>22</b><i>c </i>formed on the lower surface of the end plate <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and a groove portion <b>22</b><i>e </i>formed in both ends of the end plate <b>22</b><i>a</i>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The end plate <b>22</b><i>a </i>is located in a first concave portion <b>23</b><i>e </i>disposed on an upper end surface of the housing <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The bearing portion <b>22</b><i>c </i>is located in a second concave portion <b>23</b><i>f </i>disposed in a main body portion <b>23</b><i>b </i>of the housing <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>is meshed with the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b>. As a result, a plurality of compression chambers <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>are formed between contact portions of the two wraps <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Note that in this embodiment, for convenience of explanation, the compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>formed between an inner circumferential surface of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b> and an outer circumferential surface of the wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable scroll <b>22</b> is referred to as &#x201c;a first compression chamber&#x201d;, and the compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b </i>formed between an outer circumferential surface of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b> and an inner circumferential surface of the movable side wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>is referred to as &#x201c;a second compression chamber&#x201d;. Furthermore, in the scroll compression mechanism <b>20</b>, a plurality of the first compression chambers <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chambers <b>25</b><i>b </i>are formed respectively. Further, in this embodiment, the number of turns of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>is greater than the number of turns of the wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable scroll <b>22</b>. Thus, a maximum capacity of the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>is larger than a maximum capacity of the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>. And, an eccentric portion <b>42</b> of the crank shaft <b>40</b> is inserted into the bearing portion <b>22</b><i>c </i>via a sliding bearing <b>22</b><i>d</i>. The Oldham ring <b>24</b> is fitted into the groove portion <b>22</b><i>e</i>. Furthermore, the Oldham ring <b>24</b> is fitted into the Oldham grooves (not shown) formed in the housing <b>23</b>, so that the movable scroll <b>22</b> is supported to the housing <b>23</b> via the Oldham ring <b>24</b>. And, by means of the movable scroll <b>22</b> being incorporated into the scroll compression mechanism <b>20</b> in this manner, the movable scroll <b>22</b> orbits, without rotating, in the housing <b>23</b> around the shaft center of a main shaft portion <b>41</b> as the center of its orbit due to the rotation of the crank shaft <b>40</b>. Furthermore, the orbital radius of the movable scroll <b>22</b> is equal to an eccentric amount of the eccentric portion <b>42</b>, that is, a distance from the shaft center of the main shaft portion <b>41</b> to the shaft center of the eccentric portion <b>42</b>. And, in response to the orbital motion of the movable scroll <b>22</b>, the volumes of the compression chambers <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>decrease as they move spirally inward toward the center of the orbit of the movable scroll <b>22</b>. A gas refrigerant is, through this volume reduction arrangement, compressed in the high pressure dome-type scroll compressor <b>1</b> of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">d) Oldham Ring</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The Oldham ring <b>24</b> is a member for preventing the movable scroll <b>22</b> from rotating, as described above, and is fitted into the Oldham grooves (not shown) formed in the housing <b>23</b>. Furthermore, these Oldham grooves have an elliptical shape and are disposed at positions opposite to each other in the housing <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">(3) Suction Capacity Regulating Mechanism</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The suction capacity regulating mechanism <b>30</b> is a mechanism for regulating the suction capacity by regulating shut-off positions of compression chambers <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b </i>for suction in a suction step of the compression mechanism <b>20</b> (a position in which the suction step is completed and a compression step starts). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.3</figref>, the suction capacity regulating mechanism <b>30</b> is primarily composed of a communicating hole <b>32</b> formed in the end plate <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b>, a gas refrigerant introducing pipe <b>50</b> whose inner space connects to the communicating hole <b>32</b>, a lid body <b>27</b> which has an opening for receiving an end portion of the gas refrigerant introducing pipe <b>50</b> and supports the gas refrigerant introducing pipe <b>50</b> and covers an upper side of the communicating hole <b>32</b>, a piston <b>33</b> inserted in the communicating hole <b>32</b>, a compression coil spring <b>35</b> for biasing the piston <b>33</b> toward a side of the gas refrigerant introducing pipe, and a switching valve <b>36</b> for switching between &#x201c;a condition of applying low pressure to the piston <b>33</b> through the gas refrigerant introducing pipe <b>50</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;a condition of applying high pressure to the piston <b>33</b> against a biasing force per unit area of the compression coil spring <b>35</b> through the gas refrigerant introducing pipe <b>50</b>&#x201d; .</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the piston <b>33</b> is primarily composed of a plug portion <b>33</b><i>a </i>having a size to fit in the small diameter hole portion <b>32</b><i>b</i>, a spring receiving portion <b>33</b><i>b </i>which has a diameter larger than that of the plug portion <b>33</b><i>a </i>and to which the compression coil spring <b>35</b> is attached on an outer circumferential surface, a seal attaching portion <b>33</b><i>c </i>having a diameter larger than that of the spring receiving portion <b>33</b><i>b</i>, an annular seal receiving groove <b>33</b><i>d </i>formed on an outer periphery of the seal attaching portion <b>33</b><i>c</i>, and a through hole <b>33</b><i>f </i>which opens at an upper end surface of the seal attaching portion <b>33</b><i>c </i>and a bottom surface of the seal receiving groove <b>33</b><i>d</i>. Furthermore, in the seal receiving groove <b>33</b><i>d</i>, a piston ring <b>33</b><i>e </i>made of synthetic resin is attached thereto, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Further, a fitting end of this piston ring <b>33</b><i>e </i>has a step-like design as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, not a single right-angled fitting end. And, this piston <b>33</b> is movable between an opening position for opening the communicating hole <b>32</b> and a closing position for closing the communicating hole <b>32</b>, via the compression coil spring <b>35</b> and the switching valve <b>36</b>. Further, the through hole <b>33</b><i>f </i>is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, composed of a longitudinal hole <b>33</b><i>g </i>formed along a center shaft of the piston <b>33</b> and four lateral holes <b>33</b><i>h</i>, each of which extends radially from a lower end of the longitudinal hole to an outer circumferential surface of the piston <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">This suction capacity regulating mechanism <b>30</b> is able to switch between conditions of &#x201c;communicate&#x201d; and &#x201c;shut-off&#x201d; for the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b </i>by means of the above-described configuration. Specifically, when a low pressure is applied to a rear end surface (upper end surface) of the piston <b>33</b> by the switching valve <b>36</b>, a force exerted by the compression coil spring <b>35</b> to push up the piston <b>33</b> exceeds a force pushing down the piston <b>33</b>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the above-described communicating hole <b>32</b> opens. As a result, a gap space SP is formed at a lower portion of the piston <b>33</b>, so that the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b </i>are in the &#x201c;communicate&#x201d; condition (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). On the other hand, when a high pressure is applied to a rear end surface of the piston <b>33</b> by the switching valve <b>36</b>, a force exerted by the compression coil spring <b>35</b> to push down the piston <b>33</b> exceeds a force by the compression coil spring <b>35</b> to push up the piston <b>33</b>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the communicating hole <b>32</b> is shut, so that the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b </i>are in the &#x201c;shut-off&#x201d; condition. Furthermore, in the &#x201c;shut-off&#x201d; condition, a refrigerant is compressed to a predetermined extent in a suction capacity. Note that hereinbelow, an operation under this condition is referred to as &#x201c;a normal operation&#x201d;. Moreover, in the &#x201c;communicate&#x201d; condition, the refrigerant is compressed in the suction capacity to an extent less than the predetermined extent. Note that hereinbelow, an operation under this condition is referred to as &#x201c;a regulating operation&#x201d;. Furthermore, in this embodiment, when the regulating operation is carried out, a rotation speed of the drive motor <b>45</b> is faster than a rotation speed of the drive motor <b>45</b> under the normal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">(4) Drive Motor</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The drive motor <b>45</b> is a brushless DC motor capable of regulating a rotation speed variably by inverter control in this embodiment, and is primarily composed of an annular stator <b>46</b> secured to the inner wall surface of the casing <b>10</b>, and a rotor <b>47</b> rotatably accommodated with a small gap (air gap channel) inside the stator <b>46</b>. The drive motor <b>45</b> is disposed so that the upper end of a coil end <b>46</b><i>a </i>formed at the top side of the stator <b>46</b> is at substantially the same height as the lower end of the bearing portion <b>23</b><i>c </i>of the housing <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A copper wire is wound around a tooth portion of the stator <b>46</b>, and coil ends <b>46</b><i>a </i>are formed above and below the stator <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The rotor <b>47</b> is connected to the movable scroll <b>22</b> of the scroll compression mechanism <b>20</b> via the crank shaft <b>40</b> disposed in the axial center of the trunk shell <b>11</b> so as to extend vertically. The crank shaft <b>40</b> is rotated in response to the rotation of this rotor <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">(5) Crank Shaft</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The crank shaft <b>40</b> is disposed in the axial center of the trunk shell <b>11</b> so as to extend vertically. This crank shaft <b>40</b> is primarily composed of a main shaft portion <b>41</b> and an eccentric portion <b>42</b>. The eccentric portion <b>42</b> is formed so as to have a smaller diameter than that of the main shaft portion <b>41</b> and is formed on an upper end surface of the main shaft portion <b>41</b>. And, this eccentric portion <b>42</b> is eccentric with respect to a shaft center of the main shaft portion <b>41</b> by a predetermined amount.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Furthermore, within the crank shaft <b>40</b>, an oil feed passage which extends vertically is formed. Further, in a lower end of the main shaft portion <b>41</b>, an oil feed pump <b>43</b> is disposed. Through this oil feed pump <b>43</b>, refrigerator oil is drawn up from a bottom portion of the casing <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the drive motor <b>45</b> is driven, the crank shaft <b>40</b> rotates and the movable scroll <b>22</b> orbits with respect to the fixed scroll <b>21</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Here, refrigerant suction operation and refrigerant compression operation of the compression mechanism <b>20</b> under normal operation are explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Under the normal operation, the piston <b>33</b> is located in a closing position, and the communicating hole <b>32</b> is shut. Therefore, the first compression chambers <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chambers <b>25</b><i>b </i>are in the &#x201c;shut-off&#x201d; condition.

<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Firstly, in the first step (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), the end of the wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable scroll <b>22</b> is located between two turns of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b>. Both of the outermost first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>0</b> and the outermost second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>0</b> connect with the suction port <b>29</b> to be open to a low-pressure side.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">(2) Operation of the Compression Mechanism Under Regulating Operation</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Here, refrigerant suction operation and refrigerant compression operation of the compression mechanism <b>20</b> under regulating operation are explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> in the same way as above. Under the regulating operation, the piston <b>33</b> is in an opening position, and the small diameter portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>of the communicating hole <b>32</b> is open. Therefore, the first compression chambers <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chambers <b>25</b><i>b </i>are in the &#x201c;communicate&#x201d; condition.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Firstly, in the first step (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), as is under the normal operation, the end of the wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable scroll <b>22</b> is located between two turns of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b>. Both of the outermost first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>0</b> and the outermost second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>0</b> connect with the suction port <b>29</b> to be open to a low-pressure side. However, under the regulating operation, this first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> is connected with the outermost second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>0</b> which is in the middle of the suction step via the communicating hole <b>32</b>. Therefore, the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> is still in a condition before the suction shut-off position is reached, and is in the middle of the same suction step as the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the movable scroll <b>22</b> orbits clockwise from the first step to enter the second step (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), the contact point P<b>1</b> between the inner circumferential surface of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b> and the outer circumferential surface of the wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable scroll <b>22</b> is shifted to a position just after passing through the communicating hole <b>32</b>. Therefore, the contact point (seal point) P<b>1</b> at this time is the suction shut-off position of the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b>. On the other hand, under this condition, the outermost second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> to be shut off under the normal operation connects with the outermost first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>0</b> formed at a scroll outer circumferential side of the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> turned to the compression step via the communicating hole <b>32</b>. And, as this outermost first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>0</b> is in the middle of the suction step, the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> is in a condition before the suction shut-off Furthermore, this condition is similar to that in the third step (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) and the fourth step (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). In the third step, the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> is in a condition before the suction shut-off A seal point at the end of the wrap is not formed yet. Further, at this time, the outermost first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>0</b> is also in the middle of the suction step. Furthermore, in the fourth step, a new second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>0</b> starts being formed at the end of the scroll more spirally outward than the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the movable scroll <b>22</b> further orbits clockwise from the fourth step to enter the fifth step (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), the contact point P<b>2</b> between the outer circumferential surface of the wrap <b>21</b><i>b </i>of the fixed scroll <b>21</b> and the inner circumferential surface of the wrap <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the movable scroll <b>22</b> passes through the communicating hole <b>32</b>. Therefore, the contact point P<b>2</b> at this time is the seal point of the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b>. The compression step of the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>1</b> starts. Note that under the normal operation, in this step, the outermost first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> is in a condition of shut-off. However, under the regulating operation, the outermost first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> connects with the low-pressure side via the outermost second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>-<b>0</b>. Thus, the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b> is still in the middle of the suction step. Furthermore, this condition is similar to that in the sixth step (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) and the first step (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As such, when the communicating hole <b>32</b> is open, both suction capacities of the first compression chambers <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chambers <b>25</b><i>b </i>are smaller in comparison with them under the normal operation. As a result, under the regulating operation, the amount of gas in circulation is less than that under the normal operation, thereby resulting in a low-power operation. Furthermore, in this embodiment, when the regulating operation is carried out, the rotation speed of the drive motor <b>45</b> is set so as to be faster than that under the normal operation. Thus, a power under the regulating operation can be maintained so as to be equal to the power under the normal operation.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">&#x3c;Characteristics of the High Pressure Dome-Type Scroll Compressor According to the First Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the high pressure dome-type scroll compressor <b>1</b> according to this embodiment, the seal receiving groove <b>33</b><i>d </i>and the through hole <b>33</b><i>f </i>are formed on the piston <b>33</b> in the suction capacity regulating mechanism <b>30</b>. Further, the piston ring <b>33</b><i>e </i>having a step-like fitting end is fitted into the seal receiving groove <b>33</b><i>d</i>. Therefore, in this scroll compressor <b>1</b>, when a gas refrigerant that applies a pressure larger than biasing force of the compression coil spring <b>35</b> for biasing the piston <b>33</b> per unit area is introduced into the gas refrigerant introducing pipe <b>50</b>, the high-pressure gas refrigerant passes through the through hole <b>33</b><i>f </i>of the piston <b>33</b> and pushes the piston ring <b>33</b><i>e </i>against a wall of the through hole <b>33</b><i>f</i>. Then, the piston ring expands slightly at this time. Since the fitting end has a step-like structure, it is able to suppress a leak of the high-pressure fluid effectively. Further, at the beginning of introducing the high-pressure gas refrigerant, the high-pressure gas refrigerant flows through a minute gap between the piston <b>33</b> and the communicating hole <b>32</b> of the fixed scroll <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Thus, the piston ring <b>33</b><i>e </i>is pushed against a side of the compression chamber. Therefore, in this scroll compressor <b>1</b>, when the high-pressure gas refrigerant that applies a pressure larger than biasing force of the compression coil spring <b>35</b> per unit area is introduced into the gas refrigerant introducing pipe <b>50</b>, it is able to effectively suppress the high-pressure fluid flowing into compression chambers <b>25</b><i>a</i>, <b>25</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, in this scroll compressor <b>1</b>, it is able to suppress a power reduction in the normal operation.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the scroll compressor according to the third embodiment, the first communicating hole <b>132</b><i>a </i>for the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second communicating hole <b>132</b><i>b </i>for the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b </i>are disposed in the end plate of the fixed scroll. However, only the first communicating hole <b>132</b><i>a </i>for the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>may be formed so as to decrease a suction capacity of only the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a</i>. By doing so, the difference of gas pressure between the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b </i>can be decreased. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the effects of vibration due to imbalanced gas load or variation of a rotation torque of the scroll.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">(B)</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">While not referred to specifically in the third embodiment, balance of gas load has a relative relationship between the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, a regulating position of a suction capacity of the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b </i>may be shifted to a more spirally outward side (an end side) of a scroll than the regulating position of the suction capacity of the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>so as to be able to regulate both of suction capacities of the first compression chamber <b>25</b><i>a </i>and the second compression chamber <b>25</b><i>b. </i></p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The scroll compressor according to the present invention has a characteristic that even if a fluid that applies a pressure larger than the biasing force of the biasing member per unit area is introduced into the fluid introducing pipe, it is able to effectively suppress the leak of high-pressure fluid into a compression chamber formed by the first scroll member and the second scroll member, and is available for a scroll compressor, especially for those scroll compressors that require a renewal.</p>
