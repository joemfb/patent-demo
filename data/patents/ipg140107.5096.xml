<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of detecting, controlling and managing transmission of a transmitting device within a facility is disclosed. The method involves transmitting information to the transmission device, detecting a response transmission from the transmission device by a least one transmission detection facility, extracting identification information associated with the transmission device in response to the transmitted information; and determining a location of the transmission device based on the response transmission received by the at least one received transmission detection facility, wherein the response transmissions are sorted by the identification information, determining an allowability of the located transmission device with the set area and interacting and manipulating transmission of the detected transmitting device.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Detection of a transmission facility, such as a mobile phone or hand-held radio transmitter, or other transmission facility as described herein, within an obstruction rich environment, such as a facility with many physical barriers to electronic transmission, is difficult to achieve. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transmission detection, identification, and reporting system <b>100</b> described herein provides a method of detecting a transmission facility <b>202</b>, such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, within an environment rich in obstructions <b>102</b>. One embodiment of the transmission detection, identification, and reporting system <b>100</b> may involve the detection of a mobile phone within a heavily walled and metal-barred government facility such as a correctional facility. In this embodiment, the system may utilize an array of antennas <b>104</b> selectively placed within the facility, collection substations <b>108</b> for localized collection of detected signals, a central unit <b>110</b> for the processing of incoming signals from the facility, a display <b>112</b> for showing the location of the detected transmission facility <b>202</b>, and an action facility <b>114</b> for implementing standard procedures in the event of a detection. In this embodiment, the communications between the antennas <b>104</b> and the substations <b>108</b>, and between the substations <b>108</b> and the central unit <b>110</b>, may be wireless to make installation and maintenance of the system within the facility, cost and time effective. Selective placement of the antennas <b>104</b>, combined with algorithms and methods for determining location of the transmission facility <b>202</b>, may allow a substantially improved means for locating transmission facilities <b>202</b>, such as mobile phones, in an otherwise heavily shielded environment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In embodiments the antenna <b>104</b> may be a multi-dipole embedded antenna. Two examples of dual dipole embedded antennas are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as a first dual-dipole embedded antenna <b>302</b> and a second dual dipole embedded antenna <b>304</b>. In embodiments the antenna may be adapted to receive one, two, three, four, or more bandwidths. In embodiments the antenna <b>104</b> may be selected as one or more of a dipole antenna <b>104</b>, a Yagi-Uda antenna <b>104</b>, a loop antenna <b>104</b>, a quad antenna <b>104</b>, a micro-strip antenna <b>104</b>, a quad antenna <b>104</b>, a helical antenna <b>104</b>, a phase array antenna <b>104</b>, a patch antenna or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In embodiments, the transmission facility <b>202</b> may be a mobile phone, such as a flip phone, a slide phone, a cellular phone, a handset, a satellite phone, a 3G phone, a wireless phone, a cordless phone or the like. In embodiments, the transmission facility <b>202</b> may be a radio, such as a Walkie-Talkie, a mobile radio, a short-wave radio, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In embodiments, the transmission band from the transmission may be within the radio or other electromagnetic frequency spectrum, such as extremely low frequency (ELF), super low frequency (SLF), ultra low frequency (ULF), very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), medium frequency (MF), high frequency (HF), very high frequency (VHF), ultra high frequency (UHF), super high frequency (SHF), extremely high frequency (EHF), microwave, a frequency suitable for 802.11x wireless communications, ultra wide band (UWB), Bluetooth, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In embodiments, the obstruction rich environment <b>102</b> may be a building, such as a corrections facility, a school, a government facility, a store, a mall, a residence, a hotel, a motel, or the like. In embodiments, the obstruction rich environments <b>102</b> may be a large confined space, such as a courtyard, a food court, a recess area, a hallway, greenhouse, recreation room, gymnasium, auditorium, kitchen, cafeteria, craft area, work area, library, prison yard, or the like. In embodiments, the transmission obstruction <b>102</b> materials such as cinderblock, cement, rebar, wire cage, metal, metal coated surface, or the like. In embodiments, the obstructions in the obstruction rich environments <b>102</b> may be other construction materials, such as wood, glass, rug, flooring materials, roofing materials, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In embodiments, the transmitting signal information from the antenna <b>104</b> module to the central unit <b>110</b> may be through a communications connection, such as an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless network, IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, and/or other similar type wireless communication protocols. In embodiments, the communications connection may utilize CAT-5, RJ-45, RS-232 connections, and/or other similar type wired communication protocols and hardware. In embodiments the communications connection may utilize an optical connection, such as a wireless infrared link, wireless visible light, an optical fiber, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In embodiments, the transmitting signal information from the antenna <b>104</b> module to the central unit <b>110</b> may contain data, such as CDMA, CDPD, GSM, TDMA, and the like, and may be used to discriminate which service signal is being used, such as Verizon, Cingular, T-Mobile, Sprint, and the like. The detection of the cell phones may be further resolved down to cell phone manufacturer and cell phone provider.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In embodiments, the transmitting signal information to the central unit <b>110</b> may be made through an intermediate connection, such as a substation <b>108</b>, router, switch, hub, bridge, multiplexer, modem, network card, network interface, processing unit, preprocessor, computer, repeater, antenna <b>104</b>, and the like. (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In embodiments, the central unit <b>110</b> may have in part a computer, a computer system, a network of computers, a state machine, a sequencer, a microprocessor, a digital signal processor, an audio processor, a preprocessor, a microprocessor, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In embodiments, the central unit <b>110</b> may process information, such as location information, such as the location of people, inmates, corrections personnel, visitors, all personnel within the facility, equipment, resources, weapons, products, incoming goods, outgoing goods, and the like. In embodiments, the information may be a type of signal, such as mobile phone standard protocols such as CDMA, CDPA, GSM, TDMA, and the like. In embodiments, the information may be an event notification, such as personnel under duress, an emergency medical condition, a call for assistance, a fire, a call for police, a theft, and the like. In embodiments, the processed information may allow for the tracking of the person or object in possession of the transmission facility <b>202</b>, such as a mobile phone, a radio, a weapon, a product, a resource, and the like. In embodiments, the processed information may allow for the discrimination and/or association between people or objects, such as determining the ownership of the transmission facility <b>202</b>, the assignment of the source of transmission, current location of a transmission facility <b>202</b> compared to its predicted location, and the like. In embodiments, the processed information may also have time codes and unique identifiers assigned.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In embodiments, the central unit <b>110</b> may have a display <b>112</b>, such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), electronic paper, 3D display, head-mounted display, projector, segmented display, computer display, graphic output display, and the like. In embodiments, the central unit <b>110</b> may have an action facility <b>114</b>, comprising a user interface for causing actions relating to the detected transmission facility <b>202</b>. Actions may for example represent operations such as closing a door, sealing a room, deploying and action signal, initiating an alarm, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In embodiments the functions of a central unit <b>110</b> as described herein may be replaced by an alternate configuration, such as a configuration of multiple computers, such as a group of servers, processors, or the like, operating in parallel. In embodiments the methods and systems described herein may involve locating computing capabilities in alternative network configurations, such as in a mesh network or a peer-to-peer network.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In embodiments, the location of a transmission facility <b>202</b> may be determined by various radiolocation or signal measurement techniques, including measuring phase, amplitude, time, or a combination of these; or by identifying and locating an area associated with an antenna <b>104</b> with the highest signal strength. In embodiments, the location of a transmission facility <b>202</b> may be determined when the transmission facility <b>202</b> is powered off though detection of a null in the band pass of a transmitted frequency sweep due to the presence of a mobile phone antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In embodiments, a method of detecting a transmission facility <b>202</b> (e.g. cell phone) when the transmission facility <b>202</b> is not powered may require a transmitting device and a receiving device that can recognize the signature of an antenna <b>104</b> associated with the transmission facility <b>202</b>. By transmitting a known frequency and receiving the disturbance pattern produced by having a particular antenna <b>104</b> design in the transmission path, the pattern or &#x2018;signature&#x2019; of that antenna <b>104</b> can be characterized. In embodiments, this characterization may be evaluated by central unit <b>110</b> with results output to a display <b>112</b>. A database of these signatures can be placed into the unit, and as the transmitter sweeps across the various cell frequencies, a pattern received can be matched against the database patterns to determine the presence of transmission facilities <b>202</b>. In embodiments, any class of antenna (e.g. WI-FI, Blackberry, Walkie-Talkie, etc.) can be classified and identified.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In embodiments, the range of a hand held device that can detect an inactive transmission facility is approximately 10 feet. In embodiments, greater distances could be attained for stationary units by increasing the power.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Radiolocation, also referred to as radio-determination, as used herein, encompasses any process of finding the location of a transmitter by means of the propagation properties of waves. The angle, at which a signal is received, as well as the time it takes to propagate, may both contribute to the determination of the location of the transmission facility <b>202</b>. There are a variety of methods that may be employed in the determination of the location of a transmission facility <b>202</b>. Methods include (i) a cell-sector system that collects information pertaining to cell and sector ID's, (ii) the assisted-global positioning satellite (GPS) technology utilizing a GPS chipset in a mobile communication facility, (iii) standard GPS technology, (iv) enhanced-observed time difference technology utilizing software residing on a server that uses signal transmission of time differences received by geographically dispersed radio receivers to pinpoint a user's location, (v) time difference of arrival, (vi) time of arrival, (vii) angle of arrival, (viii) triangulation of cellular signals, (iix) location based on proximity to known locations (including locations of other radio-transmitters), (ix) map-based location, or any combination of any of the foregoing, as well as other location facilities known to those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Obstructions to radio wave propagation in the obstruction rich environments <b>102</b> may greatly reduce the effectiveness of many of the conventional radiolocation methods due to obstruction of the line-of-sight between the transmission facilities <b>202</b> and the receiving antennas <b>104</b>. However, by employing a large array of antennas <b>104</b>, positioned so as to maintain line-of-sight between possible transmission facility <b>202</b> locations and the receiving antennas <b>104</b>, several of these methods may be effectively used in the location of the transmission facility <b>202</b>. These methods include time difference of arrival, time of arrival, and angle of arrival, amplitude comparison, and the like. The time difference of arrival method determines the difference in the time, or the difference in phase, of the same radio-transmitting signal arriving at different receiving antennas <b>104</b>. Together with the known propagation speed of the radio wave, allows the determination of the location of the transmission facility <b>202</b>. The time of arrival method determines the absolute time of reception of the signal at different receiving antennas <b>104</b>, and again, along with the known propagation speed of the radio wave, allows the determination of the location of the transmission facility <b>202</b>. The angle of arrival method utilizes direction of transmission to different antennas <b>104</b> to determine the location of the transmission facility. Amplitude comparison method compares the strength of the signal detected at each antenna to determine the location of a transmission facility <b>202</b>. For example, two antennas <b>104</b> located in the same room would detect different signal amplitudes for the same transmission facility <b>202</b> output, thereby providing a means of determining which antenna <b>104</b> the transmission facility <b>202</b> is closer to. Increasing the number of antennas <b>104</b> therefore increases the resolution with which the location of the transmission facility <b>202</b> may be determined. All of these methods, and combinations of these methods, may employ mathematical processes such as triangulation, trilateration, multilateration, or like, in determining the location of the transmission facility.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Triangulation is the process of finding coordinates and distance to a point by calculating the length of one side of a triangle, given measurements of angles and/or sides of the triangle formed by that point, such as the target transmission facility <b>202</b>, and two other known reference points, such as the receiving antennas <b>104</b>. The calculation of the location of the transmission facility <b>202</b> may then be performed utilizing the law of sines from trigonometry. Tri-lateration is a method similar to triangulation, but unlike triangulation, which uses angle measurements, together with at least one known distance, to calculate the subject's location, tri-lateration uses the known locations of two or more reference points and the measured distance to the subject, such as the transmission facility <b>202</b>, and each reference point, such as the receiving antennas <b>104</b>. Multi-lateration, or hyperbolic positioning, is similar to tri-lateration, but multi-lateration uses measurements of time difference of arrival, rather than time of arrival, to estimate location using the intersection of hyperboloids.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While several radiolocation and triangulation techniques have been described in connection with locating the transmitting device, it should be understood that one skilled in the art would appreciate that there are other location methodologies and such location methodologies are encompassed by the present invention. For example, in embodiments, the location of a single antenna may be known and the single antenna may detect a transmitting device. The location of the transmitting device may be estimated through its known proximity to the single antenna location. This may provide adequate location resolution for certain applications of the technology. Similarly, two or more antennas may be used and each of the antenna locations may be known. When each of the antennas receives a transmission, the corresponding signal strengths may be compared. The one with the highest signal strength may be determined as the one closest to the transmitting device so the corresponding antenna location may provide enough location resolution for certain applications.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an embodiment of the transmission detection, identification, and reporting system <b>100</b>, a corrections facility, with its substantial and inherent obstruction rich environment <b>102</b>, presents a significant challenge to authorities of the correction facilities. In the embodiment if the invention shown and described herein, the system may be placed throughout the corrections facility for the purpose of alerting the corrections staff that cell phone activity is taking place, the location of the activity and the type, i.e., Nextel, T-Mobile, Verizon, and the like. The following technology may also allow for a standalone detection unit <b>408</b> or set of detection units <b>408</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to detect cell phones in schools, buildings and other environments in which the facility's or area's provider does not wish the use of cell phones and is interested in the detection of cell phone use.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an embodiment, the system may include an integrated antenna <b>104</b> and RF detector (together referred to as a detector unit <b>408</b>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), a substation <b>108</b>, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) whose purpose may be to communicate with each detector unit <b>408</b> within its sector, and report activity to the central unit <b>110</b> which reports confirmed activity, type of cell phone, and location to the display <b>112</b> of the central unit <b>110</b>. These detection units <b>408</b> may be used individually or in conjunction with each other and may triangulate detection within a specific area. The outside yard areas may be monitored by detection units <b>408</b>, which may cover large areas, such as 25&#xd7;25 foot sectors or smaller areas, e.g, 5&#xd7;5 foot sectors, to localize the detection of a cell phone (i.e., wireless transmission facility) and track its position from one sector to any adjoining sector. That is, as the person moves with a phone, the changing position of that phone may be reported. If the phone moves inside the facility, tracking may continue as interior detection units <b>408</b> detect the phone.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an embodiment, within these basic groups of detection units <b>408</b> may be various detection unit <b>408</b> types. Some detection unit <b>408</b>s may be designed to be hard wired via RJ-45 connectors and/or CAT 5e cable, other detection units <b>408</b> may use 802.11b (WI-FI) wireless communications between detection units <b>408</b>, and there may also be an Infra Red (IR) set of detection units <b>408</b> which utilize optical communications techniques. Each communications type may have a specific purpose within the corrections facility or other type of building and/or areas. Hard-wired units may be used when it is not possible to use either an optical unit or a WI-FI unit. Used when there are walls embedded with metal or where the distance and the obstructions <b>102</b> may preclude a wireless technique. WI-FI detection units <b>408</b> may be used when it is effective to communicate in an area where there are obstructions <b>102</b> such as cement walls or cement with embedded rebar walls, facades, and the like. Optical detection units <b>408</b> may be used in areas where clear, line-of-site communications may be possible. Optical detection units <b>408</b> may operate over relatively long distances, (e.g., 3,000 feet), while WI-FI detection units <b>408</b> may be limited to shorter distances, such as 250 feet.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an embodiment, there may also be a hand-held detection units <b>408</b> to be used once a cell phone has been detected, and the corrections officer(s) or monitor are attempting to pinpoint the location. This hand-held detection unit <b>408</b> may be similar to the integrated antenna/detector unit of the main system. This embodiment may also include a detector, discriminator and decoder module. The hand-held detection units <b>408</b> may detect and identify each cell phone and compare the cell phone identity to the allowed cell phone user list or in this case to a list of unauthorized cell phones. This detector unit <b>408</b> may output an audible alarm whose pitch changes as the signal becomes stronger or weaker.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an embodiment, a second type of hand-held detector unit <b>408</b> may be used to detect a cell phone when it is either off or in a standby condition, also referred to as null detecting. Null detection may be used at an ingress or egress of a building or an area as a way of detecting a communication device or device with an antenna. This technique may be used in areas where it is unpractical, unwanted or unwarranted to have x-ray machines or more intrusive detection systems. A null detection system may also be deployed in a handheld device so an inspector can move through an area attempting to detect a communication device. In embodiments, the null detection system may detect the presence of a transmission facility even when the transmission facility is not transmitting a signal. In embodiments, a hand held or mounted null detection device may be used in a correctional institution or other government facility.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In embodiments, null detection may utilize a transmission-detection source, independent of the transmission source being detected, which is capable of sweeping across the frequency spectrum of interest and receiving it's returning signal. The transmission source sweeps the spectrum of interest, searching for distortions in the returned field. Distortions in the spectrum may be due to the presence of an antenna of a transmission facility <b>202</b>. Matching the distortion, also referred to as a null in the band pass, to characteristics of known antennas used with mobile phones may allow the detection and/or identification of the transmission facility <b>202</b>. The unit may output an audible &#x201c;beep&#x201d; if it detects a null, allowing the officers to focus in on the location of the cell phone. The range of the hand-held detection units <b>408</b> may be, for example, 15 to 20 feet. This will allow cell phones that are in the immediate vicinity to be quickly detected. The null detection may be applicable for ingress and/or egress detection.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an embodiment, a survey may be performed to determine optimal placement and the type and number of detection units <b>408</b> required. This will insure the minimum number of required detection units <b>408</b> to perform optimal detection. The team may provide a report detailing the layout determined to be optimized for the facility and may review this report with the facilities staff so that any required modifications to the plan may be incorporated before installation is begun.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In an embodiment, the initial coverage of a facility may be in the cell blocks <b>402</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and/or pod areas. The same may be true for linear facilities. The survey may cover the entire facility, including open areas, such as courtyards, where required. Inmate also work in large yard and plantations such as Angola State Prison, it is anticipated this technology may be deployed over a large outside area.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an embodiment, the cell block detection units <b>408</b> may be mounted inside each chase <b>404</b> (a column positioned between cells in a cell block that includes various utility facilities, such as for plumbing and electricity), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and may communicate to a substation <b>108</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) located at one end of the block. This detection unit <b>408</b> may communicate its information to the central unit <b>110</b> so that tracking, confirmation, and display may be accomplished. For linear facilities <b>500</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, detector units <b>408</b> may be mounted along the walls in the obstruction rich environment <b>102</b> opposite the cells <b>402</b> and perform their function similar to the detection units <b>408</b> mounted within a chase <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an embodiment, detector units <b>408</b> may be installed in open areas such as gymnasiums, kitchens, cafeterias, craft and work areas and other open areas where a cell phone may be used. The difference in these locations from the cell blocks <b>402</b> may include the method of detection and tracking. Since most facilities may only require the identification of a cell phones presence within a room, and there could be many inmates within that room, the process may be to lock-down the room, or rooms, in that area and use a hand held device and a physical search to pinpoint the phone location. A generalized block diagram of a detector unit <b>408</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For those facilities that require resolving the location within a large interior room or area, the use of triangulation to resolve to a 10&#xd7;10 foot area may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an embodiment, facilities with the requirement to detect cell phones <b>202</b> in outside yard areas, the use of triangulation to a 25&#xd7;25 foot space or smaller foot space (e.g., 5&#xd7;5 foot) may be constructed. As a phone <b>202</b> is moved from area coverage <b>702</b> to area coverage <b>702</b>, the system may track its movement. Each square foot sector may overlap an adjoining sector. In this way, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, tracking may be continuous, without any gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an embodiment, it may also be important to know whether a phone is located on one side of an obstruction or the other, such as doors, walls, and the like. If the wrong room is identified, it may make it more difficult to locate a phone and its user. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, detection of the correct room may depend upon the level of the signal received. Proper placement of the detector units <b>408</b> may insure that the phone may be identified in the correct location.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an embodiment, when sectoring a large room such as a gymnasium, the number and placement of antennas <b>104</b> may be critical. In order to sector large regions, such as a 10&#xd7;10 foot section, within the room, the antenna <b>104</b> may need to be capable of narrowing their window to an area small enough to meet the requirement. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, there is shown an omni-directional antenna <b>104</b>, which detects signal presence generally in a 360 degree direction. Once a signal crosses a threshold, the direction finding antennas <b>104</b> may be turned on to determine the position of the signal. This may be reported to the display <b>112</b> and tracked until it is either turned off or moves to another room or hallway. Then, normal positional tracking may take place.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an embodiment, the transmission detection, identification, and reporting system <b>100</b> may work in conjunction with a personal alarm system, or an inmate tracking system, or a combination of all three and the like. This dual/tri role system(s) may allow for more cost effective use of the detection units <b>408</b> and provide for greater protection for the correctional officer and inmate alike. This detection system may utilize an individualized frequency, with known frequency separation between detection units <b>408</b> and between corrections officer's frequencies and Inmate frequencies. The detection configuration of the detection units <b>408</b> may provide complete coverage of the facility. Each transmission facility unit may be continually tracked throughout the facility. At all ingress or egress points the focus of the detection may ensure accurate location of all correctional and inmate personnel. With the combined systems more detection units <b>408</b> may be needed to ensure full coverage. In an embodiment, the known Identify of the transmission facility, in this case a cell phone being carried and/or used by an officer or inmate can be accurately associated with another known identify of another transmission facility, in this case a corrections officer and/or inmate wearing a transmission facility. In this embodiment, the use of an authorized cell phone or an authorized transmission facility by an unauthorized person can be accurately detected and reported. This embodiment can be utilized inside the facility or outside the facility.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an embodiment, the transmission detection, identification, and reporting system <b>100</b> may allow for cell phone owner discrimination. The system may provide for the allowance of authorized cell phones within the prohibited area. The system may detect and identify each cell phone and compare the cell phone identity to the allowed cell phone user list. The system may record all phone use and may automatically alert the facility of all prohibited cell phone use. In addition, each cell phone detection event may be identified with a unique identifier and time code, to ensure proper identification. The CCTV system may also be integrated to ensure greater accuracy identifying illegal use of wireless transmission devices.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The cell scan-1 detection system <b>1000</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, is an embodiment of a system for detecting signals of a transmission facility. Antenna <b>104</b> receives transmission signals from wireless transmission device (not shown). Antenna <b>104</b> may operate, for example in the range of 2.4 GHz with a bandwidth of 465 MHz. The received signals are then provided to a low pass filter and a log amplifier, wherein the level of amplification is based on the input level of the input signal. The amplified signal is next provided to a shaping filter and an operational amplifier. The amplified signals are provided to an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter and provided to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Information from the FPGA may be provided to a microprocessor to supplement the processing and control imposed by the FPGA. The FPGA may receive information from dedicated frequency bands (e.g., 9000 MHz) or from known wireless protocols (e.g., 802.15.4). The microprocessor may then determine whether a detected transmission facility for example is a person with a transmission facility (e.g., wristband, a cell phone) and may allow or prevent that person from accessing an area. The microprocessor it may also alert the central unit of the persons entering or desire to enter a restricted area. In an another embodiment, if the transmission facility for example is a cell phone and the cell phone was in use within a restricted area, the cell phone would be identified by the central unit as being in a restricted area, then the system will determine whether the cell phone is authorized or not authorized, then the system would make a determination, based upon set rules whether to allow or disallow the transmission unit within the restricted area.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The cell scan-1 detection system <b>1000</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, is an embodiment of a system for detecting signals of a transmission facility. An antenna <b>104</b> receives wireless transmission facilities in a 2.4 GHz band, with a 465 MHz antenna. In other aspects, the detection system may detect signals in other frequency bands,&#x2014;for example, 933 MHz, 433 Mhz, 2.4 GHz and other known frequencies. The detected signals are provided to High and Low band RF filter. The RF filters (band pass filter) isolate sets of frequencies for greater sensitivity. For example, the received signals may be provided to a low band RF filter to isolate low band RF signals and high band RF filters to isolate high band RF signals. The isolated RF signals are provided to Log Amplifiers that amplify or boost the signals using known amplification methods. The switch between two Wi-Fi frequencies switches all three wireless signal inputs go into a log amp circuit and then to a smoothing filter to clean up the signal to be analyzed. The signals are then provided to an Operational Amplifier (Op Amp) which amplifies the received analog signal. The amplified RF signal is then processed through an AID converter which changes the signal into a digital signal. The signal is then processed in a processing unit (in this case a dedicated Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)) and the results are then transmitted via a dedicated 2.4 GHz transceiver unit. The 2.4 GHz transceiver unit has several other applications, and is used to transmit and receive communication information and to connect to external Wi-Fi communication devices. An example of this is an education system for inmates, medical monitoring equipment in a hospital application, an interactive ID for safe school applications. The 900 MHz transceiver unit is for syncing the sensors. The 465 MHz transceiver unit is for communication with inmates bracelets and Staff (personal alarm system) as is further discussed in the aforementioned related patent applications. The lower frequency of the 465 MHz unit also provides better wall penetration and alterative wireless communication device with better wall penetration. In another embodiment, the front end of the signal detection circuit an amplifier (e.g., 0-40 db gain is added before the RF filter (example a 824-849 MHz RF filter) to provide for greater sensitivity. In additional a mixer and Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) (not shown) is added after the RF filter. The output of the mixer is a IF frequency that is amplified and then provided to a band pass filter (e.g., a 200 MHz filter with a bandwidth of 4 MHZ). The signal is then amplified and then provided to the Log Amp then to an op amp and then to the ADC. Depending on the noise floor (which is determined by proper grounding), one with an understanding of RF circuitry would know to have proper impedance matching between components, and will utilize transformer where appropriate. The IF section's general parameters are 70 MHz to 350 MHz and sensitivity is related to frequency and the width of the band pass filter. As would be appreciated, the tighter the width of the band pass, the greater the sensitivity. In another embodiment, the VCO/mixer may be fixed and the IF band pass filter may be the bandwidth of a desired frequency providing for faster detection without the need to scan. Additionally the greater the dynamic range of the sensor system the greater accuracy and resolution in determining the exact location of the transmission facility.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the processing section may be placed on a separate board, this provides for multiple sensors front ends utilizing one back end processing unit. This provide for more cost effective sensors and versatility of assets. This also allows for specific functionality such as antenna array directional location and angle tri-angularzaton being synchronized to at least one processing unit. It is also anticipated the more expensive processing component be shared such a transmission signal decoding, data analysis, communications and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The cell scan-2 detection system <b>1100</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, shows an alternate embodiment of a system for detecting a signal of a transmission facility. The RF filters (i.e., band pass filter) isolate sets of frequencies for greater sensitivity, in this example a low band cell phone signals and high band cell phone signals. The operation of the elements in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and need not be discussed in detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The main board system <b>1200</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, is an embodiment of a main circuit board within a system for detecting transmission facilities. The system may be used to determine each signal received is an actual cell phone signal and not a spurious output. Thus, a test may need to be performed that checks for the &#x2018;persistence&#x2019; of the received signal. A persistence test may run a timer <b>1202</b> for a minimum required time that may be nearly as long as the time of the shortest signal type expected. If the signal is present at the end of the timeout period, it is less likely to be a spurious response and more likely that it is a cell phone output. For example, if a GSM signal of 500 microseconds long is the shortest duration signal of all the cell phone protocols received, the persistence test may run for 450 microseconds to further ensure that the received signal is not merely a spurious response.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The sub-station system <b>1300</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, is an embodiment of a sub-station in a system for detecting transmission facilities</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a null detector (<b>1400</b>), wherein the VCO in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> tunes to known antenna frequencies and the system detects a null in the known antenna frequencies in which the antenna is detected. In embodiments, the null detection system may detect the presence of a transmission facility even when the transmission facility is not transmitting a signal. In embodiments, a hand held or mounted null detection device may be used in a correctional institution or other government facility. In embodiments, null detection may utilize a transmission-detection source, independent of the transmission source being detected, which is capable of sweeping across the frequency spectrum of interest and receiving it's returning signal. The transmission source sweeps the spectrum of interest, searching for distortions in the returned field. Distortions in the spectrum may be due to the presence of an antenna of a transmission facility <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In embodiments of the system described herein, detection levels may be determined by which output levels are possible with the various cell phone technologies that are in use today. Since the system described is an amplitude system, the strongest and weakest possible signals must be determined in order to identify the system's required dynamic range. Cell phone signals vary from &#x2212;22 dBW to 6 DBW and this range defines the detection requirements of the system. This translates to a maximum signal of 4.0 Watts at the antenna. The minimum value is equal to 0.006 Watts or 6 milliwatts. Therefore, the dynamic range required is &#x2212;52 dBm to +36 dBm. In order to achieve such a dynamic range, an amplifier that is gain adjustable is required such that an input value of +36 dBm, the amplifier is not saturated.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the embodiment, the system determines the characteristics required to insure that each cell phone is correctly identified. The amplitude of each signal is determined which allows the system to determine which sensor has received the largest signal. The system time stamps each data sample so that other sensors receiving the same signal will be recognized as such when the data is presented for analysis. Each sensor analyzes the wave shape of the signal detected. Each transmission type (i.e., CDMA2000, PCS, TDMA, GSM, IS-95, etc.) has a unique wave shape. These wave shapes allow the analysis software to recognize that signals seen in different parts of a facility can be associated with each other (using time and wave shape) and the signal that consistently contains the largest amplitude will be identified as closest to the cell phone transmission</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In embodiments of the invention, signals directed toward an IED (improvised explosive device) may be intercepted, identified and denied service. Such interception may be up to a known range in forward and side quadrants. The identification and determination of the position of the person or persons using a satellite phone and/or land-based cell phone may be determined. Cell phones, as well as other RF devices, e.g., garage door openers, walkie-talkie, etc., may be captured, identified and/or jammed that are attempting to activate or contact the IED.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In embodiments of the invention, when a cell phone, for example, is on, but not in an active communication, the cell phone is essentially invisible to anyone attempting to monitor cell phone activity. In order to be aware of the existence of such &#x201c;on but not transmitting devices&#x201d; the system described herein operates as a cell tower. That is, the system actively addresses the problem of cell phone detection by operating (becoming) the tower. A vehicle with similar (but modified equipment to that of a cell tower may actively poll the area of phones that are &#x201c;on but not in a communication of any sort.&#x201d; The vehicle (i.e., Pseudo Tower) collects the current database of active phones and those phones in standby from the tower(s) in the area and uses this data base to poll these phones in order to locate them. Once potential phones that could be possible detonation cell phones are identified and located, the Pseudo Tower would affect a handoff and make itself the active tower. Thus, the captured cell phones are not allowed to rotate back to (i.e., connect to) the local cell phone tower, insuring that any calls attempting to communicate with the detonation cell phone will not be sent. As one of the goals is to identify the person who is attempting to contact the detonation cell phone, a call history of each suspect cell phone may be analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When a caller attempts to activate an IED, the caller's presence can be identified. Furthermore, the call being made is not forwarded to the detonation cell phone and the IED will not be activated. By determining a peak angle (triangulation) the caller's cell phone/satellite phone signal, the direction of the caller is then known. Direction identification is performed by using a technique such an interferometry. In this case, multiple antennas employing interferometry may be used to scan through the current cell phone traffic identifying first, candidate threats and then, pinpointing high probability locations which can be viewed through a high powered binoculars to determine whether the candidate is in need of investigation. Criteria for determining which cell locations may be threats is a pole or road sign, etc. The Psuedo Tower may continue controlling all of the phones in the area, preventing any forwarding of calls until all possible threats have been cleared. At this point, the personnel have the option of going after the caller or deactivating the IED, or both. It would be possible to clear the area and detonate the device later if that is a desired plan of action.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Given the varying parameters by which detonation can take place, the Pseudo Tower may also be designed to deny service to any active and inactive phone within a given geographical area and pinpoint the location of said phones.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Satellite cell phone transmission presents a somewhat different problem. Since the transmission from phone to satellite to phone is communicated to a number of satellites, becoming a replacement for the satellite will require cooperation from the provider. Via one or more specific codes, the satellites may be told that the vehicle mounted satellite simulator (i.e., Pseudo Tower) will be taking over the control of phones within a certain radius. Since this is a moving or ever changing circle, the replacement &#x201c;satellite&#x201d; will have to continuously update the actual satellite of its position and which phones are being released and which phones are being controlled. Once this function has been implemented, the control of the suspect phones is similar to that of the cell phone. Determining the caller's position and the location of the detonation phone is as above.</p>

In the illustrated embodiment <b>1600</b>, antenna <b>1602</b> is a multi-band directional array that operates to detect signals in a low band and in a high band (<b>835</b> and 1.85 GHz range, respectively), a two way radio band (465 MHz), a Wi-Fi, a Bluetooth band (2.5 GHz) and PAL (Personal Alarm Locator) band (950 MHz). In the illustrated embodiment, the antenna connects to two components, first to a detector (<b>1603</b>) and also to a decoder (<b>1604</b>). The detector <b>1603</b> and decoder <b>1604</b> decodes the PAL Identification signal and may further decode biometric information, emergency information. In other embodiments, detector <b>1603</b> and decoder <b>1604</b> are configured to decode cell phone identifications. Antenna <b>1602</b> provides detected signals to a 6 way input switch (<b>1605</b>). The output of switch <b>1605</b> is connected to a wideband RF amplifier (<b>1606</b>). Wideband RF amplifier <b>1606</b> represents a variable gain amplifier that adjusts the detected signal amplitude based on the band in which a detected signal is detected by antenna <b>1602</b>. In another aspect of the invention switch <b>1606</b> may be connected to a block gain amplifier (not shown) to provide amplification of the detected signal and the amplified detected signal may then be provided to a corresponding RF filter based on the frequency band of the detected frequency.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref> illustrates an exemplary process <b>1900</b> for capturing a wireless transmission in accordance with the principles of the invention and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> illustrates an exemplary geographic configuration for explaining the processing shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, at block <b>1910</b>, a reference signal transmitted by a transmitter (<b>1972</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>) is received at a transceiving system (<b>1975</b>). The transmitter <b>1972</b> has a transmitting range represented by a distance R<sub>1</sub>. An estimated distance (D<sub>0</sub>) between the transceiving system <b>1975</b> and a transmitter <b>1972</b> of the reference signal is determined based on a received power at the transceiving system. At block <b>1920</b>, a determination is made regarding an expected power of the reference signal to be received at wireless transmission facilities a known distance (R<sub>2</sub>) from the transceiving system <b>1975</b>. In one aspect of the invention, an expected received power may be determined without regard to the positions of the reference signal transmitter <b>1972</b> and the transceiving system <b>1975</b>. That is, an expected received power may be determined a known distance (R<sub>2</sub>) about the transceiving system <b>1975</b> based solely on the received power at the transceiving system <b>1975</b> and, thus, the expected received power at point A is the same as that received at point B. In another aspect of the invention, a position of the reference signal transmitter <b>1972</b> may be determined or provided to the transceiving system <b>1975</b>. For example, a direction of the reference signal transmitter <b>1972</b> may be determined, using directional receiving antennas (or multiple receiving antennas separated by a known angular measure, such as four antenna spatially oriented 90 degrees to each other, such that the 3 dB antenna gain points intersect at 45 degrees from the antenna maximum gain) at the transceiving system <b>1975</b>, and a position relative to the transceiving system <b>1975</b> may be determined based on the determined direction and estimated distance (D<sub>0</sub>). In another aspect, a direction of the reference signal transmitter <b>1972</b> may be determined using a received signal strength of the reference signal on at least one receiving antenna. In another aspect, the position or location of the reference signal transmitter <b>1972</b> may be known and, thus, available to the transceiving system <b>1975</b>. For example, the position of the transmitter <b>1972</b> may be known through a mapping of such transmitters and/or the location is known based on conventional surveying methods or from a global positioning satellite system (GPS). With the position of the reference signal transmitter <b>1972</b> known, the expected power of the reference signal may then be determined more accurately. For example, the expected received power of the reference signal a known distance from the transceiving system <b>1975</b> in line with, and between, the transmitter <b>1972</b> and the transceiving system <b>1975</b> is greater than the expected received power of the reference signal a known distance from the transceiving system in line with but on an opposite side of the transceiving system <b>1975</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, the received signal strength at wireless transmission facility <b>1980</b> is greater than that of wireless transmission facility <b>1990</b>. The expected received power may be determined continuously along the known distance (R<b>2</b>) about the transceiving system <b>1975</b> or may determined at designated angles about the transceiving system <b>1975</b> (e.g., every 10 degrees). Interpolation between two designated angles may be used to determine an expected received power at an intermediate point. At block <b>1930</b>, a signal is transmitted from the transceiving system within a general area, as represented by R<sub>2</sub>. The area may include wireless transmission facilities <b>1980</b>, <b>1985</b>, <b>1990</b>, capable of receiving the reference signal and wireless transmission facilities <b>1995</b> that may not be capable of receiving the reference signal. In one aspect, the signal may be transmitted in an omni-directional manner wherein the general area represents an area circling the transceiving system; assuming the system and corresponding antenna(s) are co-located. In another aspect of the invention, the signal may be transmitted in a directional manner wherein the general area represents a pie-shape area, <b>1997</b>, <b>1998</b>, having an apex at the transceiving system <b>1975</b> (a sector); assuming the antenna(s) and the system <b>1975</b> are co-located. The angular spread of the pie-shared area &#x3b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3b1;<sub>2 </sub>may be determined based on the directivity of the transmitting antenna. The signal transmitted by the transceiving system <b>1975</b> is transmitted with sufficient power to interfere with communications between the reference signal and wireless transmission facilities within an area in which wireless transmission facilities may receive the reference signal. The transmitted signal may be a continuous wave type signal (i.e., a jamming signal) or may be a discrete signal that commands the wireless transmission facilities to reestablish communication with the reference signal transmitter. At block <b>1940</b>, a simulated reference signal is transmitted by the transceiving system <b>1975</b>. The simulated reference signal is transmitted at a power level such that the received power of the simulated reference signal at the known distance (R<sub>2</sub>) from the transceiving system <b>1975</b> is greater than the received power of the reference signal. At block <b>1950</b>, signal(s) received by the transceiving system <b>1975</b> from wireless transmission facilities <b>1980</b>, <b>1985</b>, <b>1990</b>, <b>1995</b> in response to the interfering signal are analyzed and processed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In one aspect of the invention, a distance D<sub>1</sub>&#x2032;, D<sub>2</sub>&#x2032;, D<sub>3</sub>&#x2032;, to each of the wireless transmission facilities <b>1980</b>, <b>1985</b>, <b>1990</b>, respectively may be estimated base on a received power, at block <b>1960</b>. In another aspect of the invention, a direction of the wireless transmission facilities may be determined using, for example, directional antennas and/or an amplitude-based angle of arrival method. In one aspect of the invention, the signals received by the transceiving system <b>1975</b> may be analyzed to determine if they are allowed to send and/or receive communication as previously disclosed at block <b>1970</b>. As discussed previously, allowability may be determined based on a known set of wireless transmission facilities that are allowed within an area. All others are not allowed and, thus, communication is prohibited. If the signals are determined to be allowable, then control of the signal is &#x201c;handed-off&#x201d; to the reference signal transmitter <b>1972</b>. Otherwise, the received signals may be further processed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In one aspect of the invention, allowability of a wireless transmission facility may be determined based on a position of the wireless transmission facility with respect to the transceiving system <b>1972</b>. For example, if the wireless transmission facility is determined to be within a predetermined distance, R<sub>3</sub>, from the transceiving system <b>1975</b>, then communication to and from the wireless transmission facility may not be allowed, even though the transmission would normally be allowed. In one aspect, the area defined by R<sub>3 </sub>may be limited using directional information of the received signal associated with the wireless facility and the transceiving system <b>1975</b>. Thus, if the transceiving system <b>1975</b> is moving towards the wireless transmission facility, then communication may not be allowed, while communication may be allowed if the transceiving system <b>1975</b> is moving away from the wireless transmission facility, even though the wireless transmission facility is within the area defined by R<sub>3</sub>. In another aspect of the invention, transceiving system <b>1975</b> may attempt to determine other wireless transmission facilities within a region, R<sub>4</sub>, attempting to communicate with the not-allowed transmission facility.</p>

Thus, a minimum distance between base station <b>112</b> and device <b>152</b> is represented as R<b>1</b>, at an angle of zero degrees between base station <b>112</b> and device <b>152</b> and extends to a maximum distance of R<b>1</b>+2R<b>2</b>, at an angle of 180 degrees (see curve a).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">However, as the operating range of device <b>152</b> exceeds the operating range of base station <b>112</b> at 180 degrees, the distance may thus be represented as R<b>3</b> (see curve b).</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Thus, as the angle between base station <b>112</b> and device <b>152</b> increases, the distance between base station <b>112</b> and device <b>152</b>, at distance R<b>2</b> from device <b>152</b>, increases and becomes limited to a distance of R<b>3</b> for an angular period around 180 degrees.

<p id="p-0134" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref> illustrates an exemplary power received at the operating range R<b>2</b> of device <b>152</b>.

However, as the distance R<b>1</b>+2R<b>2</b> exceeds the operating range of base station <b>112</b>, the power at distance R<b>3</b> is limited to the power at the edge of the operating range of base station <b>112</b>. (see curve b). Thus, to capture any devices within the local area of device <b>152</b>, device <b>152</b> must transmit at a power between that received at R<b>1</b> and that received at R<b>3</b>.

In this case, each of the regions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>240</b> are represented as having a coverage area defined as R<b>3</b> with respect to corresponding base stations <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>232</b>, and <b>242</b>.

Devices <b>262</b> and <b>268</b> are well within the coverage region of base station <b>212</b>, while device <b>264</b> is within an overlapping zone between areas <b>210</b> and <b>230</b>.

In this illustrated example, the power of each base station is assumed to be substantially equal so that the coverage areas, represented by R<b>3</b>, are substantially the same. However, it would be recognized that the power of each base station may be altered to provide greater or lesser coverage areas. In this case, the power received at R<b>2</b> may be greater or lesser and is a function of the output transmission power and the distance (e.g., R<b>1</b>, R<b>4</b> and R<b>5</b>, respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In one aspect of the invention, the transceiving system <b>252</b> may select one of the base stations as a primary cell.

The transceiving system <b>252</b> may normalize the received power based on distance and transmission power of each of the base stations. In addition, the transceiving system <b>252</b> may normalize the location of each of the base stations with respect to the location of the base station of the primary cell.
