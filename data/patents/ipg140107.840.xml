<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Nano-films, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures are usually synthesized by different kinds of technologies, such as ultrasonic spray pyrolysis or hydrothermal synthesis. Generally, an ultrasonic spray pyrolysis apparatus is only used in the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis coating process, and an autoclave is only used in the hydrothermal synthesis process. However, when a nano-film needs to be synthesized by both the above-mentioned two processes, workpieces need to be moved from the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis apparatus to the autoclave. This is inconvenient and can cause the workpieces to be contaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it is desirable to provide a new coating device, which can overcome the above-mentioned limitations.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, a coating device <b>10</b>, according to an exemplary embodiment, includes an autoclave <b>100</b>, a spray member <b>200</b>, and an actuator <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The autoclave <b>100</b> includes an autoclave body <b>102</b> and a cover <b>104</b> covered on the top of the autoclave body <b>102</b>. The autoclave body <b>102</b> includes a bottom plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>and a first side plate <b>102</b><i>b </i>extending upwards from the periphery of bottom plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>. The bottom plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>defines a feeding opening <b>102</b><i>d</i>. The feeding opening <b>102</b><i>d </i>communicates with a solution source (not shown). The inner surface of the first side plate <b>102</b><i>b </i>defines a number of holding grooves <b>102</b><i>c </i>configured for fixing a number of substrates (not shown). The first side plate <b>102</b><i>b </i>is thermally conductively connected to a heat source (not shown), thereby gaining heat from the heat source to heat the substrates and the solution (not shown) in the autoclave <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The cover <b>104</b> includes a top plate <b>104</b><i>a </i>and a second side plate <b>104</b><i>b </i>extending upwards from the periphery of the top plate <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The top plate <b>104</b><i>a </i>defines a shaft hole <b>104</b><i>c </i>at the center thereof. The inner diameter of the cover <b>104</b> substantially equals to the outer diameter of the autoclave body <b>102</b>. When the cover <b>104</b> covers the autoclave body <b>102</b>, the cover <b>104</b> substantially seals the autoclave body <b>102</b>, thereby defining a coating cavity <b>106</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The spray member <b>200</b> includes a spray body <b>210</b>, four containers <b>220</b> positioned on the spray body <b>210</b>, four ultrasonic atomization units <b>230</b> received in the four containers <b>220</b>, and a fan unit <b>240</b> engaged with the spray body <b>210</b> and the containers <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The spray body <b>210</b> includes a first plate <b>212</b>, a second plate <b>214</b>, a third plate <b>216</b>, and a fourth plate <b>218</b>, each of which is cylindrical and stacked on its next plate in turn. The first plate <b>212</b> defines a first through hole <b>212</b><i>a </i>along the radial direction thereof. The first through hole <b>212</b><i>a </i>defines two first openings <b>212</b><i>b </i>on the two opposite sides of the first plate <b>212</b>. The second plate <b>214</b>, the third plate <b>216</b>, and the fourth plate <b>218</b> each define a through hole therein in a same way as the first though hole <b>212</b><i>a </i>of the first plate <b>212</b>, which are respectively indicated as a second through hole <b>214</b><i>a</i>, a third through hole <b>216</b><i>a</i>, and a fourth through hole <b>218</b><i>a</i>. Each of the second through hole <b>214</b><i>a</i>, the third through hole <b>216</b><i>a</i>, and the fourth through hole <b>218</b><i>a </i>defines two openings on two opposite sides of the corresponding plates, which are respectively indicated as a second opening <b>214</b><i>b</i>, a third opening <b>216</b><i>b</i>, and a fourth opening <b>218</b><i>b</i>. The first, second and third openings <b>212</b><i>b</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, <b>216</b><i>b </i>face an inner surface of the autoclave body <b>102</b>. The spray body <b>210</b> also defines a fifth through hole <b>219</b> spanning from the first plate <b>212</b> to the fourth plate <b>218</b> along the center axis thereof. The fifth through hole <b>219</b> communicates with the first through hole <b>212</b><i>a</i>, the second through hole <b>214</b><i>a</i>, the third through hole <b>216</b><i>a</i>, and the fourth through hole <b>218</b><i>a</i>. The fifth through hole <b>219</b> is threaded at a terminal portion close to the first plate <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The fan unit <b>240</b> includes a wind tube <b>242</b>, four fans <b>244</b>, and a supporting tube <b>246</b>. The wind tube <b>242</b> includes four cylindrical tubes <b>242</b><i>a </i>which are joined together and forms a cross portion. Each of the cylindrical tubes <b>242</b><i>a </i>has an air outlet <b>2423</b> at the distal end, communicating with each other. A first connecting threaded hole <b>242</b><i>b </i>and a second connecting threaded hole <b>242</b><i>c </i>are defined at the center of two opposite sides of the cross portion. Each of the cylindrical tubes <b>242</b><i>a </i>defines a third connecting threaded hole <b>242</b><i>d </i>facing the spray body <b>210</b>. The supporting tube <b>246</b> defines a pair of threaded portions at two ends thereof. Each fan <b>244</b> is positioned in the fan opening <b>2423</b>. Wind is pumped into the wind tube <b>242</b> by the fans <b>244</b> and flows out from the first connecting threaded hole <b>242</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The container <b>220</b> includes a box <b>222</b> and a connecting tube <b>224</b>. The box <b>222</b> defines a cavity <b>222</b><i>a </i>therein and a fourth connecting thread hole <b>222</b><i>b</i>. The fourth connecting thread hole <b>222</b><i>b </i>communicates the cavity <b>222</b><i>a </i>to the outside of the box <b>222</b>. Two ends of the connecting tube <b>224</b> are mated with the fourth connecting thread hole <b>222</b><i>b </i>and the third connecting thread hole <b>242</b><i>d</i>, to communicate the wind tube <b>242</b> with the container <b>220</b>. The ultrasonic atomization units <b>230</b> are used for atomizing the solution. Each of the ultrasonic atomization units <b>230</b> is positioned in a respective one of the cavities <b>222</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The actuator <b>300</b> includes a motor <b>302</b> and a shaft <b>304</b> engaged with and driven by the motor <b>302</b>. The shaft <b>304</b> has a threaded end mated with the second connecting thread hole <b>242</b><i>c</i>. The motor <b>302</b> is mounted on the center of the top plate <b>104</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>300</b>, with the shaft <b>304</b> extending into the autoclave <b>100</b>. The shaft <b>304</b> passes through the shaft hole <b>104</b><i>c </i>and screws into the second thread hole <b>242</b><i>c</i>. As such, the spray member <b>200</b> can be driven to rotate by the actuator <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In operation, the substrates are positioned in the holding grooves <b>102</b><i>c</i>. A solution, such as a solution made of Zn(acac)<sub>2 </sub>and methanol, is injected into each cavity <b>222</b><i>a </i>of the boxes <b>222</b> through the fourth connecting thread holes <b>222</b><i>b</i>. Then each of the connecting tubes <b>224</b> is screwed into the fourth connecting thread holes <b>222</b><i>b </i>and the third connecting thread hole <b>242</b><i>d</i>. Therefore, the containers <b>220</b> are fixed to the fan unit <b>240</b>. After that, the supporting tube <b>246</b> is screwed into the first connecting thread hole <b>242</b><i>b </i>and the fifth through hole <b>219</b>, so that the fan unit <b>240</b> is fixed to the spray body <b>210</b>. The shaft <b>304</b> is screwed into the second connecting thread hole <b>242</b><i>c</i>, so that the spray member <b>200</b> is fixed to the actuator <b>300</b>. Finally the cover <b>104</b> covers the autoclave body <b>102</b>. As such, the spray member <b>200</b> is received in the coating cavity <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The ultrasonic atomization unit <b>230</b> emits an ultrasonic, with a frequency ranging from 2.4 kHz to 15 kHz for example, which atomizes the solution. The atomized solution flows into the wind tube <b>242</b> through the connecting tube <b>224</b>. Meanwhile, the fans <b>244</b> pump wind into the wind tube <b>242</b>. As such, the atomized solution is blown into the coating cavity <b>106</b> from those openings or holes <b>219</b>, <b>212</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>b</i>, <b>214</b><i>a</i>, <b>214</b><i>b</i>, <b>216</b><i>a</i>, <b>216</b><i>b</i>, <b>218</b><i>a </i>and <b>218</b><i>b</i>. The actuator <b>300</b> rotates the spray member <b>200</b>, so that the atomized solution evenly deposits on the surfaces of the substrates. The heat source heats the first side plate <b>102</b><i>b </i>evenly at very beginning to heat the substrates up to a working temperature, for example about 350 degrees centigrade. In this situation, the atomized solution disposes on the surfaces of the substrates to form a first film thereon. It is known that film formed by spray pyrolysis coating method is relatively more uniform than film formed by hydrothermal coating method, therefore, the first film could be used as a base for forming a second film.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After the first film is formed, the spray member <b>200</b> and the actuator <b>300</b> stop working. A solution, such as solution made of Zn(acac)<sub>2 </sub>and methanol is injected into the autoclave <b>100</b> from the solution source through the feeding opening <b>102</b><i>d</i>. The heat source just heats one side of the first side plate <b>102</b><i>b</i>, so that the solution is heated up to a working temperature, for example about 95 degrees centigrade. As just one side of the first side plate <b>102</b><i>b </i>is heated, the temperature of the solution near this side would raise faster than the solution at the other side that is opposite to the side being heated. Therefore, a temperature difference occurs between two opposite sides of the solution, which induces convection in the solution. During the convection, the solution is supersaturated, and the solute crystallizes out from the solution and accretes on the first film/seed to grow a second film that is desired, such as ZnO nanostructures.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When using the coating device <b>10</b> disclosed in the present embodiment, substrates can be coated by spray pyrolysis coating method and hydrothermal coating method. As such, transferring of substrates between different coating devices is avoided. Therefore, contamination has little chance to enter into the processing chamber to pollute the substrates, thereby improving the coating quality. Meanwhile, as the first film is relatively uniform and can be used as a base, the second film formed based on the first film will be more uniform compared to a film formed without the first film.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The container <b>220</b> is configured for forming a cavity <b>222</b><i>a </i>communicating with the first opening <b>212</b><i>b</i>, the second opening <b>214</b><i>b</i>, the third opening <b>216</b><i>b</i>, and the fourth opening <b>218</b><i>b</i>, which allows the atomized solution to flow onto the surfaces of substrates. It should be understood that the containers <b>220</b> are not limited to this embodiment. In alternative embodiments, different configurations and numbers of container may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The actuator <b>300</b> is configured for rotating the spray member <b>200</b>, so that the atomized solution can be sprayed on a number of substrates positioned around the coating cavity <b>106</b>.
