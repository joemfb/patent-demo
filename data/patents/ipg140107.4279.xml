<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A memory includes a first word line which is connected to a control gate electrode of a first memory cell, a second word line which is connected to a control gate electrode of a second memory cell, a potential transfer line which is connected to both of the first and second word lines, a first N-channel MOS transistor which is connected between the first word line and the potential transfer line, and a second N-channel MOS transistor which is connected between the second word line and the potential transfer line. A control circuit supplies a first potential with a plus value to a semiconductor substrate, and supplies a second potential with the plus value lower than the first potential to the potential transfer line, to turn the first N-channel MOS transistor on, and to turn the second N-channel MOS transistor off, in erasing data of the first memory cell.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A nonvolatile semiconductor memory, such as a NAND type flash memory, in which data of two levels or more is stored by a charge amount in a charge storage layer, has three basic operations of programming, reading, and erasing. The programming means an operation for injecting electrons into the charge storage layer, and the erasing means an operation for emitting electrons from the charge storage layer or injecting holes into the charge storage layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the nonvolatile semiconductor memory, a memory cell array includes memory blocks (for example, NAND blocks), and units of memory block is erased at one time (for example, see Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication Nos. 2-196469 and 2007-281267).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">During data erasing, in the selected memory block, channel portions of all the memory cells are set to an erasing potential (high positive potential) and all word lines (control gate electrodes of memory cells) are set to a ground potential.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, in all the memory cells of the selected memory block, electrons are emitted from the charge storage layer to the channel portion, or holes are injected from the channel portion into the charge storage layer, thereby performing the data erasing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the non-selected memory block, potentials at all the word lines are boosted to a boost potential (a positive high potential lower than the erasing potential) by capacitive coupling, because all the word lines are set to floating while the channel portions of all the memory cells are set to the erasing potential.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the data stored in any memory cells of the non-selected memory block is not erased.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Transfer transistor blocks are provided according to the memory blocks. Each transfer transistor block includes high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistors having the same number as the word lines in one block. In the high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistors, one end of a diffusion layer is connected to word lines in one block, and the other end of the diffusion layer is connected to potential transfer lines (control gate lines). And one of the high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistors in each of the transfer transistor blocks have the potential transfer lines in common.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">During the erasing, the ground potential is applied to the potential transfer line, the high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistor in the transfer transistor block corresponding to the selected memory block is turned on, and the high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistor in the transfer transistor block corresponding to the non-selected memory block is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, in the high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistor in the transfer transistor block corresponding to the non-selected memory block, the ground potential is applied to a source (potential transfer line side), and the boost potential is applied to a drain (word line side).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">At this state, a minutely small amount of punch-through leakage is produced between the source diffusion layer and the drain diffusion layer in the high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistor in the transfer transistor block corresponding to the non-selected memory block, which causes electrons to be trapped in a gate insulating film of the high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistor or in an interface between the semiconductor substrate and the source/drain diffusion layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, when the number of erasing times is increased to apply a voltage stress for a long time between the source diffusion layer and the drain diffusion layer of the high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistor in a cut-off state, the number of trapped electrons is increased to degrade reliability, such as reduction of high-potential transfer characteristics and programming/erasing error.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A semiconductor memory of an aspect of the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">1. Outline</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a nonvolatile semiconductor memory according to an embodiment of the present invention, electrons are emitted from the charge storage layer to the channel portion, or holes are injected from the channel portion into the charge storage layer, thereby performing the data erasing.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the nonvolatile semiconductor memory, a first word line and a second word line are commonly connected to a potential transfer line via a first N-channel MOS transistor and a second N-channel MOS transistor. The first word line is connected to a first memory cell as a data erasing target, and the second word line is connected to a second memory cell not as the data erasing target.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first N-channel MOS transistor whose diffusion layer is connected to the first word line and the potential transfer line is turned on, and the second N-channel MOS transistor whose diffusion layer is connected to the second word line and potential transfer line is turned off, thereby the data of the first memory cell among the first and second memory cells is only erased.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment of the present invention, during the data erasing the first memory cell, a positive first potential is applied to a semiconductor substrate, and a positive second potential that is lower than the first potential is applied to the potential transfer line, whereby the improvement of the reliability is achieved by suppressing the electron trap in the gate insulating film of the second N-channel MOS transistor or in the interface of the semiconductor substrate and the source/drain diffusion layer.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">During the data erasing the first memory cell, the positive first potential is applied to the semiconductor substrate, the ground potential is applied to the potential transfer line, and the negative second potential is applied to a gate electrode of the second N-channel MOS transistor, whereby the improvement of the reliability is achieved by suppressing the electron trap in the gate insulating film of the second N-channel MOS transistor or in the interface of the semiconductor substrate and the source/drain diffusion layer.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At this point, the semiconductor substrate includes a well region. For example, the embodiment of the present invention is aimed at both a high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistor formed on a P-type semiconductor substrate and a high-potential transfer N-channel MOS transistor formed on a P-type well region.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Materials for the gate electrode and gate insulating film are not limited in the MOS transistor. Usually the gate electrode is made of conductive polysilicon, and the gate insulating film is made of oxide silicon. However, the materials for the gate electrode and gate insulating film are not limited to the conductive polysilicon and the oxide silicon.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">2. Difference between Present Invention and Conventional Technique</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">There is well known a technique of applying a back gate bias to prevent the punch-through leakage during cut-off of the MOS transistor (for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication Nos. 2-196469 and 2007-281267).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The embodiment of the present invention proposes a technique of preventing the punch-through leakage more easily than the back gate bias during the cut-off. That is, the back gate bias is applied to the MOS transistors by which the semiconductor substrate or the well is shared, and thresholds of the MOS transistor increase.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A word line driver of a nonvolatile semiconductor memory has a circuit characteristic in which a source of a high-breakdown-voltage type MOS transistor connected to the memory cell as the data erasing target and a source of a high-breakdown-voltage type MOS transistor connected to the memory cell not as the data erasing target. And both of the high-breakdown-voltage type MOS transistors are connected to a common potential transfer line.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The embodiment of the present invention is an extremely effective technique in which the punch-through leakage is prevented instead of the back gate bias during the cut-off of the MOS transistor by utilizing the circuit characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">However, obviously the embodiment of the present invention may be used while combined with the back gate bias.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">(1) Overall View</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an overall view showing a NAND type flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Memory cell array <b>11</b> includes blocks BK<b>1</b>, BK<b>2</b>, . . . , and BKj. Each of blocks BK<b>1</b>, BK<b>2</b>, . . . , and BKj includes cell units, and each of the cell units includes a NAND string and two select gate transistors. The NAND string includes series-connected memory cells (memory cell transistors). The select gate transistors are connected to both ends of the NAND string, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Data latch circuit <b>12</b> has a function of tentatively latching data during the programming/writing. For example, data latch circuit <b>12</b> includes a flip-flop circuit. Input/Output (I/O) buffer <b>13</b> acts as a data interface circuit, address buffer <b>14</b> acts as an address signal interface circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An address signal includes a block address signal, a row address signal, and a column address signal.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Row decoder <b>15</b> selects one of blocks BK<b>1</b>, BK<b>2</b>, . . . , and BKj based on the block address signal, and row decoder <b>15</b> selects one of the word lines in the selected block based on the row address signal. Word line driver <b>17</b> drives the word lines in the selected block.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Column decoder <b>16</b> selects one of the bit lines based on the column address signal.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Substrate potential control circuit <b>18</b> controls a potential at a semiconductor substrate. Specifically, a double well region including an N-type well region and a P-type well region is formed in a P-type semiconductor substrate. When the memory cell is formed in the P-type well region, the potential at the P-type well region is controlled according to an operation mode.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the potential of the P-type well region is set to zero during the programming/writing, and to 15 V to 40 V during the erasing.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Potential generating circuit <b>19</b> generates a potential used to control word line driver <b>17</b> and a transfer potential transferred to the word lines of memory cell array <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Transfer potential selector <b>24</b> selects the transfer potential supplied to each of the word lines of memory cell array <b>11</b> based on the operation mode and a position of the selected word line, and supplies the transfer potential to the word lines through word line driver <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, during the data programming, a programming potential is supplied to the selected word line of the selected block, and a potential that is lower than the programming potential is supplied to the non-selected word line of the selected block. During the data reading, a reading potential is supplied to the selected word line of the selected block according to the data in the cell, and a potential is supplied to the non-selected word line of the selected block to turn on the cell transistor irrespective of the data in the cell. During the data erasing, for example, the ground potential (0 V) is supplied to all the word lines of the selected block.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Control circuit <b>20</b> controls operations of peripheral circuits such as data latch circuit <b>12</b>, I/O buffer <b>13</b>, address buffer <b>14</b>, row decoder <b>15</b>, word line driver <b>17</b>, substrate potential control circuit <b>18</b>, potential generating circuit <b>19</b>, and transfer potential selector <b>24</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The potential relationship of the first embodiment differs from that of the conventional technique in that potential Vs (=Vadd) at source S is larger than potential Vg (=0 V) at gate G.

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Then, for example, the voltage of 0 V is applied to the gate electrodes of N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>12</b> to Trn<b>2</b> such that output potentials at boosters <b>22</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . corresponding to all NAND blocks BK<b>2</b>, . . . except for NAND block BK<b>1</b> that becomes the data erasing target are changed from boost potential Vboost to the ground potential (0 V) to turn N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>12</b> to Trn<b>2</b> of transfer transistor units <b>21</b> (BK<b>2</b>), . . . off.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">At this point, word lines WL<b>1</b>, WL<b>2</b>, WL(n&#x2212;1), and WLn of NAND block BK<b>1</b> that becomes the data erasing target are fixed to the ground potential, and word lines WL<b>1</b>, WL<b>2</b>, WL(n&#x2212;1), and WLn of remaining NAND blocks BK<b>2</b>, . . . that do not become the data erasing target become a floating state at the ground potential.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">On the other hand, because potential transfer lines CG<b>1</b>, CG<b>2</b>, . . . , CG(n&#x2212;1), and CGn are connected to the sources of N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>11</b> to Trn<b>2</b> of transfer transistor units <b>21</b> (BK<b>1</b>) and <b>21</b> (BK<b>2</b>), the sources and drains of N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>11</b> to Trn<b>2</b> become 0 V.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">At this point, the potential at P-type well region <b>25</b><i>c </i>in which NAND blocks BK<b>1</b>, BK<b>2</b>, . . . are formed is the ground potential. That is, the ground potential (0 V) is applied to well contact (P<sup>+</sup>-type contact layer) <b>30</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, transfer potential selector <b>24</b> supplies positive potential (for example, 0.5 V) Vadd to potential transfer lines CG<b>1</b>, CG<b>2</b>, . . . , CG(n&#x2212;1), and CGn.

<p id="p-0164" num="0163">On the other hand, because potential transfer lines CG<b>1</b>, CG<b>2</b>, . . . , CG(n&#x2212;1), and CGn are also connected to the source of transfer transistor unit <b>21</b> (BK<b>2</b>), the source potentials at N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>12</b> to Trn<b>2</b> become positive potential Vadd. Because N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>12</b> to Trn<b>2</b> are in the off state, the drain potentials at N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>12</b> to Trn<b>2</b> are kept at 0 V.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Because boosters <b>22</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . of word line drivers <b>17</b>(DRV<b>2</b>), . . . corresponding to NAND blocks BK<b>2</b>, . . . that do not become the data erasing target supply negative potential (for example, &#x2212;1 V) &#x2212;Vne, negative potential &#x2212;Vne is applied to the gates of the N-channel MOS transistors of transfer transistor units <b>2</b>-<b>1</b>(BK<b>2</b>), . . . .</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Then the potential at the P-type well region in which NAND blocks BK<b>1</b>, BK<b>2</b>, . . . are formed is raised from the ground potential to positive high potential (Vera+Vadd) through well contact (P<sup>+</sup>-type contact layer) <b>30</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">At this point, Vera is a potential of 15 V to 40 V (for example, about 24 V), which is necessary for the data erasing. Vadd is identical to positive potential Vadd applied to potential transfer lines CG<b>1</b>, CG<b>2</b>, . . . , CG(n&#x2212;1), and CGn. Vera can be obtained by subtracting source potential (Vadd) at the N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>11</b> to Trn<b>2</b> from potential (Vera+Vadd) at P-type well region <b>25</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In memory cell MC of NAND block BK<b>1</b>, because word lines WL<b>1</b>, WL<b>2</b>, WL(n&#x2212;1), and WLn become Vadd while the channel portion (P-type well region <b>25</b><i>c</i>) becomes (Vera+Vadd), electrons are emitted from the charge storage layer to the channel portion, or holes are injected from the channel portion into the charge storage layer, thereby performing the data erasing.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">On the other hand, in memory cells MC of NAND blocks BK<b>2</b>, . . . , when the P-type well region is raised from the ground potential to positive high potential (Vera+Vadd), word lines WL<b>1</b>, WL<b>2</b>, WL(n&#x2212;1), . . . , and WLn in the floating state are raised from the ground potential to about (Vera+Vadd) by the capacitive coupling.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Accordingly, the data erasing is not performed to memory cells MC of NAND blocks BK<b>2</b>, . . . .</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">During the data erasing, positive potential Vadd is applied to the sources of the N-channel MOS transistors in the cut-off state in transfer transistor units <b>21</b> (BK<b>2</b>), . . . of word line drivers <b>17</b> (DRV<b>2</b>), . . . , the high potential of about (Vera+Vadd) is applied to the drain of the N-channel MOS transistors, and negative potential &#x2212;Vne is applied to the gate of the N-channel MOS transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a potential relationship among N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>12</b> to Trn<b>2</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a potential relationship among N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>11</b> to Trn<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, potential Vg at gate G is set to &#x2212;Vne, well potential Vwell is set to 0 V, potential Vs at source S is set to Vadd, and potential Vd at drain D is set to about (Vera+Vadd).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In the potential relationship of the third embodiment, as with the first and second embodiments, because potential Vs (=Vadd) at source S is larger than potential Vg (=&#x2212;Vne) at gate G, leakage current (electrons flow inverse direction) Ileak from drain D to source S is reduced, and electrons are not trapped in the gate insulating film or the interface state.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Therefore, compared with the first and second embodiments, the reliability of the N-channel MOS transistor can further be improved in the transfer transistor unit. As with the first and second embodiments, because the potential is not applied to the well of the N-channel MOS transistor, it is not necessary to consider threshold fluctuations of other N-channel transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, potential Vg at gate G is set to power-supply voltage (Vdd), well potential Vwell is set to 0 V, potential Vs at source S is set to Vadd, and potential Vd at drain D is set to about Vadd.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Vadd is transferred from source to the drain because N-channel MOS transistors Tr<b>11</b> to Trn<b>1</b> are in the on state, and therefore the electric field between the charge storage layer and the P-type well region is increased in memory cell MC of NAND block BK<b>1</b>. That is, the voltage of Vera applied between the control gate electrode and channel portion of memory cell MC is not changed by setting channel portion (P-type well region) to (Vera+Vadd). Therefore, the data erasing can be performed without problems.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">As described above, positive potential Vadd is applied to potential transfer lines CG<b>1</b>, CG<b>2</b>, . . . , CG(n&#x2212;1), and CGn, and negative potential &#x2212;Vne is applied to the gate of the N-channel MOS transistor in the cut-off state, thereby preventing the leakage current generated in the N-channel MOS transistor in the cut-off state.</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows an index concerning the reliability of the N-channel MOS transistor in the transfer transistor unit.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">A stress time of a horizontal axis expresses a time which voltage Vera is applied between the source and drain of the N-channel MOS transistor in the cut-off state, and the stress time is substantially proportional to the number of erasing times.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">&#x394;Ion/Ion(ini) of a vertical axis expresses transfer ability of the N-channel MOS transistor, Ion(ini) is an on current in an initial state, and &#x394;Ion is an amount of on-current change with respect to the initial state (Ion(ini)&#x2212;Ion). Ion is gradually decreased with increasing stress time.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The embodiment corresponds to the potential relationship of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and the comparative example corresponds to the potential relationship of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In the embodiment, compared with the comparative example, even if the stress time is increased, the on-current change ratio &#x394;Ion/Ion can be suppressed to a small level. The same effect is obtained even in the potential relationships of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">For example, assuming that a lifetime of the N-channel MOS transistor expires when the on-current change ratio &#x394;Ion/Ion exceeds 10%, the lifetime of the N-channel MOS transistor of this embodiment becomes about 20 times the lifetime of the N-channel MOS transistor of the comparative example.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Accordingly, in the embodiment of the present invention, the reliability of the N-channel MOS transistor can be improved in transferring the high potential to the word line.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">(5) Others</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In the potential relationship during the data erasing in the first and third embodiments, preferably positive potential Vadd is set in the range of 0 V&#x3c;Vadd&#x2266;1 V.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">It is thought that the reliability of the N-channel transistor in the transfer transistor unit is effectively secured as positive potential Vadd is increased. However, when positive potential Vadd is increased, the value (Vera+Vadd) applied to the channel portion during the data erasing is also increased.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Accordingly, when the Vera has the value of 15 V to 40 V, it is realistically thought that an upper limit of positive potential Vadd is set to 1 V from the relationship of diffusion layer-well breakdown voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In the potential relationship during the data erasing in the second embodiment, preferably negative potential &#x2212;Vne is set in the range of &#x2212;1 V&#x2266;&#x2212;Vne&#x3c;0 V.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">It is thought that the reliability of the N-channel transistor in the transfer transistor unit is effectively secured as negative potential &#x2212;Vne is decreased.

<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Accordingly, it is realistically thought that a lower limit of negative potential &#x2212;Vne is set to &#x2212;1 V.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">4. Application Examples</heading>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The embodiments of the present invention can be applied to the NAND type flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">There is no particular limitation to the memory cell structure of the NAND type flash memory. For example, the embodiments of the present invention can be applied to a fin memory cell and a three-dimensional memory cell (so called BiCS structure).</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">The characteristic of the high-breakdown-voltage type N-channel MOS transistor is easily affected by the fixed charge arising from the material. For example, when an insulating film containing carbon (C) is used as an element separation material, the carbon element becomes the positive fixed charge to increase the off-leakage current.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Because the embodiments of the present invention relate to the technique of suppressing the off-leakage current, the embodiments of the present invention are effectively applied in such situations.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">Recently, a so-called MONOS memory cell in which the charge storage layer is formed by an insulating film made of nitride silicon and a structure in which a so-called high-k material having a high dielectric constant is disposed between the charge storage layer and the control gate electrode are proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">When the embodiments of the present invention are applied to the NAND type flash memory having the new structure and material, the characteristic of the high-breakdown-voltage type N-channel MOS transistor is effectively improved.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In the MONOS memory cell, because trapped electrons are hardly drawn from the charge storage layer during the data erasing, holes are injected from the channel portion into the charge storage layer to neutralize electrons trapped in the charge storage layer, thereby performing the data erasing.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">However, there is generated a problem in that the time necessary for the data erasing is lengthened. That is, the MONOS memory cell has the feature that the data erasing time is longer than that of the floating gate type memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In the embodiments of the present invention, the reliability of the high-breakdown-voltage type N-channel MOS transistor is not degraded even if the data erasing time is lengthened. Therefore, the embodiments of the present invention are effectively applied to the MONOS memory cell.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">5. Conclusion</heading>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">Accordingly, the reliability of the N-channel MOS transistor can be improved in transferring the high potential to the word line.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the present invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein.
