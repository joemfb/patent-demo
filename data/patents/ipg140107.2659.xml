<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) devices may be used in various applications such as micro-phones, accelerometers, inkjet printers, etc. A commonly used type of MEMS devices utilizes a movable element (sometimes referred to as a proof mass) as a capacitor plate, and a fixed element as the other capacitor plate. The movement of the movable element causes the change in the capacitance of the capacitor. The change in the capacitance may be converted into the change in an electrical signal, and hence the MEMS device may be used as a microphone, an accelerometer, or the like. The movement of the movable element may also be used for squeezing the ink in an inkjet printer.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">For most applications, MEMS devices are electrically connected to Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to form a complete system. The connections may be made through wire bonding, which requires extra chip areas. The connections may also be made through the substrate, wherein portions of the conductive substrate may be isolated by dielectric materials to form the connections. Complicate process steps are involved in the formation of the dielectric materials that insolate the substrate portions.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The making and using of the embodiments of the disclosure are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the embodiments provide many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative, and do not limit the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) device and the method of forming the same are provided in accordance with various embodiments. The intermediate stages of forming the MEMS device are illustrated. The variations and the operation of the embodiments are discussed. Throughout the various views and illustrative embodiments, like reference numbers are used to designate like elements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 16</figref> illustrate cross-sectional views and top views of the intermediate stages in the formation of MEMS devices in accordance with various exemplary embodiments. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, substrate <b>20</b>, which is conductive, is provided. Substrate <b>20</b> may comprise a semiconductor material such as silicon, although other semiconductor materials may be used. When formed of a semiconductor material, substrate <b>20</b> may be heavily doped with a p-type or an n-type impurity, for example, to an impurity concentration higher than about 10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. Accordingly, substrate <b>20</b> has a low resistivity, and may be used for the electrical connection purpose. Dielectric layer <b>22</b> is formed on the top surface of substrate <b>20</b>. In an embodiment, dielectric layer <b>22</b> comprises silicon oxide, which may be formed by thermally oxidizing a surface layer of substrate <b>20</b>. Accordingly, throughout the description, dielectric layer <b>22</b> is alternatively referred to as oxide layer <b>22</b>, although different dielectric materials may be used to form dielectric layer <b>22</b>. The thickness of dielectric layer <b>22</b> may be greater than about 1 &#x3bc;m, or between about 1 &#x3bc;m and about 5 &#x3bc;m. It is realized, however, that the dimensions recited throughout the description are merely examples, and may be changed to different values.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Low-stress nitride layer <b>24</b> may be deposited on dielectric layer <b>22</b>. The thickness of low-stress nitride layer <b>24</b> may between about 1 k&#x212b; and about 10 k&#x212b;, for example. The deposition methods include Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) methods such as Low-Pressure CVD (LPCVD).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, conductive layer <b>26</b> is deposited, and is then patterned. In some embodiments, conductive layer <b>26</b> comprises polysilicon, although other conductive materials such as metals (for example, aluminum copper), may be used. The polysilicon in conductive layer <b>26</b> may be doped with a p-type or an n-type impurity to increase its conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the deposition and the patterning of sacrificial layer <b>28</b>, which is formed over conductive layer <b>26</b>. The pattern of sacrificial layer <b>28</b> is designed to fit the patterns of the components of the subsequently formed MEMS device <b>40</b> (please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The thickness of sacrificial layer <b>28</b> may be between about 0.2 k&#x212b; and about 100 k&#x212b;, for example. The material of sacrificial layer <b>28</b> may be selected so that there is a high etching selectivity between sacrificial layer <b>28</b> and conductive layer <b>26</b>. Accordingly, in subsequent steps, sacrificial layer <b>28</b> may be etched without the substantial etching of conductive layer <b>26</b>. Furthermore, there is a high etching selectivity between sacrificial layer <b>28</b> and low-stress nitride layer <b>24</b>. In an embodiment, sacrificial layer <b>28</b> comprises silicon oxide. The patterned sacrificial layer <b>28</b> may cover edge portions of the patterned conductive layer <b>26</b>, while some middle portions of the patterned conductive layer <b>26</b> are exposed through openings <b>30</b> in sacrificial layer <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, contact via openings <b>32</b> are formed by etching through some of the exposed portions of conductive layer <b>26</b>. In the meantime, some exposed portions of conductive layer <b>26</b> may, or may not, be left un-etched. Low-stress nitride layer <b>24</b> and dielectric layer <b>22</b> are also etched. Accordingly, contact via openings <b>32</b> further extend into low-stress nitride layer <b>24</b> and dielectric layer <b>22</b>. Substrate <b>20</b> is thus exposed through contact via openings <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the deposition and the patterning of a conductive material, so that conductive patterns <b>34</b> (including <b>34</b>A, <b>34</b>B, <b>34</b>C, and <b>34</b>D) are formed. The conductive material is filled into contact via openings <b>32</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to form contact plugs <b>36</b>, which electrically couple conductive patterns <b>34</b> to substrate <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the conductive material comprises polysilicon. Thickness T<b>1</b> of the portions of conductive patterns <b>34</b> may be greater than about 1 &#x3bc;m, and may be between about 1 &#x3bc;m and about 5 &#x3bc;m, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, portions of sacrificial layer <b>28</b> and low-stress nitride layer <b>24</b> are removed to define fusion bonding area <b>38</b>. In fusion bonding area <b>38</b>, the top surface of oxide layer <b>22</b> is exposed. The exposed portions of oxide layer <b>22</b> may form a ring in a top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, wherein the ring encircles conductive patterns <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the removal of sacrificial layer <b>28</b>. In an embodiment, sacrificial layer <b>28</b> is formed of silicon oxide, and hence may be etched using vapor HF. Alternatively, a HF solution is used to etch sacrificial layer <b>28</b>, followed by a drying process. Dielectric layer <b>22</b>, which may also be formed of silicon oxide, is also etched. As a result, in the fusion bonding area <b>38</b>, the exposed portions of dielectric layer <b>22</b> are removed. Low-stress nitride layer <b>24</b> may protect some portions of dielectric <b>22</b> from being etched. In some embodiments, conductive patterns <b>34</b>D may form a full ring, so that the portion of dielectric layer <b>22</b> encircled by ring <b>34</b>D is protected from being etched. After the removal of sacrificial layer <b>28</b>, conductive pattern <b>34</b>A may be spaced apart from the underlying portion <b>26</b>A of conductive layer <b>26</b>. Accordingly, conductive pattern <b>34</b>A and portion <b>26</b>A of conductive layer <b>26</b> form two capacitor plates of a capacitor, which is a part of MEMS device <b>40</b>. In addition, the capacitance between conductive patterns <b>34</b>A and <b>34</b>C may also form a capacitor of MEMS device. Due to the existence of the space between conductive pattern <b>34</b>A and portion <b>26</b>A of conductive layer <b>26</b>, conductive pattern <b>34</b>A is movable. Conductive pattern <b>34</b>A is alternatively referred to as a proof mass or a movable element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 10</figref> illustrate the process for preparing a cap. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, cap wafer <b>44</b> is provided. Cap wafer <b>44</b> may be a silicon wafer, for example. Alignment marks <b>46</b> may be formed on the bottom side of cap wafer <b>44</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a Deep Reactive-Ion Etching (DRIE) process is performed to form recess <b>48</b> in cap wafer <b>44</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, dielectric layers <b>50</b> may be formed on the top surface and the bottom surface of cap wafer <b>44</b>. Dielectric layer <b>50</b> that is formed on the top surface of cap wafer <b>44</b> may extend into recess <b>48</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, dielectric layers <b>50</b> may be thermal oxide layers formed by performing a thermal oxidation on cap wafer <b>44</b>. Accordingly, dielectric layers <b>50</b> are referred to as oxide layers <b>50</b> hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, cap wafer <b>44</b> is bonded to the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. MEMS device <b>40</b> is thus covered by cap wafer <b>44</b>, and may extend into recess <b>48</b> of cap wafer <b>44</b>. Portions of oxide layer <b>50</b> are bonded to the top surface of substrate <b>20</b>. The portions of oxide layer <b>50</b> that are bonded to substrate <b>20</b> may form a close-loop ring in the top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The bonding may be a fusion bonding, wherein according to some exemplary embodiments, the temperatures of cap wafer <b>44</b> and substrate <b>20</b> are kept at room temperature, and a pressure is applied to press cap wafer <b>44</b> against substrate <b>20</b>. The bonded wafer is then subject to a high temperature annealing. As a result of the high temperature and/or the pressure, oxide layer <b>50</b> forms bonds with substrate <b>20</b>. The fusion bonding may be performed in a vacuum environment. Accordingly, during the bonding process, the space (recess <b>48</b>) inside cap wafer <b>44</b> is vacuumed, which vacuum may be maintained after the structure as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is taken out of the vacuum environment.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is flipped upside down, and a backside grinding is performed on the back surface of substrate <b>20</b>. The backside grinding is performed until thickness T<b>2</b> of substrate <b>20</b> is smaller than a pre-determined thickness, for example, less than about 200 &#x3bc;m, or less than about 150 &#x3bc;m. An etch step is then performed to etch through substrate <b>20</b> to form through-openings <b>52</b>. The etch step may be performed using DRIE, for example. Through-openings <b>52</b> may physically and electrically isolate some portions of substrate <b>20</b> from other portions. For example, in the illustrative <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, substrate portions <b>20</b>A, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C may be disconnected from each other, and disconnected from other portions of substrate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates the filling of through-openings <b>52</b> with dielectric material <b>54</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, dielectric material <b>54</b> also covers the back surface of substrate <b>20</b>. Dielectric material <b>54</b> may comprise a polymer such as an epoxy in some embodiments. Furthermore, dielectric material <b>54</b> may comprise a photosensitive material such as a photosensitive epoxy. In an embodiment, the photosensitive epoxy comprises SU8, which is a negative photosensitive epoxy. In alternative embodiments, dielectric material <b>54</b> may comprise bisbenzocyclobutene (BCB). Dielectric material <b>54</b> may be filled into through-openings <b>52</b> through spin-coating, and may then be cured, for example, using a thermal curing process, an Ultra-Violet (UV) curing process, or the like. Alternatively, dielectric material <b>54</b> may comprise a dry film, which is laminated on the top surface of substrate <b>20</b> and extends into through-openings <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Through-openings <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) may be filled in a single filling step such as spin-on coating. The portions of dielectric material <b>54</b> in substrate <b>20</b> may be a homogenous material that does not comprise multiple regions formed of different materials. Rather, entireties of through-openings <b>52</b> are filled with a single homogenous material.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Dielectric material <b>54</b> (such as BCB and SU8) may also be a low-temperature material that cannot endure (and will be damaged by) high temperatures higher than about 150&#xb0; C. Since dielectric material <b>54</b> is filled after the formation of layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>34</b>, the high temperature (which may be higher than about 550&#xb0; C.) used in the formation of layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and/or <b>34</b> will not cause the damage to dielectric material <b>54</b>. Accordingly, the low-temperature material may be used to replace silicon oxide and silicon nitride for filling through-openings <b>52</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, and through-openings <b>52</b> may be filled easier than using CVD methods.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, the portions of dielectric material <b>54</b> that are on the top surface of substrate <b>20</b> are patterned. Since dielectric material <b>54</b> may be photosensitive, the patterning does not require additional photoresists. Substrate portions <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C of substrate <b>20</b> are thus exposed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> illustrates a top view of substrate <b>20</b>, wherein the cross-sectional view is obtained from the plane crossing line <b>14</b>B-<b>14</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, dielectric material <b>54</b> may form rings encircling substrate portion <b>20</b>B and substrate portion <b>20</b>C. Substrate portions <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C are insulated from each other by dielectric material <b>54</b>. Furthermore, substrate portions <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C are insulated from portions of substrate <b>20</b> that are outside of the rings. It is appreciated that although the top-view shapes of substrate portions <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C are rectangles, substrate portions <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C may also have other top-view shapes such as circles, hexagons, octagons, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, electrical connections <b>56</b> are formed on the backside of substrate <b>20</b> and over dielectric material <b>54</b>. Electrical connections may further extend into dielectric material <b>54</b> to electrically connect to substrate portions <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C. In some embodiments, electrical connections <b>56</b> comprise metal traces, which may be formed of copper, aluminum copper, or the like. Electrical connections <b>56</b> may also comprise solder balls, metal pillars, solder caps formed on metal pillars, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a package comprising MEMS device <b>40</b>, substrate <b>20</b>, cap wafer <b>44</b>, and package component <b>60</b>. It is noted that the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is merely an example for illustrating the package including MEMS device <b>40</b>. There are various methods and structures for packaging MEMS device <b>40</b>. In this example, electrical connections <b>56</b> are bonded to, and electrically coupled to, package component <b>60</b>, which may be a device die comprising transistors (not shown) therein, an interposer, a package substrate, a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, electrical connections <b>56</b> are electrically coupled to the capacitor plates of MEMS device <b>40</b> through substrate portions <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C. Substrate portions <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C thus act as electrical connections that penetrate through substrate <b>20</b>. It is observed that substrate portions <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C are electrically insulated from each other, and are electrically insulated from other portions of substrate <b>20</b> by dielectric material <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the embodiments, via-last approaches are used to form connections <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that penetrate through substrate <b>20</b>, wherein the via-last approaches means that dielectric material <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>) are formed after the formation of MEMS device <b>40</b>. Accordingly, the filling of the through-openings in substrate <b>20</b> with the dielectric material is performed after the high-temperature processes, such as the formation processes of layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 7</figref>). As a result, low-temperature materials may be used to fill into substrate <b>20</b> in order to insulate connections <b>20</b>B and <b>20</b>C. The low-temperature materials will not be damaged since the high-temperature processes have already been finished. The low-temperature materials may easily fill deep and wide through-openings in the substrate <b>20</b>. Therefore, in the embodiments, there is no need to use CVD methods to fill the openings in substrate <b>20</b>. The throughput is increased since the filling rate of the low-temperature materials in substrate <b>20</b> is significantly higher than the rate of filling using CVD methods.</p>
