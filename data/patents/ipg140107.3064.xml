<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0015">For the conventional circuit board assembly <b>71</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the metal core <b>82</b> has a good heat-releasing (heat-spreading) property. However, when a certain kind of the electric and electronic components <b>72</b> (for example relays) are applied, the circuit board <b>73</b> is deformed due to heating. There is also a concern that this heating may be enhanced when applying fuses arranged in several columns.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0016">For the above-described reasons, applying for example the structure of Patent Literature 3 has a problem that a wiring space for the bus bars and an installation space for the electric and electronic components are limited. There is also a problem of the structure being large since the bus bars need to be wired along detour paths.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0017">In view of the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a circuit board structure having measures against heat which can perform efficient heat spreading and heat releasing by utilizing a metal core, which can efficiently spread and release heat generated at heat-generating components, and which can securely spread and release heat of the circuit board even upon applying fuses and such arranged in a plurality of columns.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0018">In order to solve the above-described problems and achieve the above-described object, a first aspect of the present invention provides a circuit board structure having measures against heat, including a terminal block having an insulating block main body and a plurality of terminals, in which least one of the terminals is provided with a plurality of terminal portions for a connection with a circuit board, in which the plurality of terminal portions are inserted into respective through holes of the circuit board, the circuit board having a conductive metal core at an intermediate portion in a thickness direction of the circuit board, and in which heat of the metal core is absorbed and transferred to the terminals by the plurality of terminal portions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0019">According to the above-described structure, heat of the circuit board is absorbed from the metal core by the plurality of terminal portions of the terminals and transferred efficiently to the terminals (not to the terminal portions but to the terminal body), spreading and releasing the heat. The heat of the terminal body is released for example by radiation or by conduction to the block main body. Thus, by increasing connection points of the terminals at which the terminals connect with the metal core, efficient heat absorption can be performed.

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> show a circuit board structure having measures against heat of the present invention according to a first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0063">This structure includes a circuit board <b>2</b> having at an intermediate portion in a thickness direction thereof a plate-like conductive metal core (refer to a reference sign <b>82</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). A terminal block <b>3</b> is disposed at the circuit board <b>2</b>. A plurality of pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>is formed at a plate-like terminal (bus bar) <b>14</b> of the terminal block <b>3</b>. The terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>are inserted into respective through holes <b>16</b> of the circuit board <b>2</b> and connected by soldering so as to be in contact with a conductive portion of an inner surface of the through holes <b>16</b> of the metal core, respectively (or, the terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>are arranged to contact with the conductive portion of the inner surface of the through holes <b>16</b> of the metal core via solder).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0064">Since the basic structure of the metal core is similar to that of the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a detailed explanation thereof is eliminate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> only shows an insulating board <b>2</b><i>a </i>covering a top surface and a bottom face of the metal core. Dimensions of the metal core are arranged within a length and a width of the insulating board <b>2</b><i>a</i>. A printed circuit not shown (a pattern circuit at a surface layer) is formed with a predetermined pattern at a top face and/or a bottom face of the insulating board <b>2</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0065">The terminal block <b>3</b> includes a block main body <b>13</b> made of an insulating resin and a plurality of power supply terminals <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032; retained by the block main body <b>13</b>. The plurality of power supply terminals <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032; includes: the broad plate-like terminal (bus bar) <b>14</b> having an L-shaped cross-section shown in an enlarged view; and the narrow terminals <b>14</b>&#x2032; having an L-shaped cross-section. The narrow terminals <b>14</b>&#x2032; are provided with the one or few pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The respective terminals <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032; include a horizontal plate portion <b>14</b><i>c </i>which is parallel to the circuit board <b>2</b> and a vertical plate portion <b>14</b><i>d </i>which is perpendicular to the circuit board <b>2</b>. The horizontal plate portion <b>14</b><i>c </i>includes U-shaped holding terminal portions <b>14</b><i>a </i>for a connection with fuses which are formed integrally with an edge (anterior edge) of the horizontal plate portion <b>14</b><i>c</i>. The vertical plate portion <b>14</b><i>d </i>includes pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>for a connection with a circuit board which are formed integrally with an edge (bottom edge) of the vertical plate portion <b>14</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0066">In the present invention, the vertical plate portion <b>14</b><i>d </i>of the broad terminal <b>14</b> is provided with the plurality of (four, in this embodiment) pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>which are arranged in parallel and alternately adjacent to each other so as to be inserted into and connected to the respective through holes of the metal core of the circuit board <b>2</b> at a time. Thus, there is provided with increased connection points forming a connection with the circuit board <b>2</b>. Consequently, heat of the circuit board <b>2</b> can efficiently be absorbed and transferred to the terminal <b>14</b> by the plurality of terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, by employing the narrow terminals <b>14</b>&#x2032; each having two or so pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the efficient heat spreading, i.e. heat soaking, is enhanced, as well as the efficient heat releasing.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0067">The horizontal plate portion <b>14</b><i>c </i>of the broad terminal <b>14</b> is provided with a tab-like terminal portion <b>15</b> arranged to project from and continue from a lateral side of the horizontal plate portion <b>14</b><i>c</i>. Thus, by connecting, to the tab-like terminal portion <b>15</b>, a female terminal connected to an end of an external electric wire having large diameter (not shown), the heat absorbed by the terminal <b>14</b> can efficiently be released (dissipated) to an external environment through the electric wire. The electric wire is connected for example to a battery or an alternator of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0068">The respective pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the broad terminal <b>14</b> are formed short in length. The vertical plate portion <b>14</b><i>d </i>is provided with a vertically long slit <b>14</b><i>e </i>formed at a center with respect to the four pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b</i>, so that the four pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>are split two by two. The slit <b>14</b><i>e </i>absorbs heat strain of the vertical plate portion <b>14</b><i>d </i>caused by melted solder, reducing a stress at a soldered portion between the respective pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>and the circuit board <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0069">The horizontal plate portion <b>14</b><i>c </i>of the broad terminal <b>14</b> is provided with a plurality of holding terminal portions <b>14</b><i>a </i>arranged in parallel at an equal interval. The holding terminal portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>includes a right-and-left pair of elastic pieces and a slit therebetween. The holding terminal portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>is connected to a small blade-like fuse (not shown) having a top-and-bottom pair of tab terminals, so as the holding terminal portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>sandwiches one of the tab terminals of the fuse. The laterally-projecting tab terminal portion <b>15</b> is formed broad to address a relatively large current. A narrow tab terminal portion <b>14</b><i>f </i>arranged in parallel with the holding terminal portions <b>14</b><i>a </i>is provided for a connection with a box-shaped fusible link (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the terminal block <b>3</b> retains the terminals <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032; arranged in a plurality of vertically-layered columns (four columns in this embodiment). The horizontal plate terminal <b>14</b><i>c </i>of the broad terminal <b>14</b> is arranged at an uppermost column. The fuses are arranged in two vertically-layered columns. The block main body <b>13</b> includes a main portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>and an upper cover portion <b>13</b><i>b</i>. The vertical plate portions <b>14</b><i>d </i>of the respective terminals <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032; are inserted in the main portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>downwardly from above. Then, the cover portion <b>13</b><i>b </i>is mounted to the main portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>from a tip-end side of the terminal <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032; to fix the terminal <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0071">The vertical plate portion <b>14</b><i>d </i>of the broad terminal <b>14</b> is inserted into a broad recess portion <b>47</b> at a posterior wall of the main portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the block main body <b>13</b>, so that the respective pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>are arranged to project downwardly with respect to a bottom end of the recess portion <b>47</b>. Thus, while bottom faces of side walls <b>48</b> of the main portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>are in contact with a surface of the circuit board <b>2</b>, the respective pin-shaped terminals <b>14</b><i>b </i>are inserted into the respective through holes <b>16</b> of the circuit board <b>2</b> and are soldered, within the through hole, to the metal core. The number of the pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be other than four. In fact, the more the pin-shaped terminal portions <b>14</b><i>b </i>are provided, the higher the thermal conductivity (heat absorption property) can be provided, i.e. the more the heat can be absorbed from the metal core of the circuit board <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0072">A fuse holder (not shown) made of an insulating resin is mounted to an anterior end of the block main body <b>13</b>. Thus, the respective holding terminal portions <b>14</b><i>a </i>projecting from the block main body <b>13</b> in an anterior direction are received in the fuse holder. Then, the respective fuses are mounted horizontally to the fuse holder from an anterior side.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a plurality of relays <b>7</b> is disposed at and connected to a central portion of the circuit board <b>2</b> in a width direction, so as to be in parallel in right-and-left direction as well as in an anteroposterior direction (a longitudinal direction of the circuit board). Since the relays <b>7</b> are heat-generating components, relays <b>7</b> generate a great amount of heat causing a rise in temperature of the circuit board <b>2</b>. Small resistance components <b>49</b> are disposed at and connected to the circuit board <b>2</b>. The circuit board <b>2</b>, the terminal block <b>3</b> and the electric and electronic components such as the relays <b>7</b> together constitute a circuit board assembly (sub-assembly) <b>12</b>. In the description, direction-indicative terms such as right-and-left, top-and-bottom and anteroposterior are used for convenience and may not correspond with a direction of implementation of the circuit board assembly <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0074">As one example, the block main body <b>13</b> of the terminal block <b>3</b> may be formed with a resin material having high thermal conductivity, so that heat absorbed via the terminals <b>14</b>, <b>14</b>&#x2032; can be released efficiently also from the block main body <b>13</b> to the external environment. Such resin material having high thermal conductivity can be formed for example by mixing a resin with a filler such as metal having high thermal conductivity. Furthermore, since the bottom faces of the side walls <b>48</b> of the main portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>are in contact with the surface of the circuit board <b>2</b>, the heat generated at an anterior portion of the circuit board <b>2</b> can be released also from the block main body <b>13</b>.</p>

Consequently, the heat of the circuit board <b>2</b> can efficiently be absorbed at a plurality of sites in length and width of the metal core and by the bus bar groups <b>191</b> through <b>196</b>. Thus, the heat of the circuit board <b>2</b> can be spread and released to the external environment from an outer surface of the respective bus bars <b>19</b>. Other some of the bus bar groups <b>191</b> through <b>196</b> are connected to the pattern circuit at the surface layer of the circuit board <b>2</b>.

Consequently, the heat of the repays <b>7</b> can efficiently be absorbed by the bus bars <b>19</b>, preventing excessive heating of the relays <b>7</b> and the circuit board <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0088">Furthermore, the block main body <b>18</b> of the bus bar block <b>4</b> may be formed with a resin material having high thermal conductivity as the above-described terminal block <b>3</b>, to allow the heat absorbed by the bus bars <b>19</b> to be released efficiently also from the block main body <b>18</b> to the external environment.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0089">Advantageously, the bus bars <b>19</b> are formed with a material having higher electric conductivity to improve heat releasing property.
