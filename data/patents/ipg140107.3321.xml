<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to integrated circuit packages, and more particularly to an integrated circuit package having high yield and a method for fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In integrated circuit device fabrication, an integrated circuit packaging step is performed. The integrated circuit, in which the packaging step is performed, can be used in a wide variety of applications, including computers, mobile phones and digital cameras. Yield of the integrated circuit package can affect performance of an integrated circuit device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref> are cross-sections of a conventional integrated circuit package. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>, a protective layer <b>8</b> is formed on a covering plate <b>4</b> prior to bonding. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C-1D</figref> show a protective layer <b>8</b> formed on a covering plate <b>4</b> prior to bonding. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, an integrated circuit chip <b>2</b>, which has photosensitive devices <b>12</b> formed thereon and electrically connected to a bonding pad <b>6</b>, is illustrated. A covering plate <b>4</b> is then attached to the integrated circuit chip <b>2</b> by an adhesive layer <b>10</b> to form a distance <b>14</b> between the covering plate <b>4</b> and the integrated circuit chip <b>2</b>. During bonding of the covering plate <b>4</b> to the integrated circuit chip <b>2</b>, the adhesive layer <b>10</b> overflows onto the photosensitive devices <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-section of the integrated circuit package, in which the adhesive layer <b>10</b> overflows onto the photosensitive devices <b>12</b> during bonding, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the adhesive layer overflows onto the photosensitive device <b>12</b>, and covers a portion of the photosensitive devices <b>12</b>, so that sensitivity of the photosensitive devices <b>12</b> to light from covering plate <b>4</b> and distance <b>14</b> becomes uniform, which results in failure of the integrated circuit package.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, an integrated circuit chip <b>2</b> having photosensitive device <b>12</b> and a bonding pad <b>6</b> is provided. A protective layer <b>8</b> covers the bonding pad <b>6</b>, which is electrically connected to the photosensitive devices <b>12</b>. A covering plate <b>4</b> is subsequently attached to the integrated circuit chip <b>2</b> by an adhesive layer <b>10</b> to form a distance <b>14</b> therebetween. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, during bonding, the adhesive layer <b>10</b> overflows onto the photosensitive device <b>12</b> along a sidewall of the protective layer <b>8</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is a cross-section of an integrated circuit package, in which the adhesive layer <b>10</b> overflows onto the photosensitive devices <b>12</b> during bonding in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. The adhesive layer <b>10</b> overflows onto the photosensitive device <b>12</b> and covers a portion of photosensitive device <b>12</b>, so that yield for fabricating the integrated circuit package, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, is reduced. Accordingly, the problems described occur in conventional bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, an integrated circuit package and fabrication method thereof is needed to eliminate the problems described and increase yield of fabrication.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the invention provides an integrated circuit package. An exemplary embodiment of the integrated circuit package comprises an integrated circuit chip having a photosensitive device thereon; a bonding pad formed on an upper surface of the integrated circuit chip and electrically connected to the photosensitive device; a first barrier formed between the bonding pad and the photosensitive device; and a conductive layer formed on a sidewall of the integrated circuit chip and electrically connected to the bonding pad. The integrated circuit package further comprises a second barrier layer between the bonding pad and the first barrier layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention also provides a method for fabricating an integrated circuit package. The method comprises providing an integrated circuit chip having a photosensitive device thereon; forming a bonding pad on the integrated circuit chip, and electrically connected to the photosensitive device; forming a first barrier between the bonding pad and the photosensitive device; and forming a conductive layer on a sidewall of the integrated circuit chip, and electrically connected to the bonding pad.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The integrated circuit package has a barrier layer between the bonding pad and the photosensitive device. Thus, the barrier layer blocks an overflow of an adhesive layer into the photosensitive device during bonding. Furthermore, since the barrier layer is disposed between the bonding pad and photosensitive device, the position and amount of the adhesive layer is thus accurately controlled to reduced fabrication cost.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following description is of the best-contemplated mode of carrying out the invention. This description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention and should not be taken in a limiting sense. The scope of the invention is best determined by reference to the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2H</figref> are cross-sections of a method for fabricating an integrated circuit package according to a first embodiment of the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> having upper and low surfaces <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> is provided. A photosensitive device <b>104</b> is then formed on the upper surface <b>103</b> of the integrated circuit <b>102</b>. A bonding pad is subsequently formed on the upper surface <b>103</b> and electrically connected to the photosensitive device <b>104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> may be a photosensitive integrated circuit chip. Preferably, the bonding pad <b>106</b> is a material such as copper, aluminum or any suitable conductive material. In some embodiments, a conductive layer is formed on the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> by, for example, sputtering or evaporating followed by photolithography and etching to form the bonding pad <b>106</b>. It is appreciated that while divided bonding pads are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the bonding pad may also be a continuous layer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a barrier layer <b>108</b>, also referred to as gate pattern, is then formed on the upper surface <b>103</b> of the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b>, and the barrier layer <b>108</b> is between the bonding pad <b>106</b> and the photosensitive device <b>104</b>. In an embodiment, an insulating layer (not shown) is formed on the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> by coating followed by patterning the insulating layer by photolithography and etching to form the barrier layer <b>108</b>. Preferably, the barrier layer <b>108</b> is a material such as polyimide, epoxy, polyester or any suitable insulating material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a first substrate <b>110</b>, also referred to as a covering plate, is provided. A protective layer <b>112</b>, referred to as a dam, is subsequently formed on the first substrate <b>110</b> to prevent oxidation. In an embodiment, the first substrate <b>110</b> may be glass, quartz, opal, plastic or any suitable transparent material. Preferably, the protective layer <b>112</b> is polyimide, epoxy or suitable insulating material. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, an adhesive layer <b>114</b> is formed on the protective layer <b>112</b>. Preferably, the adhesive layer <b>114</b> is an adhesive material containing epoxy.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the first substrate <b>110</b> is attached to the upper surface of the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> by the adhesive layer <b>114</b> to form a distance between the first substrate <b>110</b> and integrated circuit chip <b>102</b>. After bonding the first substrate <b>110</b> to the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b>, the protective layer <b>112</b> covers the bonding pad <b>106</b> to prevent oxidation. The barrier layer <b>108</b> is between the protective layer <b>112</b> and the photosensitive device <b>104</b>. Preferably, a distance between the barrier layer <b>108</b> and the protective layer <b>112</b> is more than or equal to 0.5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Note that because the barrier layer is disposed between the bonding pad <b>106</b> and the photosensitive layer <b>104</b>, the adhesive layer <b>114</b> is formed between the barrier layer <b>108</b> and the bonding pad <b>106</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. Accordingly, when processing bonding, the barrier layer blocks adhesive layer overflow into a region on which the photosensitive device is formed, preventing failure of the integrated circuit package. For example, adhesive layer overflow into a portion of the photosensitive device can cause light sensitized by the photosensitive device to be uniform or the portion of the photosensitive device covered by the adhesive layer unable to sensitize light. Furthermore, since the barrier layer is disposed between the bonding pad and photosensitive device, the position and amount of the adhesive layer is thus accurately controlled to reduce fabrication cost.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">After bonding, a polishing step may optionally be performed to thin the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b>, facilitating cutting of individual die. In an embodiment, the integrated circuit chip has a thickness of between about 10 &#x3bc;m and 250 &#x3bc;m after the polishing step, facilitating cutting of individual die.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a portion of the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> is removed along a predetermined cutting line of the die by photolithography and etching to form an opening <b>118</b> for cutting individual die. The opening <b>118</b> may expose the protective layer <b>114</b> and a lower surface of the bonding pad <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the etching process may be dry etching using a gas comprising sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), octafluorocyclobutane (C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>) or any suitable gas. In some embodiments, the etching process may be wet etching comprising silicon etchant, for example a solution mixing 2.5% of hydrogen fluoride acid (HF), 50% of hydrogen nitrate acid (HNO3), 10% of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and 37.5% of water, for removing a portion of the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> and exposing the bonding pad <b>106</b>. The silicon etchant may also comprise potassium hydroxide (KOH).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a second substrate <b>122</b> is subsequently attached to the lower surface <b>105</b> of the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> by a sealant <b>120</b>. The sealant <b>120</b> is formed on the lower surface <b>105</b> of the integrated circuit <b>102</b> and filled in the opening <b>118</b>. In one embodiment, the sealant <b>120</b> such as epoxy, polyimide (PI) or suitable material is formed on the lower surface <b>105</b> of the integrated circuit <b>102</b> by coating. The second substrate <b>122</b> may be a material similar to the first substrate or a suitable opaque substrate. Furthermore, the second substrate <b>122</b> may carry the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b>, thus, the second substrate <b>122</b> may also be referred to as a carry plate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> is a cross-section of the integrated circuit package in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> rotated through 180&#xb0;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, an insulating layer <b>124</b> is formed on the second substrate <b>122</b>. Thereafter, a notching step, also referred to as cutting step, is performed along the predetermined cutting line of the individual die by notching equipment to form a trench <b>126</b> and expose a sidewall of the bonding pad <b>106</b> and a surface of the first substrate <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the insulating layer <b>124</b> such as silicon oxide, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, photoresist material or any suitable dielectric material, may be formed by, for example spin coating, spray coating, or low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, a conductive layer <b>128</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>124</b> and extending to the trench <b>126</b> to electrically connect to the bonding pad <b>106</b>. Preferably, the conductive layer <b>128</b> may be aluminum, copper, nickel or any suitable conductive material. In an embodiment, a metal layer is conformally formed on the insulting layer <b>124</b>, in which the metal layer extends from the surface of the insulating layer <b>124</b> and the sidewall of the bonding pad <b>106</b> to the surface of the first substrate <b>110</b>, by sputtering, evaporating, electroplating or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The metal layer is patterned by lithography and etching to form the conductive layer <b>128</b> and expose a portion of the insulating layer <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Note that the metal layer may be difficultly formed on the bottom of the trench <b>126</b> since the bottom of the trench <b>126</b> is narrow. Thus, electroless-plating is optionally performed to form the conductive layer <b>128</b> on the bottom of the trench <b>126</b> after forming the metal layer. It is appreciated that the conductive layer <b>128</b> is formed only by electroless-plating without patterning the metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, a solder mask <b>130</b> is formed on the conductive layer <b>128</b> to expose a portion of the conductive layer <b>128</b> which defines a position of a solder ball <b>132</b> subsequently formed. The solder ball <b>132</b> is then formed on the exposed conductive layer <b>128</b> to electrically connect the conductive layer <b>128</b>. The solder mask <b>130</b> serves as a protective layer.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An individual die is then cut along the predetermined cutting line thereof by a cutter, after the described steps. Thus, fabrication of an integrated circuit package <b>140</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, is complete. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref> is a cross-section of the integrated circuit package in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref> cut and rotated through 180&#xb0;.

A conductive layer <b>128</b> is formed on a sidewall of the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> and electrically connected to bonding pad <b>106</b> and solder ball <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, a first substrate <b>110</b> is correspondingly disposed over the integrated circuit chip <b>102</b> and a distance <b>116</b> is formed therebetween. Note that the integrated circuit package <b>140</b> according to first embodiment of the invention has a barrier layer <b>108</b> between the bonding pad <b>106</b> and the photosensitive device <b>106</b> to prevent adhesive layer overflow into the photosensitive device <b>104</b> avoiding faults in package fabrication.</p>
