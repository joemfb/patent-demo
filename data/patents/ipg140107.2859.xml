<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a biodegradable material, especially a biodegradable material containing a plasticizer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The rise of plastic packaging material closely relates to the change of general lifestyle. The use of light, convenient packaging to facilitate food storage and transportation, as well as increasing the shelf life of food has become very important due to the pressure from high population growth rate and food shortage. Although plastic packaging at present can satisfy these demand, the consumption of plastic has exceeded 160 million tons annually, within which 35% is used as packaging material. The treatment of waste from the packaging material imposes huge impact on the environment, so the recycling of plastic and the study of degradable plastic have become more and more important.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Biodegradable material has been generally defined as a material under sufficient water, oxygen, and suitable nutrients and temperature being able to decompose into carbon dioxide and water by microbes. Biodegradable material is a new type of polymer, which is characterized by the self-decomposition when its function completes. The bonding between these polymers decomposes into environmentally friendly compositions through biological processes. Biodegradable material is more friendly to the environment than conventional material. Generally speaking, the treatment and recycling for plastics used in disposable applications after use are not economic and impose greater impact on the environment. The treatment of contaminated plastics at present is nothing more than combustion or landfill, which invisibly increases the loading to the environment. Therefore, the development of biodegradable material has become a high-profile issue. Depending on the source of the material, biodegradable material can be divided into four categories: (1) biodegradable material based on polylactic acid; (2) biodegradable material based on polyester; (3) biodegradable material based on starch; and (4) biodegradable material based on polycaprolactone. Other natural materials such as soybean are also under development continually.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the biodegradable material at present is environmentally friendly, the structure of such material is hard to be modified, and their products after different kinds of fabrication processes have disadvantages of fragility, low heat-resistance, insufficient viscosity and so on. Therefore, the application of biodegradable materials is greatly limited, and the marketing products can only be used at low temperature. In view of this, the emphasis of future market demand will be focused on the environmentally friendly formula having increased functionalities of heat-tolerance, tenacity, viscosity and so on.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the disadvantages in the known art, the object of the present invention is to provide a plasticizer added in biodegradable material, to improve the property of the biodegradable material, and facilitate the follow-up processes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide a biodegradable material having excellent properties. By the use of plasticizer, biodegradable materials with appropriate tenacity, impact-tolerance, high adhesion and ductility can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a surface-covering material for paper, wood, plastic or metal substrate to improve the water-resistant, oil-resistant, microwave-tolerant and anti-freezing properties of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a adhesion material for paper, wood, plastic or metal substrate to adhere two substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">To achieve the above objects, the plasticizer for the biodegradable material of the present invention comprises 100 parts by weight of a bio-molecule and 0.1 to 1000 parts by weight of a monomer of biodegradable polymer, wherein the bio-molecule and the monomer of biodegradable polymer are thermal-treated at 50 to 160&#xb0; C. after mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention also includes a use of plasticizer for adjusting the tenacity and/or impact-tolerance and/or ductility and/or adhesion of biodegradable material, wherein the plasticizer comprises 100 parts by weight of a bio-molecule and 0.1 to 1000 parts by weight of a monomer or oligomer of biodegradable polymer, water or mixtures thereof, and the plasticizer is thermal-treated at 50 to 160&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention includes a biodegradable material precursor, which comprises 100 parts by weight of a biodegradable polymer and 0.1 to 50 parts by weight of a plasticizer; wherein the plasticizer is made up of 100 parts by weight of a bio-molecule and 0.1 to 1000 parts by weight of a monomer or oligomer of biodegradable polymer, water or mixtures thereof; wherein the plasticizer is thermal-treated at 50 to 160&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention also includes a biodegradable material (a biodegradable product), which is obtained by thermal-treating the above-mentioned biodegradable material precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The biodegradable product of the present invention can adhere two objects by thermal-compressing, and therefore the present invention also provides a adhesion material, which is obtained by thermal-treating the above-mentioned biodegradable material precursor. The adhesion material is characterized by adhering two surfaces through thermal-compressing.</p>

In these embodiments, the bio-molecule solution is used to adjust the tenacity and/or impact-tolerance and/or adhesion and/or ductility of the biodegradable polymer. The bio-molecule solution used as plasticizer is composed of 100 parts by weight of a bio-molecule and 0.1 to 1000 parts by weight of water, wherein some parts of the water can be replaced by the precursor monomer of the biodegradable polymer. The same as the embodiments using the precursor monomer of the biodegradable polymer, the bio-molecule solution is thermal-treated at 50 to 160&#xb0; C. after mixing, and preferably at 80 to 130&#xb0; C. In this embodiment, the definition of the bio-molecule is the same as mentioned above. From the above description for the composition of the plasticizer, the use of plasticizer is to adjust the tenacity and/or impact-tolerance and/or adhesion and/or ductility of a biodegradable polymer, wherein the plasticizer is added to the biodegradable polymer, and then the tenacity and/or impact-tolerance and/or adhesion and/or ductility of the biodegradable polymer can be changed after fabrication as expected.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Therefore, the biodegradable material precursor of the present invention comprises 100 parts by weight of a biodegradable polymer and 0.1 to 50 parts by weight of a plasticizer, wherein the plasticizer comprises 100 parts by weight of a bio-molecule and 0.1 to 1000 parts by weight of a precursor monomer or oligomer of the biodegradable polymer, water or mixtures thereof, and the plasticizer is thermal-treated at 50 to 160&#xb0; C. The definitions of bio-molecule and biodegradable polymer are the same as mentioned above. Preferably, the biodegradable material precursor is formed by mixing 100 parts by weight of a biodegradable polymer and 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a plasticizer, wherein the preferred temperature for thermal-treating the plasticizer is 80 to 130&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The biodegradable material precursor of the present invention can be thermal-treated to form different types of biodegradable material as needed (ex: container or surface thin film), i.e. the present invention provides a biodegradable material, which is obtained by thermal-treating the above-mentioned biodegradable material precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The thermal-treating process mentioned in the present invention includes polymer techniques which are used to produce a polymer, such as injection-molding, extrusion-molding, roll-coating, laminating or foaming. The molding temperature of the biodegradable material formed by the biodegradable material precursor of the present invention is 160 to 280&#xb0; C., and preferably 190 to 250&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It can be easily understood by the skilled in the art that biodegradable materials with different tenacity, impact-resistance, adhesion and ductility can be obtained by adjusting the composition of plasticizer and the ratio of plasticizer to biodegradable polymer as needed. For example, the required properties for a biodegradable material used as a container, a coating film or electronic plastics are different, and that can be achieved by changing the composition of the precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">During the development of the present invention, the biodegradable material can also be used as a adhesive, which is to place the biodegradable material between the surface of two objects needed to be adhered, and use thermal-compressing to produce the adhesive property of the biodegradable material, then adhere these two objects.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Therefore, the biodegradable material of the present invention is also a adhesion material, which is used to adhere two objects, wherein the material of these two objects can be the same or different, including paper, wood, plastic or metal.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Specifically, it is known from the above description for the biodegradable material precursor that the flowability of the biodegradable material precursor can be adjusted by changing the amount of the plasticizer added, and therefore the biodegradable material with high and low contents of plasticizer can be used in different fields appropriately, and can be diluted by adding solvents (especially water). Generally speaking, the biodegradable material with low flowability (i.e. high viscosity) is more suitable to be used as a adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The advantages of the present invention are further depicted with the illustration of examples, which however should not be construed as a limitation on the scope of claims.</p>
