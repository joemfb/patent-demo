<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus and method for inspecting a circuit of a substrate is described. The apparatus includes a pin probe coming into contact with a first end of an electrode formed on a first side of a substrate, a voltage source for applying a voltage to the pin probe, a film disposed at a second end of the electrode formed on a second side of the substrate, a dielectric fluid sealed in the film, and an electronic ink dispersed in the dielectric fluid, and charged with electricity to flow when the electrode is electrified. The present invention is advantageous in that whether an electrode has been electrified is measured using charged electronic ink, so that the use of a pin probe is limited to one side of a substrate, thus reducing cost required for the entire inspection.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0109306, filed on Nov. 12, 2009, entitled &#x201c;Inspection Apparatus and Method For Circuit of Substrate&#x201d;, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for inspecting the circuit of a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the recent development of the electronics industry, the requirement that electronic parts be of high functionality has rapidly increased, and thus inspection methods for the circuit of a substrate, performed when the substrate is manufactured, also require high precision, high speed and low cost. However, methods for inspecting the circuit of a substrate, which are currently being generally used, that is, contact pin probe methods, do not yet satisfy the above requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view showing a conventional apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate using contact pin probes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate <b>15</b> using contact pin probes includes two pin probes <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, a voltage source <b>13</b>, and an ammeter <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first pin probe <b>11</b> comes into contact with one end of an electrode <b>16</b>, formed on one side of the substrate <b>15</b>, and functions to transfer current supplied by a voltage source <b>13</b> to the electrode <b>16</b>. The second pin probe <b>12</b> comes into contact with the other end of the electrode <b>16</b>, formed on the other side of the substrate <b>15</b>, and functions to receive current from the electrode <b>16</b> and transfer the current to the ammeter <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">That is, when the electrode <b>16</b> is electrified, the voltage source <b>13</b>, the first pin probe <b>11</b>, the electrode <b>16</b>, the second pin probe <b>12</b>, and the ammeter <b>14</b> are sequentially connected in series, so that a closed circuit is formed and current flows into the closed circuit. Therefore, when current is measured using the ammeter <b>14</b>, a resistance value can be obtained using Ohm's law (R=V/I). When the electrode <b>16</b> is electrified, a resistance of 0&#x3a9; must be theoretically measured. However, since conducting wires, forming the pin probes <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> and the closed circuit, have their own resistances, the resistance is measured as a relatively small value and not 0&#x3a9;.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Meanwhile, when the electrode <b>16</b> is not electrified, current does not flow, and the resistance becomes infinite (V/0=&#x221e;).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate using pin probes can determine whether the electrode has been electrified by measuring the resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, the conventional apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate is problematic because pin probes must be precisely manufactured to cope with the micro-patterning of a substrate, so that the cost of manufacturing pin probes gradually increases, and thus the entire cost required for inspection also increases.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, when defects in which an electrode pad has become slightly unfastened and then the electrode is not electrified are present, the electrode may be electrified due to the pressure of pin probes at the time of inspecting the circuit, and thus the results of an erroneous measurement indicating that the electrode is normal may be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, the conventional apparatus is problematic in that, since pin probes must be brought into contact with both ends of the electrode, respectively, measurement time increases, and in that, since heat is generated by the flow of current during the inspection, the electrode may be broken down.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Prior to giving the description, the terms and words used in the present specification and claims should not be interpreted as being limited to their typical meaning based on the dictionary definitions thereof, but should be interpreted to have the meaning and concept relevant to the technical spirit of the present invention, on the basis of the principle by which the inventor can suitably define the implications of terms in the way which best describes the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. In the present specification, reference now should be made to the drawings, in which the same reference numerals are used throughout the different drawings to designate the same or similar components. Further, the terms &#x201c;one side&#x201d;, &#x201c;the other side&#x201d;, &#x201c;one end&#x201d; and &#x201c;the other end&#x201d; are used to distinguish one component from the other component, and the components of the present invention are not limited by the terms. Further, in the description of the present invention, if detailed descriptions of related well-known constructions or functions are determined to make the gist of the present invention unclear, the detailed descriptions will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are sectional views showing an apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate <b>180</b> according to the present embodiment includes a pin probe <b>110</b> coming into contact with one end of an electrode <b>160</b> formed on one side of the substrate <b>180</b>, a voltage source <b>120</b> for applying a voltage to the pin probe <b>110</b>, a film <b>130</b> disposed at the other end of the electrode <b>160</b> formed on the other side of the substrate <b>180</b>, a dielectric fluid <b>140</b> sealed in the film <b>130</b>, and electronic ink <b>150</b> dispersed in the dielectric fluid <b>140</b> and charged with electricity to flow when the electrode <b>160</b> is electrified. The apparatus for inspecting the circuit of the substrate <b>180</b> according to the present embodiment may further include a camera <b>190</b> for capturing an image indicating whether the electronic ink <b>150</b> is flowing, and an image comparison means <b>200</b> for comparing the image captured by the camera <b>190</b> with a comparative image obtained when the electrode <b>160</b> is electrified, thus determining whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Here, electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> are targets to be inspected by the apparatus for inspecting the circuit of the substrate <b>180</b> according to the present invention, and indicate a concept including via holes, circuit layers and pads which are vertically formed through the substrate <b>180</b> and are exposed on both sides of the substrate <b>180</b>. Further, in the present embodiment, the substrate <b>180</b> is shown as a single layer, but it is apparent that a multi-layer substrate is included in the scope of the present invention, and the substrate is a concept including a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) or a semiconductor wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A pin probe <b>110</b> comes into contact with one end of each of the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> formed on one side of the substrate <b>180</b> and function to transfer the voltage applied by the voltage source <b>120</b> to the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>. In the electrode <b>160</b> receiving the voltage, an electric field is generated. Whether the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> have been electrified can be measured using such an electric field. This operation will be described in detail later.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, such a pin probe <b>110</b> is manufactured using a microscopic pin-type structure to cope with fine circuits. The cross section of the pin probe <b>110</b> typically has a circular shape, but is not limited to such a shape and may have the shape of a polygon, such as a triangle or a rectangle. Further, the pin probe <b>110</b> is implemented as a conductor to transfer the voltage to the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>. The surface of the pin probe <b>110</b> is plated with metal having low electric resistance and high surface hardness, for example, a precious metal such as gold or rhodium, so as to minimize the electric resistance of the pin probe <b>110</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The voltage source <b>120</b> functions to apply a voltage to the pin probe <b>110</b>. In this case, the voltage source <b>120</b> is preferably implemented as a DC voltage source <b>120</b> for applying a voltage of 70V to 100V, but is not limited to that voltage source, and a voltage source <b>120</b> for applying a suitable voltage in consideration of the thickness of the substrate <b>180</b>, the weight of the electronic ink <b>150</b>, etc. may be selected as the voltage source <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The film <b>130</b> is a means for sealing the dielectric fluid <b>140</b>, which will be described later, and is disposed on the other side of the substrate <b>180</b>, which is opposite one side of the substrate <b>180</b> on which the pin probe <b>110</b> is disposed. The film <b>130</b> may be made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), Poly Carbonate (PC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), polyethersulfone (PES), cyclic olefin copolymer (COC), glass, tempered glass, etc. Further, the dielectric fluid <b>140</b> and the electronic ink <b>150</b> which are core components of the present invention are scarcely influenced by the bending of the film <b>130</b>. Therefore, according to the circumstances, the film <b>130</b> may be flexibly manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The dielectric fluid <b>140</b> is a dispersion medium sealed in the film <b>130</b> and functions to allow the electronic ink <b>150</b>, which is a dispersoid dispersed in the dielectric fluid <b>140</b>, to flow through the fluid <b>140</b>. The dielectric fluid <b>140</b> may be typically implemented using a fluid exhibiting a color (dyed colloidal suspension), such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) oil, but may be implemented using a transparent fluid to more definitely measure the flow of the electronic ink <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The electronic ink <b>150</b> is composed of corpuscles dispersed in the dielectric fluid <b>140</b> as minute particles, and is configured to be charged with positive electricity or negative electricity and to flow through the dielectric fluid when the electrode <b>160</b> or <b>170</b> is electrified, thus making it possible to visually (with the naked eye or the camera <b>190</b>) determine whether the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> have been electrified. In more detail, a procedure for allowing the electric ink <b>150</b> to flow will be described below. That is, the voltage from the pin probes <b>110</b> is applied to the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>. Since the other end of each of the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> is open, current does not flow through the other end. An electric field is generated at the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b>. The electronic ink <b>150</b> flows owing to the electric field generated at the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, when the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a negative voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b>, the electronic ink <b>150</b> charged with positive electricity flows to the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b> due to electrical attractive force, but does not flow to the other end of the unelectrified electrode <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, when the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a positive voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b>, the electronic ink <b>150</b> charged with negative electricity flows to the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b> due to electrical attractive force, but does not flow to the other end of the unelectrified electrode <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Therefore, it can be determined that the electrode <b>160</b> to which the electronic ink <b>150</b> flows is electrified, and that the electrode <b>170</b> to which the electronic ink <b>150</b> does not flow is not electrified. That is, whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified can be determined using electrophoresis.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described above, the apparatus for inspecting the circuit of the substrate according to the present invention performs inspection using electrophoresis which is a non-contact measurement method, without bringing the pin probe <b>110</b> into contact with the other end of each of the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>, so that the use of the pin probes <b>110</b> can be reduced, and thus the entire inspection cost and inspection time can be decreased. Further, erroneous measurements that may occur when the pads of the electrodes have become slightly unfastened in a contact measurement method can be prevented. Furthermore, since current does not flow through the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> during inspection, the breakdown of the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Meanwhile, the case where the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a positive voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b> and the electronic ink <b>150</b> is charged with positive electricity, or the case where the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a negative voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b> and the electronic ink <b>150</b> is charged with negative electricity can also be taken into account. However, in this case, the electronic ink <b>150</b> becomes more distant from the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b> due to electrical repulsive force. As a result, a problem arises in that determination of whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified cannot be definitely performed. Therefore, it is preferable that, as described above, the electronic ink <b>150</b> be charged with electricity which is opposite that of the voltage applied by the voltage source <b>120</b> to the pin probes <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, at the time of determining based on the flow of the electronic ink <b>150</b> whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified, power can be reduced using bi-stability. The term &#x2018;bi-stability&#x2019; means a property that, after the electronic ink <b>150</b> flows due to an electric field and collects around the other end of the electrode <b>160</b>, the electronic ink <b>150</b> does not move even if the electric field is eliminated Bi-stability is desirably implemented when the specific gravity of a dispersoid is equal to that of a dispersion medium. Accordingly, it is preferable that the specific gravities of the electronic ink <b>150</b> and the dielectric fluid <b>140</b> be identical to each other. However, the term &#x2018;identical specific gravity&#x2019; does not mean perfect identicalness in a mathematical meaning, but is a concept including errors in the manufacturing process of the electronic ink <b>150</b> or the dielectric fluid <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Meanwhile, titanium dioxide or carbon may preferably be used as the electronic ink <b>150</b>. The size of the electronic ink <b>150</b> is not especially limited, but may preferably be 1 to 2 &#x3bc;m so that measurement is facilitated while the flow of the electronic ink <b>150</b> caused by electrical attractive force is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Meanwhile, the flow of the electronic ink <b>150</b> can be measured with the naked eye, but the camera <b>190</b> for capturing an image indicating whether the electronic ink <b>150</b> is flowing is preferably provided to perform more precise measurement. Further, it is more preferable to provide the image comparison means <b>200</b> for comparing the image captured by the camera <b>190</b> with a previously input comparative image, obtained when the electrode is electrified, and then precisely determining whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are sectional views showing an apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate according to a second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the present embodiment is compared with the above-described first embodiment, the largest difference therebetween is that micro capsules <b>133</b> in which a dielectric fluid <b>140</b> and electronic ink <b>150</b> are sealed are further included in a film <b>130</b>. Components other than the micro capsules <b>133</b> are identical to those of the above embodiment, and thus a repetitive description thereof will be omitted, and the micro capsules <b>133</b>, which indicate the difference, will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the first embodiment, since the electronic ink <b>150</b> can freely flow into the entire space of the inside of the film <b>130</b>, the electronic ink <b>150</b> may cluster or cohere. In this case, problems may arise in that, even if electrical attractive force acts on the electronic ink <b>150</b>, the electronic ink <b>150</b> may not flow, or in that, since the densities of portions of the electronic ink <b>150</b> differ, it is difficult to precisely measure the flow of the electronic ink <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In order to solve the above problems, the present embodiment employs the micro capsules <b>133</b>. Each of the micro capsules <b>133</b> defines a space in which the electronic ink <b>150</b> can flow, thus preventing the electronic ink <b>150</b> from clustering or cohering on a specific portion. Further, when the micro capsules <b>133</b> are minutely manufactured, the apparatus of the present invention has an advantage in that measurement resolution can be improved, thus coping with the micro-patterning of the substrate <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Even in the present embodiment, similarly to the above first embodiment, the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a negative voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b> and allows the electronic ink <b>150</b> to be charged with positive electricity, so that whether the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> have been electrified can be measured (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Alternatively, the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a positive voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b> and allows the electronic ink <b>150</b> to be charged with negative electricity, so that whether the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> have been electrified can be measured (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are sectional views of an apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the present embodiment is compared with the above-described embodiments, the largest difference therebetween is that partitions <b>135</b> are vertically formed in a film <b>130</b> so that electronic ink <b>150</b> is separated at regular intervals. Components other than the partitions <b>135</b> are identical to those of the above embodiments, and thus a repetitive description thereof will be omitted, and the partitions, which indicate the difference, will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The partitions <b>135</b> of the present embodiment perform a function similar to that of the micro capsules <b>133</b> of the second embodiment. That is, the partitions <b>135</b> provided in the film <b>130</b> define spaces in which the electronic ink <b>150</b> can flow, thus preventing the electronic ink <b>150</b> from clustering or cohering on a specific portion. Further, when the partitions <b>135</b> are formed at regular minute intervals, the apparatus of the present invention has an advantage in that measurement resolution can be improved, thus coping with the micro-patterning of the substrate <b>180</b>. Moreover, since the partitions <b>135</b> function to support the film <b>130</b>, the thickness of the film <b>130</b> can be prevented from being formed to be non-uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Even in the present embodiment, similarly to the above first embodiment, the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a negative voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b> and allows the electronic ink <b>150</b> to be charged with positive electricity, so that whether the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> have been electrified can be measured (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). Alternatively, the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a positive voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b> and allows the electronic ink <b>150</b> to be charged with negative electricity, so that whether the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> have been electrified can be measured (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are sectional views showing an apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the present embodiment is compared with the above embodiments, the largest difference therebetween is that electronic ink <b>150</b> is composed of white ink <b>153</b> and black ink <b>155</b>. Further, the white ink <b>153</b> and the black ink <b>155</b> are separated from each other when they are charged with electricity having different polarities and electric fields act on each other. Therefore, the flow of the electronic ink <b>150</b> can be more definitely measured.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, when the white ink <b>153</b> is charged with positive electricity, and the black ink <b>155</b> is charged with negative electricity, and thereafter the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a negative voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b>, the white ink <b>153</b> moves to the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b> due to electrical attractive force, and the black ink <b>155</b> becomes more distant from the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b> due to electrical repulsive force, and thus the white ink <b>153</b> and the black ink <b>155</b> become separated from each other. In contrast, since an electric field is not generated at the other end of the unelectrified electrode <b>170</b>, the white ink <b>153</b> and the black ink <b>155</b> are not separated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, when the white ink <b>153</b> is charged with negative electricity and the black ink <b>155</b> is charged with positive electricity, and thereafter the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a negative voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b>, the black ink <b>155</b> moves to the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b> due to electrical attractive force, and the white ink <b>153</b> becomes more distant from the other end of the electrode <b>160</b> due to electrical repulsive force, and thus the white ink <b>153</b> and the black ink <b>155</b> are separated from each other. In contrast, since an electric field is not generated at the other end of the unelectrified electrode <b>170</b>, the white ink <b>153</b> and the black ink <b>155</b> do not become separated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Therefore, in the present embodiment, whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified can be precisely determined based on the determination of whether the white ink <b>153</b> and the black ink <b>155</b> have been separated from each other by using the white ink <b>153</b> and the black ink <b>155</b> which are definitely distinguished from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> show the case where the micro capsules <b>133</b> are also employed (refer to the second embodiment), but the present invention is not limited to this embodiment. That is, the electronic ink <b>150</b> may be composed of white ink <b>153</b> and black ink <b>155</b> even when only the above basic film <b>130</b> is provided (refer to the first embodiment) and when the film <b>130</b> equipped with partitions is provided (refer to the third embodiment).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 10</figref> are sectional views sequentially showing a method of inspecting the circuit of a substrate according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 10</figref>, the method of inspecting the circuit of a substrate according to the present embodiment includes (A) preparing both a pin probe <b>110</b> and a film <b>130</b> in which a dielectric fluid <b>140</b>, in which electronic ink <b>150</b> is dispersed, is sealed, (B) bringing the pin probe <b>110</b> into contact with one end of an electrode <b>160</b> formed on one side of a substrate <b>180</b>, and disposing the film <b>130</b> at the other end of the electrode <b>160</b> formed on the other side of the substrate <b>180</b>, and (C) a voltage source <b>120</b> applying a voltage to the pin probe <b>110</b> and measuring whether charged electronic ink <b>150</b> is flowing, thus determining whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The method of inspecting the circuit of a substrate according to the present embodiment is implemented using the above-described apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate. Since the components of the apparatus for inspecting the circuit of a substrate have already been described, a repetitive description thereof will be omitted, and a description will be made on the basis of the time-series properties of the method of inspecting the circuit of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the pin probe <b>110</b> and the film <b>130</b>, in which the dielectric fluid <b>140</b> in which the electronic ink <b>150</b> is dispersed, is sealed, are prepared. In this case, the specific gravities of the electronic ink <b>150</b> and the dielectric fluid <b>140</b> are preferably identical to each other. The reason for this is to use bi-stability at the time of determining, based on the flow of the electronic ink <b>150</b>, whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified in the subsequent procedure, which will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a pin probe <b>110</b> comes into contact with one end of each of the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>, formed on one side of the substrate <b>180</b>, and the film <b>130</b> is disposed at the other end of each of the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>, formed on the other side of the substrate <b>180</b>. In this case, the pin probes <b>110</b> preferably come into contact with the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> to form an electric connection, and the film <b>130</b> is preferably located to fall within the range of an electric field that will be generated by the electrified electrode <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>, whether the electronic ink <b>150</b>, which is charged when the voltage source <b>120</b> applies a voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b>, is flowing is measured, and thus whether the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> have been electrified is determined. More preferably, this procedure includes applying a voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b>, eliminating the voltage from the pin probes <b>110</b>, and determining using the image comparison means <b>200</b> whether the electrodes <b>160</b> and <b>170</b> have been electrified, on the basis of measurements made using the camera <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">First, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the voltage source <b>120</b> applies the voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b>. When the voltage is applied, the electronic ink <b>150</b> flows to the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b> due to electrical attractive force, and does not flow to the other end of the unelectrified electrode <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the voltage applied to the pin probes <b>110</b> is eliminated When the flow of the electronic ink <b>150</b> stops, the voltage applied to the pin probes <b>110</b> is eliminated Even if the voltage is eliminated, the electronic ink <b>150</b> does not flow from the other end of the electrified electrode <b>160</b>, owing to bi-stability. Therefore, the voltage source <b>120</b> needs only to selectively apply a voltage to the pin probes <b>110</b> only when the electronic ink <b>150</b> is flowing, and thus there is an advantage of reducing power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified is determined by the image comparison means <b>200</b>, on the basis of measurements made using the camera <b>190</b>. The flow of the electronic ink <b>150</b> can be determined by the naked eye, but an image indicating whether the electronic ink <b>150</b> is flowing is captured by the camera <b>190</b> so as to perform more precise measurement, and thus whether the electronic ink <b>150</b> is flowing can be better determined. Thereafter, the image captured by the camera <b>190</b> is transmitted to the image comparison means <b>200</b>. In this case, a comparative image, obtained when the electrode is electrified (when the electrode is normal) is previously stored in the image comparison means <b>200</b>. The image comparison means <b>200</b> compares the image captured by the camera <b>190</b> with the comparative image, and thus determines whether the electrode <b>160</b> has been electrified.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As described above, the present invention is advantageous in that whether an electrode has been electrified is measured using charged electronic ink, so that the use of pin probes is limited only to one side of a substrate, thus reducing the entire cost required for inspection.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, the present invention is advantageous in that, when defects in which an electrode pad has become slightly unfastened and then an electrode is not electrified are present, whether the electrode has been electrified is measured using electrophoresis by which a pressure is not applied, thus preventing the occurrence of erroneous measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Furthermore, the present invention is advantageous in that, since pin probes need to come into contact with only one side of a substrate, measurement time is shortened, and in that, since current does not flow through the electrode, the breakdown of the electrode attributable to the generation of heat can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying claims.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The modifications or changes of the present invention belong to the scope of the present invention, and the detailed scope of the present invention will be more clearly understood by the accompanying claims.</p>
