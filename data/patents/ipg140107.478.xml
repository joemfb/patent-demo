<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus and a method for interacting with a mobile telephone are provided. A remote control unit receives a user command and transmits it to a TV system which recognizes the user command as a telephone function command and transmits the function command to the mobile telephone if the TV system is set to Telephone Mode. The TV system may also output data received from the mobile telephone in response to the transmitted function command. Thus, a user may interact with a mobile telephone using an interactive TV system by displaying text/image data received from the telephone and by inputting various telephone function commands using a remote control unit. Upon receiving a function command from the TV system, the mobile telephone generates output data in response to the function command and transmits itto the TV system. A display unit of the TV system displays the text/image data, and a speaker outputs the sound data. As a result, a user may conveniently interact with a mobile telephone using a display unit and a speaker of an interactive TV system with a remote control unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a system for a mobile telephone, and more particularly, to apparatus and method of interacting with a mobile telephone using an interactive television system with a remote control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As there have been high demands from many mobile telephone users, many mobile communication service providers have recently started to provide not only a simple telephonic communication service, but also various supplemental communication services such as an Internet service, text/voice/image message service, and electronic mailing service. In order for a user to use any one of the various supplement services mentioned above, the user must be able to view images that are displayed on a display unit of a mobile telephone and to input one or more desired commands into the mobile telephone by pressing one or more buttons provided on the mobile telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the sizes of the key buttons and display units of many existing mobile telephones are significantly limited due to the current trend toward smaller dimensions of the mobile telephones, and this create great inconveniences to many users for properly viewing the image and/or text data and inputting the desired commands by pressing the key buttons provided on the mobile telephones.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the present invention is directed to apparatus and method of interacting with a mobile telephone using an interactive television system that substantially obviates one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a method of interacting with a mobile telephone using an interactive television system that provides a significantly improved way of interacting with the mobile telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus of interacting with a mobile telephone using an interactive television system that provides a significantly improved way of interacting with the mobile telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, an apparatus of interacting with a mobile telephone according to the present invention includes a remote control unit receiving a user command from a user and remotely transmitting the user command, and a TV system connected to the mobile telephone. The TV system recognizes the user command remotely received from the remote control unit as a telephone function command and transmits the function command to the mobile telephone if the TV system is set to a telephone mode by the user.

Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an apparatus of interacting with a mobile telephone using an interactive television system (TV system) with a remote control unit in accordance with the present invention. As it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus includes a mobile telephone <b>100</b> being able to receive or transmit various communication data including text, image, and/or voice data from a sender or to a receiver; an interactive television system <b>300</b> that is connected to the mobile telephone <b>100</b> and is able to display various data received from the mobile telephone <b>100</b>; and a remote control unit <b>200</b> for enabling a user to set the interactive television system <b>300</b> to TV Mode or Telephone Mode. The television system <b>300</b> receives the output data from the mobile telephone <b>100</b> and displays the image/text data if the user has set the television system <b>300</b> to Telephone Mode.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The mobile telephone <b>100</b> includes a TV interface unit <b>110</b> for interfacing with the interactive television system <b>300</b> and further includes a controller (not illustrated) that gives a command for transmitting the output data corresponding to a telephone function command received from the television system <b>300</b>. A user sets the television system <b>300</b> to Telephone Mode for interacting with the mobile telephone <b>100</b> or to TV Mode for performing various TV-related functions such as channel up/down and volume up/down functions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The interactive television system <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a remote-control interface unit <b>313</b> for receiving one or more user commands from the remote control unit <b>200</b>; a telephone interface unit <b>319</b> connected to the mobile telephone <b>100</b> through a connection unit <b>320</b> for transmitting the user commands to the mobile telephone <b>100</b> and receiving the corresponding output data from the mobile telephone <b>100</b>; a microcomputer <b>314</b> generating a control signal for displaying a key index corresponding to Telephone Mode or TV Mode and for outputting the output data received from the mobile telephone <b>100</b>; a video/audio data processor <b>315</b> combining an original image signal with the key index and/or image/text data included in the output data received from the telephone <b>100</b>; and a display unit <b>317</b> displaying the combined data.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the interactive television system <b>300</b> further includes a tuner <b>310</b> receiving a broadcasting signal; an A/D converter <b>311</b> converting the analog broadcasting signal to a digital broadcasting signal; a link <b>312</b> checking and correcting any error included in the converted digital signal; a speaker <b>318</b> outputting a sound signal processed in the video/audio data processor <b>315</b> according to the control signal of the microcomputer <b>314</b>; and a memory <b>316</b> storing the program information of the microcomputer <b>314</b> or other information. The interactive television system <b>300</b> may provide not only the video/audio data of the digital broadcasting signal, but also various supplemental program information.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The general functions of the components of the television system <b>300</b> will now be described in detail. First, the tuner <b>310</b> receives various broadcasting signals including satellite, terrestrial, and cable broadcasting signals. Then the A/D converter <b>311</b> converts the broadcasting signals to digital signals and outputs the converted digital signals to the link <b>312</b>. The link <b>312</b> performs error checking and correcting functions and outputs compressed video/audio data streams. In accordance with a control signal generated by the microcomputer <b>314</b>, the video/audio data processor <b>315</b> performs a compensation function on the compressed data streams and converts the compensated data streams to analog image/voice signals. Then the video and audio signals are outputted through the display unit <b>317</b> and the speaker <b>318</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, when a user inputs a user command by pressing one or more key buttons provided on the remote control unit <b>200</b>, the remote-control interface unit <b>313</b> transmits the user command to the microcomputer <b>314</b>. Then the microcomputer <b>314</b> outputs a control signal for performing a desired function in response to the user command. Any graphic information generated by the microcomputer <b>314</b> upon receiving the user command from the remote control unit <b>200</b> or other graphic information related to the supplemental program information are transmitted to the video/audio data processing unit <b>315</b> via a data bus and are added to the original image signals in accordance with the control signal of the microcomputer <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The apparatus according to the present invention enables a user to interact with a mobile telephone <b>100</b> by displaying the output data received from the telephone <b>100</b> on the display unit <b>317</b> of the television system <b>300</b> and inputting any telephone function command into the mobile telephone <b>100</b> using the remote control unit <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The steps showing how the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> actually operates will now be described in detail. First of all, a user connects the mobile telephone <b>100</b> with the interactive television system <b>300</b> and sets the television system <b>300</b> to Telephone Mode or TV Mode by pressing a corresponding mode key button provided on the remote control unit <b>200</b> or on a key panel of the television system <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the microcomputer <b>314</b> receives a command setting the mode of the television system <b>300</b>, it generates a corresponding control signal in order for the video/audio data processor <b>315</b> to display a corresponding key index on the display unit <b>317</b> using an OSD function.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the television system <b>300</b> is set to Telephone Mode, the microcomputer <b>314</b> checks whether the mobile telephone <b>100</b> is connected to the television system <b>300</b>. Thereafter, when a user inputs a user command through the remote control unit <b>200</b> for controlling the mobile telephone <b>100</b>, the microcomputer <b>314</b> transmits a corresponding telephone function command to the mobile telephone <b>100</b>. Upon receiving the function command from the television system <b>300</b>, a controller of the telephone <b>100</b> generates a control signal in order to perform a corresponding telephone function such as viewing the phone numbers stored in the telephone <b>100</b> or viewing one of the text messages previously received.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Then the mobile telephone <b>100</b> transmits any data generated upon performing the function or any text/voice/image data received from an external source to the television system <b>300</b> via the TV interface unit <b>110</b>. Next, the television system <b>300</b> outputs the output data or text/voice/image data through the speaker <b>318</b> and/or the display unit <b>317</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The display unit <b>317</b> may display the text/image data received from the mobile telephone <b>100</b> in a predetermined portion of the display unit <b>317</b> with or without the regular images of the broadcasting signal. On the other hand, when the television system <b>300</b> being initially set to TV Mode receives a user command from the remote control unit <b>200</b> for performing a general TV function such as a power on/off, channel switching, and volume adjusting function, the microcomputer <b>314</b> generates a corresponding control signal so that the television system performs the desired TV function.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of interacting with a mobile telephone <b>100</b> using an interactive television system <b>300</b> according to the present invention. As shown in the figure, the microcomputer <b>314</b> included in the television system <b>300</b> initially checks whether the mobile telephone <b>100</b> is connected to the television system <b>300</b> through a connecting unit <b>320</b> (S<b>100</b>). If it is confirmed in the step S<b>100</b> that the mobile telephone <b>100</b> is connected to the television system <b>300</b>, the microcomputer <b>314</b> further checks whether a user has inputted a first command for Telephone Mode by pressing a Telephone Mode button provided on a remote control unit <b>200</b> or a key panel of the television system <b>300</b> (S<b>110</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If it is confirmed that the first command for Telephone Mode is received, the microcomputer <b>314</b> sets the television system <b>300</b> to Telephone Mode. Subsequently, a first key index corresponding to Telephone Mode is displayed on a predetermined portion of the display unit <b>317</b> of the television system <b>300</b> (S<b>120</b>). An example of the first key index that gets displayed on the display unit <b>317</b> as the television system <b>300</b> is set to Telephone Mode is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The first key index is an On Screen Display (OSD) type index indicating what each key button of the remote control unit <b>200</b> represents in Telephone Mode. For example, it includes a mode indicator indicating that the TV system is currently set to Telephone Mode.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">On the other hand, if it is found in the step S<b>110</b> that the first command for Telephone Mode is not inputted by the user, the microcomputer <b>314</b> checks whether the user has inputted a second command for TV Mode by pressing a TV Mode key button provided on the remote control unit <b>200</b> or the key panel of the television system <b>300</b> (S<b>130</b>). If it is confirmed in the step S<b>130</b> that the second command for TV Mode is received, the microcomputer <b>314</b> sets the television system <b>300</b> to TV Mode. Subsequently, a second key index corresponding to TV Mode gets displayed on a predetermined portion of a display unit <b>317</b> (S<b>140</b>). An example of the second key index that gets displayed on the display unit <b>317</b> as the television system <b>300</b> is set to TV Mode is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The second key index is also an On Screen Display (OSD) type index indicating what each key button of the remote control unit <b>200</b> represents in TV Mode. For example, it includes a mode indicator indicating that the TV system is currently set to TV mode.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After the television system <b>300</b> is set to either one of Telephone Mode or TV Mode, the microcomputer <b>314</b> further checks whether the user has inputted a user command by pressing any key button of the remote control unit other than the Telephone or TV Mode key button (S<b>150</b>). If it is found in the step S<b>150</b> that such user command is received from the remotely control unit <b>200</b>, the microcomputer <b>314</b> further checks whether the television system <b>300</b> is currently set to Telephone Mode or TV Mode (S<b>160</b>). If the present mode is Telephone Mode, the user command is recognized as a telephone function command, and a corresponding key code gets transmitted to the mobile telephone <b>100</b> through a telephone interface unit <b>319</b> (S<b>170</b>). On the other hand, if the present mode is found to be TV Mode, the user command is recognized as an ordinary TV function command, and the television system <b>300</b> performs a TV function corresponding to the TV function command (S<b>180</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Finally, the microcomputer <b>314</b> further checks whether any output data has been received from the mobile telephone <b>100</b> (S<b>190</b>). If it is confirmed that the output data has been received, the television system <b>300</b> performs a corresponding function according to the data received (S<b>200</b>). For example, it will display the text/image data included in the output data received from the mobile telephone <b>100</b> on the display unit <b>317</b> and output the sound data through the speaker <b>318</b>. The steps of S<b>150</b> to S<b>200</b> may be repeated until the user inputs no further user command. In addition, the first or second key index displayed in the step S<b>120</b> or S<b>140</b> may be undisplayed if it is determined that the user inputs no further user command</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the steps carrying out a method of interacting with a mobile telephone <b>100</b> using an interactive television system <b>300</b> according to the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, first of all, the controller (not illustrated) of the mobile telephone <b>100</b> checks whether the interactive television system <b>300</b> is connected to the mobile telephone <b>100</b> (S<b>300</b>). Next, if it is confirmed in the step S<b>300</b> that the television system <b>300</b> is connected to the mobile telephone <b>100</b>, it further checks whether any one of text, image, and voice messages is received from a message sender (S<b>310</b>). If the mobile telephone <b>100</b> has received such message, it transmits the message to the television system <b>300</b> (S<b>320</b>). Then the television system <b>300</b> displays the image or text message on the display unit <b>317</b> and outputs the voice message through the speaker <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">On the other hand, if it is found in the step S<b>310</b> that there is no data received, the controller of the mobile telephone <b>100</b> further checks whether any key code is received from the television system <b>300</b> (S<b>330</b>). If it is found in the step S<b>330</b> that the mobile telephone <b>100</b> received a key code from the television system <b>300</b>, then the mobile telephone performs a corresponding function and transmits output data that it generates upon performing the function to the television system (S<b>340</b>). Subsequently, the display unit <b>317</b> of the television system <b>300</b> displays the text/image data and outputs the sound data included in the output data through the speaker <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to the method of the present invention described above, a user is able to interact with a mobile telephone using an interactive television system by displaying the text/image data received from the telephone and by inputting various telephone function commands using a remote control unit. Upon receiving a function command from the television system that the user has inputted through the remote control unit, the output data that the mobile telephone generates in response to the function command is transmitted to television system. Finally the text/image data of the output data is displayed on a display unit of the television system and the sound data is outputted through a speaker. As a result, a user may conveniently interact with the mobile telephone using the display unit and speaker of the television system and a remote control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
