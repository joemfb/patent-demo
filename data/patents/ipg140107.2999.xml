<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods for producing oxidized cyclic phenol sulfides, which are useful as metal capture agents or solidifying agents wherein the metal-ion capturing ability thereof is used; optical sensors, ion sensors or substrate specific sensors wherein the recognizing ability of ions or molecules is used; materials for separation membranes and intermediates thereof, charge control agents; catalysts, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0003">Until now, as the method for producing an oxidized cyclic phenol sulfide, it is known that there is the method which comprises the step of oxidizing a corresponding cyclic phenol sulfide. Examples of oxidizing agents used for oxidation reaction include hydrogen peroxide, organic peroxides, peracids, halogen oxides, N-halogen compounds, halogen molecules, oxygen, ozone, a nitric acid, and inorganic oxides. Hydrogen peroxide, halogen molecules, and inorganic oxides such as sodium perborate are preferable among them. Though a preferable solvent varies depending on the kind of an oxidizing agent, it is proposed to use halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as chloroform and dichloromethane; alcohols such as methanol and ethanol; acetonitrile; polar solvents such as an acetic acid and water, and the like. Further, it is also known that, if necessary, catalysts such as vanadium (V) oxide, sodium metavanadate (V), titanium trichloride, tungsten (VI) oxide and sodium phosphate can be used in oxidation reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0004">Thus, various combinations of an oxidizing agent/a solvent/a catalyst are proposed to be used in oxidation of sulfide bond of a cyclic phenol sulfide of formula (A) (refer to Patent Literature 1, for example):</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0005"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003">

wherein X represents a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group, or an acyl group; Y represents a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group, a halogenated hydrocarbon group, &#x2014;COR1, &#x2014;OR2, &#x2014;COOR3, &#x2014;CN, &#x2014;CONH<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;NO<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;NR4R5, a halogen atom, &#x2014;SO<sub>4</sub>R6, or &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>R7, in which R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, and R7 each represents a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group; and 1 represents an integer of 4 to 12. However, the literature discloses that 10 to 50 mL of a solvent is preferably used per 1 g of a cyclic phenol sulfide, which is rather a large quantity of a solvent; that the reaction temperature is preferably 15 to 65&#xb0; C. when using an inorganic oxide, which is rather a mild range of the embodiment; and that the reaction is conducted for over 2 days until oxidation to a sulfonyl group is completed, which is a long period of time. Further, it discloses that phenolate substituent X is a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbon group or an acyl group. However, since a compound wherein X is a hydrogen atom is applied to a metal capture agent, purity of an oxidized compound wherein X is a hydrogen atom is not paid attention to. Practically, widely used is the method which comprises the step of oxidizing a cyclic phenol sulfide with sodium perborate or hydrogen peroxide in a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent(s) such as chloroform and in the presence of an acetic acid (refer to Non-patent Literatures 1 to 3, for example).
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0006">The reason why a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent is widely used is that though the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (A) is poorly soluble in most solvents, it is relatively well soluble in a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent such as chloroform as compared to other solvents. In addition to it, when using ketone, ester, or ether solvents as well as proposed alcohol solvents in the presence of an oxidizing agent, there are risks such as explosion and fire derived from the peroxide production of a solvent itself. This is also the reason why a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent such as chloroform is widely used. Thus, though a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent is practically widely used in oxidation of the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (A), usage thereof seriously damages the environment as is well known. Therefore, it would be difficult from both the cost and environmental aspects that a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent is applied on industrial scale where the usage amount thereof becomes large.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0007">Meanwhile, an oxidized cyclic phenol sulfide obtained by oxidizing the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (A) is actively studied as a substance which has a variety of possible industrial applicability such as a third-generation inclusion molecule and a static charge control agent which is studied by the present inventors.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0008">However, it is still impossible to develop the environmentally conscious and highly productive production method thereof which is applicable on industrial scale, and the compound is hardly industrially applicable. In order to promote wide use of such a useful substance on the industrial field, it has been eagerly desired to develop the production method thereof which is industrially applicable.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">In a cyclic phenol sulfide which is used as a raw material of the present invention, examples of a straight or branched alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms represented by R in the formula (1) include following groups: a methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, 2-propyl group, n-butyl group, sec-butyl group, 2-methylpropyl group, tert-butyl group, n-pentyl group, 1-methylbutyl group, 1-ethylpropyl group, 1,1-dimethylpropyl group, 1,2-dimethylpropyl group, n-hexyl group, 1-methylpentyl group, 2-methylpentyl group, 3-methylpentyl group, 4-methylpentyl group, 1-ethylbutyl group, 2-ethylbutyl group, 1,1-dimethylbutyl group, 1,2-dimethylbutyl group, 1,3-dimethylbutyl group, 1, 4-dimethylbutyl group, 2,2-dimethylbutyl group, 2,3-dimethylbutyl group, 3,3-dimethylbutyl group, 1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl group, and 1,1,2-trimethylpropyl group. Further, the cyclic phenol sulfide which is a raw material of the present invention can be filtered after the synthetic reaction thereof, and thus obtained crystals can be used as a raw material of oxidation reaction without a step of purifying said crystals.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">In an oxidized phenol sulfide of the formula (2) of the present invention, n is 1 or 2, and n of each molecules may be the same or different from each other, and it is preferable that each molecule satisfies 1.5 m&#x2266;N&#x2266;2 m when defining a total of n as N. Further preferable range of N is 1.7 m&#x2266;N&#x2266;2 m.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">Next, the method for producing an oxidized cyclic phenol sulfide of the present invention is illustrated. In the present invention, it is preferable that an organic carboxylic acid not comprising a halogen atom is used as a solvent used in the oxidation reaction. Examples thereof include an acetic acid, a propionic acid and a butyric acid, and an acetic acid is particularly preferable. According to the production method of the present invention, there is an advantage that oxidation proceeds even in the state where the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (1), which is a raw materials, is dispersed in a solvent(s). Thus, there is no need to use an extra amount of a solvent for preparing a solution state, and the reaction can be conducted in 2 or more and less than 10 parts by weight of an organic carboxylic acid per 1 part by weight of the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (1). 2 to 7 parts by weight thereof is preferable, and 3 to 5 parts by weight thereof is more preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">In the present invention, various oxidizing agents can be used as the oxidizing agent used in the oxidation reaction, e.g., hydrogen peroxide, sodium perborate, sodium perchlorate, and an m-chloroperbenzoic acid. Hydrogen peroxide water is preferable among them, and 35% hydrogen peroxide water is more preferable from the viewpoint of safe handling.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">Usage of hydrogen peroxide is preferably 4 to 24 in mole ratios per 1 mole of the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (1) and particularly preferably 8 to 16 in mole ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031">In the present invention, the reaction can be promoted by making a metal catalyst(s) coexist in the oxidation reaction. It is possible to use various metal catalysts such as vanadium (V) oxide, sodium metavanadate (V), tungsten (VI) oxide and sodium phosphate and cobalt acetate. A tungsten acid and sodium tungstate are preferable, and sodium tungstate is particularly preferable. The usage thereof is preferably 0.01 to 40 mol % per 1 mole of the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (1), and particularly preferably 10 to 20 mol %.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">The reaction rate can be increased without affecting the reaction composition by adding metal carboxylate in advance or during the reaction in addition to a metal catalyst(s). A preferable example of metal carboxylate which is a reaction accelerator is metal acetate, and sodium acetate is particularly preferable. The usage thereof is preferably 0.01 to 5 in mole ratios per 1 mole of a metal catalyst and more preferably 1 to 2.5 in mole ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">In the present invention, when using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent, it is preferable that hydrogen peroxide water is added dropwise under heating to a mixture comprising the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (1), a solvent, a catalyst and a reaction accelerator. Though it is possible to previously pour a total amount of hydrogen peroxide water together with the mixture and proceed with the reaction, it is particularly preferable to add it dropwise for safety. In the present invention, the start temperature of hydrogen peroxide oxidation is about 60&#xb0; C. When the temperature is lower than 60&#xb0; C., hydrogen peroxide accumulates and it carries runaway risk when heating. Therefore, in order to start oxidation safely and smoothly, it is preferable that the reaction mixture is previously heated up to 60&#xb0; C. and then hydrogen peroxide water is added dropwise thereto. Though this oxidation reaction is exothermic reaction and heat evolution is especially seen at the beginning of the reaction, the method of the present invention has an advantage of controlling heat evolution by controlling the drop rate of hydrogen peroxide. Basically, when and after adding dropwise hydrogen peroxide water in an amount of 8 molar equivalent per 1 mole of the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (1), heat evolution is hardly seen. Though the drop time is not particularly limited, it is preferably 1 to 3 hours. After the drop of an oxidizing agent (hydrogen peroxide water) is completed, the temperature may be maintained until the end of the reaction, or it is possible to speed up the reaction procedure by gradually heating. Though the heating temperature and the reaction time in said temperature are not particularly limited, it is preferable to conduct the reaction for 15 to 18 hours at 60&#xb0; C., then for 2 to 3 hours after heating it up to 70&#xb0; C., and then for 2 to 5 hours (more preferably 2 to 3.5 hours) after heating it up to 80&#xb0; C. or higher (more preferably 80&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">The oxidation reaction mixture, which exists in a solvent in dispersion state, is cooled down to appropriate temperature after the completion of the reaction, and, without any complicated treatment step, it is just filtered and washed to easily separate and obtain only a reaction product. Though the cooling temperature is not particularly limited, it is preferable to cool down the mixture to room temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">When using the reaction product of the present invention as a static charge control agent, it is preferable to add a mineral acid in mole ratios of 0.01 to 10, and more preferably 2 to 4 per 1 mole of the cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (1) at the end of the oxidation reaction. Though the temperature and time when adding a mineral acid are not particularly limited, it is preferable to add a mineral acid for 1 hour at 80&#xb0; C. which is the same temperature as the final temperature in the oxidation reaction. Since a part of the oxidized cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (2) which is the reaction product remains as metal phenolate, the object of this treatment with a mineral acid is to hydrolyze metal phenolate and decrease a content of metal salts of impurities in the oxidation product. In the case of not treating with a mineral acid, metal residual volume in the oxidized cyclic phenol sulfide of the formula (2) is beyond 1000 ppm and, therefore, decreased charging performance is seen. On the other hand, in the case of treating with a mineral acid, metal residual volume is limited to 1000 ppm or lower and, therefore, it is possible to obtain an oxidized cyclic phenol sulfide of which charging performance is not decreased. Examples of used mineral acids include a hydrochloric acid, a sulfuric acid, a nitric acid, a phosphoric acid, and a boric acid. Though a used mineral acid is not particularly limited, a hydrochloric acid is preferable since inorganic salts which are produced by hydrolysis are easily removed when filtering and washing.</p>
