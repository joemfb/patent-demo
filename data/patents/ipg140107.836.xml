<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A run/walk may include visible progress marking of participants. The run/walk may be marked including marking one or more color zones and marking a start line and a finish line. A start to the run/walk may be signaled. The participants may traverse the run/walk including traversing the color zones. At each color zone, a quantity of a colored substance may be propelled at the participants as they traverse the color zone. Each color zone may be associated with a color, and colored substance propelled at the participants in each color zone may include the associated color. After the run/walk is complete, markings for the run/walk may be removed. An article of clothing may include the visible progress markings after receiving the propelled quantity of the colored substance. The markings may be preserved on the article of clothing by adding vinegar and hot pressing the article of clothing.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Running has grown in popularity due to its health benefits and the positive feelings that it can generate. Many races of various lengths are held throughout the world. Races may include a plurality of participants, which can add a communal feeling and further enhance the joy brought from running. However, many people choose to forgo participating in races because they find them boring, unmemorable, and/or tedious, and/or they do not enjoy the competitiveness of timed races. A race may be made more memorable, interesting, and fun by creating a custom article of clothing during the race that will remind the participant of the race.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of a run/walk course <b>100</b> with visible progress marking of participants. A run/walk may be a timed race, an untimed traversing of a marked course, and/or the like. The run/walk may also be called a paint race even if no official time is kept for the event and/or no winner is declared. Visible progress marking of participants as they traverse the course <b>100</b> may enjoyably divert participants attention and make the run/walk less tedious and/or boring for the participants. Additionally, the visible progress markings may stylize and/or color one or more articles of clothing with unique markings indicative of experiences of a participant during and after traversal of the course. The participant can save the article as a reminder of the indicated experiences, which the participant may recall with fondness when reminded of the experiences. The visible progress markings may transform an unadorned article of clothing to an article of clothing with a plurality of indications of a plurality of corresponding events enjoyed by the participant. Alternatively or in addition, the visible progress markings may indicate a number of race segments completed by the participant.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A run/walk course <b>100</b> may be set up by marking the course <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Traversal of the run/walk by participants may begin with signaling <b>306</b> a start to the run/walk. Signaling may include emitting a first audible signal, displaying a visible signal, and/or the like. Examples of audible signals may include a gunshot, a horn blast, a tone, a vocal utterance, and/or the like. The audible signal may be digital and/or produced by a computer processor. The participants may receive the start signal and begin traversing the course <b>100</b> after the start signal is received. The participant may traverse the course, including crossing the start line <b>110</b>, traversing through the plurality of color zones <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, and crossing the finish line <b>160</b>. In an embodiment, the participants may be divided into a plurality of groups with different start times.

Quantities of a colored substance may be propelled <b>308</b> at the participants as each color zone <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> is traversed. For example, while the first participant <b>200</b> traverses the first color zone <b>120</b>, a first quantity of a colored substance <b>260</b> may be propelled at the participant <b>200</b>. The first quantity of the colored substance <b>260</b> may be configured to additionally disperse onto other participants when propelled at the first participant <b>200</b>.

The sold items may include t-shirts, tank tops, shorts, knee socks, hats, sunglasses, bandanas, sweatshirts, pants, wristbands, headbands, color packets containing the colored substance, and/or the like. The color tosses may include signaling <b>310</b> to a plurality of finished participants at the regular intervals that additional quantities of the colored substance should be dispersed into the air. The finished participants may disperse the additional quantities after receiving the signal. The finished participants may receive the additional quantities of the colored substance dispersed into the air, which may create additional visible markings <b>212</b> on the finished participants. The finished participants may throw the additional quantities of the colored substance up into the air to disperse the additional quantities. Signaling at regular intervals may include emitting a second audible signal at the regular intervals, such as a vocal utterance.
