<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A stormwater treatment system includes water treatment media that defines a helical flow path within a conduit. The water treatment media may include a plurality of helical water treatment media components that are constructed and arranged to seal against an inside surface of the conduit. The individual helical water treatment media components may be installed in situ within the conduit when the conduit is positioned within a chamber having an access opening, and periodically removed and replaced by passing the components to the access opening. The components further may have a flexible frame, which allows the water treatment media to dynamically adjust to swelling of the filtration media and other forces that may occur during use. The performance of the system may be adjusted by adjusting the helical pitch of the helical water treatment media components.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to the field of environmental remediation of stormwater. More specifically, this invention relates to an improved modular filtration system for a stormwater system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Technology</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Stormwater that is created by storm runoff in heavily developed areas is typically channeled into storm drainage systems that eventually drain into nearby streams, creeks, rivers or other bodies of water. For purposes of this document, stormwater includes not only storm runoff, but other sources of wastewater such as rinse water and melting snow and ice.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Paved surfaces that bear automobile traffic typically become coated with significant pollutants such as heavy metals and volatile organic compounds, both under normal traffic conditions and in particular when motor vehicle accidents occur. When normal rain or snowfall occurs, these pollutants tend to be swept away with the runoff stormwater and eventually lead to contamination of the bodies of water that eventually receive them. Such contamination has become a significant environmental issue in many areas. In addition, a significant amount of sediment and debris such as bottles and cans tends to be swept away by stormwater runoff. Some of the debris is heavier than water, and some of it has the tendency to float. Stormwater filtering systems have to be able to effectively filter both types of debris, in both ordinary and elevated flow conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Depending on the location of a stormwater system inlet, the primary environmental concern may be pollutants or it may be sedimentation and larger debris.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Systems exist for filtering stormwater runoff that are effective to some extent in removing debris from stormwater and in removing certain other pollutants, such as hydrocarbons. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,080,307 discloses a storm drain insert that contains one basket for the collection of debris as well as a canister that contains a hydrophobic, compliant, oil-absorbent copolymer material that is said to be effective in removing oil from the stormwater. Additional systems for removing pollutants such as heavy metals from stormwater have been commercialized by Fabco Industries Inc., the assignee of this application.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The removal of sedimentation and larger debris from stormwater requires a system that is simple to install and to service, since the collected sedimentation and debris will have to periodically be removed from the system. Water treatment media such as filtration media will also have to be periodically inspected and replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In any type of water treatment system, there is a trade-off between the amount of stormwater that the system can effectively process and the efficiency of the water treatment. In other words, for a given system, the greater the amount of stormwater to be processed, the less effective the treatment can be. Accordingly, it is advantageous to be able to design a system that is scalable for the anticipated flow rates in order to optimize water treatment efficiency and longevity of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A need exists for an improved system and process for processing sediment and debris laden stormwater that can be optimized for anticipated conditions, that is effective under all conditions, that is suitable for filtering all kinds of debris, and that is moreover inexpensive to deploy and cost-effective to service.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved system and process for processing sediment and debris laden stormwater that can be optimized for anticipated conditions, that is effective under all conditions, that is suitable for filtering all kinds of debris, pathogens, nutrients, oils and grease and that is moreover inexpensive to deploy and cost-effective to service.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to achieve the above and other objects of the invention, a stormwater treatment system according to a first aspect of the invention includes structure defining a first chamber for receiving stormwater; structure defining a second chamber; a conduit communicating the first and second chambers; and stormwater treatment media positioned within the conduit, the stormwater treatment media defining a substantially helical flow path for stormwater that passes through the conduit from the first chamber to the second chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A method of treating stormwater according to a second aspect of the invention includes steps of deploying stormwater treatment media that defines a substantially helical flow path within a conduit; and passing stormwater through the conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A modular helical water treatment media component according to a third aspect of the invention includes a flexible frame; and water treatment media attached to the flexible frame, the water treatment media being constructed and arranged to engage and substantially form a seal against an inner surface of a stormwater conduit, the water treatment media further defining a helical flow path for stormwater passing through the conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and various other advantages and features of novelty that characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and forming a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, its advantages, and the objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to the accompanying descriptive matter, in which there is illustrated and described a preferred embodiment of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding structure throughout the views, and referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a stormwater treatment system <b>10</b> that is constructed according to a preferred embodiment of the invention includes a base portion <b>12</b>, a riser portion <b>14</b> and a top slab portion <b>16</b>, each of which is preferably fabricated from a reinforced precast concrete material. The purpose of the riser portion <b>14</b> is to ensure that the access openings <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> discussed below are accessible from grade level. In some cases, it is not necessary to use the riser portion <b>14</b>. In those cases, the top slab portion <b>16</b> fits directly on the base portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Stormwater treatment system <b>10</b> includes structure defining a first influent chamber <b>18</b> for receiving stormwater and a second effluent chamber <b>20</b> into which treated stormwater is released.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The top slab portion <b>16</b> has a first access opening <b>22</b>, positioned substantially over the first chamber <b>18</b>, that is closable by a removable cover <b>24</b> and a second access opening <b>26</b>, positioned substantially over the second chamber <b>20</b>, which is closable by a removable cover <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The stormwater treatment system <b>10</b> includes at least one conduit <b>30</b> communicating the first and second chambers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. Stormwater treatment media <b>32</b> is preferably positioned within the conduit <b>30</b>. The stormwater treatment media <b>32</b> advantageously defines a pair of substantially helical flow paths <b>35</b>, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for stormwater that passes through the conduit <b>30</b> from the first chamber <b>18</b> to the second chamber <b>20</b>. Stormwater treatment media <b>32</b> also preferably has a substantially helical shape, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the preferred embodiment, stormwater treatment media <b>32</b> is shaped as a double helix.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the preferred embodiment, stormwater treatment system <b>10</b> further includes a second conduit <b>34</b>, which also communicates the first and second chambers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> and has stormwater treatment media <b>32</b> positioned therein.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the first and second conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> preferably has a strainer and diffuser assembly <b>36</b> mounted adjacent to an inlet opening <b>31</b> of the respective conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>. Each of the conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> further include a second, outlet opening <b>33</b> which is in communication with the second, effluent chamber <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The inner wall of the stormwater treatment system <b>10</b> may be provided with a pair of anchors <b>38</b> for releasably holding a deployment and recovery tool <b>74</b>, which will be discussed in greater detail below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The stormwater treatment system <b>10</b> further includes an inlet <b>40</b> for admitting stormwater into the first, influent chamber <b>18</b> and an outlet <b>42</b> for permitting treated stormwater to exit the second, effluent chamber <b>20</b>. The first chamber <b>18</b> is partially defined by a wall <b>44</b> that is part of the base portion <b>12</b> and includes an upper edge <b>45</b>. The space that is defined between the upper edge <b>45</b> of the wall <b>44</b> and the underside of the top slab <b>16</b> forms an emergency bypass or overflow path that permits untreated stormwater to pass from the first chamber <b>18</b> to the second chamber <b>20</b> without entering either of the conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The base portion <b>12</b> further includes first and second saddle portions <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, which support the first and second conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the first and second conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> are both positioned so that they are substantially horizontal, with their inlets <b>31</b> being at substantially the same elevation as their outlets <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows, brackets <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> are preferably used to secure the conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> and position relative to the saddle portions <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, with connectors <b>52</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> being used to secure the brackets <b>50</b>, <b>54</b> to the respective saddle portion <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows, each of the conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> preferably has a substantially smooth inner surface <b>60</b>. The stormwater treatment media that is positioned in either of the conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> is preferably embodied as a plurality of filter segments <b>62</b>, each of which has a substantially helical shape having a pitch defined by an angle a, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Preferably, the angle &#x3b1; is substantially within a range of about 65 degrees to about 87 degrees, more preferably substantially within a range of about 70 degrees to about 85 degrees and most preferably substantially within a range of about 75 degrees to about 82 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Filter segments <b>62</b> also have a pitch P, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, that is preferably substantially within a range of about 2 inches to about 10 inches, more preferably substantially within a range of about 3 inches to about 9 inches and most preferably substantially within a range of about 4 inches to about 8 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to one advantageous aspect of the invention, the treatment performance of the stormwater treatment media <b>32</b> may be preset or adjusted by setting or varying the pitch of the individual filter segments <b>32</b>. By increasing the pitch, a greater flowrate becomes possible, but with less effective filtration. By decreasing the pitch, the design flow rate becomes less but the filtration is more effective.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, each of the individual filter segments <b>32</b> is sized so that it may be inserted and withdrawn through the access opening <b>22</b>. Each of the filter segments <b>32</b> is preferably constructed so as to be slidable along the substantially smooth inner surface <b>60</b> of the respective conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> when it is being inserted and removed from the conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>, and further is constructed to flexibly engage the inner surface <b>60</b> and seal against the inner surface <b>60</b> so as to define a constrained helical flow path <b>35</b>. The filter segments <b>32</b> are preferably deployed within the respective conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> in situ, in a manner that will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which is an assembly view of a filter segment <b>62</b> that is constructed according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the filter segment <b>62</b> includes a longitudinally extending threaded rod <b>64</b>, which is used to connect a plurality of helical elements <b>70</b>. Each of the helical elements <b>70</b> includes a flexible wire frame <b>66</b> having a hole <b>67</b> for receiving the threaded rod <b>64</b>. A media sleeve <b>68</b> is fitted over each end of the flexible wire frame <b>66</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the media sleeve <b>68</b> is fabricated from filtration media, such as a foam material or a fabric material. Depending on the target pollutant, Open Cell Foam (Bacteria, Nutrients, Heavy Metals) or Hydrophobic Fabric (Hydrocarbons) may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The filter segment <b>62</b> accordingly defines a double helix having two separate helical flow paths <b>35</b>. Stormwater can move from one end of one of the flow path <b>35</b> to a second, opposite end, or it can penetrate the media sleeve <b>68</b> and enter into the second flow path <b>35</b>, thereby being filtered.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">All filters tend to blind over time. In most filter systems, this results in the front filters blinding first, preventing water from reaching the subsequent filters. However, the helical filter system described herein is unique in that has the front portion of the helix begins to blind due to pollutants, the water will naturally climb through the helical filter path <b>35</b> is necessary, thereby contacting fresh media as needed. Over the life of the filter, this results in an evenly spent filter. In other words, efficient use of the filtration media is optimized.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows, at least one of the media sleeves <b>68</b> is preferably long enough so as to bend against the smooth inner surface <b>60</b> of the conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> and form a seal with respect to the surface <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A connector <b>72</b> having an eye hook <b>73</b> is threaded over each end of the threaded rod <b>64</b> for holding the assembly together. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates, the eye hook <b>73</b> may be engaged by the end of the tool <b>74</b> in order to insert or remove the filter segments <b>62</b> from the inside of the respective conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The stormwater treatment system <b>10</b> benefits from regular maintenance intervals to remain effective as a stormwater filter. Maintenance requirements and frequency are dependent on the pollutant load characteristics of the site of deployment. The influent and effluent chambers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> should be cleaned of any collected oil, trash, debris and sediment that may inhibit filter performance. Inspection personnel may access the interior of the system <b>10</b> through the access openings <b>22</b>, <b>26</b> in order to periodically inspect the condition of the system <b>10</b>, including the stormwater treatment media <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If replacement of the helical filter segments <b>62</b> is determined to be necessary, the access covers <b>24</b>, <b>28</b> will be removed, permitting venting of the interior chamber of the system <b>10</b>. The interior of the chambers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> may be cleaned with the use of an external vacuum device, such as a vacuum truck.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Removal of the helical filter segments <b>62</b> is preferably performed from the first, influent chamber <b>18</b>. A ladder is used to enter the influent chamber <b>18</b>, and the diffuser assembly <b>36</b> is removed from each of the conduits <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>. Each diffuser assembly <b>36</b> is preferably attached to the housing by means of releasable fasteners such as wing nuts. A pair of pliers may be required to loosen the wing nuts.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With the diffuser assembly <b>36</b> removed, the helical filter segments <b>62</b> are exposed and can be pulled directly out of the respective conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>. In the preferred embodiment, each conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> will include five separate helical filter segments <b>62</b>. The individual helical filter segments <b>62</b> are preferably not directly connected to each other. The tool <b>74</b> is preferably used to engage the eye hooks <b>73</b> of the respective filter segments <b>62</b> in order to remove the helical filter segment <b>62</b> from the respective conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>. In the event that one of the helical filter segments <b>62</b> cannot be removed manually using the tool <b>74</b>, one or more of the anchors <b>38</b> may be used in conjunction with a mechanical force amplifying device such as a ratchet pulling device or crank puller.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The filter segments <b>62</b> are preferably removed one at a time and located under the access opening <b>22</b>, where they may be lifted out of the system <b>10</b> through the access opening <b>22</b>. A mechanical lifting device may be used in order to lift the filter segments <b>62</b> out of the system <b>10</b>. Advantageously, the eye hook <b>73</b> is constructed so as to be able to bear the full weight of a saturated filter segment <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After the filter segments <b>62</b> have been removed, the interior of the respective conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> is inspected for damage. Any sediment and debris is removed prior to inserting new filter segments <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The new filter segments <b>62</b> are preferably lowered through the access opening <b>22</b> with the aid of a mechanical lifting device, with the full weight of the filter segments <b>62</b> being borne by the eye hook <b>73</b>. Each of the filter segments <b>62</b> is carefully pushed into the respective conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>. Each of the filter segments <b>62</b> is preferably assembled (stacking the wire frames) in a counter-clockwise direction. This allows the filter segment <b>62</b> to be installed in the conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> in either direction and insures that the helical paths <b>35</b> through the conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> are in a continuous direction. Once the filter segments <b>62</b> are properly positioned within the respective conduit <b>30</b>, <b>34</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the diffuser assembly <b>26</b> is replaced.</p>
