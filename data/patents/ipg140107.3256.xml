<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor circuit employing quantum dot structures and methods of manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As dimensions of semiconductor devices scale down to nanometer scale, quantum effects are manifested in semiconductor devices. One type of quantum effect is quantization of electrical charges in the volume of the semiconductor device. For example, a semiconductor cube having a dimension of about 21.5 nm on each side has a total volume of about 10<sup>4 </sup>nm<sup>3</sup>, which is 10<sup>&#x2212;17 </sup>cm<sup>3</sup>. If the semiconductor cube has a dopant concentration of 10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, a single dopant atom is present in the volume of the semiconductor cube. Dopant concentration levels from about 10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 10<sup>21 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, which are typically employed in semiconductor devices, correspond to numbers of dopant atoms from about 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>to about 10<sup>4 </sup>in such a semiconductor cube.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">By forming an isolated semiconductor island having dimensions on the order of tens of nanometers and providing a suitable doping level in the semiconductor material, the number of electrical charges in the isolated semiconductor island may be a single digit number or double digit numbers. In such a structure, quantization of electrical charge is reflected in electrical characteristics of the isolated semiconductor island. Such structures are referred to as &#x201c;quantum dot&#x201d; structures in which states of excitons are spatially bound in nanoscale dimensions and display quantum effects.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Scaling of conventional field effect transistors having source and drain regions that abut a body region having an opposite type of doping than the source and drain regions suffer from leakage current in an off state. As the dimensions of the field effect transistor scale down, the off-state leakage current increases. The problem becomes even more complicated when the operational voltage of the field effect transistor is also reduced. Since the voltage swing on the gate of the field effect transistor has a small magnitude, e.g., less than 1.2 V, the ratio between the on-current and the off-current of the transistor decreases with the scaling of physical dimensions and reduction of the operational voltage. A semiconductor circuit containing such field effect transistors consumes a large amount of power even in an off-state. Thus, semiconductor circuits containing conventional field effect transistors face tremendous difficulty in reducing power as the dimensions of semiconductor devices scale down.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above, there exists a need for a semiconductor circuit that offers an equivalent functionality of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) circuits while providing a low leakage current below the level of scaled-down versions of semiconductor circuits employing conventional metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), and methods of manufacturing the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a semiconductor circuit that employs a plurality of semiconductor devices that provide electronic switching employing a quantum dot structure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The semiconductor circuit of the present invention includes a plurality of semiconductor devices, each including a semiconductor islands having at least one electrical dopant atom and located on an insulator layer. Each semiconductor island is encapsulated by dielectric materials including at least one dielectric material portion. The at least one dielectric material layer includes portions having a thickness less than 2 nm to enable quantum tunneling effects. Conductive material portions, at least one of which abut two dielectric material portions that abut two distinct semiconductor islands, are located directly on the at least one dielectric material layer. At least one gate conductor is provided which overlies at least two semiconductor islands. Conduction across a dielectric material portion between a semiconductor island and a conductive material portion is effected by quantum tunneling. The conductive material portions and the at least one gate conductor are employed to form a semiconductor circuit having a low leakage current. An inverter, a NAND gate, a NOR gate, or logic gates similar to the logic gates employed in metal-semiconductor-oxide field effect transistor (MOSFET) circuits may be formed. A design structure for the semiconductor circuit is also provided.</p>

The thickness of the top semiconductor layer <b>30</b> may be from about 5 nm to about 200 nm, and typically from about 10 nm to about 100 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses are also contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, a photoresist <b>33</b> is applied over the top surface of the top semiconductor layer <b>30</b>. The photoresist <b>33</b> is lithographically patterned to define a plurality of islands of the photoresist <b>33</b>. The pattern in the photoresist <b>33</b> is transferred into the top semiconductor layer <b>30</b> by an etch, which may be an anisotropic etch such as a reactive ion etch (RIE). The etch proceeds to the top surface of the buried insulator layer <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each of the semiconductor portions may be doped with electrical dopants of p-type or n-type. Block level masks may be employed to selectively dope some semiconductor portions, while blocking other semiconductor portions. For example, the first semiconductor portion <b>32</b>A may be doped with dopants of a first conductivity type, and the second semiconductor portion <b>32</b>B may be doped with dopants of a second conductivity type, in which the second conductivity type is the opposite of the first conductivity type.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The total number dopant atoms in each semiconductor portion (<b>32</b>A or <b>32</b>B) is obtained by multiplying the volume of the semiconductor portion (<b>32</b>A or <b>32</b>B) and the dopant concentration of the semiconductor portion (<b>32</b>A or <b>32</b>B). For each semiconductor portion (<b>32</b>A or <b>32</b>B), the total number of dopants is less than about 100, i.e., from 1 to about 100. The total number of dopants may be from 1 to about 50, and typically from about 10 to about 25.</p>
