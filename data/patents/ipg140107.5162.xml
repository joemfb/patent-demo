<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0078854, filed on Aug. 16, 2010, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates to electrodes for a living body and devices for detecting bio-signals, and more particularly, to electrodes for a living body which have a reduced size for improved user convenience and which are capable of stably acquiring fine signals, and to devices for detecting bio-signals using the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, connected healthcare systems for detecting various bio-signals in daily life have been developed. For example, the detection of bio-signals may be used to improve accuracy and convenience of diagnosis, to help the telediagnosis of medical staff by providing health-related services through databases of personal health information, to deliver results of diagnosis/prescriptions, and the like. A living body is a type of conductor, and a number of minute electric currents are generated therein. Accordingly, an inner condition of a living body may be detected by detecting such minute electric currents or by detecting changes in electric currents with respect to external stimuli in the living body. Generally, various bio-signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), galvanic skin resistance (GSR), electrooculography (EOG), body temperature, heartbeat, pulse, blood pressure, body movement, and the like, may be detected, and an electrode for a living body may be used to detect changes in such bio-signals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An electrode for a living body that is attached to the skin of a user may act as a medium for connecting the living body of the user to a detecting system. This attached electrode may affect the quality of detected bio-signals and user convenience. In order for an electrode to be attached to the living body of a user and to detect bio-signals of the user at all times, various technical problems with respect to accuracy of detection, communication, power consumption, and the like, need to be addressed. In addition, the electrode should be easy to use.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, an electrode that is attached to a living body as a wearable sensor should be miniaturized to be of small size and to be lightweight. A generally used electrode for a living body may be manufactured to be disposable based on performance and user convenience. When an electrode for a living body is attached to the skin of a user and the user moves for an extended period of time thereafter, it may be difficult to acquire accurate signals. For example, the accuracy of the signal may be affected due to weakened adhesiveness of the electrode attached to his or her body and/or evaporation of electrolytes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one general aspect, there is provided an electrode for a living body for connecting the living body to a signal processing module, the electrode comprising an insulation sheet comprising at least one via hole, an electrode unit formed in the at least one via hole, and a guiding unit configured to guide the attachment of the signal processing unit to the electrode for a living body.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The following detailed description is provided to assist the reader in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the methods, apparatuses, and/or systems described herein. Accordingly, various changes, modifications, and equivalents of the methods, apparatuses, and/or systems described herein will be suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art. Also, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions may be omitted for increased clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a device for detecting bio-signals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of an exploded perspective view of an electrode for a living body, which may be employed by the device for detecting bio-signals of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of a cross-sectional view of the electrode for a living body of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a device for detecting bio-signals <b>100</b> includes an electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and a signal processing module <b>120</b>. The electrode for a living body <b>110</b> may be attached to a living body, and the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be attached to the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>. For example, an electrolyte cream containing an electrolyte may be used to attach the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> to a living body. As an example, the electrolyte cream may be applied to the skin, and then the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> may be attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> includes an insulation sheet <b>111</b>, a guiding unit <b>112</b>, an electrode unit <b>113</b>, and first and second protection films <b>115</b> and <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this example, the insulation sheet <b>111</b> is a flexible flat panel member, and a via hole <b>111</b><i>a </i>is formed near the center of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. For example, the insulation sheet <b>111</b> may be formed of a nonconductive material or an insulation material. For example, the insulation sheet <b>111</b> may be formed of an insulation resin, an insulation fiber, paper, a combination thereof, and the like. The rectangular shape of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is merely for purposes of example, and it should be appreciated that the insulation sheet <b>111</b> may be formed of various shapes including circular shapes, polygonal shapes, and the like. An electrode unit <b>113</b> may be inserted into the via hole <b>111</b><i>a</i>. Although the via hole <b>111</b><i>a </i>has a circular shape in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the via hole <b>111</b> may be formed of various shapes, for example, elliptical shapes, rectangular shapes, polygonal shapes, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the via hole <b>111</b><i>a </i>is formed at or near the center of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. However, the device is not limited thereto, and it should be understood that one or more via holes <b>111</b><i>a </i>may be located at any desired location of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The guiding unit <b>112</b> may be formed as an outer wall structure protruding at edges of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. For example, the guiding unit <b>112</b> may be formed by folding edges of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> or by attaching separately formed outer walls to edges of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. In this example, the guiding unit <b>112</b> is formed at three edges of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> except for the edge of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> at which a tab portion <b>115</b><i>b </i>protrudes from the first protection film <b>115</b> out of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. It should be appreciated that the guiding unit <b>112</b> is not limited to this design. For example, the guiding unit <b>112</b> may be formed at at least one edge of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> other than the edge of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> at which the tab portion <b>115</b><i>b </i>protrudes from the first protection film <b>115</b> out of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. As another example, if the insulation sheet <b>111</b> has a circular shape or a polygonal shape, the guide unit <b>112</b> may be correspondingly formed at some or all of the edges of the circular shape or the polygonal shape. The outer wall structure is an example of protruding portions for defining the location of the signal processing unit <b>120</b>, and the guiding unit <b>112</b> may provided on an inner side of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5D</figref>, the guiding unit <b>112</b> guides the attachment of the signal processing unit <b>120</b> to be attached to the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>. Furthermore, the guiding unit <b>112</b> may prevent the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and/or the signal processing module <b>120</b> from being pushed with the first protection film <b>115</b> while the first protection film <b>115</b> is being removed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The electrode unit <b>113</b> may transmit minute electric currents in a living body to the signal processing unit <b>120</b>. In this example, the electrode unit <b>113</b> includes a device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>and a living body contacting portion <b>113</b><i>b</i>. For example, the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the living body contacting portion <b>113</b><i>b </i>may be formed of a conductive and adhesive material. Because the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>has an adhesiveness, the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>may be attached to the bottom surface (<b>121</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the signal processing module <b>120</b> and may maintain valid adhesiveness. Any desired conductive and adhesive materials may be used. As a non-exhaustive example, a hydro gel may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the living body contacting portion <b>113</b><i>b </i>may be connected to each other as a single body via the via hole <b>111</b><i>a</i>. For example, the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the living body contacting portion <b>113</b><i>b </i>may be formed by molding melted or liquid hydro gel on both surfaces of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. For example, the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the living body contacting portion <b>113</b><i>b </i>may be formed simultaneously by spraying liquid hydro gel to regions around the via hole <b>111</b><i>a </i>on both surfaces of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> and compressing the applied hydro gel using molds at both surfaces of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example in which the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the living body contacting portion <b>113</b><i>b </i>of the electrode unit <b>113</b> are placed in the via hole <b>111</b><i>a</i>, the device is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the living body contacting portion <b>113</b><i>b </i>may be formed to spread on regions on both surfaces of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> around the via hole <b>111</b>. Because the electrode unit <b>113</b> is attached to the signal processing module <b>120</b> by an adhesive, the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>may be formed to have a thin planar shape, and thus the overall thickness of the electrode unit <b>113</b> may be reduced. Furthermore, because the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>and a terminal <b>123</b> of the signal processing module <b>120</b> simply contact surface by surface to each other, the thickness of the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be reduced. Furthermore, a signal transmission process from the skin to a circuit may be reduced because the thickness of the signal processing module <b>120</b> is reduced. Dynamic noises may also be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The insulation sheet <b>111</b> and the electrode unit <b>113</b> may be flexibly deformed, and thus may be easily and adaptively attached to a location. To improve a mechanical combination between the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and the signal processing module <b>120</b> for providing a stable detecting environment, an adhesive material may be applied to the edges of the top surface of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> around the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a</i>. As another example, an adhesive material may be applied to the edges of the bottom surface of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> around the living body contacting portion <b>113</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this example, the first protection film <b>115</b> includes a protection portion <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the tab portion <b>115</b><i>b</i>, which is an extended portion of the protection portion <b>115</b><i>a</i>. For example, the protection portion <b>115</b><i>a </i>may be formed to completely cover the surface of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> contacting the signal processing module <b>120</b>. The protection portion <b>115</b><i>a </i>may protect an adhesive applied to the surface of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> contacting the signal processing module <b>120</b> to maintain the performance of the adhesive. For example, the protection portion <b>115</b><i>a </i>may have a double layer structure formed by folding a single protection film. In this example, an upper layer of the protection portion <b>115</b><i>a </i>toward the signal processing module <b>120</b> may extend and form the tab portion <b>115</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The second protection film <b>118</b> may protect an adhesive applied to the surface of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> contacting a living body to maintain the performance of the adhesive. For example, the second protection film <b>118</b> may be formed to completely cover the opposite surface of the surface of the insulation sheet <b>111</b> that contacts the signal processing module <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the signal processing unit <b>120</b> includes a substrate <b>121</b>, on which electronic parts <b>125</b> for processing signals are mounted, and the terminal <b>123</b> that contacts the electrode unit <b>113</b> of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, the substrate <b>121</b> may have a rectangular shape housed in the guiding unit <b>112</b>, which forms the outer wall structure of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. As another example, if the guiding unit <b>112</b> is formed to have a circular shape or a polygonal shape, the substrate <b>121</b> may be formed to have a circular shape or a polygonal shape in correspondence to the shape of the guiding unit <b>112</b>. As another example, if the guiding unit <b>112</b> is formed on the middle of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>, grooves into which the guiding unit <b>112</b> is inserted may be formed in the bottom surface <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some examples, the insulation sheet <b>111</b> may include a plurality of via holes <b>111</b><i>a </i>that each include a respective electrode unit <b>113</b> formed therein. In addition, the signal processing unit <b>120</b> may include a plurality of terminals <b>123</b> at locations corresponding to the locations of the plurality of electrode units <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The substrate <b>121</b> may be formed as a flexible circuit board, which may be flexibly deformed, and may be deformed in correspondence to deformation of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>. As another example, the substrate <b>121</b> may be formed of a rigid material. If the substrate <b>121</b> is formed of a rigid material, the terminal <b>123</b> may be formed to have flexibility, such that the terminal <b>123</b> may move in correspondence to a deformation of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The terminal <b>123</b> may be exposed on the bottom surface <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>12</b><i>a</i>, and the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be attached to the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>, such that the bottom surface <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>121</b> is located on the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a</i>. For example, a silicon releasing agent may be applied onto the bottom surface <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>121</b>. If the adhesive applied to the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> has strong adhesive power, the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be damaged when the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> is removed. Therefore, the silicon releasing agent may prevent the signal processing module <b>120</b> from being damaged by easing the removal of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Because the electrode unit <b>113</b> and the terminal <b>123</b> may contact each other via flat surfaces, resistance between the electrode unit <b>113</b> and the terminal <b>123</b> may be reduced due to a surface contact. Therefore, even minute electric currents in a living body may be effectively transmitted to the terminal <b>123</b> of the signal processing module <b>123</b>, and thus, signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Because the device contacting portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the electrode unit <b>113</b> has an adhesive power, the electrode unit <b>113</b> may be kept attached to the signal processing module <b>120</b> without a separate fixing mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of a signal processing module. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, signal processing module <b>120</b> includes an analog signal processing unit <b>126</b>, an analog to digital (A/D) converter <b>127</b>, a digital signal processing unit <b>128</b>, and a wired/wireless transmitting/receiving module <b>129</b>, which may be connected to the terminal <b>123</b> of the bottom surface <b>121</b><i>a </i>of the substrate <b>121</b> in the order stated, or in a different order.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The analog signal processing unit <b>126</b> may amplify and/or filter minute electric currents transmitted from the terminal <b>123</b> such as analog signals and may transmit the amplified or filtered analog signals to the A/D converter <b>127</b>. The A/D converter <b>127</b> converts the transmitted analog signals to digital signals and may transmit the converted digital signals to the digital signal processing unit <b>128</b>. The digital signal processing unit <b>128</b> may process the converted digital signals, for example, the digital signal processing unit <b>128</b> may process the converted digital signals according to a programmed algorithm. The wired/wireless transmitting/receiving module <b>129</b> may transmit the digital signals processed by the digital signal processing unit <b>128</b> to an external device. For example, the wired/wireless transmitting/receiving module <b>129</b> may transmit the digital signals by a wired and/or a wireless connection, and may receive an operating signal from the external device.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As described above, the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be connected to an external device by wire or wirelessly, and may transmit information regarding bio-signals of a wearer, such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), electroencephalogram (EEG), galvanic skin resistance (GSR), while being attached to a living body. As another example, a memory (not shown) may be disposed in the signal processing module <b>120</b> instead of the wired/wireless transmitting/receiving module <b>129</b>, and thus digital signals processed by the digital signal processing unit <b>128</b> may be stored in the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5D</figref> illustrate examples of a device for detecting bio-signals in which the signal processing module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is attached to the electrode for a living body of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be aligned with the guiding unit <b>112</b> of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and may be attached onto the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>. For example, the guiding unit <b>112</b> may guide the signal processing module <b>120</b> such that the electrode unit <b>113</b> of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and the terminal <b>123</b> of the signal processing module <b>120</b> are aligned. Because the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be formed of flexible materials, alignment between the signal processing module <b>120</b> and the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> may be easily dislocated while the signal processing module <b>120</b> is being attached to the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>. However, in the device described herein, because the electrode unit <b>113</b> and the terminal <b>123</b> are aligned with each other based on the guiding unit <b>112</b>, an electrical path of bio-signals detected by the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> may be secured, and the impedance between the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, while the signal processing module <b>120</b> is aligned with the guiding unit <b>112</b> of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>, the tab portion <b>115</b><i>b </i>of the first protection film <b>115</b> may be pulled. In this example, as the tab portion <b>115</b><i>b </i>is pulled, the upper layer of the protection portion <b>115</b><i>a </i>is pulled out, and an edge <b>115</b><i>c </i>of the first protection film <b>115</b> is separated from the top surface of the insulation sheet <b>111</b>. Accordingly, as the edge <b>115</b><i>c </i>of the first protection film <b>115</b> is sequentially pulled out from the insulation sheet <b>111</b>, the first protection film <b>115</b> may be removed while the signal processing module <b>120</b> is arranged on the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>. In this example, because the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and the signal processing module <b>120</b> are formed of flexible materials, the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and/or the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be pushed with the first protection film <b>115</b> while the first protection film <b>115</b> is being removed. In this example, the guiding unit <b>112</b> prevents the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> or the signal processing module <b>120</b> from being pushed by the first protection film <b>115</b> while the first protection film <b>115</b> is being removed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, when the first protection film <b>115</b> is removed from the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>, the signal processing module <b>120</b> may directly contact and may be adhered to the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It should be appreciated that the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and the signal processing module <b>120</b> may be combined before or after the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> is attached to a living body. For example, if the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and the signal processing module <b>120</b> are combined after the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> is attached to a living body, the second protection film <b>118</b> may be omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A through 5D</figref>, and the electrode for the living body <b>110</b> may be placed directly in contact with a living body. Accordingly, the device for detecting bio-signals <b>100</b> may be placed in direct contact with a living body.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The device for detecting bio-signals <b>100</b> resolves mechanical combinations of the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and the signal processing module <b>120</b> by using a conductive adhesive. Therefore, the overall thickness of the device for detecting bio-signals <b>100</b> may be reduced, and user convenience may be improved by easily combining the electrode for a living body <b>110</b> and the signal processing module <b>120</b> using the guiding unit <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> illustrate a case in which only one electrode unit <b>113</b> is formed in the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>, it should be appreciated that the bio-signal sensing device may include a plurality of electrode units <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example of a device for detecting bio-signals according to a modification of the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, device for detecting bio-signals <b>100</b>&#x2032; includes an electrode for a living body <b>110</b>&#x2032; that includes a plurality of electrode units <b>113</b>&#x2032; for detecting changes at a plurality of locations. In this example, a plurality of terminals <b>123</b>&#x2032; are formed in a signal processing module <b>120</b>&#x2032;. As the number of electrode units <b>113</b>&#x2032; and terminals <b>123</b>&#x2032; increase, it may be more difficult to combine the electrode for a living body <b>110</b>&#x2032; and the device for detecting bio-signals <b>100</b>&#x2032;, which are flexible, in precise alignment. However, the guiding unit <b>112</b> may enable precise alignment between the plurality of terminals <b>123</b>&#x2032; and the plurality of electrode units <b>113</b>&#x2032; even when a plurality of electrode units and terminals are used.</p>
