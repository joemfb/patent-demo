<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various types of cleaning tools with a sheet-type cleaning element are known for wiping an object to be cleaned. For example, Japanese non-examined laid-open Patent Publication No. 9-154791 discloses a cleaning tool having cleaning fabric and a holder that detachably holds the cleaning fabric inserted into a holding region of the cleaning fabric. While the known cleaning tool is capable of wiping a face to be cleaned by using the cleaning fabric held via the holder, it is required to provide a further effective technique for enhancing cleaning effect.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide effective technique for a higher cleaning effect and higher operability of a cleaning element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above-described object is achieved by claimed invention. As one aspect of the invention, a cleaning element is provided which may be applied to faces to be cleaned such as floors, walls, ceilings, external walls, furniture, clothes, curtains, bedding, home electric appliances and so on inside and outside of houses, apartments, buildings, factories, vehicles, etc. These faces to be cleaned may be either flat or curved, uneven or stepped.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cleaning element according to this invention includes at least a fiber assembly, a nonwoven fabric, a first fusion bonded part and a plurality of second fusion bonded parts.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the invention, the fiber assembly comprises a plurality of fibers extending in a predetermined direction. Preferably, the fiber assembly may have a planar structure having a predetermined flat or curved surface and has a three-dimensional form having a certain thickness or has a thin sheet-like form.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The &#x201c;fibers&#x201d; in this invention are elements of yarn, textile or the like and defined as being thin and flexible fibers having a substantially longer length compared with the thickness. Typically, a long continuous fiber is defined as a filament and a short fiber as a staple.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, the &#x201c;fiber assembly&#x201d; in this invention is a single fiber structure formed by the above-mentioned fibers, a fiber structure having the above-mentioned fibers aligned in the length direction and/or the radial direction (twist yarn, spun yarn, yarn to which a plurality of filaments are partially connected), or an assembly of the fiber structures.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Typically, the fiber assembly is formed of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), nylon, rayon or the like. In practical use, an assembly of filaments formed by opening a tow is frequently used as the fiber assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this invention, a sheet-like nonwoven fabric is disposed on the fiber assembly. The nonwoven fabric may comprise a single nonwoven fabric sheet layer or a plurality of nonwoven fabric sheet layers having the same or different functions and stacked in layer. The &#x201c;nonwoven fabric&#x201d; in this invention has a sheet-like configuration formed by fixing or entangling fibers by mechanical, chemical or heat treatment. Typically, the nonwoven fabric partly includes thermal melting fibers (thermoplastic fibers) and thus can be fusion bonded.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first fusion bonded part of this invention extends in a direction crossing the predetermined direction in order to fusion bond the fiber assembly and the nonwoven fabric. It is essential for the first fusion bonded part in this invention to extend in a direction crossing the predetermined direction. Therefore, the configuration of the first fusion bonded part may include a configuration having a continuously linearly extending bonded portion and a configuration having a discontinuously extending bonded portion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The plurality of the second fusion bonded parts are formed discontinuously in a direction crossing the predetermined direction in order to fusion bond the fiber assembly. It is essential for the second fusion bonded parts in this invention to be formed discontinuously in a direction crossing the predetermined direction. Therefore, the configuration of the second fusion bonded parts may include a configuration having a plurality of bonded portions aligned on the same line and a configuration having a plurality of bonded portions not aligned on the same line.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A distance between adjacent ones of the second fusion bonded parts which are provided in the middle of the cleaning element in the direction crossing the predetermined direction is longer than a length of unbonded portions that are formed on both sides of the pair adjacent second fusion bonded parts. In a construction in which two additional second fusion bonded parts are provided on the both sides of the pair adjacent second fusion bonded parts, the &#x201c;unbonded portions&#x201d; may be defined as the regions between the adjacent second fusion bonded parts and the additional second fusion bonded parts. Further, in a construction in which no additional second fusion bonded parts are provided on the both sides of the pair adjacent second fusion bonded parts, the &#x201c;unbonded portions&#x201d; here are defined as the regions between the adjacent second fusion bonded parts and the ends of the cleaning element.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Fibers between the adjacent second fusion bonded parts provided in the middle of the cleaning element serve as a main cleaning part for trapping dust, and fibers of the unbonded portion formed on both sides of the pair adjacent second fusion bonded parts serve as an auxiliary cleaning part for trapping dust. Further, in this invention, one or more pairs of the adjacent second fusion bonded parts may be provided in the middle (a region covering the central portion and an area on its both sides) of the cleaning element in the direction crossing the predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, in this invention, the fiber assembly includes a first fiber extending part and a second fiber extending part. The first fiber extending part has fibers which extend from one end fixed at the first fusion bonded part to the other free end on the end of the cleaning element in the predetermined direction. The second fiber extending part has fibers which extend from one end fixed at the second fusion bonded parts to the other free end on the end of the cleaning element in the predetermined direction. The first fusion bonded part and the second fusion bonded parts are located such that a fiber extending length of the second fiber extending part is shorter than a fiber extending length of the first fiber extending part.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">With such construction of the cleaning element according to this invention, fibers joined to the sheet-type nonwoven fabric form a horizontal section having a relatively high bond strength between the first fusion bonded part and the second fusion bonded parts. Further, with the construction having this horizontal section, the cleaning element can easily conform to a horizontal face to be cleaned, during cleaning operation. Thus, this construction is effective in enhancing the cleaning effect.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, according to this invention, when the cleaning element is lightly shaken or broken up into pieces by the user such that air is taken into the fiber assembly, fibers of the first fiber extending part which have a relatively long length in the fiber assembly are easily entangled with each other and depend downward.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">On the other hand, fibers of the second fiber extending part which have a relatively short length in the fiber assembly are not easily entangled with the first fiber extending part. Therefore, when air is taken into the fiber assembly, the fiber assembly is held homogeneous with a limited amount of unnecessary voids, and the fiber assembly is wholly densely spread. Thus the volume of the fiber assembly is increased. This state in which the fibers have a high density and are homogeneous can be defined as providing a high voluminous feeling, and also referred to as a &#x201c;bulky state&#x201d;, &#x201c;volume increased state&#x201d;, &#x201c;high space-fullness state&#x201d; or &#x201c;bulk-up state&#x201d;. Therefore, the cleaning effect can be enhanced by increasing the volume of the fiber assembly. Further, due to the volume increase, the fiber assembly makes closer contact with a face to be cleaned. Therefore, dirt of the fiber assembly stands out (the fiber assembly is easily blackened), so that the user can realize that dust is reliably trapped and thus can get a higher level of satisfaction.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, in this invention, a distance between the two second fusion bonded parts between which the main cleaning part for trapping dust is provided is longer than a length of the unbonded portion in which the auxiliary cleaning part for trapping dust is provided. Therefore, the main cleaning part is the bulkiest in the fiber assembly and is formed in the middle of the cleaning element in a direction crossing the predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Typically, in cleaning operation, the cleaning element is used with its front end side lowered than its rear end side. Therefore, the construction in which the bulkiest main cleaning part of the fiber assembly is formed in the middle of the cleaning element like in this invention has an effect that the fiber assembly easily acts upon the face to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, in the cleaning element according to this invention, the two adjacent second fusion bonded parts provided in the middle of the cleaning element are arranged such that a distance between one of the second fusion bonded parts and one end of the cleaning element is equal to a distance between the other of the second fusion bonded parts and the other end of the cleaning element in a direction crossing the predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">With this construction of the cleaning element, if the user turns around the cleaning element in use, the bulkiest main cleaning part of the fiber assembly is always located in the middle of the fiber assembly, so that the user can use the cleaning element without feeling odd, just like before the orientation change.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, in the cleaning element according to this invention, the first fusion bonded part is located such that fibers of the first fiber extending part have the same extending length, and the second fusion bonded parts are located such that fibers of the second fiber extending part have the same extending length.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Such construction of the cleaning element is effective in arranging and stabilizing the shape of the fiber assembly when air is contained in the fiber assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, in the cleaning element according to this invention, the first fusion bonded part extends in a direction crossing the predetermined direction in the middle of the cleaning element in the predetermined direction. Further, the second fusion bonded parts are formed discontinuously in a direction crossing the predetermined direction on the both sides of the first fusion bonded part.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With this construction of the cleaning element, the fiber assembly can have a shape well-balanced between the right and left portions on the both sides of the first fusion bonded part when air is contained in the fiber assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A cleaning tool according to this invention includes at least the above-described cleaning element and a cleaning element holder. The cleaning element holder in this invention has a grip to be held by a user in a cleaning operation and a holding portion for holding the cleaning element, and the grip and the holding portion are coupled to each other. The holding portion of the cleaning element holder is removably attached to the cleaning element. In the attached state of the cleaning element holder, the holding portion of the cleaning element holder holds the cleaning element. A user holds the grip of the cleaning element holder to perform a cleaning operation. Further, the user can replace the cleaning element by removing the cleaning element from the holding portion of the cleaning element holder as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With such construction, a cleaning tool with a cleaning element having a higher cleaning effect can be provided. Further, various constructions may be applied to attach the cleaning element holder to the cleaning element. Typically, it may be constructed such that a protruding cleaning element holding portion is inserted into the holding space of the cleaning element.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, the cleaning element attached to the holding portion of the cleaning element holder according to this invention may be of disposable type designed for single use, disposable type designed for multiple use which can be used several times, while retaining dust which has been removed from the face to be cleaned, on a brush portion, or reusable type which can be reused by washing.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described above, according to this invention, in a sheet-type cleaning element for wiping an object to be cleaned, particularly, a cleaning effect can be enhanced by providing improved configurations of the fusion bonded parts for fusion bonding the fiber assembly and the nonwoven fabric which form the cleaning element.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be readily understood after reading the following detailed description together with the accompanying drawings and the claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Each of the additional features and method steps disclosed above and below may be utilized separately or in conjunction with other features and method steps to provide and manufacture improved cleaning elements and cleaning tools and method for using such cleaning elements and cleaning tools, as well as devices utilized therein. Representative examples of the present invention, which examples utilized many of these additional features and method steps in conjunction, will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings. This detailed description is merely intended to teach a person skilled in the art further details for practicing preferred aspects of the present teachings and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Only the claims define the scope of the claimed invention. Therefore, combinations of features and steps disclosed within the following detailed description may not be necessary to practice the invention in the broadest sense, and are instead taught merely to particularly describe some representative examples of the invention, which detailed description will now be given with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A representative embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. First, the structure of a cleaning tool <b>100</b> according to this embodiment will now be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>. Objects to be cleaned with the cleaning tool <b>100</b> includes faces to be cleaned (floors, walls, windows, ceilings, external walls, furniture, clothes, curtains, bedding, lighting, home electric appliances, etc.) inside and outside of houses, apartments, buildings, factories, vehicles, etc. and faces of human body parts to be cleaned. These faces to be cleaned may be either flat curved, uneven or stepped.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the cleaning tool <b>100</b> according to this embodiment in perspective view, in a state disassembled into a cleaning element <b>110</b> and a cleaning element holder <b>120</b>. As shown, the cleaning tool <b>100</b> comprises the cleaning element <b>110</b> and the cleaning element holder <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The cleaning element <b>110</b> includes a cleaning element body <b>111</b> and a holding sheet <b>112</b> disposed on and joined to the upper face of the cleaning element body <b>111</b>. The cleaning element <b>110</b> comprises a sheet-type cleaning element having a function of removing dirt on the face to be cleaned. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cleaning element <b>110</b> is rectangular in plan view and elongate in a predetermined longitudinal direction (the direction of the length). This predetermined longitudinal direction generally corresponds to the direction crossing the direction in which the plurality of fibers forming the fiber assembly extend. The cleaning element <b>110</b> may also be formed into a square shape in plan view as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The cleaning element body <b>111</b> forming the cleaning element <b>110</b> includes a base sheet <b>111</b><i>a</i>, a fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>and a cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>laminated and joined together, which will be described in more detail below. All of the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a</i>, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>are of sheet type, similarly rectangular in plan view and elongate in the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b>. The fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>form a brush-like part having a dirt removing function, which is also referred to as the &#x201c;brush portion&#x201d;. The cleaning element <b>110</b> may be of disposable type designed for single use, disposable type designed for multiple use which can be used several times, while retaining dust which has been removed from the face to be cleaned, on the brush portion, or reusable type which can be reused by washing. Further, in this embodiment, the cleaning element body <b>111</b> of the cleaning element <b>110</b> is described as a structure having the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a</i>, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>stacked in layer, but may be constructed as a structure having an additional fiber layer and/or sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The cleaning element body <b>111</b> and the holding sheet <b>112</b> are fusion bonded together at a central joining line <b>113</b> extending in the middle of the cleaning element <b>110</b> in its longitudinal direction and at fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> disposed on the both sides of the central joining line <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The central joining line <b>113</b> is designed as a fusion bonded part at which the cleaning element body <b>111</b> and the holding sheet <b>112</b> are joined together. The central joining line <b>113</b> extends in the longitudinal direction through the middle of the cleaning element <b>110</b> and is a feature that corresponds to the &#x201c;first fusion bonded part extending in a direction crossing the predetermined direction in order to fusion bond the fiber assembly and the nonwoven fabric&#x201d; in this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are designed as fusion bonded parts at which the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>and part of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>of the cleaning element body <b>111</b> and the holding sheet <b>112</b> are joined together. The fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> correspond to the &#x201c;plurality of second fusion bonded parts formed discontinuously in a direction crossing the predetermined direction in order to fusion bond the fiber assembly and the nonwoven fabric&#x201d; in this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, a pair of right and left holding spaces <b>115</b> extending in the longitudinal direction are defined between the central joining line <b>113</b> and the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. Each of the holding spaces <b>115</b> has a rear open end <b>115</b><i>a </i>and a front open end <b>115</b><i>b</i>. A holding plate <b>132</b> of a holder body <b>130</b> which will be described below can be inserted into the holding space <b>115</b> from both the rear open end <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the front open end <b>115</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cleaning element <b>110</b> having the above-described structure is removably attached to the cleaning element holder <b>120</b>. The cleaning element holder <b>120</b> includes the holder body <b>130</b> and the handle <b>140</b> connected to each other. The handle <b>140</b> includes a longitudinally extending handle body <b>141</b> and a connection <b>141</b><i>a </i>disposed between the handle body <b>141</b> and the holder body <b>130</b>. The handle body <b>141</b> is held by a user and is a feature that corresponds to the &#x201c;grip&#x201d; in this invention. The handle body <b>141</b> and the holder body <b>130</b> are fixedly connected at the connection <b>141</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, the holder body <b>130</b> and the handle <b>140</b> (the handle body <b>141</b> and the connection <b>141</b><i>a</i>) are separately molded of resin material and thereafter assembled together. With this construction, the entire cleaning tool can be reduced in weight and the manufacturing costs can be reduced. Instead of this construction, the holder body <b>130</b> and the handle <b>140</b> (the handle body <b>141</b> and the connection <b>141</b><i>a</i>) may be integrally molded, or two of the holder body <b>130</b>, the handle body <b>141</b> and the connection <b>141</b><i>a </i>may be integrally molded, or all of them may be separately molded and then fixedly assembled together.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The holder body <b>130</b> has a function of detachably holding the cleaning element <b>110</b> and is a feature that corresponds to the &#x201c;cleaning element holding portion&#x201d; in this invention. The holder body <b>130</b> includes a base <b>131</b> on the handle <b>140</b> side, a pair of holding plates <b>132</b> and a retaining plate <b>134</b>. The holding plates <b>132</b> extend forward in the longitudinal direction from the base <b>131</b> and parallel with a predetermined spacing therebetween. In other words, the holder body <b>130</b> has a bifurcated form. Each of the holding plates <b>132</b> may have a constant width in the longitudinal direction or be tapered.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, two projections <b>133</b> are formed on the front and rear portions of the outer edge of each of the holding plates <b>132</b>. Each of the projections <b>133</b> has an elliptic contour projecting outward from the holding plate <b>132</b> and has a convexly curved projecting surface. For example, the projection <b>133</b> has an elliptic contour having a 180&#xb0; circular arc angle, a 16 mm major axis and a 8 mm minor axis. Further, an opening or hollow portion <b>133</b><i>a </i>is formed in the central portion of the projection <b>133</b>. The retaining plate <b>134</b> extends forward between the pair holding plates <b>132</b> and is convexly curved downward. The retaining plate <b>134</b> further has an engagement lug (not shown) on the underside.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The holding plate <b>132</b> can be inserted into the associated holding space <b>115</b> and has a function of holding the cleaning element <b>110</b> in the inserted state. In the inserted state, the holding plate <b>132</b> is fitted in the associated holding space <b>115</b> by close sliding contact, so that the cleaning element <b>110</b> is securely attached to the holding plate <b>132</b>. Further, in the inserted state, the retaining plate <b>134</b> presses the cleaning element <b>110</b> from above, and the engagement lug (not shown) formed on the underside of the retaining plate <b>134</b> serves as a stopper for preventing the cleaning element <b>110</b> from coming off. Thus, in the inserted state in which the holding plate <b>132</b> is inserted into the holding space <b>115</b>, the cleaning element <b>110</b> is reliably retained by the holder body <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of the cleaning element holder <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a disassembled state. As shown, the holder body <b>130</b> and the handle <b>140</b> are separately resin molded and thereafter disengageably connected together. The holder body <b>130</b> has an engagement plate <b>131</b><i>a </i>on the rear end of the base <b>131</b>. The handle <b>140</b> has a first engaging plate <b>143</b> and a second engaging plate <b>144</b> on the front end of the handle body <b>141</b>. An engagement region <b>145</b> is defined between the first engaging plate <b>143</b> and the second engaging plate <b>144</b> and can receive the engagement plate <b>131</b><i>a</i>. A projection (not shown) is provided in the engagement region <b>145</b> and can be engaged with a recess <b>131</b><i>b </i>of the engagement plate <b>131</b><i>a</i>. Thus, when the engagement plate <b>131</b><i>a </i>is inserted into the engagement region <b>145</b>, the engagement plate <b>131</b><i>a </i>is sandwiched between the first engaging plate <b>143</b> and the second engaging plate <b>144</b>. Further, the projection of the engagement region <b>145</b> is engaged with the recess <b>131</b><i>b </i>of the engagement plate <b>131</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the holder body <b>130</b> and the handle <b>140</b> are joined together by a joining force acting therebetween. In this state, the holder body <b>130</b> and the handle <b>140</b> can be disengaged from each other by pulling the holder body <b>130</b> and the handle <b>140</b> apart from each other by a pulling force larger than the joining force.</p>

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the cleaning element <b>110</b> of this embodiment, the holding sheet <b>112</b> is overlaid on the cleaning element body <b>111</b> on the cleaning side (which is also referred to as the &#x201c;lower face side&#x201d; or the &#x201c;back&#x201d;). Further, the cleaning element body <b>111</b> has the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c</i>, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>placed one on the other in this order from the cleaning side (lower face side). In this case, the holding sheet <b>112</b> and the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>are overlaid on the upper face side of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>to form an upper face side sheet. Thus, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is sandwiched between the holding sheet <b>112</b> and base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>(upper face side sheet) and the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>(lower face side sheet). The holding sheet <b>112</b>, the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>have a plurality of zigzag strips (strip portions) extending in a direction crossing the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Specifically, the holding sheet <b>112</b> comprises a plurality of strips <b>112</b><i>a </i>arranged in parallel and extending in a direction crossing the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b>. The base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>comprises a plurality of strips <b>111</b><i>d </i>arranged in parallel and extending in a direction crossing the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b>. The cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>comprises a plurality of strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>arranged in parallel and extending in a direction crossing the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b>. The zigzag strips of the sheets provides a structure to easily trap dust. The strips may have the same kind or different kinds of shape appropriately selected from various shapes, such as zigzag, linear and curved shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a</i>, the strips <b>111</b><i>d </i>extend outward from the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> formed in the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b>. Further, in the holding sheet <b>112</b> overlaid on the upper face of the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a</i>, the strips <b>112</b><i>a </i>having the same shape as the strips <b>111</b><i>d </i>extend outward from the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> formed in the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b>.</p>

Therefore, the proximal ends of the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>are joined at the central joining line <b>113</b>.

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The construction of the nonwoven fabric forming the above-described base sheet <b>111</b><i>a</i>, cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>and holding sheet <b>112</b> and the construction of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>will now be explained in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The base sheet <b>111</b><i>a</i>, the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>and the holding sheet <b>112</b> can typically be formed of sheet-type nonwoven fabric comprising thermal melting fibers (thermoplastic fibers) and thus referred to as nonwoven fabric sheet. The base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the holding sheet <b>112</b> herein form the &#x201c;sheet-type nonwoven fabric&#x201d; according to this invention. The nonwoven fabric has a sheet-like configuration formed by fixing or entangling fibers by mechanical, chemical or heat treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The nonwoven fabric partly includes thermoplastic fibers and thus can be fusion bonded. Further, the nonwoven fabric has a plurality of strips. Examples of the thermal melting fibers (thermoplastic fibers) include polyethylene, polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate. The nonwoven fabric may be manufactured by through-air bonding, spunbonding, thermal bonding, spun lacing, point bonding, melt blowing, stitch bonding, chemical bonding, needle punching or other similar processes. In order to enhance the dust wiping function, it is preferred to use a nonwoven fabric having higher rigidity. Further, as an alternative to or in addition to the nonwoven fabric, a material to be worked into strips, such as urethane, sponge, woven fabric, net and split cloth, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is a single fiber structure formed by fibers, a fiber structure having fibers aligned in the length direction and/or the radial direction (twist yarn, spun yarn, yarn to which a plurality of filaments are partially connected), or an assembly of the fiber structures. The fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>partially includes thermoplastic fibers and can be fusion bonded. The fibers forming the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>are elements of yarn, textile or the like and defined as being thin and flexible fibers having a substantially longer length compared with the thickness. Typically, a long continuous fiber is defined as a filament and a short fiber as a staple.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The proximal ends of the fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>are joined at the central joining line <b>113</b> and the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. The fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>each have one end fixed at the fusion bonded parts and the other free end (distal end) on the opposite side. The fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>extend elongate in a direction crossing the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b> (or the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b</i>). The fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>extending in a direction crossing the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b> is a feature that corresponds to the &#x201c;fiber assembly comprising a plurality of fibers extending in the predetermined direction&#x201d; according to this embodiment. The fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is also referred to as the &#x201c;fiber bundle&#x201d; having a plurality of fibers in a bundle.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the representative example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>comprises three fiber layers, but it may comprise one or more fiber layers as necessary. Preferably, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>has a planar structure having a predetermined flat or curved face and has a three-dimensional form having a certain thickness or has a thin sheet-like form. The &#x201c;fiber assembly&#x201d; is typically formed of polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), nylon, rayon or the like. In practical use, an assembly of filaments formed by opening a tow is frequently used as the fiber assembly. It is particularly preferable that the fiber assembly comprises conjugated fibers having a core of polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE) and a core covering sheath of polyethylene (PE). Further, the filaments of the fiber assembly are preferred to have a fineness of 1 to 50 dtex, more preferably 2 to 10 dtex. The individual fiber assembly may contain fibers of generally the same fineness or of different finenesses.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, in order to enhance the dust wiping function, it is preferred to use a fiber assembly including fibers having higher rigidity or fibers having higher fineness. It is further preferred that the fiber assembly has crimped fibers. Here, the crimped fibers are fibers subjected to a predetermined crimping process and easily entangled with each other. With the fibers being crimped, the fiber assembly becomes bulkier than before the holder is attached thereto, and dust can be easily captured by the crimped portions. This structure can be realized especially by using crimped fibers opened from a tow.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For the fiber assembly, flat yarns or split yarns may also be employed. The flat yarns are prepared by slitting a film into tapes and by stretching the tapes in the longitudinal direction. The split yarns are prepared by splitting a thermoplastic film resin in the direction perpendicular to the orientation direction of the resin so that the film is fibrillated and interconnected into a net shape. Alternatively, a nonwoven fabric which is bulky and has low fiber density, such as a through-air bonded nonwoven fabric, may be employed to form the fiber assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The kinds and numbers of the component parts of the cleaning element <b>110</b> are not limited to those described in the above-described example, and can be selected as necessary. The cleaning element <b>110</b> is rectangular in plan view and is attached to the cleaning element holder <b>120</b> such that its longer side extends along the longitudinal direction of the holder body <b>130</b> and a handle <b>140</b> of the cleaning element holder <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The construction of the fusion bonded parts in the cleaning element <b>110</b> will now be explained in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a plurality of the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are formed on the both sides of the central joining line <b>113</b> at the same distance therefrom and arranged along the extending direction of the central joining line <b>113</b>. Specifically, on each of extending lines L<b>1</b> on the both sides of the central joining line <b>113</b>, the fusion bonded parts <b>116</b> are formed at the rear open end <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the front open end <b>115</b><i>b</i>, and two fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> are formed between the two fusion bonded parts <b>116</b>. In this embodiment, each of the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> has a fusion bonded portion shaped into a circle (perfect circle), and each of the fusion bonded parts <b>116</b> has a fusion bonded portion shaped into a combined form obtained by superposing a circle (perfect circle) on an ellipse and elongated in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Each of the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> is disposed opposite to the central joining line <b>113</b>. A region demarcated by the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> and the central joining line <b>113</b> forms the holding space <b>115</b> into which the holding plate <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> is inserted. The fusion bonded part <b>114</b> has at least a circular arc portion (curved portion) bulged toward the projection <b>133</b> of the inserted holding plate <b>132</b> which projects outward from the holding plate <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b>. With this construction, sliding resistance caused between the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the projection <b>133</b> when the holding plate <b>132</b> is inserted into the holding space <b>115</b> can be reduced. Thus, the holding plate <b>132</b> can be smoothly inserted into the holding space <b>115</b>. Therefore, ease of attaching the holding plates <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> to the cleaning element <b>110</b> can be enhanced. The fusion bonded part <b>114</b> may have a curved surface shape comprising a circular arc portion of a circle or an ellipse in part or in entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">This effect of reducing the sliding resistance caused between the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the projection <b>133</b> can be further enhanced by providing the hollow portion <b>133</b><i>a </i>in the projection <b>133</b>, in addition to the bulged shape of the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the projection <b>133</b>. Specifically, when the projection <b>133</b> slides in contact with the fusion bonded part <b>114</b>, the projection <b>133</b> easily deforms toward the holding plate <b>132</b> by the effect of the hollow portion <b>133</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the effect of reducing the sliding resistance caused between the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the projection <b>133</b> can be enhanced. In a construction in which this effect can be obtained only by deformation of the holding plate <b>132</b> itself or deformation of materials forming the cleaning element <b>110</b>, the projection <b>133</b> may be solid.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, a region demarcated by the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the adjacent fusion bonded part <b>116</b> forms a housing region <b>117</b> for housing the projection <b>133</b> of the inserted holding plate <b>132</b>. The fusion bonded part <b>114</b> interferes with the projection <b>133</b> housed in the housing region <b>117</b> and prevents the projection <b>133</b> from moving in the longitudinal direction of the cleaning element <b>110</b>, so that the projection <b>133</b> is positioned in the holding space <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As to a specific configuration of the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> comprising a circular arc portion, the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> is preferably 7 to 12 mm in circular arc diameter and 90 to 360&#xb0; in circular arc angle, and more preferably 10 mm in circular arc diameter and 180&#xb0; in circular arc angle.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">By forming the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> having the above-mentioned circular arc diameter, the projection <b>133</b> can smoothly climb over the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> when the holding plate <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> is inserted. Further, after insertion, the projection <b>133</b> once received in the housing region <b>117</b> does not easily come off. If the circular arc diameter of the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> is too small, the projection <b>133</b> will rapidly deform when it climbs over the fusion bonded part <b>114</b>, so that smoothness cannot be obtained in the climbing movement. On the other hand, if the circular arc diameter is too large, the projection <b>133</b> once received in the housing region <b>117</b> will not be stabilized (not fit well) and easily come off the housing region <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, by forming the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> having the above-mentioned circular arc angle, the direction of insertion of the holding plate <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> can be stabilized. Further, the degree of difficulty in forming the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> by using a conventional thermal welding machine can be lowered, and the appearance of the fusion bonded parts can be improved. If the circular arc angle of the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> is too small, the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> will not be reliably engaged with the projection <b>133</b> and the direction of insertion of the holding plate <b>132</b> is not easily stabilized. Further, defective bonding is easily caused due to the smaller bonding area. Further, in terms of the appearance, in some cases, fusion bonded parts having a circular arc angle 180&#xb0; or 360&#xb0; is preferred in terms of the design.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the central joining line <b>113</b> is designed to join the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>in entirety in the direction of the thickness, while the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> are designed to join the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>only in part in the direction of the thickness. With this construction, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is divided into upper fibers <b>118</b> and lower fibers <b>119</b> by a dividing line L<b>2</b> in the direction of the thickness. The fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> may be designed to join the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>in entirety in the direction of the thickness, as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the upper fibers <b>118</b> have a first fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>a </i>and a second fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>b</i>. The proximal end of the first fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>a </i>is joined at the central joining line <b>113</b>. The first fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>a </i>extends elongate from one end fixed at the central joining line <b>113</b> to the other free end (distal end) on the side opposite to the fixed end. Specifically, no fusion bonded part exists between the fixed end and the free end of the first fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>a</i>. Further, the second fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>b </i>extends elongate from one end fixed at the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> to the other free end (distal end) on the side opposite to the fixed end. Specifically, no fusion bonded part exists between the fixed end and the free end of the second fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, in this embodiment, the central joining line <b>113</b> extends parallel to the long sides of the cleaning element through the middle of the cleaning element. Thus, the fibers of the first fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>a </i>have the same extending length. Further, the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are formed on the both sides of the central joining line <b>113</b> at the same distance therefrom and arranged along the extending direction of the central joining line <b>113</b>. Thus, the fibers of the second fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>b </i>have the same extending length. Such construction is effective in arranging and stabilizing the shape of the fiber assembly when air is contained in the fiber assembly. Particularly, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>can have a shape well-balanced between the right and left portions on the both sides of the central joining line <b>113</b>. The bonded portion of the central joining line <b>113</b> may continuously linearly extend or discontinuously extend. Further, the bonded portions of the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> may extend along a predetermined line or along a predetermined curve.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The first fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>a </i>is a feature that corresponds to the &#x201c;first fiber extending part having fibers which extend from one end fixed at the first fusion bonded part to the other free end on the end of the cleaning element in the predetermined direction&#x201d; according to this invention. The second fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>b </i>is a feature that corresponds to the &#x201c;second fiber extending part having fibers which extend from one end fixed at the second fusion bonded parts to the other free end on the end of the cleaning element in the predetermined direction&#x201d; according to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The proximal ends of the lower fibers <b>119</b> are joined at the central joining line <b>113</b>, and each of the lower fibers <b>119</b> extends elongate from one end fixed at the central joining line <b>113</b> to the other free end (distal end) on the side opposite to the fixed end. Specifically, no fusion bonded part exists between the fixed ends and the free ends of the lower fibers <b>119</b>. Therefore, an extending length d<b>5</b> of the first fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>a </i>of the upper fibers <b>118</b> and the extending length d<b>5</b> of the lower fibers <b>119</b> are longer than an extending length d<b>4</b> of the second extending part <b>118</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">With this construction of the cleaning element <b>110</b> of this embodiment, fibers joined to the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the holding sheet <b>112</b> at the central joining line <b>113</b> and the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> form a horizontal section having a relatively high bond strength between the central joining line <b>113</b> and the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>. This construction is effective in obtaining a high bond strength which cannot be obtained by joining only the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the holding sheet <b>112</b>. Further, with this construction in which the horizontal section is formed between the central joining line <b>113</b> and the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, the cleaning element <b>110</b> can easily conform to a horizontal face to be cleaned, during cleaning operation. Thus, this construction is effective in enhancing the cleaning effect.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Further, when the cleaning element <b>110</b> is lightly shaken or broken up into pieces directly by user's hand such that air is taken into the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b</i>, fibers of the first fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>a </i>which have a relatively long length in the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>are easily entangled with each other and depend downward. On the other hand, fibers of the second fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>b </i>which have a relatively short length in the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>are not easily entangled with the first fiber extending part <b>118</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, when air is taken into the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b</i>, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is held homogeneous with a limited amount of unnecessary voids, and the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is wholly densely spread. Thus the volume of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">This state in which the fibers have a high density and are homogeneous can be defined as providing a high voluminous feeling, and also referred to as a &#x201c;bulky state&#x201d;, &#x201c;volume increased state&#x201d;, &#x201c;high space-fullness state&#x201d; or &#x201c;bulk-up state&#x201d;. Therefore, the cleaning effect can be enhanced by increasing the volume of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b</i>. Further, due to the volume increase, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>makes closer contact with a face to be cleaned. Therefore, dirt of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>stands out (the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is easily blackened), so that the user can get a higher level of satisfaction, realizing that dust is reliably trapped.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Particularly, in this embodiment, a distance d<b>2</b> between the adjacent fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> disposed in the middle of the cleaning element in the longitudinal direction is longer than a distance d<b>2</b> between the front fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> and a distance d<b>3</b> between the rear fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. Fibers of the unbonded portion between the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> serve as a main cleaning part (a main cleaning part <b>111</b><i>f </i>which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and will be described below) for trapping dust.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Fibers of the unbonded portion between the fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the fusion bonded part <b>116</b>, and fibers of the unbonded portion between the fusion bonded part <b>116</b> and the cleaning element end serve as an auxiliary cleaning part (an auxiliary cleaning part <b>111</b><i>g </i>which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and will be described below) for trapping dust. Therefore, according to this embodiment, the main cleaning part is the bulkiest in the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>and is formed in the middle of the cleaning element between the two fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> in the longitudinal direction. Typically, in cleaning operation, the cleaning element <b>110</b> is used with its front end side lowered than its rear end side. Therefore, the construction in which the bulkiest main cleaning part of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is formed in the middle of the cleaning element like in this embodiment has an effect that the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>easily acts upon the face to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Further, in this embodiment, preferably, the distance between the front fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the front end of the cleaning element <b>110</b> is equal to the distance between the rear fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the rear end of the cleaning element <b>110</b>. With this construction, whether the holding plate <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>140</b> is inserted from the rear open end <b>115</b><i>a </i>or the front open end <b>115</b><i>b</i>, the bulkiest main cleaning part of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is always located in a predetermined middle position of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, if the user turns around the cleaning element <b>110</b> in use, the user can use the cleaning element <b>110</b> without strange feeling, just like before the change of orientation of the cleaning element <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The fusion bonded parts <b>116</b> are formed at the rear open end <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the front open end <b>115</b><i>b </i>and provide a function of guiding the holding plate <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> to be smoothly inserted into the holding space <b>115</b>. Therefore, the fusion bonded parts <b>116</b> extend in the longitudinal direction and preferably includes a linear portion extending linearly in the longitudinal direction toward the holding space <b>115</b>. In this manner, when the holding plate <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> is inserted into the holding space <b>115</b>, the holding plate <b>132</b> can be more smoothly guided into the holding space <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As to a specific configuration of the fusion bonded part <b>116</b>, the fusion bonded part <b>116</b> is preferably 10 to 17 mm or more preferably 15 mm, in extending length in the longitudinal direction. By forming the fusion bonded part <b>116</b> having such an extending length, the operation of inserting the holding plate <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> can be stabilized. Further, the area of insertion of the holding plate <b>132</b> can be easily recognized, and the degree of difficulty in forming the fusion bonded part <b>116</b> by using a conventional thermal welding machine can be lowered. If the extending length of the fusion bonded part <b>116</b> is too short, the operation of inserting the holding plate <b>132</b> cannot be stabilized and the area of insertion of the holding plate <b>132</b> cannot be easily recognized. Further, if the fusion bonded part <b>116</b> is formed at a position displaced from a specified joining position, the fiber assembly <b>11</b><i>b</i>, the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the holding sheet <b>112</b> cannot be reliably joined together.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Usage of the cleaning tool <b>100</b> having the above-described construction will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 10</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> are perspective views showing the manner of attaching the cleaning element <b>110</b> to the cleaning element holder <b>120</b> in this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a perspective view showing the cleaning element <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and broken up into pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In order to use the cleaning tool <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the holding plates <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> are inserted from the rear open end <b>115</b><i>a </i>of the holding space <b>115</b>, so that the cleaning element <b>110</b> is attached to the cleaning element holder <b>120</b>. With the construction of this embodiment in which the holding space <b>115</b> has the rear open end <b>115</b><i>a </i>and the front open end <b>115</b><i>b</i>, the holding plate <b>132</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> can be inserted from the front open end <b>115</b><i>b </i>of the holding space <b>115</b>, as necessary, so that the cleaning element <b>110</b> can also be attached to the cleaning element holder <b>120</b> in the inverted position.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In order to attach the cleaning element <b>110</b> to the cleaning element holder <b>120</b>, first, the front ends of the holding plates <b>132</b> are inserted into the holding space <b>115</b>. At this time, the front projection <b>133</b> of each of the holding plates <b>132</b> is engaged with the inner edge portion of the fusion bonded part <b>116</b>. Thus, the holding plate <b>132</b> is positioned with respect to the holding space <b>115</b>. In this embodiment, the fusion bonded part <b>116</b> has components extending in the longitudinal direction. Therefore, the direction of movement of the holding plate <b>132</b> can be naturally fixed on a line even if the user does not care about it, and the holding plate <b>132</b> can be smoothly guided forward in the holding space <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Further, when the holding plate <b>132</b> is inserted into the holding space <b>115</b>, the front projection <b>133</b> climbs over the circular arc portion of the rear fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and then over the circular arc portion of the front fusion bonded part <b>114</b>. At this time, each time the front projection <b>133</b> climbs over the circular arc portions of the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, the holding plate <b>132</b> and the projection <b>133</b> itself repeat inward deformation and reversion (recovery). Thus, the resistance acted upon the user continuously changes. The user feels such change of the resistance as movement of the holding plates <b>132</b> which move toward and away from each other. Therefore, it is effective in providing the user with peace of mind that the cleaning element holder <b>120</b> is reliably attached to the cleaning element <b>110</b> and seems not to easily come off.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">When the front and rear projections <b>133</b> are received in the respective housing regions <b>117</b>, the base <b>131</b> of the holder body <b>130</b> interferes with the rear open end <b>115</b><i>a</i>, so that the holder body <b>130</b> is prevented from further moving forward. In this state, the cleaning element holder <b>120</b> is attached to the cleaning element <b>110</b>. In this attached state, the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> on the both sides of the projections <b>133</b> prevent the projections <b>133</b> from moving. Thus, the cleaning element <b>110</b> is prevented from coming off the cleaning element holder <b>120</b> just by lightly shaking the cleaning element holder <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In this manner, the cleaning tool <b>100</b> is provided in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this state, the thickness of the cleaning element <b>110</b> is kept to a minimum. Further, the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>facing the face to be cleaned is held separated from the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b</i>, so that it cannot perform a desired cleaning function. In order to obtain a desired cleaning function, preferably, the cleaning element <b>110</b> is lightly shaken or broken up into pieces directly by hand, or lightly shaken with the cleaning element holder <b>120</b> held by hand, such that air is taken into the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>and the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>expands three-dimensionally.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">By such breaking-up or shaking of the cleaning element <b>110</b>, the fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>are mixed with the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>of the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c</i>. Upon swinging movement of the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>about the fixed ends or the central fusion-bonding line <b>113</b>, the outer free ends of the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>depend downward under the own weight. At this time, the fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>depend downward around the bonded portion of the central fusion-bonding line <b>113</b> together with the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>of the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c</i>. Thus, containing air in the fiber bundle <b>111</b><i>b</i>, the cleaning element <b>110</b> is made bulkier than before the cleaning element holder <b>120</b> is attached. Specifically, in synchronization with the swinging movement of the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>of the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c</i>, the cleaning element <b>110</b> expands by containing air between the fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Particularly, in this embodiment, the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>of the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>have a relatively smaller width than the strips <b>111</b><i>d </i>of the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the volume of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>can be increased without causing a problem that the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>impair elasticity of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the users can gain higher expectations and peace of mind with respect to the dust trapping function. Further, by forming the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>by using crimped fibers as mentioned above, the fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>can be easily entangled with the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>of the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>are mixed with the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>of the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>and the main cleaning part <b>111</b><i>f </i>of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is increased in volume, so that the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>expands three-dimensionally. By expansion of the main cleaning part <b>111</b><i>f </i>formed between the front and rear auxiliary cleaning parts <b>111</b><i>g </i>in the cleaning element <b>110</b>, the main cleaning part <b>111</b><i>f </i>can more easily conform to (or make close contact with) irregular or curved surfaces of the object to be cleaned. At this time, the fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>which are mixed with the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>of the cleaning side sheet <b>111</b><i>c </i>perform a cleaning function in cooperation with the strips <b>111</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Particularly, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>serves as a core of a dirt collecting function as dirt is entangled between the fibers of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>or on the crimped portions of the fibers. Further, the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>is exposed downward from the strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>and thus appears to be increased in volume, which can provide the users with higher expectations and peace of mind with respect to the dust trapping function. The strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>have a dirt collecting function as a supplement to the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>serving as a core of the dirt collecting function. The strips <b>111</b><i>e </i>can easily reach into finer irregularities or curved surfaces of the object to be cleaned and retain the dust between the strips or on the strip faces, thus performing a cleaning function. The strips <b>111</b><i>d </i>of the base sheet <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the strips <b>112</b><i>a </i>of the holding sheet <b>112</b> are not easily affected by the movement of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b </i>and perform a dust wiping-out function independently of the movement of the fiber assembly <b>111</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The present invention is not limited to the embodiment as described above, but rather, may be added to, changed, replaced with alternatives or otherwise modified. For example, the following provisions can be made in application of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the above-described embodiment, the distance between the front fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the front end of the cleaning element <b>110</b> is described as being equal to the distance between the rear fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the rear end of the cleaning element <b>110</b>. However, in this invention, the distance between the front fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the front end of the cleaning element <b>110</b> may be different from the distance between the rear fusion bonded part <b>114</b> and the rear end of the cleaning element <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Further, although, in this embodiment, the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> of the cleaning element <b>110</b> are described as being formed on the both sides of the central joining line <b>113</b>, the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> may be formed on either one side of the central joining line <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, although, in this embodiment, the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> are described as having a circular shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is essential for the fusion bonded parts to have at least a bulged portion protruding toward the central joining line <b>113</b>. The shape and the number of the fusion bonded parts can be changed as necessary. For example, the fusion bonded parts may be shaped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 16</figref>. Cleaning elements <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>240</b> <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 16</figref> have substantially the same construction as the cleaning element <b>110</b> except for the shape or the number of the first fusion bonded parts.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The cleaning element <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> has first fusion bonded parts <b>211</b> having a circular angle of 180&#xb0;. The cleaning element <b>220</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> has first fusion bonded parts <b>221</b> having a solid filled circular shape (joined over the whole circular area). With the first fusion bonded parts <b>221</b> having such a shape, the joint area is increased, so that the bond strength is increased. Further, a powerful appearance can be obtained, and the position of the holding space can be easily recognized by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, the cleaning element <b>230</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> has first fusion bonded parts <b>231</b> having a configuration of a double circle. With the first fusion bonded parts <b>231</b> having such a configuration, the appearance can be enhanced, and the bond strength is increased. The cleaning element <b>240</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> has first fusion bonded parts <b>241</b> having a combined configuration of a plurality of circles with different diameters. With the first fusion bonded parts <b>241</b> having such a configuration, the appearance can be enhanced, and fine joining operation can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The cleaning elements <b>250</b>, <b>260</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> have an increased number of the fusion bonded parts <b>114</b>. Particularly, the cleaning element <b>260</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> has an additional fusion bonded part <b>114</b> between the two fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> which are provided on each side in the middle of the cleaning element <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this case, two pairs of the adjacent fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> are provided on each side in the middle of the cleaning element. Also in this construction, like in the cleaning element <b>110</b>, preferably, the distance d<b>1</b> between the adjacent fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> is longer than the distance d<b>2</b> between the front fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> and the distance d<b>3</b> between the rear fusion bonded parts <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. Further, when the first fusion bonded parts are increased in number, all of the first fusion bonded parts may not necessarily be provided on the same line.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Further, in this embodiment, the fusion bonded parts <b>116</b> are described as being shaped into a combined form of a circle (perfect circle) and an ellipse as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is essential for the fusion bonded parts to have at least an elongated portion extending in the longitudinal direction. The shape and the number of the fusion bonded parts can be changed as necessary. For example, the fusion bonded parts may be shaped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref>. Cleaning elements <b>270</b>, <b>280</b>, <b>290</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 to 19</figref> have substantially the same construction as the cleaning element <b>110</b> except for the shape or the number of the second fusion bonded parts.</p>

The cleaning element <b>290</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> has second fusion bonded parts <b>291</b> shaped into a combined form of two circular fusion bonded parts and elongated in the longitudinal direction. Also with the second fusion bonded parts <b>271</b>, <b>281</b>, <b>291</b>, like the fusion bonded parts <b>116</b>, the operation of inserting the holding plate <b>132</b> can be stabilized. Particularly, with the second fusion bonded parts <b>291</b>, the joint area is increased, so that the bond strength is increased.</p>
