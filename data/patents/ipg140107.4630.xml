<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission and reception apparatus is provided which allows high accuracy estimation of frequency offset, high accuracy estimation of a transmission path fluctuation and high accuracy synchronization/signal detection. A mapping section generates a plurality of OFDM signals. In these OFDM signals, some pilot carriers are assigned to the same carrier position, and orthogonal sequences are assigned to the same time slot in the same carrier position.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0015">It is an object of the present invention to provide a MIMO-OFDM transmission apparatus and a MIMO-OFDM transmission method capable of high accuracy frequency offset estimation, high accuracy transmission path fluctuation estimation and high accuracy synchronization/signal detection.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">The MIMO-OFDM transmission apparatus according to the present invention transmits OFDM-modulated data symbols from a plurality of antennas in a data transmission period and transmits pilot symbols from specific carriers of the plurality of antennas in the data transmission period, and employs a configuration having: an OFDM signal forming section that forms OFDM signals transmitted from the antennas; and a pilot symbol mapping section that assigns orthogonal sequences to the same carriers in OFDM signals transmitted from the antennas at the same time, in the time domain, and forms pilot carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">According to this configuration, orthogonal sequences are assigned to corresponding subcarriers among OFDM signals transmitted at the same time from the respective antennas in the time domain to form pilot carriers, so that, even when pilot symbols are multiplexed among a plurality of channels (antennas), it is possible to estimate frequency offset/phase noise with high accuracy. Furthermore, since pilot symbols of each channel can be extracted without using a channel estimation value (transmission path fluctuation estimation value), it is possible to simplify the configuration of the section for compensating for the frequency offset/phase noise.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">Furthermore, the MIMO-OFDM transmission apparatus of the present invention adopts a configuration where, when the OFDM signals are transmitted from two antennas, a pilot symbol mapping section forms pilot carriers such that: pilot signals of orthogonal sequences are used for the same carriers between a first antenna and a second antenna; pilot signals of different sequences are used for different carriers at the first antenna and the second antenna; and pilot signals of the same sequence are used at the first antenna and the second antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">According to this configuration, when MIMO-OFDM transmission is carried out using two transmission antennas, it is possible to realize a transmission apparatus capable of minimizing an increase of transmission peak power in a simple configuration without degrading estimation accuracy for frequency offset/phase noise.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">Moreover, the MIMO-OFDM transmission apparatus of the present invention adopts a configuration, wherein, when the OFDM signals are transmitted from three antennas, a pilot symbol mapping section forms pilot carriers such that: pilot signals of orthogonal sequences are used for the same carriers among a first antenna, a second antenna and a third antenna; there is an antenna where pilot signals of different sequences are used for carriers assigned the pilot signals; and there are two or more antennas where pilot signals of the same sequence are used.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">According to this configuration, when MIMO-OFDM transmission is carried out using three transmission antennas, it is possible to realize a transmission apparatus capable of minimizing an increase of transmission peak power in a simple configuration without degrading the estimation accuracy for frequency offset/phase noise.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effect of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">According to the present invention, it is possible to realize a MIMO-OFDM transmission apparatus and a MIMO-OFDM transmission method capable of high accuracy frequency offset estimation, high accuracy transmission path fluctuation estimation and high accuracy synchronization/signal detection.</p>

Signals at the same time on the same carriers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) are spatially multiplexed.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">From time <b>1</b> to time <b>8</b>, symbols for estimating transmission path fluctuations corresponding to h<b>11</b>(<i>t</i>), h<b>12</b>(<i>t</i>), h<b>21</b>(<i>t</i>) and h<b>22</b>(<i>t</i>) in Equation (1), for example, symbols called &#x201c;preambles&#x201d; are transmitted. This preamble is composed of guard symbol <b>301</b> and reference symbol <b>302</b>. Guard symbol <b>301</b> is assumed to be (0, 0) on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane. Reference symbol <b>302</b> is, for example, a symbol at known coordinates other than (0, 0) on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane. Channel A and channel B are configured such that no interference occurs with each other. That is, when, for example, guard symbol <b>301</b> is placed on channel A on carrier <b>1</b> at time <b>1</b>, reference symbol <b>302</b> is placed on channel B and when reference symbol <b>302</b> is placed on channel A on carrier <b>2</b> at time <b>1</b>, guard symbol <b>301</b> is placed on channel B, and in this way different symbols are placed on channel A and channel B. By adopting such an arrangement, when, for example, attention is focused on channel A at time <b>1</b>, it is possible to estimate a transmission path fluctuation of carrier <b>3</b> using reference symbols <b>302</b> of carrier <b>2</b> and carrier <b>4</b>. Since carrier <b>2</b> and carrier <b>4</b> are reference symbols <b>302</b>, the transmission path fluctuation can be estimated. Therefore, transmission path fluctuations of all carriers of channel A can be accurately estimated at time <b>1</b>. In the same way, transmission path fluctuations of all carriers can be accurately estimated for channel B, too. From time <b>2</b> to time <b>8</b>, transmission path fluctuations of all carriers of channel A and channel B can be estimated in the same way. Thus, since the frame configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> allows transmission path fluctuations of all carriers to be estimated at all times from time <b>1</b> to time <b>8</b>, this can be said to be a preamble configuration capable of realizing quite high accuracy estimation of transmission path fluctuations.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, information symbol (data symbol) <b>303</b> is a symbol for transmitting data.

<p id="p-0101" num="0101">Pilot symbol <b>305</b> is a symbol for estimating a phase fluctuation by frequency offset and/or phase noise.

Pilot symbols <b>305</b> are placed on carrier <b>4</b> and carrier <b>9</b> on both channel A and channel B. When a wireless LAN builds a system at the same frequency and in the same frequency band according to IEEE802.11a, IEEE802.11g and spatial multiplexing MIMO system, this allows the frame configuration to be shared, and therefore it is possible to simplify the reception apparatus.</p>

For example, when transmission is carried out under the modulation scheme of QPSK in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, as is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, it is necessary to multiply the coordinates in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> by a value of 1/sqrt(2).

Here, BPSK modulation is used for these arrangements but the modulation is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">A feature of the signal point constellations of pilot symbols <b>305</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is that the signal point constellations on the same carriers of channel A and channel B are orthogonal to each other (cross-correlation is zero).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0106">For example, the signal point constellation from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b> of channel A on carrier <b>4</b> is orthogonal to the signal point constellation from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b> of channel B on carrier <b>4</b>. Furthermore, the same applies to time <b>15</b> to time <b>18</b>. The signal point constellation from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b> of channel A on carrier <b>9</b> is also orthogonal to the signal point constellation from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b> of channel B on carrier <b>9</b>. Furthermore, the same applies to time <b>15</b> to time <b>18</b>. At this time, using a Walsh-Hadamard conversion, orthogonal codes or the like is suitable because of the orthogonality of signals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the case of BPSK, but if signals are orthogonal, QPSK modulation may also be used or it may not be necessary to follow the rule of the modulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">Furthermore, in the case of this embodiment, for simplicity of the receiver, suppose the signal point constellations are the same (same pattern) between carrier <b>4</b> of channel A and carrier <b>9</b> of channel B and between carrier <b>9</b> of channel A and carrier <b>4</b> of channel B (here, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, they are named &#x201c;pattern #<b>1</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;pattern #<b>2</b>&#x201d;). The reason will be explained in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. However, the same pattern does not mean to adopt completely the same signal point constellation. For example, a case where only the phase relationship is different on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane can also be regarded as the same pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">Furthermore, the signal point constellation of pilot symbols <b>305</b> is made to differ between carriers <b>4</b> and <b>9</b> of channel A (or channel B) and this is because using the same signal point constellation may lead to an increase of transmission peak power. However, the pattern defined above may be the same. In other words, it is important that the signal point constellations are different.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">Here, an advantage of orthogonality will be explained in detail using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> first.</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0119">As described above, by making signal point constellations of channel A and channel B on the same carriers orthogonal to each other, even when pilot symbols <b>305</b> are multiplexed on channel A and channel B, it is possible to estimate frequency offset and/or phase noise with high accuracy. Another important advantage is that since no channel estimation value (transmission path fluctuation estimation value) is required, it is possible to simplify the configuration of the part for compensating for the frequency offset and/or phase noise. If signal point constellations of pilot symbols <b>305</b> of channel A and channel B are not orthogonal to each other, signal processing of MIMO demultiplexing, for example, ZF (Zero Forcing), MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) or MLD (Maximum Likelihood Detection) is carried out, frequency offset and/or phase noise are then estimated. On the other hand, according to the configuration of this embodiment, it is possible to compensate for frequency, offset and/or phase noise before demultiplexing a signal (signal processing section <b>223</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. In addition, the frequency offset and/or phase noise can be removed using pilot symbols <b>305</b> even after demultiplexing the signal of channel A from the signal of channel B by signal processing section <b>223</b>, thereby making it possible to compensate for the frequency offset and/or phase noise with higher accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0120">By the way, when the signal point constellations of channel A and channel B of the same carriers are not orthogonal to each other, the estimation accuracy for frequency offset and/or phase noise by frequency offset/phase noise estimation section <b>213</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> decreases (signals become components of interference with each other), and therefore it is difficult to add the frequency offset/phase noise compensation section <b>215</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and it is not possible to realize high accuracy frequency offset/phase noise compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0121">Furthermore, this embodiment assumes the same signal point constellation (same pattern) for carrier <b>4</b> of channel A and carrier <b>9</b> of channel B, and carrier <b>9</b> of channel A and carrier <b>4</b> of channel B, thereby providing commonality between code storage sections <b>605</b> and <b>607</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and leading to simplification of the reception apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0122">However, while it is essential in this embodiment that signal point constellations of channel A and channel B on the same carriers be orthogonal to each other, it is not necessarily essential that they have the same pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0123">This embodiment has been explained using an example where pilot symbols <b>305</b>, which are orthogonal to each other in four-symbol units, from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b>, but the present invention is not limited to four-symbol units. However, when considering an influence on the orthogonality due to a fluctuation of fading in the time direction, if an orthogonal pattern is formed in 2 to 8-symbol units, it may be possible to secure the estimation accuracy for frequency offset/phase noise. When the period of an orthogonal pattern is too long, the possibility that the orthogonality may not be secured increases and the estimation accuracy for frequency offset/phase noise degrades. Furthermore, the case where the number of transmission antennas is 2 and two modulated signals are transmitted has been explained, but the present invention is not limited to this and even in a case where the number of transmission antennas is 3 or more and three or more modulated signals are transmitted, it is possible to obtain effects similar to those described above by making pilot symbols <b>305</b> existing on the same carriers orthogonal to each other in several-symbol units.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0127">Likewise adopting the same pattern for carriers <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>11</b>, too leads to simplification of the reception apparatus though their phase relationships are different. Here, making the pattern of even numbered carriers and the pattern of the odd numbered carrier same can further simplify the reception apparatus. However, even when they are different, there is an advantage to a certain degree in the aspect of simplification of the reception apparatus. This is because only one necessary pattern signal is added. Similarly, adopting the same pattern for channel A and channel B leads to further simplification of the reception apparatus, but adopting different patterns also has an advantage to a certain degree.</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0137">In this way, pattern signal generation section <b>804</b> can be shared among carrier <b>1</b> to carrier <b>12</b>, and therefore it is possible to reduce the storage capacity of pattern signals of pattern signal generation section <b>804</b> and standardize the signal processing and simplify the reception apparatus accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0138">By the way, what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are signal point constellations on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane when reference symbols <b>302</b> are modulated in BPSK and they are similar to the signal point constellations when data symbols <b>303</b> are modulated in BPSK and the normalization factors to be multiplied are also similar to those when data symbols <b>303</b> are modulated in BPSK. However, by so doing, if an analog/digital converter is mounted to carry out digital signal processing at the reception apparatus, the influence of quantization errors increases. An example of signal point constellation on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane to solve this problem will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows an example of signal point constellation on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane for solving this problem. As an example, BPSK modulation is used. At this time, suppose that the normalization factor is 1.0 and the signal point constellation of reference symbols <b>302</b> is (1.414&#x2248;sqrt(2), 0) or (&#x2212;1.414&#x2248;sqrt(2), 0). In other words, a signal point constellation is assumed to be obtained by multiplying the signal point constellation when data symbols <b>303</b> are modulated in BPSK by coefficient 1.414.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0140">Time fluctuation in the intensity of the received signal in such a case will be explained using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0141">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>a</i>) shows time fluctuation of the waveform of the received signal when the signal point constellation of preambles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is adopted and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>b</i>) shows time fluctuation of the waveform of the received signal when the signal point constellation of preambles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is adopted. When the signal point constellation of preambles as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is adopted, average reception power of preambles is smaller than average reception power of data symbols <b>303</b>. This phenomenon is caused by the existence of guard symbols <b>301</b> when the same signal point constellation as that of data symbols <b>303</b> is carried out for reference symbols <b>302</b> of preambles. As a result, especially when a received signal is converted to a digital signal using an analog/digital converter, the quality of the received signals of preambles degrades due to the influence of quantization errors.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0142">On the other hand, when the signal point constellation of preambles as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is carried out, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref><i>b</i>), the average reception power of preambles becomes equivalent to the average reception power of data symbols <b>303</b>. Therefore, even if a received signal is converted to a digital signal using an analog/digital converter, the influence of quantization errors on the received signals of preambles is reduced and the quality is secured.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0143">Based on a concept similar to that described above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a method of signal point constellation when QPSK is adopted as the signal point constellation of reference symbols <b>302</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0145">As described above, when the modulation scheme called #X of data symbols <b>303</b> is used for reference symbols <b>302</b>, it is important to use the signal point constellation which becomes 1.414&#x2248;sqrt(2) times the signal point constellation of data symbols <b>303</b> on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane after multiplication by a normalization factor as the signal point constellation of reference symbols <b>302</b> on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane after multiplication by a normalization factor. The factor 1.414&#x2248;sqrt(2) is a value determined because reference symbols <b>302</b> are arranged for every symbol on the frequency axis.</p>

This symbol is composed of guard symbol <b>301</b> and reference symbol <b>302</b>. Suppose guard symbol <b>301</b> is (0, 0) on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane. Reference symbol <b>302</b> is, for example, a symbol at known coordinates other than (0, 0) on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane. Channel A, channel B and channel C are configured in such a way that no interference occurs with each other. That is, when, for example, reference symbol <b>302</b> is placed on channel A on carrier <b>1</b> at time <b>1</b>, guard symbol <b>301</b> is placed on channel B and channel C, when reference symbol <b>302</b> is placed on channel B on carrier <b>2</b> at time <b>1</b>, guard symbol <b>301</b> is placed on channel A and channel C, and when reference symbol <b>302</b> is placed on channel Con carrier <b>3</b> at time <b>1</b>, guard symbol <b>301</b> is placed on channel A and channel B.

From time <b>2</b> to time <b>8</b>, the transmission path fluctuations of all carriers of channel A, channel B and channel C can be estimated in the same way.

Here, suppose the modulation scheme of reference symbols <b>302</b> is BPSK. At this time, a case where a normalization factor is 1 and the signal point constellations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> are adopted is assumed, the reception intensity of preambles decreases compared to data symbols <b>303</b> as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and therefore the influence of quantization errors increases on only preambles due to the analog/digital converter mounted on the reception apparatus, causing deterioration of the reception quality. On the other hand, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the signal point constellation of reference symbol <b>302</b> on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane is assumed to be (1.732&#x2266;sqrt(3), 0) or (&#x2212;1.732&#x2248;sqrt(3), 0).

<p id="p-0167" num="0167">Based on the above described concept, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the method of signal point constellation when QPSK is assumed to be the signal point constellation of reference symbols <b>302</b>.</p>

Here, 1.225 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is calculated from 1.255&#x2248;sqrt(3)/sqrt(2).</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0169">As described above, when the modulation scheme called #X of data symbols <b>303</b> is used for reference symbols <b>302</b>, it is important to use the signal point constellation which becomes 1.732&#x2248;sqrt(3) times the signal point constellation of data symbol <b>303</b> on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane after multiplication by a normalization factor as the signal point constellation of reference symbols <b>302</b> on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane after multiplication by a normalization factor.

For example, the transmission section of channel C does not operate when frame configuration signal <b>113</b> indicates a double transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme.

<p id="p-0181" num="0181">As for the signal point constellation on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane of data symbols <b>303</b>, those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> are adopted.

<p id="p-0182" num="0182"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a normalization factor to be adopted in each MIMO scheme and each modulation scheme when a normalization factor is assumed to be 1 in the case of a double transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO and BPSK. The reason that normalization factors are set in this way is to equalize total transmit power of modulated signals transmitted by the AP regardless of the modulation scheme and regardless of the number of modulated signals to be transmitted. Therefore, if the normalization factor based on the double transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme is assumed to be X when the same modulation scheme is used, the normalization factor of the triple transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme becomes sqrt(2)/sqrt(3) times X.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0183">Next, a signal point constellation of preambles on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane at this time will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0184">In the case of the double transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme, suppose that the signal point constellation of reference symbols <b>302</b> of preambles on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> explained in Embodiment 1 in order to reduce the influence of quantization errors produced in the analog/digital converter of the reception apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0185">Considering the normalization factors in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> and the explanations of Embodiment 2 at this time, it is necessary to adopt signal point constellations as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> to reduce the influence of quantization errors produced in the analog/digital converter of the reception apparatus. By so doing, even when the AP switches between the double transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme and the triple transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme, the reception apparatus can reduce the influence of quantization errors on preambles.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0186">What is important in the above described explanation, when the total transmit power of modulated signals to be transmitted is equalized regardless of the modulation scheme and the number of modulated signals to be transmitted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is that when using a modulation scheme called &#x201c;#X&#x201d; of data symbols <b>303</b> for reference symbols <b>302</b>, the same signal point constellation of reference symbols <b>302</b> on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane after multiplication by a normalization factor be used for the double transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme and the triple transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0187">Adopting such a configuration can reduce the influence of quantization errors in preambles, thereby suppressing degradation of reception quality.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0188">The case where the average reception power of data symbols <b>303</b> is equalized to that of the preambles has been explained above as an example, but it is often the case that reception quality is secured by using greater average reception power of preambles than the average reception power of data symbols <b>303</b>. The above-described concept can also be applied to this case, too. In short, when using the modulation scheme called #X of data symbols <b>303</b> for reference symbols <b>302</b>, it is only necessary to observe the rule that the same signal point constellation of reference symbols <b>302</b> on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane after multiplication by a normalization factor is used for the double transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme and the triple transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0189">That is, in an n-transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO scheme having n transmission antennas and n transmission modulated signals, when reference symbol <b>302</b> is inserted for every n&#x2212;1 symbols at the preamble, if a modulation scheme called #X of data symbols <b>303</b> is used for reference symbols <b>302</b>, the operation would be the same as that described above if the same signal point constellation of reference symbols <b>302</b> on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane after multiplication by a normalization factor is used regardless of n.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0190">This embodiment has been explained with an example using an OFDM scheme, but the present invention is not limited to this and can also be implemented in the same way when using a single-carrier scheme, other multicarrier schemes or spread spectrum communication schemes.

Then, suppose that the same signal point constellation as that for channel A is used for channel B. The above described special signal processing is then applied thereto. This special signal processing is the processing on channel B for shifting the phase of a modulated signal obtained after a Fourier transform, for example, by 0.5 symbols with respect to the time axis. However, signals which stick out of channel A without overlapping channel A are placed (turned down) one by one from top to bottom. This operation is disclosed in the document &#x201c;Channel estimation for OFDM systems with transmitter diversity in mobile wireless channels,&#x201d; IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol. 17, no. 3, pp.-461-471, March 1999 and &#x201c;Simplified channel estimation for OFDM systems with multiple transmit antennas,&#x201d; IEEE Transaction on wireless communications, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 67-75, 2002, and Cyclic delay diversity is applied to channel A and channel B at time <b>1</b> on carrier <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0197">Therefore, at time <b>1</b>, there is a situation in which cyclic delay diversity is applied to channel A and channel B, and channel A and channel C alternately with respect to the frequency axis. At this time, the transmission path fluctuation estimation section of the reception apparatus can estimate transmission paths of channels to which cyclic delay diversity is applied by realizing equalization processing. Therefore, it is possible to estimate transmission path fluctuations of channel A and channel B at the same time on carrier <b>1</b> at time <b>1</b> and estimate transmission path fluctuations of channel A and channel C on carrier <b>2</b> at time <b>1</b>. Unlike the case of Embodiment 2, this allows transmission path fluctuations corresponding to two channels to be estimated at the same time, and therefore the number of preamble symbols can be reduced. This leads to improvement of the data transmission speed.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0198">However, while cyclic delay diversity capable of estimating transmission path fluctuations corresponding to three channels is theoretically possible, there is a disadvantage that the diversity gain decreases and the circuit scale of the reception apparatus increases, and therefore the configuration whereby transmission path fluctuations corresponding to two channels are estimated at the same time like this embodiment is preferable. For this purpose, it is important to always insert guard symbol ((I, Q)=(0, 0)) in any one of channels.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0199">When attention is focused on time <b>1</b>, the phases of channel B and channel C are shifted, and it is very important to match the amount of phase shifted (may also be expressed by the amount of symbols or time), for example, 0.5 symbols. This is because the reception apparatus can thereby standardize the circuit of simultaneous estimation of transmission path fluctuations of channel A and channel B and simultaneous estimation of transmission path fluctuations of channel A and channel C.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0200">As shown above, arranging preambles of triple transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO system so that cyclic delay diversity of two channels is executed on a channel which differs from one carrier to another makes it possible to estimate transmission path fluctuations with high accuracy and also reduce the number of preambles and improve the data transmission speed.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0201">This embodiment has explained the case of triple transmission, but can also be applied to a case with four or more antennas. This embodiment has been explained with an example using an OFDM scheme, but the present invention is not limited to this and can also be implemented in the same way when using a single-carrier scheme, other multicarrier schemes or a spread spectrum communication scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0202">Embodiment 3 above has explained switching between double transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO and triple transmission spatial multiplexing MIMO, but the present invention is not limited to this.

<p id="p-0204" num="0204"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> shows an example of the frame configuration of a transmission signal which is formed by a transmission apparatus of this embodiment and components corresponding to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are assigned the same reference numerals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel A, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel B and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27(</figref><i>c</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel C. As is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, pilot symbols (pilot carriers) <b>305</b> are arranged on carrier <b>3</b>, carrier <b>5</b>, carrier <b>8</b>, carrier <b>10</b> except for times at which reference symbols <b>302</b> and control symbols <b>304</b> are transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0205"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows signal point constellations of pilot symbols <b>305</b> of channel A, channel B and channel C, and a feature thereof. The feature in this case is that signal point constellations of channel A, channel B and channel C on the same carriers are orthogonal to each other (cross-correlation is zero) as in the case of Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0206">For example, the signal point constellation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>a</i>)) from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b> of channel A on carrier <b>3</b>, the signal point constellation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>b</i>)) from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b> of channel B on carrier <b>3</b> and the signal point constellation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>c</i>)) from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b> of channel C on carrier <b>3</b> are orthogonal to each other. Signal point constellations are performed so that such orthogonality is also maintained from time <b>15</b> onward. Using Walsh-Hadamard conversion, orthogonal codes or the like is suitable because of the orthogonality of signals at this time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> shows a case of BPSK, but if signals are orthogonal, QPSK modulation may also be used or it may be possible not to follow the rule of the modulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0207">Furthermore, for simplicity of a transmission apparatus and a reception apparatus in the case of this embodiment, the same signal point constellation (same sequence) is used between carrier <b>3</b> of channel A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>a</i>)) and carrier <b>5</b> of channel C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>f</i>)), between carrier <b>3</b> of channel B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>b</i>)) and carrier <b>8</b> of channel B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>h</i>)), between carrier <b>3</b> of channel C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>c</i>)) and carrier <b>10</b> of channel A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>j</i>)), between carrier <b>5</b> of channel A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>d</i>)) and carrier <b>8</b> of channel C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>i</i>)), between carrier <b>5</b> of channel B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>e</i>)) and carrier <b>10</b> of channel B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>k</i>)), and between carrier <b>8</b> of channel A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>g</i>)) and carrier <b>10</b> of channel C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28(</figref><i>l</i>)).

<p id="p-0208" num="0208">Furthermore, different signal point constellations (different sequences) of pilot symbols <b>305</b> are used for carriers <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b> of channel A (or channel C) and this is because there is a possibility that using the same signal point constellation (same sequence) may lead to an increase of transmission peak power.

<p id="p-0238" num="0238">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, pilot symbols <b>305</b> are arranged at specific times onspecific carriers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel A, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel B and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34(</figref><i>c</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel C. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, pilot symbol sequences which are orthogonal to each other are used among channels of the same carriers and at the same time pilot symbol sequences of the same sequences are repeatedly used where pilot symbols <b>305</b> are multiplexed on channel A, channel B and channel C. On channel A, pilot symbols <b>305</b> of different sequences are used for different subcarriers. That is, from time <b>6</b> to time <b>9</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, mapping similar to that for pilots from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is performed, and next from time <b>12</b> to time <b>15</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, mapping is performed according to a rule similar to that from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. Thus, using the frame configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> under a condition equivalent to the above described one can obtain effects similar to those described above.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0239">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, pilot symbols <b>305</b> are arranged in a plurality of consecutive subcarriers at a specific time. At this time, for example, a pilot symbol sequence on channel A at time <b>6</b> on carrier <b>2</b> to carrier <b>5</b>, a pilot symbol sequence on channel B at time <b>6</b> on carrier <b>2</b> to carrier <b>5</b> and a pilot symbol sequence on channel C at time <b>6</b> on carrier <b>2</b> to carrier <b>5</b> are orthogonal to each other. In the same way, pilot signals (pilot symbols) <b>305</b> on channel A at time <b>6</b> on carrier <b>8</b> to carrier <b>11</b>, pilot signals on channel B at time <b>6</b> on carrier <b>8</b> to carrier <b>11</b> and pilot signals on channel C at time <b>6</b> on carrier <b>8</b> to carrier <b>11</b> are orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0240">Furthermore, pilot signals on channel A at time <b>12</b> on carrier <b>2</b> to carrier <b>5</b>, pilot signals on channel B at time <b>12</b> on carrier <b>2</b> to carrier <b>5</b> and pilot signals on channel C at time <b>12</b> on carrier <b>2</b> to carrier <b>5</b> are orthogonal to each other. In the same way, pilot signals on channel A at time <b>12</b> on carrier <b>8</b> to carrier <b>11</b>, pilot signals on channel B at time <b>12</b> on carrier <b>8</b> to carrier <b>11</b> and pilot signals on channel C at time <b>12</b> on carrier <b>8</b> to carrier <b>11</b> are orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0241">Furthermore, using, for example, the same sequence for pilot signals on channel A at time <b>6</b> on carrier <b>2</b> to carrier <b>5</b> and for pilot signals on channel C at time <b>6</b> on carrier <b>8</b> to carrier <b>11</b> and also using the same sequence for other pilot signals can reduce a circuit scale and obtain effects similar to those in the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Here, a plurality of consecutive subcarriers have been explained as an example, but this example is not exclusive and similar effects can be obtained even if pilot symbols <b>305</b> are assigned to subcarriers discretely to an extent that orthogonality is not lost. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, even when pilot symbols are assigned on both the time axis and the frequency axis, similar effects can be obtained. In any case, effects similar to those described above can be obtained by assigning pilot symbols <b>305</b> in the frequency axis or the time domain in such a way that orthogonality is not lost.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0242">This embodiment has been explained using an example where pilot symbols <b>305</b>, which are orthogonal to each other in four-symbol units, but the present invention is not limited to four-symbol units. However, considering the influence of a fading fluctuation in the time direction or the frequency direction on the orthogonality, forming an orthogonal pattern with about 2 to 8 symbols may allow the estimation accuracy of frequency offset/phase noise to be secured. When the period of an orthogonal pattern is too long, the possibility that the orthogonality may not be secured increases and the estimation accuracy of frequency offset/phase noise degrades.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0243">The important points in the method of configuration of pilot symbols <b>305</b> of this embodiment are as follows:</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">(a) Pilot signals on the same carriers of channel A, channel B and channel C are orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">(b) In different carriers on which pilot signals are arranged, channels using different sequences exist.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">(c) Two or more channels using the same sequence exist (for example, one certain sequence is used for both antenna A and antenna B, that is, one certain sequence is shared by a plurality of different antennas).</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0244">In this way, when performing MIMO-OFDM transmission using three transmission antennas, it is possible to minimize an increase of transmission peak power without degrading the estimation accuracy of frequency offset/phase noise and realize a transmission apparatus in a simple configuration. It is an optimum condition to select pilot signals so as to meet all of the three conditions above and form pilot carriers, but when, for example, only some of the above described effects are preferably obtained, it is also possible to select pilot signals so at to meet, for example, only two out of the three conditions above and form pilot carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0245">This embodiment has been explained with an example using an OFDM scheme but the present invention is not limited to this and can also be implemented in the same way when using a single-carrier scheme, other multicarrier schemes or a spread spectrum communication scheme.

This preamble is composed of guard symbol <b>301</b>, and reference symbol <b>302</b>. Guard symbol <b>301</b> is assumed to be (0, 0) on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane. Reference symbol <b>302</b> is, for example, a symbol at known coordinates other than (0, 0) on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane. Channel A and channel B are configured such that no interference occurs with each other. That is, when, for example, guard symbol <b>301</b> is placed on channel A on carrier <b>1</b> at time <b>1</b>, reference symbol <b>302</b> is placed on channel B and when reference symbol <b>302</b> is placed on channel A on carrier <b>2</b> at time <b>1</b>, guard symbol <b>301</b> is placed on channel B, and in this way different symbols are placed on channel A and channel B. By adopting such an arrangement, when, for example, attention is focused on channel A at time <b>1</b>, it is possible to estimate a transmission path fluctuation of carrier <b>3</b> using reference symbols <b>302</b> of carrier <b>2</b> and carrier <b>4</b>.

In the same way, transmission path fluctuations of all carriers can be accurately estimated for channel B, too. From time <b>2</b> to time <b>8</b>, transmission path fluctuations of all carriers of channel A and channel B can be estimated in the same way. Thus, since the frame configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> allows transmission path fluctuations of all carriers to be estimated at all times from time <b>1</b> to time <b>8</b>, this can be said to be a preamble configuration capable of realizing quite high accuracy estimation of transmission path fluctuations.</p>

At this time, using a Walsh-Hadamard conversion, orthogonal codes or the like is suitable because of the orthogonality of signals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the case of BPSK, but if signals are orthogonal, QPSK modulation may also be used or it may not be necessary to follow the rule of the modulation scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0278">Furthermore, in the case of this embodiment, for simplicity of the receiver, suppose the signal point constellations are the same (same pattern) between carrier <b>4</b> of channel A and carrier <b>9</b> of channel B and between carrier <b>9</b> of channel A and carrier <b>4</b> of channel B. However, the same pattern does not mean do adopt completely the same signal point constellation.

<p id="p-0279" num="0279">Here, as defined in Embodiment 5, if it is assumed that &#x201c;the same sequence&#x201d; means completely the same signal point constellation, for simplicity of the receiver, the signal point constellations may be assumed to be same between carrier <b>4</b> of channel A and carrier <b>9</b> of channel B and between carrier <b>9</b> of channel A and carrier <b>4</b> of channel B, that is, the same sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0280">Furthermore, the signal point constellation of pilot symbols <b>305</b> is made to differ between carriers <b>4</b> and <b>9</b> of channel A (or channel B), that is, different sequences, and this is because using the same signal point constellation may lead to an increase of transmission peak power.</p>

<p id="p-0286" num="0286">Code multiplication section <b>612</b>A receives baseband signal <b>603</b> of carrier <b>4</b> and selection signal <b>611</b> as input, multiplies baseband signal <b>603</b> of carrier <b>4</b> by selection signal <b>611</b>, generates baseband signal <b>613</b>A of channel A of carrier <b>4</b> and outputs this. The reason is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0287">Baseband signal <b>603</b> of carrier <b>4</b> is a signal in which the baseband signal of channel A and the baseband signal of channel B are multiplex.

<p id="p-0291" num="0291">As described above, by making signal point constellations of channel A and channel B on the same carriers orthogonal to each other, even when pilot symbols <b>305</b> are multiplexed on channel A and channel B, it is possible to estimate frequency offset and/or phase noise with high accuracy. Another important advantage is that since no channel estimation value (transmission path fluctuation estimation value) is required, it is possible to simplify the configuration of the part for compensating for the frequency offset and/or phase noise. If signal point constellations of pilot symbols <b>305</b> of channel A and channel B are not orthogonal to each other, signal processing of MIMO demultiplexing (for example, ZF, MMSE or MLD) is carried out, frequency offset and/or phase noise are then estimated. On the other hand, according to the configuration of this embodiment, it is possible to compensate for frequency offset and/or phase noise before demultiplexing a signal (signal processing section <b>223</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. In addition, the frequency offset and/or phase noise can be removed using pilot symbols <b>305</b> even after demultiplexing the signal of channel A from the signal of channel B by signal processing section <b>223</b>, thereby making it possible to compensate for frequency offset and/or phase noise with higher accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0292">By the way, when the signal point constellations of channel A and channel B of the same carriers are not orthogonal to each other, the estimation accuracy for frequency offset and/or phase noise by frequency offset/phase noise estimation section <b>213</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> decreases (signals become components of interference with each other), and therefore it is difficult to add the frequency offset/phase noise compensation section <b>215</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and it is not possible to realize high accuracy frequency offset/phase noise compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0293">Furthermore, this embodiment assumes the same signal point constellation (same sequence) for carrier <b>4</b> of channel A and carrier <b>9</b> of channel B, and carrier <b>9</b> of channel A and carrier <b>4</b> of channel B, thereby providing commonality between sequence storage sections <b>3601</b> and <b>3603</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> and this leads to simplification of the reception apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0294">However, while it is essential in this embodiment that signal point constellations of channel A and channel B on the same carriers be orthogonal to each other, it is not necessarily essential that they have the same sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0295">This embodiment has been explained using an example where pilot symbols <b>305</b>, which are orthogonal to each other in four-symbol units, from time <b>11</b> to time <b>14</b>, but the present invention is not limited to four-symbol units. However, when considering an influence on the orthogonality due to a fluctuation of fading in the time direction, if an orthogonal pattern is formed in 2 to 8-symbol units, it may be possible to secure the estimation accuracy for frequency offset/phase noise. When the period of an orthogonal pattern is too long, the possibility that the orthogonality may not be secured increases and the estimation accuracy for frequency offset/phase noise degrades.</p>

<p id="p-0301" num="0301">The above described explanation shows that adopting the configuration of pilot symbols <b>305</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> can simplify the reception apparatus. Similarly, adopting the pilot symbol configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also allows the transmission apparatus to standardize sequence storage sections <b>3701</b> and <b>3703</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> and also leads to the simplification of the transmission apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0302">As shown above, the method of generating preambles and pilot signals of this embodiment, the detailed configuration and operation of the transmission apparatus which generates them and the reception apparatus which receives the modulated signal of this embodiment have been explained. According to this embodiment, it is possible to improve the estimation accuracy of frequency offset, transmission path fluctuation and synchronization, thereby improving the probability of detection of signals and simplifying the transmission apparatus and the reception apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0303">As in the case of Embodiment 1, the important points of the method of configuration of pilot symbols <b>305</b> of this embodiment are as follows:</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">(a) Pilot signals of channel A and channel B on the same carriers are orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">(b) Within the same channel, different sequences are used for different carriers on which pilot signals are arranged.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">(c) The same sequence is used on each channel (channel A and channel B).</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0304">In this way, when performing MIMO-OFDM transmission using two transmission antennas, it is possible to minimize an increase of transmission peak power without degrading the estimation accuracy of frequency offset/phase noise and realize a transmission apparatus in a simple configuration. It is an optimum condition to select pilot signals so as to meet all of the three conditions above and form pilot carriers. However, when, for example, only some of the above described effects are preferably obtained, it is also possible to select pilot signals so at to meet, for example, only two out of the three conditions above and form pilot carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0305">This embodiment has been explained with an example using an OFDM scheme but the present invention is not limited to this and can also be implemented in the same way when using single-carrier schemes, other multicarrier schemes or spread spectrum communication schemes. Furthermore, this embodiment has been explained with an example where two antennas are used for transmission and reception respectively, but the present invention is not limited to this and can also be implemented even when the number of reception antennas is three or more, in the same way without being influenced. Furthermore, the frame configuration is not limited to this embodiment and especially pilot symbols <b>305</b> for estimating distortion such as frequency offset, phase noise or the like may only be required to be arranged on specific subcarriers, and transmitted from a plurality of antennas, and the number of the subcarriers for transmitting pilot symbols <b>305</b> is not limited to two of this embodiment.

The reason is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0329">Baseband signal <b>3102</b>_#<b>3</b> of carrier <b>3</b> is a signal in which the baseband signal of channel A and the baseband signal of channel B are multiplexed. When this multiplexed signal is multiplied by signal <b>3111</b> of sequence #<b>1</b>, the component of the baseband signal of channel B having a zero cross-correlation is removed, thereby making it possible to extract only a baseband signal component of channel A.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0330">Phase fluctuation estimation section <b>3105</b>A receives baseband signal <b>3104</b>A_#<b>3</b> of channel A of carrier <b>3</b> as input, estimates a phase fluctuation based on this signal and outputs phase fluctuation estimation signal <b>3106</b>A_#<b>3</b> of channel A.</p>

<p id="p-0333" num="0333">Frequency offset/phase noise estimation section <b>3123</b>_#<b>5</b> of carrier <b>5</b> only differs in the signal to be processed and operates in the same way as above described frequency offset/phase noise estimation section <b>3123</b>_#<b>3</b> of carrier <b>3</b> and outputs phase fluctuation estimation signal <b>3106</b>A_#<b>5</b> of channel A about carrier <b>5</b> and phase fluctuation estimation signal <b>3106</b>B_#<b>5</b> of channel B. Frequency offset/phase noise estimation section <b>3123</b>_#<b>8</b> of carrier <b>8</b> also only differs in the signal to be processed and operates in the same way as above described frequency offset/phase noise estimation section <b>3123</b>_#<b>3</b> of carrier <b>3</b> and outputs phase fluctuation estimation signal <b>3106</b>A_#<b>8</b> of channel A about carrier <b>8</b> and phase fluctuation estimation signal <b>3106</b>B_#<b>8</b> of channel B. Moreover, frequency offset/phase noise estimation section <b>3123</b>_#<b>10</b> of carrier <b>10</b> also only differs in the signal to be processed and operates in the same way as above described frequency offset/phase noise estimation section <b>3123</b>_#<b>3</b> of carrier <b>3</b> and outputs phase fluctuation estimation signal <b>3106</b>A_#<b>10</b> of channel A about carrier <b>10</b> and phase fluctuation estimation signal <b>3106</b>B_#<b>10</b> of channel B.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0334">As described above, making signals of channel A and channel B of the same carriers orthogonal to each other, allows frequency offset/phase noise to be estimated with high accuracy even when pilot symbols <b>305</b> are multiplexed on channel A and channel B. Another important advantage is that since no channel estimation value (transmission path fluctuation estimation value) is required, the configuration of the part for compensating for frequency offset and/or phase noise can be simplified. If the signal point constellations of channel A and channel B are not orthogonal to each other, signal processing of MIMO demultiplexing, for example, ZF, MMSE, MLD is carried out and then frequency offset and/or phase noise are estimated. On the other hand, according to the present invention, it is possible to compensate for frequency offset and/or phase noise before demultiplexing a signal (signal processing section <b>223</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In addition, signal processing section <b>223</b> can remove the frequency offset and/or phase noise using pilot symbols <b>305</b> even after the signal is demultiplexed into the signal of channel A and signal of channel B, and therefore it is possible to compensate for the frequency offset and/or phase noise with higher accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0335">On the other hand, when the signal point constellations of channel A and channel B of the same carriers are not orthogonal to each other, the estimation accuracy for frequency offset/phase noise estimation section <b>213</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> decreases (signals become components of interference with each other), and therefore it is difficult to add frequency offset/phase noise compensation section <b>215</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and it is not possible to perform frequency offset/phase noise compensation with high accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0336">As described above, a plurality of channels or a plurality of carriers are made to use pilot symbols <b>305</b> of the same sequence, and therefore it is possible to standardize sequence storage sections <b>3108</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>3108</b>_<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> among a plurality of channels or a plurality of carriers, which leads to the simplification of the reception apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0337">This embodiment has been explained using pilot symbols <b>305</b>, which are orthogonal to each other in four-symbol units, as an example, but the present invention is not limited to four-symbol units. However, considering an influence of a fluctuation of fading in the time direction on the orthogonality, it may be possible to secure the estimation accuracy of frequency offset and/or phase noise if an orthogonal pattern is formed with about 2 to 8 symbols. When the period of the orthogonal pattern is too long, the possibility that the orthogonality may not be secured increases and the estimation accuracy of frequency offset and/or phase noise degrades.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0338">The important points of the method of configuration of pilot symbols <b>305</b> of this embodiment are as follows.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">(a) Pilot signals on the same carriers of channel A and channel B are orthogonal to each other.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">(b) For different carriers on which pilot signals are arranged within the same channel, different sequences are used.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">(c) The same sequence is used for respective channels (channel A and channel B).</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0339">In this way, when performing MIMO-OFDM transmission using two transmission antennas, it is possible to minimiz an increase of transmission peak power without degrading the estimation accuracy of frequency offset and/or phase noise and realize a transmission apparatus in a simple configuration. It is an optimum condition to select pilot signals so as to meet all of the three conditions above and form pilot carriers, but when, for example, it is preferable to obtain only some of the above described effects, it is possible to select pilot signals so at to meet, for example, only two out of the above three conditions and form pilot carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0340">This embodiment has been explained with an example using an OFDM scheme but the present invention is not limited to this and can also be implemented in the same way when using a single-carrier scheme, other multicarrier schemes or a spread spectrum communication scheme. Furthermore, this embodiment has been explained with an example where two antennas are used for transmission and reception respectively, but the present invention is not limited to this and can also be implemented even when the number of reception antennas is three or more in the same way without being influenced. Furthermore, the frame configuration is not limited to this embodiment and especially pilot symbols <b>305</b> for estimating distortion such as frequency offset, phase noise or the like may only be required to be arranged on specific subcarriers, and transmitted from a plurality of antennas, and the number of the subcarriers for transmitting pilot symbols <b>305</b> is not limited to four in this embodiment. Embodiments with other numbers of antennas or using other transmission methods will be explained in detail later. In addition, this embodiment has been explained using naming such as &#x201c;pilot symbol <b>305</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;reference symbol <b>302</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;guard symbol <b>301</b>&#x201d;, &#x201c;preamble&#x201d;, but using other names will by no means influence this embodiment.

<p id="p-0341" num="0341">Furthermore, the frame configuration has been explained using the frame configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> as an example but is by no means limited to this.

<p id="p-0344" num="0344">The element indicated with &#x201c;A&#x201d; appended at the end of the reference numeral is the part related to channel A, the element indicated with &#x201c;B&#x201d; appended is a part related to channel B, the element indicated with &#x201c;C&#x201d; appended is a part related to channel C and the element indicated with &#x201c;D&#x201d; appended is a part related to channel D, and they only differ in signals to be handled and are basically subjected to processing similar to processing on the part about channel A indicated with &#x201c;A&#x201d; appended at the end of the reference numerals explained in Embodiment 1.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0345"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> shows an example of the frame configuration of a transmission signal formed by the transmission apparatus of this embodiment and parts which correspond to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are assigned the same reference numerals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45(</figref><i>a</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel A, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45(</figref><i>b</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel B, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45(</figref><i>c</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel C and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45(</figref><i>d</i>) shows the frame configuration of channel D.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0346">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, the most characteristic aspect is the configuration of preambles and at a certain time on two channels, reference symbols <b>302</b> and guard (null) symbols <b>301</b> are alternately arranged on the frequency axis (for example, channel A and channel C at time <b>1</b> and time <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, and channel B and channel D at time <b>3</b> and time <b>4</b>), while reference symbols <b>302</b> are not arranged on the remaining two channels and only guard (null) symbols <b>301</b> are arranged (for example, channel B and channel D at time <b>1</b> and time <b>2</b>, and channel A and channel C at time <b>3</b> and time <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0347">When transmitting modulated signals of four channels, a method of inserting reference symbol <b>302</b> for every 3 symbols may be thought of as the simplest configuration, but it is also possible to think of a radio communication system in which a correlation of a transmission path fluctuation on the frequency axis decreases due to the influence of multipaths as the distance on the frequency axis increases. In such a radio communication system, it is not preferable to insert reference symbol <b>302</b> for every 3 symbols. But it is not always undesirable. Depending on a radio communication system, inserting reference symbol <b>302</b> for every 3 symbols may not influence reception quality, either.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0348">Therefore, this embodiment inserts reference symbols <b>302</b> and guard (null) symbols <b>301</b> alternately for OFDM symbols (generic name of symbols of all subcarriers within a certain time, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45(</figref><i>d</i>)) at a certain time. However, it is not possible to adopt the configuration in which reference symbols <b>302</b> and guard (null) symbols <b>301</b> are arranged alternately for OFDM symbols on all channels. This is because adopting such a configuration would cause reference symbols <b>302</b> to collide with each other among different channels. Even when the number of channels increases, adopting the frame configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> can avoid reference symbols <b>302</b> from colliding with each other among different channels without reference symbols <b>302</b> being de multiplexed from each other too much on the frequency axis.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0349"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> shows a relationship between a modulation scheme of reference symbols <b>302</b> and a normalization factor when four modulated signals are transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0350"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> show examples of mapping when four modulated signals are transmitted on the in-phase I-quadrature Q plane in OFDM symbol units when the relationship between a modulation scheme of reference symbols <b>302</b> and a normalization factor is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>. However, the examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> apply to a case where the normalization factor is 1. At this time, if the rule in Embodiment 3 is observed, it is preferable to set the power of reference symbols <b>302</b> to 2&#xd7;2+0&#xd7;0=4 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. This allows the receiver to reduce the influence of quantization errors and thereby suppress a reduction of reception quality.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0351">Here, the case where the same average reception power is set for data symbols <b>303</b> and preambles has been explained as an example, but there are often cases where reception quality can be secured when the average reception power of preambles is made to be greater than the average reception power of data symbols <b>303</b>. The above described concept can also be applied to this case, too.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0352">Furthermore, this embodiment has been explained using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> as an example of the transmission frame configuration in which it is possible to prevent reference symbols <b>302</b> from colliding with each other among different channels without reference symbols <b>302</b> being demultiplexed too much from each other on the frequency axis even if the number of channels increases, but this example is not exclusive and it is also possible to obtain similar effects using a frame configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>.</p>
