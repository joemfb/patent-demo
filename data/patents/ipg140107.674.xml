<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 of German Patent Application DE 10 2009 014 435.8 filed Mar. 26, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to an exhaust gas-treating device for an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine, especially of a motor vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such an exhaust gas-treating device may contain at least one particle filter in order to filter out particles carried in the exhaust gas, especially soot. The particles filtered out are deposited in a particle filter element of the particle filter. The storage capacity of the particle filter decreases with increasing load, and the flow resistance of the particle filter increases at the same time. Regenerations are correspondingly carried out, during which the particle load is burned off. Since particles that cannot be burned off are also deposited in the particle filter, the particle filter gradually becomes clogged despite regenerations, which reduces the storage capacity of the particle filter and increases the flow resistance thereof. It may therefore be necessary over the intended service life of an internal combustion engine to perform maintenance on or replace the particle filter. It is undesirable in this connection to replace the entire exhaust gas-treating device. It is rather desirable to design the exhaust gas-treating device such that the particle filter or at least the particular particle filter element can be made accessible and replaced with the least possible effort. It is common practice for this to design a housing of the exhaust gas-treating device such that it can be opened. For example, individual components of the housing can be fastened detachably to one another for this purpose. For example, flanged fastenings are conceivable, but this means increased weight as well as a comparatively great manufacturing effort. Plug-in connections are quasi ruled out because these can be detached with very great difficulty only or not at all any more after a long connection time. Clamp connections seem to be best suited.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention pertains to the object of providing an improved embodiment for an exhaust gas-treating device of the type mentioned in the introduction, which is characterized especially by simple handling for changing the particle filter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is based on the general idea of installing at least one mounting tube in the housing of the exhaust gas-treating device, which said mounting tube passes through an end bottom of the especially barrel-shaped housing. A particle filter can be subsequently inserted into the mounting tube axially without the housing itself having to be opened. In addition, the exhaust gas-treating device is equipped with a deflecting housing, which deflects in the mounted state the exhaust gas flow leaving the particle filter or the mounting tube in a deflecting chamber contained therein to an inlet of the housing, which inlet likewise passes through said end bottom of the housing. The exhaust gas can thus be led out of the housing proper of the exhaust gas-treating device through the external deflecting housing, deflected and introduced again. A further treatment of the exhaust gas may subsequently optionally follow in the interior of the housing of the exhaust gas-treating device. The deflecting housing is detachably attached to the housing by means of at least one fastening means. The respective fastening means detachably connects at least one inlet of the deflecting housing to an outlet end of the mounting tube.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The mode of construction being proposed creates sufficient access to the particle filter for maintenance purposes without the housing itself having to be opened for this. The detachable attachment of such a deflecting housing is comparatively simple and inexpensive.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Corresponding to an advantageous embodiment, an outlet-side end section of the particle filter, which faces the deflecting housing, may be designed such that it can be integrated in the fastening means, which is provided for the detachable fastening of the inlet of the deflecting housing at the outlet end of the mounting tube, such that axial fixation of the particle filter at the mounting tube or at the inlet of the deflecting housing is achieved hereby. In other words, the fastening means, which is used to fasten the deflecting housing to the housing of the exhaust gas-treating device, assumes a dual function, because the particle filter inserted into the mounting tube is axially fixed with it at the same time. This facilitates the mounting and removal or replacement of the particle filter, because no separate additional fastening means has to be actuated, which could be intended for the separate fixation of the particle filter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Corresponding to another advantageous embodiment, an inlet-side end section of the particle filter, which faces away from the deflecting housing, can be radially supported at the mounting tube in an axially displaceable manner. The particle filter can perform relative motions as a result in relation to the mounting tube in the area of its inlet-side end section. This is of increased significance especially in respect to thermal expansion effects. The axially displaceable supporting leads to a movable bearing of the particle filter in or at the mounting tube in the area of the inlet-side end section, while the axial fixation provided at the inlet-side end section of the particle filter quasi forms a fixed bearing between the particle filter and the mounting tube. This combination leads to secure and stable supporting or fixation of the position of the particle filter in the mounting tube and is, moreover, extensively free from thermal stresses.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Corresponding to another advantageous embodiment, provisions may be made for forming the mounting tube by an outlet-side extension of a jacket of an oxidation-type catalytic converter, which is arranged upstream of the particle filter in the housing of the exhaust gas-treating device. The jacket accommodates, moreover, at least one oxidation-type catalytic converter element. The jacket of the oxidation-type catalytic converter thus assumes a dual function, because it accommodates the respective oxidation-type catalytic converter element, on the one hand, while it forms the mounting tube for mounting the particle filter, on the other hand.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is obvious that the above-mentioned features, which will also be explained below, can be used not only in the particular combination indicated, but in other combinations or alone as well without going beyond the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferred exemplary embodiments of the present invention are shown in the drawings and will be explained in more detail in the following description, where identical reference numbers designate identical or similar or functionally identical components. The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and specific objects attained by its uses, reference is made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which preferred embodiments of the invention are illustrated.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to the drawings in particular, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exhaust gas-treating device <b>1</b>, which is intended for use in an exhaust system of an internal combustion engine, especially of a motor vehicle, may have a housing, which has a jacket <b>3</b> extending laterally circumferentially, as well as two end-side bottoms or end bottoms <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, of which only one or the first end bottom <b>4</b> faces the viewer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The other or second end bottom <b>5</b> is arranged at the end of the housing <b>2</b> located away from the first end bottom <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the exhaust gas-treating device <b>1</b> is preferably equipped with at least one mounting tube <b>6</b>. Precisely one such mounting tube <b>6</b> is provided in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows, purely as an example, an embodiment with two such mounting tubes <b>6</b>. The respective mounting tube <b>6</b> passes axially through the first end bottom <b>4</b>. Furthermore, the respective mounting tube <b>6</b> accommodates a particle filter <b>7</b>. The respective particle filter <b>7</b> is plugged for this into an outlet end <b>8</b> of the mounting tube <b>6</b>, which said outlet end <b>8</b> passes through the first end bottom <b>4</b>, axially and from the outside, i.e., from a side facing away from the interior space <b>23</b> of housing <b>2</b>. Particle filter <b>7</b> is arranged now coaxially with the mounting tube <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, a deflecting housing <b>9</b> is provided in the example. This contains, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a deflecting chamber <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the deflecting housing <b>9</b> has at least one inlet <b>11</b> communicating with the deflecting chamber <b>10</b> as well as at least one outlet <b>12</b> communicating with the deflecting chamber <b>10</b>. The deflecting housing <b>9</b> is attached to the housing <b>2</b> of the exhaust gas-treating device <b>1</b>, which can hereinafter also be called main housing <b>2</b>. At least one fastening means <b>13</b>, which makes possible the detachable fastening of the respective inlet <b>11</b> of the deflecting housing <b>9</b> to the respective outlet end <b>8</b> of the respective mounting tube <b>6</b>, is used for this.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition or as an alternative, the exhaust gas-treating device <b>1</b> being shown here may also have, besides, a mixing housing <b>14</b>, which is arranged in the main housing <b>2</b>. Mixing housing <b>14</b> contains a mixing chamber <b>15</b> and has an inlet <b>16</b>, which communicates with the mixing chamber <b>15</b>, as well as an outlet <b>17</b>, which likewise communicates with the mixing chamber <b>15</b>. Both the inlet <b>16</b> and the outlet <b>17</b> pass through the first end bottom <b>4</b> of the main housing <b>2</b>. The mixing chamber <b>14</b> is recognizable in the embodiments being shown here in the area of a front side <b>18</b> facing the first bottom <b>4</b> only in physical contact with the main housing <b>2</b>, whereas it is otherwise located at a spaced location from the main housing <b>2</b>, i.e., especially from jacket <b>3</b> and from the second end bottom <b>5</b>. The dimensioning of the mixing housing <b>14</b> is preferably adapted to the dimensioning of the main housing <b>2</b> such that a deflection area <b>19</b> located away from the inlet <b>16</b> in the mixing chamber <b>15</b> is located farther away from the first end bottom <b>4</b> than from the second end bottom <b>5</b>. In other words, the mixing housing <b>14</b> extends from the first end bottom <b>4</b> to the second end bottom <b>5</b>, but preferably without touching this. As a result, mixing chamber <b>15</b> assumes a comparatively great length in the axial direction of the especially cylindrical or barrel-shaped main housing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Outlet <b>17</b> of the mixing housing <b>14</b> opens into a deflecting chamber <b>20</b>, which can hereinafter be called an additional deflecting chamber <b>20</b>. Furthermore, at least one inlet <b>21</b> of at least one SCR catalytic converter <b>22</b> opens into this additional deflecting chamber <b>20</b>. The respective inlet <b>21</b> of the SCR catalytic converter <b>22</b> likewise passes through the first end bottom <b>4</b>. The respective SCR catalytic converter <b>22</b> extends otherwise in the interior <b>23</b> of the main housing <b>2</b>. Corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the exhaust gas-treating device <b>1</b> has two such SCR catalytic converters <b>22</b> in this example. It is clear that there may also be more or fewer SCR catalytic converters <b>22</b>. Gas flows through the two SCR catalytic converters <b>22</b> in parallel and they open on the outlet side, via a corresponding outlet <b>24</b> each, into the interior <b>23</b> or into a settling chamber <b>25</b> of the main housing <b>2</b>, which said chamber is formed in the interior <b>23</b>. Purely as an example, the SCR catalytic converter <b>22</b> has two SCR catalytic converters <b>26</b> in the example, which are arranged one after the other, i.e., gas can flow through them in series.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Main housing <b>2</b> has, in the usual manner, an outlet port <b>27</b>, which communicates, for example, with the settling chamber <b>25</b>. In addition, an intermediate bottom <b>28</b>, which separates in the interior <b>23</b> the settling chamber <b>25</b> from an absorption chamber <b>29</b>, which may be filled with a sound-absorbing material <b>30</b> in the example, may be arranged in the main housing <b>2</b>. Intermediate bottom <b>28</b> is designed such that it is permeable to air-borne sound. For example, it has a corresponding perforation. In addition, additional sound-absorbing measures may be provided in the exhaust gas-treating device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Main housing <b>2</b> is equipped, furthermore, with an inlet port <b>31</b>, which is connected corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in the interior <b>23</b> via a deflecting shell <b>32</b> to an inlet <b>33</b> of an oxidation-type catalytic converter <b>34</b>. The oxidation-type catalytic converter <b>34</b> is arranged upstream of the particle filter <b>7</b>. If a plurality of particle filters <b>7</b> are accommodated in the main housing <b>2</b>, correspondingly many oxidation-type catalytic converters <b>34</b> are provided as well, to which exhaust gas is admitted via a common inlet port <b>31</b> or via separate inlet ports <b>31</b>. It is likewise possible to provide a common oxidation-type catalytic converter <b>34</b> for a plurality of particle filters <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A preferred embodiment and corresponding processes will be discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>. The particle filter <b>7</b> correspondingly has an outlet-side end section <b>35</b>, which faces the deflecting housing <b>9</b> and is preferably configured such that it can be integrated into the fastening means <b>13</b>. The end section <b>35</b> is integrated in the fastening means <b>13</b> such that axial fixation of the particle filter <b>7</b> to the mounting tube <b>6</b> or to the inlet <b>11</b> of the deflecting housing <b>9</b> and hence also axial fixation of the particle filter <b>7</b> to the deflecting housing <b>9</b> is also formed hereby. By separating the fastening means <b>13</b>, the axial fixation of the particle filter <b>7</b> is eliminated as well, so that the particle filter <b>7</b> can be pulled axially out of the mounting tube <b>6</b> when the deflecting housing <b>9</b> is removed. By mounting the deflecting housing <b>9</b> and by fastening the deflecting housing <b>9</b> to the main housing <b>2</b>, the respective particle filter <b>7</b> is also fixed at the same time in the relative position intended therefor by means of the fastening means <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The fastening means <b>13</b> is designed as a clamp connection in the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. Contrary to this, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a fastening means <b>13</b> designed as a screwed flange connection. Corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, the respective fastening means <b>13</b> comprises a first mounting flange <b>36</b>, which is formed at the free end of the respective inlet <b>11</b>. Furthermore, the fastening means <b>13</b> comprises a second mounting flange <b>37</b>, which is formed at the free outlet end <b>8</b> of the respective mounting tube <b>6</b>. The outlet-side end section <b>35</b> of the particle filter <b>7</b> has a collar <b>38</b>, which projects outwardly and extends circumferentially in some segments or preferably in its entirety. In the mounted state shown, this collar <b>38</b> is arranged axially between the mounting flanges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> of the fastening means <b>13</b>. The fastening means <b>13</b> is preferably configured now such that it makes it possible to axially brace the collar <b>38</b> between the mounting flanges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The respective fastening means <b>13</b> may be equipped with at least one seal <b>39</b> in order to improve the gas tightness of the connection made. Exactly one such seal <b>39</b>, which is axially directly in contact with the two mounting flanges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, is provided in the example according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</figref>. The collar <b>38</b> is directly in contact with the mounting flanges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> in these cases. Contrary to this, two such seals <b>39</b> are provided in the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, and the mounting flanges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> are supported at the collar <b>38</b> via one of these seals <b>39</b> on sides mutually facing away from one another. Especially advantageous is an embodiment in which the seals <b>39</b> are fastened to the collar <b>38</b>, e.g., by bonding or vulcanization. The respective seal <b>39</b> can then also be replaced automatically by changing the particle filter <b>7</b>. In addition, mounting becomes simpler.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">To make it possible to replace the particle filter <b>7</b> in a simplified manner, it is preferably equipped with a jacket <b>41</b>, which has a tubular design and which accommodates at least one particle filter element <b>42</b>. The particle filter element <b>42</b> is enveloped here by means of a mounting mat <b>43</b> in the usual manner and is thus positioned in the jacket <b>41</b>. The aforementioned collar <b>38</b> is preferably made integrally in one piece with this jacket <b>41</b> of the particle filter <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an inlet-side end section <b>40</b> of the particle filter <b>7</b>, which end section is located away from the deflecting housing <b>9</b>, can be radially supported at the mounting tube <b>6</b> such that the end section <b>40</b> is axially displaceable relative to the mounting tube <b>6</b>. This axial displaceability of the inlet-side end section <b>40</b> can be embodied in different ways. A plurality of alternative solutions are shown as examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-13</figref>. For example, an annular or ring segment-shaped bearing body <b>44</b>, which can slide on the mounting tube <b>6</b>, may be fastened to the particle filter <b>7</b> or to the jacket <b>41</b> thereof corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 12</figref>, the bearing body <b>44</b> may be made elastic and formed, for example, by a collar or pad or wiremesh or mounting mat material, which extents fully circumferentially or extends circumferentially in some segments. This elastic bearing body <b>44</b> may be fastened to the particle filter <b>7</b> or the jacket <b>41</b> thereof corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and slide on the mounting tube <b>6</b>. It is likewise possible, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, to arrange such an elastic bearing body <b>44</b> at the mounting tube <b>6</b>, so that the particle filter <b>7</b> or the jacket <b>41</b> thereof can slide thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">No separate bearing body <b>14</b> is used in the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>, but a contour that makes mounting possible is formed directly at the particle filter <b>7</b> or at the jacket <b>41</b> thereof corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> or directly at the mounting tube <b>6</b> corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a cross-section expansion <b>45</b>, which is formed directly at jacket <b>41</b> of particle filter <b>7</b> and which may be configured such that it extends fully circumferentially or extends circumferentially in some segments. As can be recognized, this cross-section expansion <b>45</b> is supported directly at the mounting tube <b>6</b>. Contrary to this, a cross-section contraction <b>46</b> formed at the mounting tube <b>6</b>, which is dimensioned such that it comes into direct radial contact with the particle filter <b>7</b> or with the jacket <b>41</b> thereof, is provided in the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>. This cross section contraction <b>46</b> may also extend fully circumferentially or extend circumferentially in some sections. For example, the linear support shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> indicates a cross section contraction <b>46</b> extending in an annular pattern, while the flat support shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> indicates a cross section contraction <b>46</b> extending circumferentially in a punctiform manner or in some segments, which has a plurality of contact areas arranged at spaced locations from one another in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows another peculiarity of the exhaust gas-treating device <b>1</b> shown here. The oxidation-type catalytic converter <b>34</b> comprises in the example an oxidation-type catalytic converter element <b>47</b>, which is arranged in a tubular jacket <b>48</b> and is positioned in the corresponding jacket <b>48</b> by means of a corresponding mounting mat <b>49</b>. Jacket <b>48</b> of the oxidation-type catalytic converter <b>34</b> is axially extended on an outlet side <b>50</b> of the oxidation-type catalytic converter <b>34</b>. This axial outlet-side extension of jacket <b>48</b> of the oxidation-type catalytic converter <b>34</b> forms the mounting tube <b>6</b> in the embodiments being shown here. An extreme simplification and weight reduction is obtained hereby and simple possibility of replacing the particle filter <b>7</b> is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the outlet <b>12</b> of the deflecting housing <b>9</b> and the inlet <b>16</b> of the mixing housing <b>14</b> are connected to one another in a communicating manner. A fastening means <b>51</b>, which makes it possible to detachably fasten the outlet <b>12</b> and the inlet <b>16</b> to one another, shall be used for this connection as well. This additional fastening means <b>51</b> may be, in principle, of the same design as the aforementioned fastening means <b>13</b>. Thus, this is preferably also a clamp connection or a screwed flange connection.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref> show different embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref> show a clamp connection each, wherein the respective clamp <b>52</b> is designed as a flat clamp <b>52</b>, which brings about only radial pressing of the tube sections plugged coaxially into one another, namely, between the outlet <b>8</b> of the mounting tube <b>6</b> and the inlet <b>11</b> of the deflecting housing <b>9</b>, on the one hand, and between the outlet <b>12</b> of the deflecting housing <b>9</b> and the inlet <b>16</b> of the mixing housing <b>14</b>, on the other hand. An embodiment corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in which the respective clamp connection <b>13</b>, <b>51</b> is designed as a V clamp <b>53</b>, is preferred. Such a V clamp <b>53</b> can be equipped corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> with a circumferential tensioning band <b>54</b> as well as with a V-section <b>55</b>, as a result of which axial pressing of the mounting flanges <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> can be achieved by means of such a V clamp <b>53</b>, which can also be called a V-band clamp. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> indicates tightening means <b>56</b>, which make it possible to tighten the respective clamp <b>53</b> in the usual manner. Contrary to this, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows for the respective clamp <b>52</b> only an area <b>57</b>, which is intended for arranging a suitable tightening means.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Finally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows an embodiment in which the respective fastening mans <b>13</b>, <b>51</b> is designed as a screwed flange connection <b>58</b>. Corresponding screws <b>59</b> can be recognized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. It can be determined from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-16</figref> that the fastening means <b>13</b>, <b>51</b> operating with V-clamps <b>53</b> have an especially compact design in the axial direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> indicates that the two fastening means <b>13</b>, <b>51</b> do not necessarily have to be of identical design. Thus, the fastening means <b>13</b> associated with the particle filter <b>7</b> is designed as a V-clamp <b>53</b>, whereas the fastening means <b>51</b> associated with the mixing housing <b>14</b> is designed as a flat clamp <b>52</b> here as an example.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-23</figref> and partly corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-29</figref>, at least one guide wall <b>60</b> may be arranged in the mixing housing <b>14</b>. The embodiments according to FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>23</b> show only a single guide wall <b>60</b> each, whereas the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> additionally have another guide wall <b>61</b>. The respective guide wall <b>60</b>, <b>61</b> forms within the mixing chamber <b>15</b> a mixing section <b>62</b>, which is indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-23</figref>. However, simple embodiments which make do without a guide wall <b>60</b>, <b>61</b> are conceivable as well.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, an intermediate wall <b>63</b>, which can be better recognized in the corresponding side views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, respectively, is arranged in the mixing housing <b>14</b> in the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. The respective intermediate wall <b>63</b> separates two planes within the chamber <b>15</b>. The mixing section <b>62</b> extends through both planes. A section of the mixing section <b>62</b>, which extends in the plane facing away from the viewer, is indicated for illustration by arrows drawn in broken line, while a section of the mixing section <b>62</b>, which is located in the plane facing the viewer, is indicated by arrows drawn in solid line.
