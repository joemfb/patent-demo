<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wagering game machines, such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally, the popularity of such machines depends on the likelihood (or perceived likelihood) of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing wagering game machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same (or believed to be the same), players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines, features, and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore, there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">This description of the embodiments is divided into five sections. The first section provides an introduction to embodiments. The second section describes example operating environments while the third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments. The fourth section describes additional example operating environments while the fifth section presents some general comments.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This section provides an introduction to some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Many computerized wagering game systems have a variety of sound and graphical elements designed to attract and keep a game player's attention, such as sound effects, music, and animation. These game presentation features often include a variety of music, sound effects, and voices presented to complement a visual (e.g., video, computer animated, mechanical, etc.) presentation of the wagering game on a display (e.g., a monitor screen, a computer desktop, a computerized display background, etc.). Often, multiple gaming applications run on a wagering game machine. The multiple gaming applications can compete for sound resources, fighting for the foreground. For example, a main, or primary game application (&#x201c;primary game&#x201d;) can be running on a wagering game machine. At the same time a secondary game application (&#x201c;secondary game&#x201d;) can also be presented on the wagering game machine. The secondary game may present content (&#x201c;secondary content&#x201d;) in a graphical interface (e.g., a graphical user interface, a window, a utility panel, a widget, a button panel, a game panel, a flash animation object, a visual object, a toolbar, etc.) that may be off-centered on the wagering game machine display (e.g., docked to one side of a display, offset to the left-hand side of the screen, etc.). The primary game may also present content, which may or may not be centered on the screen. Thus, the primary game and secondary game may present content that appears with different visual characteristics (e.g. different locations) on the wagering game machine's display, thus enhancing a player's experience by presenting multiple content at the same time in interesting visual configurations. The sound from each game application, however, may not be as interesting. Quite often sound is one of the least developed portions of a wagering game, though it can provide as equally powerful an impact on the player as visual characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some embodiments of the present subject matter, however, describe examples of controlling sound distribution in wagering game applications based on visual characteristics of content and content containers. Some embodiments of controlling sound distribution in wagering games may include examples of gaming applications in a casino network, using wagering game machines. Other embodiments may include examples of network wagering venues (e.g., an online casino, a wagering game website, a wagering network, etc.). Embodiments can be presented over any type of communications network (e.g., public or private) that provides access to wagering games such as a website (e.g., via wide-area-networks, or WANs), a private gaming network (e.g., local-area-networks, or LANs), a file sharing networks, a social network, etc., or any combination of networks. Multiple users can be connected to the networks via computing devices. The multiple users can have accounts that subscribe to specific services, such as account-based wagering systems (e.g., account-based wagering game websites, account-based casino networks, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments herein a user may be referred to as a player (i.e., of wagering games), and a player may be referred to interchangeably as a player account. Account-based wagering systems utilize player accounts when transacting and performing activities, at the computer level, that are initiated by players. Therefore, a &#x201c;player account&#x201d; represents the player at a computerized level. The player account can perform actions via computerized instructions. For example, in some embodiments, a player account may be referred to as performing an action, controlling an item, communicating information, etc. Although a player, or person, may be activating a game control or device to perform the action, control the item, communicate the information, etc., the player account, at the computer level, can be associated with the player, and therefore any actions associated with the player can also be associated with the player account. Therefore, for brevity, to avoid having to describe the interconnection between player and player account in every instance, a &#x201c;player account&#x201d; may be referred to herein in either context. Further, in some embodiments herein, the word &#x201c;gaming&#x201d; is used interchangeably with &#x201c;gambling.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As mentioned previously, some embodiments include examples of controlling sound distribution in wagering game applications based on visual characteristics of content and content containers. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of controlling sound distribution based on a visible location of a graphical interface for the content, such as a window, or other similar container-type object, that confines the content to a physical location on an overall display area.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram that illustrates an example of controlling audio panning for wagering game applications based on window location, according to some embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) <b>100</b> includes a wagering game machine <b>160</b> connected to a wagering game server <b>150</b> via a communications network <b>122</b>. The wagering game server <b>150</b> can provide main wagering game content (&#x201c;primary content&#x201d;) <b>107</b>, such as reels <b>108</b>. Also connected to the communications network <b>122</b> is a secondary content server <b>180</b>. The secondary content server <b>180</b> can provide additional content (&#x201c;secondary content&#x201d;) <b>105</b>, including both wagering and non-wagering content, such as secondary wagering games, advertisements, account information, etc. The system <b>100</b> can control (e.g., restrict, limit, focus, etc.) an aural presence (e.g., audio fields <b>111</b>, <b>117</b>) for the secondary content <b>105</b> within an area around the wagering game machine <b>160</b> that represents the geometry of a graphical interface window (&#x201c;window&#x201d;) <b>106</b> that contains the secondary content <b>105</b>. For instance, the system <b>100</b> focuses the audio fields <b>111</b>, <b>117</b> in a way that approximates, or represents, a location of one or more boundaries (e.g., right-side boundary <b>109</b>) of the window <b>106</b> in relation to a shape, size, boundary, position, dimension, or other visual characteristics of a display <b>101</b>. For instance, the system <b>100</b> can determine a display width <b>130</b> for the display <b>101</b>, and can set or control a panning limit <b>132</b> for the audio fields <b>111</b>, <b>117</b>. The system <b>100</b> can utilize the panning limit <b>132</b> to determine an audio-field focus setting (&#x201c;focus setting&#x201d;) <b>134</b>, which the system <b>100</b> can utilize to determine a volume scale <b>136</b>. The system <b>100</b> can utilize the volume scale <b>136</b> to control sound intensity for the secondary content <b>105</b> at multiple sound production devices (e.g., left speaker <b>113</b> and right speaker <b>115</b>). The sound intensity at the left speaker <b>113</b> and the right speaker <b>115</b>, control the audio fields around the wagering game machine <b>160</b>, which produces a sound for the secondary content <b>105</b> that seems to come more from the left speaker <b>113</b> than from the right speaker <b>115</b>. The system <b>100</b> produces an unbalanced sound so that the amount of sound that comes from the left speaker <b>113</b>, for the secondary content <b>105</b>, feels more to the left because the window <b>106</b> is more to the left-hand side of the display <b>101</b>. For example, if the right-side boundary <b>109</b> is approximately at 30% of the display width <b>130</b>, then the system <b>100</b> sets the panning limit <b>132</b> so that an overall audio field (e.g., the combination of audio fields <b>111</b>, <b>117</b>) will appear to be mostly to the left-hand side of the wagering game machine <b>160</b> (e.g., sound volume of sound effect <b>119</b> is set at a minimum of 70% on the left speaker <b>113</b>, sound volume of sound effect <b>119</b> set at a maximum of 30% on the right speaker <b>115</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> describes some embodiments, the following sections describe many other features and embodiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example Operating Environments</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">This section describes example operating environments and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments. More specifically, this section includes discussion about wagering game system architectures.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Wagering Game System Architecture</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a conceptual diagram that illustrates an example of a wagering game system architecture <b>200</b>, according to some embodiments. The wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can include an account server <b>270</b> configured to control user related accounts accessible via wagering game networks and social networks. The account server <b>270</b> can store wagering game player account information, such as account settings, preferences, player profile data, and other information for a player. The account server <b>270</b> can store and track player information, such as identifying information (e.g., avatars, screen name, account identification numbers, etc.) or other information like financial account information, social contact information, etc. The account server <b>270</b> can contain accounts for social contacts referenced by the player account. The account server <b>270</b> can also provide auditing capabilities, according to regulatory rules, and track the performance of players, machines, and servers.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can also include a wagering game server <b>250</b> configured to control wagering game content, provide random numbers, and communicate wagering game information, account information, and other information to and from a wagering game machine <b>260</b>. The wagering game server <b>250</b> can include a content controller <b>251</b> configured to manage and control content for the presentation of content on the wagering game machine <b>260</b>. For example, the content controller <b>251</b> can generate game results (e.g., win/loss values), including win amounts, for games played on the wagering game machine <b>260</b>. The content controller <b>251</b> can communicate the game results to the wagering game machine <b>260</b>. The content controller <b>251</b> can also generate random numbers and provide them to the wagering game machine <b>260</b> so that the wagering game machine <b>260</b> can generate game results. The wagering game server <b>250</b> can also include a content store <b>252</b> configured to contain content to present on the wagering game machine <b>260</b>. The wagering game server <b>250</b> can also include an account manager <b>253</b> configured to control information related to player accounts. For example, the account manager <b>253</b> can communicate wager amounts, game results amounts (e.g., win amounts), bonus game amounts, etc., to the account server <b>270</b>. The wagering game server <b>250</b> can also include a communication unit <b>254</b> configured to communicate information to the wagering game machine <b>260</b> and to communicate with other systems, devices and networks. In some embodiments, the wagering game server <b>250</b> may be referred to as a primary content server or primary wagering game server.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can also include the wagering game machine <b>260</b> configured to present wagering games and receive and transmit information to control sound distribution in wagering games. The wagering game machine <b>260</b> can include a content controller <b>261</b> configured to manage and control content and presentation of content on the wagering game machine <b>260</b>. The wagering game machine <b>260</b> can also include a content store <b>262</b> configured to contain content to present on the wagering game machine <b>260</b>. The wagering game machine <b>260</b> can also include a display device controller <b>263</b> configured to present content on a display device associated with the wagering game machine <b>260</b>. The display device controller <b>263</b> can also determine display dimensions for a display device, such as a computer monitor, a wagering game machine display screen, etc. The wagering game machine <b>260</b> can also include a graphical interface locator <b>264</b> configured to determine a visible characteristic, such as a location of a graphical interface, which presents wagering game content. The wagering game machine <b>260</b> can also include an audio control module <b>265</b> configured to modify sound distribution (e.g., panning of sound, sound volume, sound balance) between multiple sound production devices based on the graphical interface's visible characteristic (e.g., the location of the graphical interface) in relation to visible characteristics (e.g., display dimensions, a screen size, a desktop resolution, etc.) for a display device that presents the graphical interface. The audio control module <b>265</b> can also dynamically determine changes to a graphical interface's location, and other factors (e.g., content movement, player movement, client configuration changes, etc.), and dynamically adjust the sound distribution. The wagering game machine <b>260</b> can also include a sound production device controller <b>266</b> configured to control sound at multiple sound-production devices (e.g., speakers).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can also include a secondary content server <b>280</b> configured to provide content and control information for secondary games and other secondary content available on a wagering game network (e.g., secondary wagering game content, promotions content, advertising content, player tracking content, web content, etc.). The secondary content server <b>280</b> can provide &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; content, or content for &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; games presented on the wagering game machine <b>260</b>. &#x201c;Secondary&#x201d; in some embodiments can refer to an application's importance or priority of the data. In some embodiments, &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; can refer to a distinction, or separation, from a primary application (e.g., separate application files, separate content, separate states, separate functions, separate processes, separate programming sources, separate processor threads, separate data, separate control, separate domains, etc.). Nevertheless, in some embodiments, secondary content and control can be passed between applications (e.g., via application protocol interface), thus becoming, or falling under the control of, primary content or primary applications, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each component shown in the wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via a communications network <b>222</b>. However, some functions performed by one component could be performed by other components. For example, the wagering game server <b>250</b> can also be configured to perform functions of the display device controller <b>263</b>, the graphical interface locator <b>264</b>, the audio control module <b>265</b>, the sound production device controller <b>266</b>, and other network elements and/or system devices. Furthermore, the components shown may all be contained in one device, but some, or all, may be included in, or performed by multiple devices, as in the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or other configurations not shown. For example, the account manager <b>253</b> and the communication unit <b>254</b> can be included in the wagering game machine <b>260</b> instead of, or in addition to, being a part of the wagering game server <b>250</b>. Further, in some embodiments, the wagering game machine <b>260</b> can determine wagering game outcomes, generate random numbers, etc. instead of, or in addition to, the wagering game server <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The wagering game machine <b>260</b> can take the form of floor standing models, handheld mobile units, bar-top models, workstation-type console models, surface computing machines, etc. Further, wagering game machines can be primarily dedicated for use in conducting wagering games, or can include non-dedicated devices, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, personal computers, etc. The wagering game machine <b>260</b> can be associated with (e.g., include, be accessible to, be connected to, configured to communicate with, etc.) a computer system, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cell phone, a laptop, or any other device or machine that is capable of processing information, instructions, or other data provided via the communications network <b>222</b>. In some embodiments, the wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can include a personal computer <b>237</b> in addition to and/or in place of, the wagering game machine <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, wagering game machine and wagering game servers work together such that the wagering game machine can be operated as a thin, thick, or intermediate client. For example, one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the wagering game machine or the wagering game servers (server). Game play elements can include executable game code, lookup tables, configuration files, game outcome, audio or visual representations of the game, game assets or the like. In a thin-client example, the wagering game server can perform functions such as determining game outcome or managing assets, while the clients can present a graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the user (e.g., player). In a thick-client example, the clients can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the wagering game server for recording or managing a player's account.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, either the client or the server can provide functionality that is not directly related to game play. For example, account transactions and account rules may be managed centrally (e.g., by the server) or locally (e.g., by the client). Other functionality not directly related to game play may include power management, presentation of advertising, software or firmware updates, system quality or security checks, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, the wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can be implemented as software, hardware, any combination thereof, or other forms of embodiments not listed. For example, any of the network components (e.g., the wagering game machines, servers, etc.) can include hardware and machine-readable storage media including instructions for performing the operations described herein. Machine-readable storage media includes any mechanism that stores information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a wagering game machine, computer, etc.). For example, machine-readable storage media includes read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media, flash memory machines, etc. Some embodiments of the invention can also include machine-readable signal media, such as any media suitable for transmitting software over a network.</p>

<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram (&#x201c;flow&#x201d;) <b>300</b> illustrating distributing multi-source sound for gaming applications, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> are conceptual diagrams that help illustrate the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to some embodiments. This description will present <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in concert with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the flow <b>300</b> begins at processing block <b>302</b>, where a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) determines wagering game content presented in a computerized graphical interface (&#x201c;graphical interface&#x201d;) on a wagering game machine display. The display may be part of an electronic display device, such as a video monitor, a flat-panel display, an LED screen, etc. The display device may be built into the wagering game machine or may be a peripheral device associated with the wagering game machine, such as a video monitor connected to a docking station. The system can present the display using software stored on the wagering game machine that presents visual images and controls the positions of the images. For instance, the wagering game machine may be configured with an operating system that tracks the positions and sizes of application graphical interfaces, such as panels, windows, frames, forms, etc. The graphical interfaces have structural characteristics, geometric properties, reference points, and/or other data, which define the graphical interface's spatial relationships to each other and other system objects, including to structural characteristics, geometric properties, reference points, etc., of the display. The structural characteristics, geometric properties, reference points, and other data may include information that the system can use to present a boundary, a mid-point, a corner, an anchor, a border, a handle, a coordinate point, a grid, a layer, a scroll-bar, a control, or other parts of a graphical interface on the display. In one embodiment, the system can determine graphical interface boundaries that constitute a graphical interface area. The system can also determine display boundaries that constitute a display area. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the graphical interface window (&#x201c;window&#x201d;) <b>106</b> includes a border that confines the secondary content <b>105</b> to the window <b>106</b>. The border has four sides, or boundaries including, two vertical boundaries (i.e., a top-side boundary and bottom-side boundary) and two horizontal boundaries (i.e., a left-side boundary and the right-side boundary <b>109</b>). Each of the four boundaries can be defined by a coordinate line on the display <b>101</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another example of a window <b>406</b> on a display <b>401</b> of a wagering game machine <b>460</b>. The display <b>401</b> is associated with a coordinate grid. Specifically, the coordinate grid includes coordinates for individual points (e.g., pixels) on the display <b>401</b>. The wagering game machine <b>460</b> can utilize any type of coordinate tracking or graphing systems, but, for exemplary purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a Cartesian coordinate system with tangential X and Y coordinate reference axes (i.e., x-axis <b>425</b> and y-axis <b>426</b>) that intersect at a common center point. The y-axis <b>426</b> represents a central coordinate divider for a width of the display <b>401</b>. The x-axis <b>425</b> represents a central coordinate divider for the height of the display <b>401</b>. It should be noted that while some embodiments refer to &#x201c;central&#x201d; coordinate dividers and &#x201c;central&#x201d; points of reference for a display boundary, other embodiments can utilize other reference elements of a display boundary, such as a corner point, a border origin line, etc. The wagering game machine <b>460</b> can also have multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b>. The multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> can produce a multi-source sound for sound producing content (&#x201c;content&#x201d;) <b>405</b> within the window <b>406</b>. The wagering game machine <b>460</b> can balance the sound between the multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> in a way that correlates with the dimensions of the display <b>401</b>. For instance, speaker <b>410</b> can produce an audio field <b>411</b> predominantly representative of the coordinates for the upper left-hand region, or quadrant, of the display <b>401</b> (i.e., &#x2212;X and +Y coordinates). Likewise, speaker <b>412</b> can produce a audio field <b>413</b> predominantly representative of the coordinates for the upper right-hand quadrant of the display <b>401</b> (i.e., +X and +Y coordinates), speaker <b>414</b> can produce a audio field <b>415</b> predominantly representative of the coordinates in the lower left-hand quadrant of the display <b>401</b> (i.e., &#x2212;X and &#x2212;Y coordinates), and speaker <b>416</b> can produce a audio field <b>417</b> predominantly representative of the coordinates in the lower right-hand quadrant of the display <b>401</b> (i.e., +X and &#x2212;Y coordinates). In some embodiments, the wagering game machine <b>460</b> may have a hardware configuration that presents content in a three-dimensional gaming environment (e.g., peripheral display devices that wrap around a player, surround sound speakers in front of and behind a player, etc.). The wagering game machine <b>460</b> may, in such embodiments, utilize a third axis (e.g., a depth coordinate axis, or z-axis) to represent visual and sound effect depth. The window <b>406</b> has four corners <b>430</b>, <b>431</b>, <b>432</b>, and <b>433</b> and four boundaries <b>440</b>, <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, and <b>443</b> that make up a window area. The window area covers only a portion of the display area and can be in a non-centered position on the display <b>401</b>. The four boundaries <b>440</b>, <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>443</b> confine the content <b>405</b> to the window area. The content <b>405</b> can include game objects, advertisement animations, videos, wagering game objects, game assets, advertising objects, wagering game related activity, secondary game activity, advertising activity, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>304</b>, where the system determines audio production devices associated with the wagering game machine that present sound content from the wagering game content. The audio production devices are positioned in relation to the display to produce a multi-source and/or multi-directional sound from the audio production devices for the sound producing content. The audio production devices can be speakers, woofers, sound reflection devices, musical instruments, or any other sound generation, reflection, or transmission devices. The multi-source and/or multi-directional sound streams from the audio production devices according to sound commands associated with the sound content and/or sound settings associated with the wagering game machine (e.g., sound system settings). The system uses the sound commands to present differences in sound distribution factors, such as sound properties and sound reproduction characteristics from the audio production devices. Sound distribution factors can include balance, pan, movement, delay, timing, frequency, directionality, reverberation, volume, equalization, flanging, dynamics, dynamic range, panoramic position, fading, roll-off, etc. For example, in some embodiments, the system can adjust audio &#x201c;pan&#x201d; or &#x201c;panning&#x201d; Audio pan may include the spreading of a monaural signal in a stereo or multi-channel audio field. Audio pan control can include modifying volume levels, adding reverberations, adjusting sound timing, etc. to create the impression that a source is moving around a soundstage (e.g., from one side of a wagering game machine to another). Soundstages can be designed for an application and the application can produce sound commands for its own sound space to generate the multi-source sound. The sound commands are preconfigured with sound production configurations that distribute the multi-source sound between the plurality of audio production devices in relation to a position of an active sound producing content (e.g., sound producing wagering game objects) within the graphical interface area.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>306</b>, where the system determines a position of the graphical interface on the wagering game machine display. The system can compare a structural or geometric characteristic of a graphical interface, such as a window boundary, to a structural or geometric characteristic of the display, such as a boundary of the display. The system can determine a spatial relationship value that defines a comparative position between the graphical interface characteristic and the display device characteristics. The system can use coordinates as spatial relationship values. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the system <b>100</b> can utilize coordinates values for the right-side boundary <b>109</b> to determine a relative position of the window <b>106</b> to the boundaries of the display <b>101</b>. In some embodiments, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the wagering game machine <b>460</b> can use coordinate values associated with all of the four boundaries <b>440</b>, <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, and <b>443</b> to determine the relative position of the window <b>406</b> to the boundaries of the display <b>401</b>. In some embodiments, the area of the window <b>406</b> is less than the size of the display <b>401</b> so that the four boundaries <b>440</b>, <b>441</b>, <b>442</b> and <b>443</b> can be positioned in different positions relative to the display (e.g., can move around the space provided by the display <b>401</b>, can be offset to appear or reside in different regions of the display <b>401</b>, can be docked or anchored to characteristics within the area of the display <b>401</b>, etc.). The wagering game machine <b>460</b> can obtain coordinate values, and/or other geometry and visual field information, from an application that runs within the window <b>406</b>, from a wagering game machine operating system, or from other applications or services. The four boundaries <b>440</b>, <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>443</b> each have coordinate values with a fixed value in relation to at least one of the boundaries for the display <b>401</b>. For example, a right-side boundary <b>442</b> has a fixed value (e.g., X<b>1</b> coordinate value) on the x-axis <b>425</b>. The X<b>1</b> coordinate value, when followed in a direct line downward, tangentially intersects a bottom display boundary <b>470</b> at a point that correlates with the same X<b>1</b> coordinate value on the bottom display boundary <b>470</b>. The bottom display boundary <b>470</b> has a distance along a dimensional width of the display <b>401</b>. The wagering game machine <b>460</b> compares the x-coordinate value to a width scale <b>481</b> that represents the width of the display <b>401</b> divided into 100 scale units. The y-axis <b>426</b> represents a center point on the width scale <b>481</b>. The wagering game machine <b>460</b> determines that the X<b>1</b> value is approximately eight scale units (of the width scale <b>481</b>) to the right of the y-axis <b>426</b>. The wagering game machine <b>460</b> can also determine that a left-side boundary <b>440</b> has a fixed value (e.g., &#x2212;X<b>1</b>, wherein the minus value represents a position in the negative domain of the x,y coordinate scale, or, in other words, a value to the left of the central y-axis <b>426</b>). The &#x2212;X<b>1</b> value also correlates with a same &#x2212;X<b>1</b> value on the bottom display boundary <b>470</b>, which is approximately 33 scale units (of the width scale <b>481</b>) to the left of the y-axis <b>426</b>. Using this information, the wagering game machine <b>460</b> can determine the exact positions of the left-side boundary <b>440</b> and the right-side boundary <b>442</b> of the window <b>406</b> relative to the bottom display boundary <b>470</b>. The wagering game machine <b>460</b> can also determine Y coordinate values (e.g., Y<b>1</b>, &#x2212;Y<b>1</b>) of a top boundary <b>441</b> and a bottom boundary <b>443</b> in relation to coordinate values on a right-side display boundary <b>471</b>. The wagering game machine <b>460</b> can compare the Y coordinate values to a height scale <b>482</b> (e.g., also scaled to 100 scale units, though not necessarily equivalent in value to the scale units for the width scale <b>481</b> to adjust for differences in width and height of the display <b>401</b>). The wagering game machine <b>460</b> determines the exact positions of the top boundary <b>441</b> and the bottom boundary <b>443</b> of the window <b>406</b> relative to the right-side display boundary <b>471</b>. The wagering game machine <b>460</b> can use the scaled values to determine the width and height of the window <b>406</b> relative to width and height of the display <b>401</b>. Thus, the wagering game machine <b>460</b> can determine the size and position of the window <b>406</b> relative to the size and position of the display <b>401</b>, using height and width measurements and/or coordinate values. In other embodiments, the wagering game machine <b>460</b> can use other structural characteristics or reference points of the window <b>406</b>, other than or in addition to the coordinates of the four boundaries <b>440</b>, <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, such as the coordinates of the four corners <b>430</b>, <b>431</b>, <b>432</b>, and <b>433</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref> illustrate other embodiments that use one boundary to determine relative positions instead of four boundaries. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the window <b>106</b> is docked to the left side of the display <b>101</b>, which represents a far-left boundary value of the display <b>101</b>, which the system <b>100</b> knows. The system <b>100</b> can use the coordinate value for the right-side boundary <b>109</b> to determine the relative size and/or position of the window <b>106</b> to the size and/or position of the display <b>101</b> in one dimension, a horizontal dimension. The system <b>100</b> only needs to determine relative positions in one dimension because the orientation of the audio production devices (e.g., left speaker <b>113</b> and right speaker <b>115</b>) only presents one dimension of sound (i.e., left to right). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) <b>500</b> determines the position of the window <b>406</b> in relation to one dimension (i.e., a width dimension) of a display border <b>501</b> based on the docked position of window <b>506</b>. For example, the window <b>506</b>, at stage &#x201c;1&#x201d; is docked to a right-side boundary <b>503</b> of the display border <b>501</b>. Consequently, the system <b>500</b> utilizes a left-side boundary <b>507</b> of the window <b>506</b> to determine the size and position of the window <b>506</b>. Further, because the system <b>500</b> only has two speakers oriented to represent right and left side sound from a wagering game machine, the system <b>500</b> only needs to determine width coordinate values in relation to a display dimension. Processing block <b>308</b> below includes further discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The flow <b>300</b> continues at the processing block <b>308</b>, where the system controls distribution of the sound content on the audio production devices based on the position of the graphical interface on the display. For example, the system can modify distribution of multi-source, multi-directional sound between a plurality of audio production devices based on a position of the graphical interface area in relation to the display area. In some embodiments, the system can use a determined position of a window's boundaries to find a correlated sound modification setting, or parameter, that the system can use to modify the sound and/or set limitations on the sound from the sound content. The system can provide control instructions to control audio fields (e.g., audio loads) on the plurality of audio production devices positioned in relation to a dimension for the display area. The system can use the control instructions to modify sound distribution between the plurality of audio production devices to represent the relative position of the graphical interface to the display dimensions. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a sound distribution module <b>487</b> within the wagering game machine <b>460</b> can use the coordinate values of the window <b>406</b> to control sound fields <b>411</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>415</b>, <b>417</b>. The sound distribution module <b>487</b> can generate scale values or factors (e.g., a) <b>438</b> to distribute sound between the multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> in a way that correlates with the position of the four boundaries <b>440</b>, <b>441</b>, <b>442</b>, <b>443</b>, the four corners <b>430</b>, <b>431</b>, <b>432</b>, <b>433</b>, or any other feature of the window <b>406</b> that defines its spatial relationship to the display <b>401</b>. The sound distribution module <b>487</b> can generate an overall audio field (e.g., combination of individual audio fields <b>411</b>, <b>413</b>, <b>415</b>, and <b>417</b>) that causes the sound from the content <b>405</b> to appear distributed between the multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> in a way that correlates with the position of the window <b>406</b> relative to the display <b>401</b>, so that more sound volume appears to come from some speakers more than others. For instance, the sound distribution module <b>487</b> can generate the factors <b>438</b> as direct correlates with the scaled coordinate values of the boundary lines X<b>1</b>, &#x2212;X<b>1</b>, Y<b>1</b>, and &#x2212;Y<b>1</b> according to the width scale <b>481</b> and the height scale <b>482</b>. The sound distribution module <b>487</b> can attenuate sounds, increase sounds, pan sounds, modify sound directionality, etc., for the content <b>405</b> based on the factors <b>438</b> to control the sounds in a number of aural field dimensions based on the positioning of the multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> (e.g., overall audio fields in horizontal and vertical dimensions). The sound distribution module <b>487</b> can control audio loads on the multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> by interfacing with speaker controllers and/or other software and hardware that controls sound for the wagering game machine <b>460</b>. The sound distribution module <b>487</b> can also adjust settings, configurations, and/or other sound parameters that are stored on or accessible to the wagering game machine <b>460</b>. The sound distribution module <b>487</b> distributes more sound to, or makes more sound appear to come from, the speaker <b>410</b> because the position of the window <b>406</b> is offset to have more of its area in the upper left-hand quadrant of the display <b>401</b>. The amount of sound distribution can be directly related to the amount of window area offset into a quadrant compared to an amount of offset in an opposing quadrant. The sound distribution module <b>487</b> contemporaneously reduces, or ducks, sound in the other speakers <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> to a degree commensurate with an amount of window area that is offset in the other quadrants. For instance, if the window <b>406</b> were centered on the display <b>401</b>, the sound distribution module <b>487</b> would permit the content <b>405</b> to play its playlist without limitations and/or without application of the factors <b>438</b> to modify the distribution of sound. Thus, if the window <b>406</b> were centered, the sound distribution module <b>487</b> would not modify the sound effects produced by the playlist sound commands and could cause an equal amount of sound for the content <b>405</b> from each of the multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b>. However, as the window <b>406</b> moves, or is positioned, into other quadrants of the display <b>401</b>, the sound distribution module <b>487</b> modifies sound distribution according to the factors <b>438</b>, so that the sound distribution represents the location of the window <b>406</b> within the display <b>401</b>. For instance, the sound distribution module <b>487</b>, can produce more sound from some speakers than other speakers that correlates with an off-set position of the window <b>406</b> in relation to a central reference point (e.g., the cross section of the x-axis <b>425</b> and the y-axis <b>426</b>) for the display <b>401</b>. The multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> are positioned relative to the display <b>401</b> to produce a multi-directional sound for the content <b>405</b> relative to regions for the display <b>401</b> (e.g., the multiple speakers <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> produce sounds for the closest quadrants of the display <b>401</b>). The sound distribution module <b>487</b> can pan the multi-directional sound so that more sound comes from a direction (i.e., from a speaker) associated with a given region (e.g., a graphical quadrant) in which the window <b>406</b> is positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a similar example of distributing sound between speakers <b>513</b> and <b>515</b> based on the position of the window <b>506</b>. Additionally, the system <b>500</b> distributes sound from the speakers <b>513</b>, <b>515</b> based on the position of objects within the window <b>506</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of setting a panning limit on a horizontal (e.g., width) content volume scale <b>532</b>. The window <b>506</b> at stage &#x201c;1&#x201d; is docked against the right-side boundary <b>503</b> and constitutes approximately 30% of the width of a display associated with the display border <b>501</b>. The system <b>500</b> sets a panning limit maximum of 30% for left-pan based on the positioning of the left-side boundary <b>507</b>. The system <b>500</b> can scale the sound volume for content in the window <b>506</b> to match the panning limit. The system <b>500</b> can adjust sound distribution based on the position of a sound producing object (e.g., fish <b>510</b>) in addition to the panning limit. For instance, at stage &#x201c;1&#x201d; the position of the fish <b>510</b> corresponds to a horizontal coordinate value <b>520</b>. The system <b>500</b> can use the horizontal coordinate value <b>520</b> to adjust sound distribution based on the relative position of the fish <b>510</b> compared to the left-side boundary <b>507</b> while also enforcing the panning limit based on the position of the left-side boundary <b>507</b> to the display border <b>501</b>. As a result, the system <b>500</b> can adjust the panning of the sound between the speakers <b>513</b> and <b>515</b> according to the horizontal content volume scale <b>532</b>. The system <b>500</b> adjusts the volume for the fish <b>510</b> at a right speaker <b>515</b> to have an appropriate volume setting based on the position of the fish <b>510</b> within the panning limits (e.g., the volume for the fish <b>510</b> is set to a 76 volume setting out of 100). At the same time, the system <b>500</b> adjusts the volume for the fish <b>510</b> at a left speaker <b>513</b> to a volume setting of 24 out of 100.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the system can distribute sound in many ways in addition to those already mentioned, including, but not limited to the following:

        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0042">The system can use head tracking to locate where a player is situated for three-dimensional audio.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0043">The system can utilize audio object location processing to modify sounds to appear to come from a specific location of a window in relation to a display. Audio object location processing can include utilizing a head related transfer function, as described in the United States Patent Application, Publication No. US20080070685, incorporated herein by reference. For example, a head related transfer function, or HTRF, is derived from the way a listener's head, ear, and torso affect the sound that is eventually heard. These head, ear, and torso effects are largely responsible for the listener's ability to determine the direction from which a sound is coming, and can be characterized and applied to sounds to make them sound as though they are coming from directions other than their true source. The head-related transfer function is determined such as by use of preexisting models, or by measuring a dummy head designed to mimic the acoustic behavior of a human head. This function is then applied to a sound signal by use of filters such as digital signal processing filters that shape the frequency response of the sound signal before the signal is routed to a speaker and converted to an acoustic or audible sound signal. The game player then hears a filtered version of the sound having frequency response filtering applied such that the sound appears to come from a location specific to the applied filtering process.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0044">The system can delay the transmission time between left and right speakers to distribute sound. Sound delay can produce a similar effect as volume reduction as it causes an effect of distance of an origin of sound. Therefore, even though sound from speakers may be equal, or only slightly different, in intensity, the directionality can produce an effect to a player that sound appears to come from one direction more than from another.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0045">The system can provide cross-talk cancellation to eliminate cross talk between left and right speakers.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0046">The system can use filtering.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0047">The system can reflect sounds off objects in a room.</li>

<p id="p-0043" num="0048">The flow <b>300</b> continues at processing block <b>310</b>, where the system dynamically adjusts the distribution of the sound content on the audio production devices based on a change in the position of the graphical interface. For instance, the system dynamically adjusts the distribution of a multi-source or multi-directional sound between a plurality of audio production devices based on a change in the position of a window's reference point in relation to a display's reference point (e.g., a change in the window's vertical boundary coordinate position in relation to the display's horizontal central point). The window can move (e.g., system directed movement, manual movement by end-user, operating-system directed movements, display resolution scale change, etc.) and the system can dynamically determine updated boundaries (e.g., updated coordinates) for the window, and automatically update sound distribution settings and/or effects such as panning limitations, volume scaling, etc. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the window <b>506</b> may move, or be moved, from the right-side boundary <b>503</b> of the display border <b>501</b>, at stage &#x201c;1,&#x201d; to a left-side boundary <b>505</b> of the display border <b>501</b> at stage &#x201c;2.&#x201d; In some embodiments, the move may be accompanied by a wagering game function related to the priority of gaming data. For example, the system <b>500</b> may be programmed, or may read user preferences that indicate, to move windows from the right side of a wagering game machine display screen to the left side of the wagering game machine display based on the value of a secondary game. At stage &#x201c;1,&#x201d; game content within the window <b>506</b> provides a game with a certain expected payout value. However, in time the expected payout values, or other value related factors, may change, such as an amount of time left to participate in a game, a number of players involved in a game, a number of social contacts participating in a game, an availability of a preferred type of game, etc. In some embodiments, the system <b>500</b> can determine player preferences for positions of windows. For example, a player account may include settings that indicate that games that meet certain requirements, such as possessing certain characteristics (e.g., certain game types, certain themes, etc.) or experiencing certain conditions (e.g., changes n perceived values, changes in potential award values, etc.) should be positioned on preferred locations of the a display (e.g., secondary game windows whose games are of a certain genre or type should be docked on the left side of a display screen, long-term games that increase in value during a gaming session should be automatically moved and docked on the top side of the display screen, etc.). The system <b>500</b>, for instance, recognizes that the secondary game within the window <b>506</b> increases a potential pot amount, or other reward value. Consequently, in stage &#x201c;2,&#x201d; the system <b>500</b> moves the window <b>506</b> to the left side of the display and docks the window <b>506</b> to the left-side boundary <b>505</b>, as a visual indication of the game's perceived value to the player. When the system <b>500</b> moves the window <b>506</b>, the system <b>500</b> also dynamically adjusts the sound distribution based on the movement. For instance, the system <b>500</b> utilizes a right-side boundary <b>509</b> of the window <b>506</b> to determine the relative position of the window <b>506</b> to the display border <b>501</b>. If the size of the window <b>506</b> remains the same, then the system can invert the previous panning limits and scaling factors for the left side of the display. If the window size changes, however, the system <b>500</b> can re-determine the relative position of the window <b>506</b> using the location of the right-side boundary <b>509</b>. The system <b>500</b> can also determine whether objects have moved within the window <b>506</b> and further adjust panning limits, volume scales, or other sound distribution effects. In stage &#x201c;2,&#x201d; for instance, the fish <b>510</b> moved to the right side of the window <b>506</b> and a predator <b>511</b> enters the window <b>506</b> on the left-hand side of the window <b>506</b>. The system <b>500</b> recognizes the positions of the fish <b>510</b> and the predator <b>511</b>, scales the content volume for the individual objects based on the panning limits, and adjusts sounds for each object at the speakers <b>513</b> and <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the system can also dynamically adjust multi-source sound based on many other factors including changes to machine configurations, movements of a player in relation to a display, movements of the player in relation to audio production devices, changes to sizes of the display, changes of position of graphical interfaces in peripheral display devices, additions of multiple graphical interfaces, changes in shape or sizes of the graphical interface, etc. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a wagering game system <b>600</b> includes a sound control server <b>640</b> and a client <b>660</b> that can detect changes to positions of gaming windows on a display <b>601</b>, differences in positions of speakers <b>611</b> and <b>613</b>, player activity, etc. For instance, the client <b>660</b> may be a personal computer that receives wagering game web content from a web server <b>680</b>. The web server <b>680</b> is connected to the client <b>660</b> and wagering game server <b>650</b> via a communications network <b>622</b>. The display <b>601</b> can include a primary game graphical user interface <b>610</b>, a secondary game graphical user interface <b>612</b>, a button panel <b>615</b>, and other graphical interfaces, controls, or other items presented on the display <b>601</b>. The system <b>600</b> can detect when a player account accesses an account server <b>670</b> using the client <b>660</b>. The sound control server <b>640</b> can automatically determine configurations about the client <b>660</b>, including the type of the speakers <b>611</b>, <b>613</b>, their position, their capabilities, etc., and automatically adjust sound distribution based on that information. In some embodiments, the system <b>600</b> can also determine other speakers and audio production devices that may be connected to a network (e.g., light show hardware, overhead speakers, intercom systems, etc.), that may produce sound from network content. The system <b>600</b> can present the network content on network displays that run throughout a casino, or other establishment. The system <b>600</b> can control sound distribution from the network speakers based on network content position across one or more of the network displays.</p>
