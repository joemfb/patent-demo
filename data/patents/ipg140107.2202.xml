<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to a human recombinant monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) to inhibit adhesion between leukocytes and activated endothelial cells and transmigration of leukocytes through the activated endothelial cells, and a prophylactic and therapeutic composition for inflammatory disease or cancer comprising the same. The human recombinant monoclonal antibody according to the present invention shows a strong affinity to VCAM-1 expressed on human endothelial cell, and effectively inhibits VCAM-1-mediated adhesion between leukocytes and activated endothelial cells and transmigration of leukocytes through the activated endothelial cells, thereby being used for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory disease such as asthma and arthritis, transplant rejection, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a human recombinant monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) to inhibit adhesion between leukocytes and activated endothelial cells and transmigration of leukocytes through the activated endothelial cells, and a prophylactic and therapeutic composition for inflammatory disease or cancer comprising the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During migration from the blood stream to the tissue, immune cells including leukocytes pass through activated endothelial cells to induce immune responses, and many cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), such as integrins, selectins, ICAMs (intracellular adhesion molecule) and VCAMs (vascular cell adhesion molecule), are involved in the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells and their migration to the tissue. Cell adhesion molecules are functionally divided into selectins involved in interaction between leukocytes and endothelial cells, integrins involved in adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells, and immunoglobulins such as ICAM and VCAM. These cell adhesion molecules play important roles in many physiological responses such as immune responses, inflammation, and thrombosis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">VCAM-1 is one of the vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules, which interacts with integrin (VLA-4) expressed on the surfaces of most leukocytes, excluding neutrophils. VCAM-1 is expressed by inflammatory signals, and induces attachment of leukocytes to the vascular endothelial cells and the subsequent transendothelial migration of leukocytes into the damaged tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite recent attention to VCAM-1-VLA-4 interaction, the development of a neutralizing antibody to VCAM-1 has not been actively studied. Although M/K-2.7, a monoclonal antibody to mouse VCAM-1, has recently been developed and shows an inhibitory effect on arthritis in collagen-induced arthritis mouse model, the antibody is specific only to mouse model, and thus the usefulness of the antibody should be further tested for clinical application.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, VCAM-1 consists of seven IgG-like domains and its domains 1 and 4 are substantially involved in binding with its ligand, integrin (&#x3b1;4&#x3b2;1 or &#x3b1;4&#x3b2;7) (1995, PNAS, 92:p5714; 1995, The journal of immunology, 155: p3135 et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this regard, there is an urgent need to develop a fully human monoclonal antibody which inhibits the interaction between VCAM-1 antigen and integrin to effectively inhibit adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes to endothelial cells, and minimizes the risk of immunogenicity.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Examples. However, the following Examples are provided only for the purpose of illustrating the present invention, and accordingly it is not intended that the present invention is limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one aspect to achieve the above objects, the present invention relates to a human recombinant monoclonal antibody, characterized in that it specifically binds to human Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) to inhibit adhesion between leukocytes and activated endothelial cells and transmigration of leukocytes through the activated endothelial cells.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Description of the following terms is provided for a better understanding of the specification, and the terms as used herein are provided for illustrative purposes only, and the invention is not intended to be limited by these terms. It should be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, singular articles are intended to include a plurality of objects unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; includes reference to an immunoglobulin molecule immunologically reactive with a particular antigen, and includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. The term also includes genetically engineered forms such as chimeric antibodies (e.g., humanized murine antibodies) and heteroconjugate antibodies (e.g., dispecific antibodies).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; also includes antigen binding forms of antibodies, including fragments with antigen-binding capability (e.g., Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, Fab, Fv and rIgG). The term also refers to recombinant single chain Fv fragments (scFv). The term antibody also includes bivalent or bispecific molecules, diabodies, triabodies, and tetrabodies. Bivalent and bispecific molecules are described in, e.g., Kostelny et al. (1992, J. Immunol. 148:15467), Pack and Pluckthun (1992, Biochemistry 31:1579), Hollinger et al. (1993, supra), Gruber et al. (1994, J. Immunol.: 5368), Zhu et al. (1997, Protein Sci. 6:781), Hu et al. (1996, Cancer Res. 56:3055), Adams et al. (1993, Cancer Res. 53:4026 and McCartney et al. (1995, Protein Eng. 8:301).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Also, the term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein, refers to an antibody molecule that has been obtained from a substantially identical antibody clone, which shows single-binding specificity and affinity for a specific epitope.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Typically, an immunoglobulin has a heavy and light chain. Each heavy and light chain contains a constant region and a variable region (the regions are also known as &#x201c;domains&#x201d;). Light chain and heavy chain variable regions contain three hypervariable regions called &#x201c;complementarity-determining regions&#x201d; (hereinbelow, referred to as &#x201c;CDRs&#x201d;) and four &#x201c;framework&#x201d; regions. The CDRs are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen. The CDRs of each chain are typically referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, numbered sequentially starting from the N-terminus, and are also typically identified by the chain in which the particular CDR is located.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; is a molecule derived from human immunoglobulin, and means that all amino acid sequences constituting an antibody, including complementarity-determining regions and framework regions, are composed of human immunoglobulin. The term &#x201c;human recombinant monoclonal antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody molecule of single molecular composition, derived from human immunoglobulin.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Humanized antibodies generally have at least three potential advantages for use in human therapy. First, it may interact better with the human immune system, e.g., to destroy target cells more efficiently by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Second, the human immune system does not recognize the antibody as foreign. Third, the half-life in the human circulation will be similar to that of naturally occurring human antibodies, allowing smaller and less frequent doses to be given. Therefore, the human monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention show a strong affinity to VCAM-1 expressed on human endothelial cells, and effectively inhibit leukocyte adhesion to activated endothelial cells expressing VCAM-1. In addition, since their heavy chain and light chain domains are all derived from human cells to show low immunogenicity, the human monoclonal antibodies according to the present invention can be used for the treatment of inflammatory disease or cancer, and the inflammatory disease may be selected from tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1;(TNF-&#x3b1;-mediated disease, intestinal disease, arteriosclerosis, and myocardial infarction, and preferably selected from the group consisting of asthma, diabetes, uveitis, ankylosing spondylitis, sepsis, endotoxin shock, hemodynamic shock, sepsis syndrome, ischemic reperfusion injury, malaria infection, mycobacterial infection, meningitis, psoriasis, congestive heart failure, fibrotic diseases, Kachexie, transplant rejection, cancer, autoimmune diseases, AIDS-related opportunistic infection, arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gout, ankylosing gout, Crohn's disease, ulcerative trigonitis, multiple sclerosis, erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), radiation injury and hyperoxia-induced alveolar damage.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Additionally, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention may include a heavy chain variable region that contains CDR1 having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 10; CDR2 having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 11; and CDR3 having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 12.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention may include a light chain variable region that contains CDR1 having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 14; CDR2 having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 15; and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 16. Meanwhile, the human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be prepared by attaching the framework region (FR) of the known therapeutic antibody to the complementarity-determining region (CDR). More preferably, the human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be a human recombinant monoclonal antibody that contains the light chain amino acid sequence as defined by SEQ ID NO. 13 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">More preferably, the human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be a human monoclonal antibody that contains all of the light chain and heavy chain variable regions. That is, the human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention may include a heavy chain variable region that contains heavy chain CDR1 as defined by SEQ ID NO. 10; heavy chain CDR2 as defined by SEQ ID NO. 11; and heavy chain CDR3 as defined by SEQ ID NO. 12, and a light chain variable region that contains light chain CDR1 as defined by SEQ ID NO. 14; light chain CDR2 as defined by SEQ ID NO. 15; and light chain CDR3 as defined by SEQ ID NO. 16.

That is, human VCAM-1 antigen as a ligand was immobilized to a sensor chip (Sensor chip CM5, BIACORE, BR-1003-99), and then each dilution of the antibodies was applied to the immobilized ligand using a BIACORE instrument to induce association and dissociation between antigen and antibody, thereby determining the association(Ka)/dissociation (Kd) constant KD value, and chi square &#x394;(&#x3c7;2) value that is a statistical value associated with reliance.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention can easily be produced by well-known methods for producing a monoclonal antibody. For example, the method for preparing a monoclonal antibody may be performed by producing a hybridoma using B leukocytes obtained from immunized animals (Koeher and Milstein, 1976, Nature, 256:495), or using a phage display method, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">An antibody library using a phage display is a method of expressing an antibody on the surface of a phage with genes of the antibody directly obtained from B lymphocytes without preparation of hybridoma. Many of the difficulties associated with generating monoclonal antibodies by B-cell immortalization can be overcome by a phage display method.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A conventional phage display comprises: 1) inserting an oligonucleotide having a random sequence into the region corresponding to the N-terminus of a phage coat protein pIII (or pIV); 2) expressing a fusion protein of a natural coat protein and a polypeptide coded by said oligonucleotide having a random sequence; 3) treating a receptor material that can bind to the polypeptide coded by said oligonucleotide; 4) eluting peptide-phage particles bound to the receptors using low pH or a molecule which has binding competitiveness; 5) amplifying the eluted phage in a host cell by panning; 6) repeating said steps to obtain desired amounts of phage; and 7) determining the sequence of an active peptide with the DNA sequencing of phage clones selected by panning.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a preferred embodiment, a preparation method of the human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be performed by a phage display method. A person skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains can perform the above steps easily referring to well-known phage display techniques, which are disclosed in, for example, Barbas et al. (METHODS: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology 2: 119, 1991 and J. Virol. 2001 July; 75(14):6692-9) and Winter et al. (Ann. Rev. Immunol. 12:433, 1994). A phage which can be used for constructing the antibody library may be a filamentous phage, for example, fd, M13, f1, If1, Ike, Zj/Z, Ff, Xf, Pf1 and Pf3, but is not limited thereto. Also, a vector, which can be used for the expression of a heterogeneous gene on the surface of the filamentous phage, may be a phage vector such as fUSE5, fAFF1, fd-CAT1, or fdtetDOG, or a phagemid vector such as pHEN1, pComb3, pComb8 or pSEX, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, a helper phage, which can be used for providing a natural coat protein required for successful re-infection of recombinant phage, may be exemplified by M13K07 or VSCM13, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the specific Example of the present invention, the human antibody specific to human VCAM-1 was obtained as scFv by phage display technology, and screened as a mono phage clone, thereby obtaining 20 types of monoclone phages being specific to human VCAM-1.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the specific Example of the present invention, a molecular weight and purity of VCAM-1 obtained by recombinant technique were examined, and then used for preparation of a monoclonal antibody. VCAM-1 was reacted with library phage from human naive scFv library cells having diversity, followed by panning and screening of monoclonal antibodies strongly binding to VCAM-1 antigen (see Table 1). The selected monoclonal antibodies were confirmed by fingerprinting, followed by sequencing to confirm CDR regions of VH and VL of the antibody. Homology between the above antibody and germ line antibody group was investigated using the Ig BLAST program of NCBI website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast). As a result, 20 types of phage antibodies being specific to VCAM-1 were obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, in accordance with the specific Example of the present invention, an expression vector containing a polynucleotide encoding the heavy chain and light chain of the selected 20 types of human antibody phage or the fragment thereof having immunological activity was constructed. Upon construction of the expression vector, expression regulatory elements, such as a promoter, a terminator, and an enhancer, and a sequence for targeting membranes or secretion can be properly selected and used in combination for purpose, depending on a host cell intended to produce the light chain and heavy chain of the human antibody or the fragment thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The expression vector of the present invention includes a plasmid vector, a cosmid vector, a bacteriophage vector, a viral vector or the like, but is not limited thereto. A suitable expression vector includes a signal sequence or a leader sequence for targeting membranes or secretion as well as expression regulatory elements, such as a promoter, an operator, an initiation codon, a stop codon, a polyadenylation signal and an enhancer, and can be constructed in various forms depending on the purpose thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the present invention provides a method of identifying the location of the domains of human VCAM-1 antigen, which bind with the human recombinant monoclonal antibody. It has been reported that VCAM-1 consists of seven IgG-like domains and its domains 1 and 4 are substantially involved in binding with its ligand, integrin (&#x3b1;4&#x3b2;1 or &#x3b1;4&#x3b2;7). Therefore, to confirm the epitope of VCAM-1 antigen specific to the human recombinant monoclonal antibody according to the present invention, the following procedures were performed in the specific Example.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The present inventors analyzed antigen-binding regions of 20 types of antibodies by ELISA, after expressing and purifying each domain (VD2, VD4, VD7) of human VCAM-1 antigen. As a result, the antigen-binding regions vary depending on the type of antibodies, and among them, the antibodies H6 and 7HT binding to domain 1 or 2 was obtained (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, the human recombinant monoclonal antibody according to the present invention provides an affinity to human VCAM-1 antigen. In the specific Example of the present invention, an association/dissociation constant (KD value) of the antibody to human VCAM-1 antigen was determined by a BIACORE analysis to confirm the affinity. It was found that antibodies H6 and 7HT have a strong affinity to human VCAM-1 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As a result, it was found that the H6 antibody has an excellent binding capacity to human VCAM-1 antigen to a level of approximately 0.6 nM, and the 7HT antibody has a binding capacity to human VCAM-1 antigen to a level of approximately 6.3 nM.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Therefore, the human recombinant monoclonal antibody according to the present invention can be used in the composition and method for detecting VCAM-1, comprising the step of detecting antigen-antibody reaction between the human recombinant monoclonal antibody and VCAM-1 in a biological sample.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, in the specific Example of the present invention, the human recombinant monoclonal antibody (H6) according to the present invention was found to inhibit the adhesion between human leukocytes (U937 cell) and human endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated with recombinant human VCAM-1 or human TNF-&#x3b1;, since the interaction between leukocytes and activated endothelial cells is mediated by VCAM-1. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a human VCAM-1-immobilized solid support plate or a HUVEC monolayer plate is treated with the antibodies at various concentrations. To examine whether the antibodies inhibit binding of the fluorescence-labeled U937 cell and the antigen, fluorescence intensity was measured. As a result, the antibody showed an inhibitory activity on the adhesion. In particular, the antibody was found to exhibit strong inhibitory activity even at a low concentration (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Moreover, in the present invention, it was confirmed that the human recombinant monoclonal antibody according to the present invention inhibits the permeability of human leukocytes into human endothelial cell monolayer among the interactions between human leukocytes (U937 cell) and human endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated with human TNF-&#x3b1;, since the interaction between leukocytes and activated endothelial cells is mediated by VCAM-1. In the example of the present invention, HUVEC monolayer plated on a transwell plate was treated with the antibodies, and then the permeability of HUVEC monolayer by U937 cells was confirmed by counting the number of U937 cells collected in the bottom of the transwell. As a result, the above antibody showed a strong inhibitory activity on the permeability (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, it was confirmed that adhesion and transmigration of inflammatory cells were effectively inhibited, when VCAM-1-expressing mouse arterial endothelial cells were treated with VCAM-1 antibody (7HT). Thereafter, it was also confirmed that VCAM-1 antibodies (7HT) specifically bind to arterial endothelial cells upon intraperitoneal injection of the antibodies into high-fat diet-fed mouse (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). To investigate the therapeutic effect of VCAM-1 antibody (7HT) on cardiovascular disease, ApoE&#x2212;/&#x2212; mice were divided into four groups. Group 1 was administered with PBS and fed with normal chow diet twice a week, Group 2 was administered with a control antibody, 4BT (10 mg/kg) and fed with a high-fat diet twice a week, Group 3 was administered with the VCAM-1 antibody, 7HT (low dose of 1 mg/kg) and fed with a high-fat diet twice a week, and Group 4 was administered with the VCAM-1 antibody, 7HT (high dose of 10 mg/kg) and fed with a high-fat diet twice a week for 12 weeks. Then, an en-face technique for aortic lesions was performed to analyze arteriosclerosis, and a significant reduction in arteriosclerosis was found in Group 4, compared to Group 2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>). In addition, frozen cardiac sections were sequentially prepared and analyzed to observe arteriosclerosis formed in the aortic arch. Consequently, a reduction in arteriosclerosis was found in Groups 3 and 4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 21</figref>). By hematologic analysis, it was confirmed that the result was not attributed to cholesterol metabolism/excretion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). There was no significant difference in the body weight and the amount of feed consumed during the experimental period (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). After the experiment, a toxicity test was performed to examine the liver toxicity of the antibody (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). It was confirmed that VCAM-1 antibody (7HT) inhibits VCAM-1 function, leading to alleviation of arteriosclerosis.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Accordingly, since the human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the present invention has a strong affinity to VCAM-1 expressed on human endothelial cells, it can be employed in any application requiring the VCAM-1 antigen recognition. In particular, it effectively inhibits adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes to the activated endothelial cells, thereby providing an effective diagnostic and therapeutic method for VCAM-1-mediated diseases such as inflammatory disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer.</p>

However, the following Examples are provided only for the purpose of illustrating the present invention, and accordingly it is not intended that the present invention is limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">1. Preparation of Human and Mouse VCAM-1 Antigen</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">1.1. Cloning of Human VCAM-1</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">A plasmid containing human VCAM-1 gene (hMU012650) (Kugi # IRAU-75-G02) was purchased from KUGI (Korean UniGene Information) provided by Center for Functional Analysis of Human Genome, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB). The plasmid was used as a template DNA, and in order to express only D1-D2 domain and D1-D4 domain of VCAM-1, each gene was amplified using a forward primer (5&#x2032;-CAGGGGGCCGTGGGGGCCTTTAAAATCGAGACCACCCC-3&#x2032;)(SEQ ID NO: 17) and a reverse primer (5&#x2032;-TAGCGGCCGACGCGGCCAATTGCAATTCTTTTACAGCCTG-3&#x2032;)(SEQ ID NO: 18) for D1-D2 domain of VCAM-1, and a forward primer (5&#x2032;-CAGGGGGCCGTGGGGGCCTTTAAAATCGAGACCACCCC-3&#x2032;)(SEQ ID NO: 19) and a reverse primer (5&#x2032;-TAGCGGCCGACGCGGCCAAGAGCTCCACCTGGATTCCCT-3&#x2032;)(SEQ ID NO: 20) for D1-D4 domain of VCAM-1. After treatment of sfiI, ligase was used to clone the genes into a pYK602-Fc vector and a pYK602-His only vector (vector constructed by KRIBB), respectively. PCR products were obtained under the following PCR conditions: for a total reaction volume of 50 ul, a template of 100 ng was reacted at 94&#xb0; C. for 2 min, and then at 94&#xb0; C. for 30 sec, at 55&#xb0; C. for 30 sec, and at 72&#xb0; C. for 1min and 30 sec (D1-D4), and 45 sec (D1-D2) for 30 cycles, and then 10 min at 72&#xb0; C. Moreover, base sequences of the cloned pYK602-FC-VCAM-1-D1-D2, pYK602-His-VCAM-1-D1-D2, pYK602-FC-VCAM-1-D1-D4, and pYK602-His-VCAM-1-D1-D4 vectors were examined.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">1.2. Expression and Purification of VCAM-1 Protein</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Among various proteins, the entire molecule-containing hVCAM-Fc-chimera (R&#x26;D system, cat#: 862-VC) and mVCAM-1-Fc chimera (R&#x26;D systems, Cat#: 643-VM) were commercially purchased, and expression and purification of the fragments with each VCAM-1 domain were performed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">First, 5&#xd7;106 293E cells were plated in 10 dishes of 150 mm diameter, and on next day, each 20 &#x3bc;g of the cloned pYK602-VCAM-1-D1-D2 vector and pYK602-VCAM-1-D1-D4 vector were treated with PEI (23966: Polysciences, Inc, USA) for transfection. Next day, the media was replaced with serum-free DMEM, and then the supernatants were collected every other day, followed by electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and Western blotting for analysis of expression level.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The supernatants, in which the expression of hVCAM-1-D1-D2-Fc and hVCAM-1-D1-D4-Fc was confirmed, were collected, and filtered using a 0.22 &#x3bc;m Top-filter (Millipore, Cat#: SCGP T05 RE) to obtain a sufficient amount of protein. The proteins were purified before use, as follows. First, an Econo-column (Bio-Rad Cat. No 737-1006, 1&#xd7;5 cm) was washed with PBS, and packed with 500 &#x3bc;l of protein A (Amersham Cat. No. 17-1279-30). During performing the packing, 10 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) was applied to the column to wash beads, and 30 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was applied as a binding buffer. Subsequently, the obtained supernatant was applied thereto using a Peri-staltic pump (Bio-Rad Cat. No. 731-8142) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After binding to the column, it was washed with PBS at a flow rate of 2 ml/min for 1 hr, followed by elution. 500 &#x3bc;l of 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) was used for elution, and 1/10 volume of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) was added for neutralization. Among 6 elution fractions, the protein was mainly eluted in #1 and #2 fractions. These two fractions were put in 10 K dialysis membrane, followed by o/n dialysis in 4 L of PBS. All the above processes were performed in a 4&#xb0; C. cold room. After quantification, the products were aliquoted and stored at &#x2212;70&#xb0; C. After purification, the products were confirmed on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. hVCAM-1-D1-D2-Fc and hVCAM-1-D1-D4-Fc were obtained in an amount of 2.8 mg and 800 &#x3bc;g, respectively. The supernatants, in which the expression of hVCAM-1-D1-D2-his and hVCAM-1-D1-D4-his was confirmed, were collected, filtered using a 0.22 &#x3bc;m Top-filter (Millipore, Cat#: SCGP T05 RE) and concentrated using pellicon XL membrane (Millipore, 8K, cat #: PXB0 08A 50) of LabScale TFF System (Millipore, Cat#: XX42LSS11) to 1/10 volume. 10-fold volume of an IMAC buffer solution (300 mM KCl, 50 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) was added to the concentrate, and replaced by the IMAC buffer solution. Purification was performed using a Bio-Scale Mini profinity IMAC cartridge (cat#: 732-4610) of Profinia&#x2122; protein Purification System (Bio-Rad) at a rate of 1 ml/min according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluent was dialyzed using a membrane (10K, 132574:SPECTRAPOR, USA) in 4 L of PBS solution at 4&#xb0; C. for 4 hr or longer, and then dialyzed again in 4 L of precooled PBS solution overnight. After o/n dialysis, the resultant was transferred to an e-tube, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Consequently, 400 &#x3bc;g of hVCAM-1-D1-D4-his and hVCAM-1-D1-D2-Fc proteins were obtained, and examined in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">2. Construction of Library Phage</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">2.7&#xd7;1010 human scFv library cells having diversity were cultured in SB medium [30 g of bactotrypton, 20 g of Yeast extract, 10 g of MOPS, pH 7.0] containing 50 &#x3bc;g/ml ampicillin and 2% glucose at 37&#xb0; C. for 2-3 hrs (OD600=0.5). Then, the cells were infected with VCSM13 helper phage, followed by culture in a medium containing 70 &#x3bc;g/ml kanamycin and 1 mM IPTG at 30&#xb0; C. for 16 hrs. The cells proceeded to centrifugation (4500 rpm, 15 min, 4&#xb0; C.) and supernatant was obtained, which was dissolved in a solution supplemented with 4% PEG 6000 and 3% NaCl, followed by reaction in ice for 1 hr. The reactant was centrifuged again (8000 rpm, 20 min, 4&#xb0; C.). The pellet was dissolved in PBS, which proceeded to centrifugation again (12000 rpm, 10 min, 4&#xb0; C.). As a result, the supernatant containing library phage was obtained, which was transferred into a new tube and stored at 4&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">3. Biopanning by Phage Display</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">When VCAM-1 consisting of seven IgG-like domains binds with its ligand, alpha4beta1 integrin (&#x3b1;4&#x3b2;1 integrin), its domains 1 and 4 are known to function as a binding motif. Thus, panning was performed using human VCAM-1-D1-D4 (hVCAM-1-D1-D4) as well as the entire VCAM-1 molecule. In this Example, the panning method and result for hVCAM-1-D1-D4 will be described.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">After 4th round of panning, each of single colonies was picked from an output titer plate using a sterile toothpick, and inoculated in a 96-well plate containing SB-ampicillin media (200 &#x3bc;l/well), followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 2&#x2dc;3 hrs (OD600=0.5&#x2dc;0.7). Subsequently, 20 &#x3bc;l of 10 mM IPTG was added to each well, and cultured at 30&#xb0; C. for 16 hrs. Each well of 96-well immunoplate (Costar 3690) was coated with 250 ng of hVCAM-1-D1-D4 antigen using a coating buffer solution at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 hr, and then blocked with skim milk (3%) in PBS. The scFv phages of 4th round of panning were first centrifuged (3000 rpm, 15 min), and the supernatant was removed. 60 &#x3bc;l of TES buffer was added to each well, followed by incubation in ice for 30 min. Thereafter, centrifugation (3000 rpm, 15 min) was performed, and 25 &#x3bc;l of each supernatant was added to each well of 96-well immunoplate coated with VCAM-1-D1-D4 antigen, from which 3% skim milk/PBS was removed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Each well was washed with 0.2 ml of PBS-tween 20 (0.05%) four times, and then treated with 25 &#x3bc;l of secondary antibody anti-HA-HRP (Santan Cruz, SC-7392) diluted in 3% skim milk/PBS at a ratio of 1:3000, followed by incubation for 1 hr. Each well was washed with 0.2 ml of PBS-tween 20 (0.05%) four times, and treated with 25 &#x3bc;l of TMB solution, and left for 5 min. After reaction, 25 &#x3bc;l of 1 M H2504 was immediately added to each well to terminate the reaction, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Spectrophotometer (MolecularDevice, USA).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As a result, binding capacities of 78 single phage clones to hVCAM-1-D1-D4 antigen were compared, and their types were confirmed by finger printing and sequence analysis. Finally, 20 different types of phage antibodies were selected.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">4. Cloning of Full IgG Form</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">To convert the monoclonal phage antibodies against hVCAM-1 from phage to full IgG vector, colony PCR (iCycler iQ, BIO-RAD) was performed to obtain a heavy chain using 1 &#x3bc;l of monoclone DNA and 10 pmole/&#x3bc;l of a heavy chain forward primer and a heavy chain reverse primer, 5 &#x3bc;l of 10&#xd7; buffer, 1 &#x3bc;l of 10 mM dNTP mix, 0.5 &#x3bc;l of pfu DNA polymerase (Solgent, co., 2.5 U/&#x3bc;l), and distilled water. In addition, colony PCR was also performed to obtain a light chain using light chain forward and reverse primers in the same manner.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The heavy chain DNAs obtained from PCR were purified using a DNA-gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and mixed with 1 ul of pNATAB H vector (10 ng), 15 ul of heavy chain(100&#x2dc;200 ng), 2 ul of 10&#xd7;Buffer, 1 ul of ligase (1 U/ul), and distilled water, left at room temperature for 1&#x2dc;2 hrs for ligation with the vector. Competent cells (XL1-blue) were added thereto, and left in ice for 30 min, followed by heat-shock at 42&#xb0; C. for 90 sec for transformation. The mixture was placed in ice again for 5 min, and 1 Ml of LB medium was added thereto. After incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 hr, the cells were spread on LB Amp solid medium, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 16 hrs. The single colony obtained was inoculated in 5 Ml of LB Amp liquid medium, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 16 hrs. DNA was extracted from the culture medium using a DNA-prep. Kit (Nuclogen). The light chain DNA was also extracted using a pNATAB L vector in the same manner as the above. Sequencing analysis of the obtained DNA was performed using a CMVproF primer (AAA TGG GCG GTA GGC GTG)(SEQ ID NO: 29) (Solgent). As a result, it was confirmed that the heavy chain and the light chain sequences of full IgG converted from 9 clones against VCAM-1 were identical to the sequence of phage antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">5. Transient Gene Expression of Antibody</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Transient gene expression from the cloned full IgG heavy chain and light chain DNAs was performed.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary)-S was used as a host cell for transient gene expression to induce transfection in a mixed solution of Opti-MEMI (GIBCO 31985, Invitrogen) with lipofectamine 2000 (Cat no. 11668-019, Invitrogen) and DNA (1:1). To maximize the transient expression, heavy chain and light chain DNAs were used at a ratio of 1:1. RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO 22400, Invitrogen) was used for transfection, and the cell was used at a concentration of 2&#xd7;106 cells/ml. After the mixed solution was reacted for 20 min, and mixed with the transfection medium at a ratio of 1:9, followed by incubation in a 5% CO2 37&#xb0; C. shaking incubator at 110 rpm for 4 hrs. Subsequently, CD-CHO medium (GIBCO 10743, Invitrogen) containing 8 mM glutamine (GIBCO 25030, L-Glutamine 200 mM, 100&#xd7;, Invitrogen) and HTS (GIBCO, HT Supplement, Cat no. 11067-030, Invitrogen) was added thereto in an equal volume of the transfection medium. The flask was incubated in an 8% CO2 37&#xb0; C. shaking incubator at 100 rpm for 4 days. The cultured sample was centrifuged at 8,000 g for 15 min to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 &#x3bc;m filter (Corning) to prepare a culture solution for isolation and purification of antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">6. Isolation and Purification of Antibody</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The supernatant prepared in Example 5 was passed through a recombinant protein-A sepharose column (Hitrap rProteinA FF, 5 mL, GE healthcare) equilibrated using an equilibrium buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl). The antibodies binding to the column was eluted with 0.1 M Na-citrate (pH 3.0), 100 mM NaCl solution, and neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), followed by dialysis in a PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, Welgene) buffer solution. The purified antibody was electrophoresed on Bis-Tris 4-12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (NuPAGE gel, Invitrogen) under reduced conditions. As a result, about 55 kDa of heavy chain and about 25 kDa of light chain were detected.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">7. Analysis of Antigen Affinity of Antibody</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">7.1. Affinity to Antigen Domain</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The location of anti VCAM-1 antibody-binding region in VCAM-1 consisting of seven domains was identified by ELISA. Each well of microplate was coated with a recombinant human VCAM-1 domain 1&#x2dc;2/Fc chimera (hereinbelow, referred to as &#x2018;VD2&#x2019;, A&#x26;R therapeutics), VCAM-1 domain 1&#x2dc;4/Fc chimera (hereinbelow, referred to as &#x2018;VD4&#x2019;, A&#x26;R therapeutics), and VCAM-1 domain 1-7/Fc chimera (hereinbelow, referred to as &#x2018;VD7&#x2019;, R&#x26;D, 862-VC) at a concentration of 2 &#x3bc;g/ml at 4&#xb0; C. overnight. The plate was washed using PBS once, and blocked using PBS supplemented with 3% BSA (bovine serum albumin) at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 hrs, followed by incubation in cell culture medium containing 7H antibody (1:50) at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 hrs. The plate was washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 four times, and the amount of anti VCAM-1 antibody binding to recombinant human VCAM-1 antigen was detected by anti-Fab monoclonal antibody horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-F(ab&#x2032;)2 antibody. The plate was reacted with a TMB substrate solution (3,3,5,5-Tetramethylbenzidine) at room temperature for about 5 min, and the reaction was terminated by 1 N (normal) sulfuric acid solution to measure optical density at 450 nm. With respect to H6 antibody, the purified antibody was diluted to 100&#x2dc;125 ng/ml, and reacted, and then detected by the action of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-kappa light chain antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it was found that H6 had a strong binding capacity to all VCAM-1 domains, 1-2 (VD2), 1-4 (VD4), and 1-7 (VD7). In particular, H6 antibody was found to have an excellent binding capacity to 1-2 domain (VD2) among 7 domains of VCAM-1. 7H antibody was also found to have an excellent binding capacity to 1-2 domain (VD2) among the VCAM-1 domains.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">7.2. Affinity Analysis by BIACORE</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In order to determine the binding affinity of anti VCAM-1 antibodies, H6 and 7HT to human VCAM-1 antigen, each antigen as a ligand was immobilized to a sensor chip (Sensor chip CM5, BIACORE, BR-1003-99), and then each dilution of the human antibodies was applied to the immobilized ligand using BIACORE to induce association and dissociation between antigen and antibody, thereby determining the association/dissociation constant Kd value, which indicates a binding interaction between the corresponding antigen and antibody. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (Reference: Thomas Hofer, Wisit Tangkeangsirisin, Michael G. Kennedy, Rose G. Mage, Stephen J.

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">BIACORE analysis comprises the three steps of 1) Pre-concentration that determines coupling conditions between sensor chip and ligand; 2) immobilization of ligand to sensor chip; and 3) binding of analyte to the immobilized ligand.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">1) Pre-concentration</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In this experiment, a conventional BIACORE sensor chip CM5 (BIACORE, BR-1003-99) was used, and before ligand immobilization to the chip, the electrostatic attraction of ligand to the sensor surface was determined via change in pH 4.0-5.5 of sodium acetate, which is used as a coupling buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">2) Ligand Immobilization</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">For ligand immobilization to the sensor chip CM5, the chip should be first activated with a mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and Nethyl-n&#x2032;-(dimethylaminopropyl) (EDC) (Amine Coupling Kit, BR-1000-50) to prepare a NHS-ester-activated chip surface being highly reactive to amino group. 1 mg/ml of ligand to be immobilized was diluted in 97 &#x3bc;l of each sodium acetate solution (vary within the pH range from 4.0 to 5.5) at a dilution ratio of 3/100, and then applied at a flow rate of 10 &#x3bc;l/min for about 3 min (as a negative control, the ligand was diluted using a running buffer, HBS-EP buffer (BIACORE AB, Sweden) in the same manner). In order to immobilize the ligand at a predetermined value target RU (resonance unit), serial injection was carried out automatically, until reaching target RU. The ligandimmobilized chip was inactivated by injection of 1 M ethanolamine (Amine Coupling Kit, BR-1000-50) at a flow rate of 10 &#x3bc;l/min for about 3 min. The final RU was determined by an immobilization report which provides a difference in RU values before and after injection of ethanolamine.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">3) Binding of Analyte to the Immobilized Ligand</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">A flow cell 2-flow cell 1 mode provided by BIACORE instrument was employed in this experiment in order to remove non-specific binding. At this time, a recombinant VCAM1/Fc antigen was immobilized as a ligand to the flow cell 2, and BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) was immobilized to the flow cell 1. Then, anti VCAM-1 antibody H6 as the analyte were applied to flow cell 1 and 2, simultaneously. The sensogram RU of flow cell 1 was automatically subtracted from the sensogram RU of flow cell 2. Subsequently, the analytes were applied at a flow rate of 30 &#x3bc;l/min for about 3 min, and then dissociation was induced for 120 sec. Through this procedure, an association/dissociation curve of the corresponding antigen and antibody was obtained, and an association/dissociation constant KD was calculated by BIAevaluation program (BIACORE AB, Sweden), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As a result, it was found that H6 antibody against human VCAM-1 antigen has an excellent binding capacity of about 0.6 nM, and 7HT antibody has a binding capacity of about 6.3 nM.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">8.1. Inhibitory Effect on Adhesion Between Human VCAM-1 Antigen and Leukocyte</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Each well of 96-well plate (Maxisorp, Nunc) was coated with 100 &#x3bc;l of recombinant human VCAM-1 (10 &#x3bc;g/ml, Cat. No.: 809-VR-200, R&#x26;D systems) for 1 hr, and then H6 antibody was added to the VCAM-1-coated well in an amount of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 &#x3bc;g for antigen binding for 1 hr. At this time, 4B2 mouse anti-human VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody (Cat. No.: BBA5, R&#x26;D) was used as a positive control, and as a negative control, the antigen was only treated without antibody. While binding of antibodies to the antigen, the fluorescence staining of human leukocyte cell U937 (Cat. No.: CRL-1593.2, ATCC) was performed using 5 &#x3bc;M of BCECF-AM (Cat. No.: 216254, Calbiochem). Next, U937 cell was treated with 100% human serum (Cat. No.: H4522, Sigma) to inactivate the Fc receptor on the cell surface. The leukocyte cells treated with fluorescence staining and Fc receptor inactivation were suspended to a density of 1.0&#xd7;106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Cat. No.: 22400-089, Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% fetal calf bovine serum. 100 &#x3bc;l of the prepared U937 cells were applied to each well of the antigen and antibody-treated plate, and incubated in a 37&#xb0; C. 5% CO2 incubator for 15 min, and each well was filled with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% fetal calf bovine serum, and sealed tightly with a sealing tape. The plate was placed upside down, and centrifuged at 200&#xd7;g force for 5 min. The sealing tape was removed from the upside-down centrifuged plate. The medium and unbound U937 cells were completely removed, and 150 &#x3bc;l of cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.5), 0.1% SDS) was added to each well to lyse the bound U937 cells for 15 min. Subsequently, the plate was placed in a fluorometer (GeminiX, Molecular Device), and fluorescence intensity was measured at an absorbance wavelength 485 nm/emission wavelength 530 nm. Mean values of the triplicate measurements (per each experimental condition) were calculated, and reduction in fluorescence intensity compared to that of non-antibody treated group was calculated to analyze the inhibition rate. As a result, H6 antibody showed 80% or higher inhibition at an amount of 1 &#x3bc;g or more (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>

When cell monolayer was observed under a microscope, the cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml of human TNF-&#x3b1; for 24 hrs. Thereafter, to remove TNF-&#x3b1;, each well was washed with 200 &#x3bc;l of EGM-2 medium twice, and the antibody H6 was added to the HUVEC monolayer plated on the well in an amount of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 &#x3bc;g, respectively. The plate was incubated for 1 hr to induce antigen-antibody binding. At this time, 0.5 and 5.0 &#x3bc;g of 4B2 mouse anti-human VCAM-1 monoclonal antibody (Cat.

The plate was incubated in a 37&#xb0; C. 5% CO2 incubator for 10 min, and placed upside down to remove the medium and unbound cells. Each well was filled with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, and sealed tightly with a sealing tape. The upside-down plate was centrifuged at 400&#xd7;g force for 5 min. The sealing tape was removed from the upside-down centrifuged plate. The medium and unbound U937 cells were completely removed, and 150 &#x3bc;l of cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.1% SDS) was added to each well to lyse the bound U937 cells for 15 min. Subsequently, the plate was placed in a fluorometer (GeminiX, Molecular Device), and fluorescence intensity was measured at an absorbance wavelength 485 nm/emission wavelength 530 nm. Mean values of the triplicate measurements (per each experimental condition) were calculated, and reduction in fluorescence intensity compared to that of non-antibody treated group was calculated to analyze the inhibition rate. As a result, H6 showed approximately 25&#x2dc;65% inhibition at an amount of 0.1 &#x3bc;g&#x2dc;10.0 &#x3bc;g (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).

The media supplemented with TNF-&#x3b1; was removed from the insert with HUVEC, and antibody H6 was added to 100 ul of 1% FBS/RPMI media, and a portion of Fc receptor-blocked U937 cells was suspended in anti-alpha 4 integrin antibody or recombinant human VCAM-1 antigen, and pre-treated at 37&#xb0; C. for 30 min. U937 cells in 1% FBS/RPMI media (5&#xd7;105 cell/200 &#x3bc;l) were added to the pre-treated HUVEC, and the equal number of U937 cells suspended in anti-alpha 4 integrin antibody was also added to HUVEC. At this time, to induce transendothelial migration of U937 leukocyte, 400 &#x3bc;l of 10 nM C5a (R&#x26;D, 2037C5) was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37&#xb0; C. for 2&#x2dc;6 hrs.

Centrifugation was performed at 1,500 rpm for 3 min to remove media, and then the cell pellet was suspended in 600 &#x3bc;l of 1&#xd7;PBS to count the number of cell (Cell counter, Beckman Coulter TM, Vi-Cell XR 2.03).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The number of non-specifically transmigrated leukocytes of the non-treated group (not treated with TNF-&#x3b1; and C5a) was subtracted from the number of transmigrated leukocytes through the TNF-&#x3b1;-treated HUVEC experimental group (Human IgG control-treated group) by treatment of C5a, which was regarded as 100% migration. Migration inhibition (%) of each antibody was calculated. As a result, H6 antibody was found to show approximately 25% migration inhibition (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">2&#xd7;105 HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) were inoculated in a 6-well plate, and cultured for about 3 days until monolayer formation. The cells were treated with human TNF-&#x3b1; (20 ng/ml, Cat. No.: ab9642, abcam) to induce VCAM-1 expression for 14&#x2dc;16 hrs. HUVEC of passages 1-5 was used. To remove human TNF-&#x3b1;, the cells were washed with PBS once, and the plate was left at 4&#xb0; C. for 20 min. HUVEC was treated with H6 antibody diluted in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA (10 ug/ml), and incubated at 4&#xb0; C. for 30 min to induce binding. Then, the cells were washed with PBS once. The plate was left at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 min, 10 min, 30 min, and 60 min to induce internalization of VCAM-1-bound antibodies, followed by washing. Except the experiment group for VCAM-1 expression test, 1 ml of acidic PBS (pH 2.5) was added to each experiment group, and left at room temperature for 5 min to remove antibodies on the cell surface, followed by washing. The cells were recovered by trypsin treatment (Cat. No.: CC-5034, Clonetics), and reacted with 4% formaldehyde (in PBS) at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were washed with PBS once, and reacted with 0.2% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 10 min, followed by washing with PBS once. FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Cat.

<p id="p-0159" num="0158">13. Analysis of Inhibitory Effect of VCAM-1 Antibody on Inflammatory Cell Adhesion Via in Vitro Adhesion Assay</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">To confirm whether VCAM-1 antibody binds to vascular endothelial cells to inhibit adhesion of inflammatory cells, arterial vascular endothelial cells of C57BL/6 mouse were separated by Matrigel method, and then cultured. Then, 1&#xd7;105 cells were inoculated in a 24-well culture dish, and then treated with TNF&#x3b1; to induce VCAM-1 expression. Bone marrow-derived monocytes of GFP (green fluorescence protein) transgenic mouse were isolated using a magnetic bead specific to their surface marker CD11b, and 1&#xd7;106 cells were treated to the vascular endothelial cells. After incubation for 30 min, unbound cells were removed by washing with PBS. 4% paraformaldehyde fixation was performed for 10 min, followed by PBS washing.

Intraperitoneal injection was performed four times for 2 weeks, together with high-fat diet, and then the artery of each mouse was recovered, and reacted with Alexa 594-labelled anti-human IgG secondary antibody. To re-confirm the VCAM-1 expression of vascular endothelial cells, the artery was reacted with goat anti-mVCAM-1 antibody and Alexa 488-labelled anti-goat IgG secondary antibody. Then, the sections of arteries were visualized by confocal microscopy. As a result, VCAM-1 expression was clearly observed in the artery of each mouse, and a strong binding of VCAM-1 Ab was only observed in the mouse injected with a high dose of VCAM-1 Ab (7HT, 10 mg/kg) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>).</p>
