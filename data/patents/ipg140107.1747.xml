<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to guidewires and their methods of manufacture. Specifically, the present invention relates to guidewires for use in medical applications, including urological applications. Those skilled in the art will recognize the benefits of applying the present invention to similar fields not discussed herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Guidewires are used in a variety of medical applications including intravascular, gastrointestinal, and urological. For example, a common vascular application is Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA). This procedure can involve inserting a guidewire through an incision in the femoral artery near the groin, advancing the guidewire over the aortic arch, into a coronary artery, and across a lesion to be treated in the heart. Similarly, angioplasty performed in other parts of the anatomy is called Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) and may also involve the use of a guidewire. Typical vascular guidewires are about 50 cm to 300 cm in length, and are about 0.010-0.038 inches in diameter depending upon the application.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Common gastrointestinal uses of guidewires include endoscopic procedures in which an endoscope may be inserted into the mouth and advanced through the esophagus to the bile duct, the cystic duct, or the pancreatic duct. A guidewire is then threaded through a lumen in the endoscope and into the bile duct, cystic duct, or pancreatic duct. For purposes of this disclosure, &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refers to the end further from the device operator during use and &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; refers to the end closer to the device operator during use. Once the distal tip of the guidewire is located in a position desired to be treated, a diagnostic or therapeutic medical instrument is advanced over the guidewire and to the treatment area. The guidewire and the instrument may then be observed through the endoscope as treatment occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Urological uses of guidewires include the placement of ureteral stents, or the placement of a basket-type retrieval device to retrieve kidney stones. Ureteral stenting, for example, is required when the normal flow of urine from the kidney into the bladder is compromised perhaps by tumor growth, stricture, or stones. Generally, the procedure involves the insertion of a ureteroscope through the urethra and into the bladder. A guidewire is then advanced through the ureteroscope and into a ureter. The wire is then forced through the compromised portion of the ureter. Once the guide wire is in place, a ureteral stent is advanced over the guidewire and into position in the ureter. The guidewire may then be removed and the stent will maintain the patency of the fluid path between the kidney and the bladder. The procedures described above are but a few of the known uses for guidewires.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Pushability, kink resistance, torqueability, and bendability are closely related and important features of a guidewire. It is important that force applied at the proximal end of a guidewire is transferred to the distal end of the guidewire. In addition, a guidewire must exhibit good bendability. This characteristic is a balance between adequate flexibility to navigate a tortuous lumen and suitable rigidity to support tracking of another device such as a catheter. Torqueability is closely related to the torsional rigidity of the wire and is ultimately demonstrated by how well rotation imparted to the proximal end of the guidewire is translated to the distal end of the guidewire.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Kink resistance is also an important characteristic of a guidewire. Kink resistance is closely related to the stiffness of the wire. Very stiff wires often provide good pushability (axial rigidity) but poor kink resistance. Kink resistance is measured by the ability of the guidewire to be forced into a relatively tight bend radius without permanently deforming the wire. A kink can lead to an improper force transfer and pushability along the guide wire.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Many guidewires exhibit a transition in stiffness along their length from a relatively more stiff portion in the proximal end to a relatively less stiff portion in the distal end. This provides a more desirable combination of pushability and the ability to navigate tortuous vessels. For some applications, the preferred transition is a smooth and continuous transition from stiffer to less stiff.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Several different types of guidewires are well known in the art. One type of known wire is characterized by a solid metal core surrounded by a metal coil. Typical metals for the core may include spring steels and stainless steels. Coils are usually made of the same variety of metals used as core materials. The coil is usually made of round wire or flat wire and surrounds either the entire length of the core or only a portion of the core. The coil usually is formed by helically wrapping the wire around a mandrel, removing the mandrel, and inserting the core into the coil. The pitch of the wire coil may be varied along the length of the coil to vary the stiffness of the coil. Changes in the pitch of the coil can result in flexibility changes to the resulting guidewire structure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Traditional coil over core wires also achieve a transition in stiffness along their length by using a ground core. In current guidewire technology, for example, the distal tip of the core is usually ground to a taper to provide the characteristics of added flexibility near the tip. In the above described examples, the core wire portion of the guidewire is formed from a base cylindrical metal stock material that is then machined down to a predetermined profile and cross-sectional configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The stock material used for guidewire construction is usually a continuous length of cylindrical wire cut to a desired length after machining. The cylindrical stock material is machined along certain portions to obtain a desired outer diameter to control flexibility. The grinding required to alter the device's flexibility is usually accomplished with a particular manufacturing machine tool called a center-less grinder. Often using a rotating cutting wheel/blade, a center-less grinder cuts away portions of the stock material profile to attain a precise desired configuration. For example, a known centerless grinder machine tool is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,106, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The use of a center-less grinder machine has a number of undesirable drawbacks related to the manufacture of guidewires. For example, the operation of a center-less grinding machine is a labor intensive procedure that requires an experienced operator. In addition, the process results in a relatively high scrap rate, resulting in excess material cost. Moreover, center-less grinding stations, including the actual machinery and related components, leave a large footprint occupying valuable and costly production space otherwise available for alternative uses. Despite these drawbacks, and since guidewire flexibility is largely determined based on the resulting machined profile of the base core wire, dependable alternative configurations and methods of manufacture have, as of yet, not been successful.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The profile and cross-sectional configurations of guidewires formed with a center-less grinding machine inherently results in distinct portions having a smooth or tapered cylindrical outer diameter. The inherent cylindrical configuration results in a number of characteristics that hinder the desired performance of such guidewires during use. For example, the outer diameter of the guidewire, even with a fluoropolymer coating, can result in undesired friction during movement within a working channel of an endoscope. The friction results from contact between a relatively large portion of the exterior perimeter of the guidewire against an internal surface of a working channel in an endoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the inherent cylindrical geometry resulting from center-less grinding also occupies valuable area within the working channel of an endoscope. For example, the necessary area occupied by the inherent geometry of such guidewires limits potential for increased fluid flow within a working channel during irrigation and suction. In addition, the shape of such guidewires can reduce the capability for alternate device passage resulting from potentially unoccupied additional working channel space available with alternative guidewire geometries.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, there is a need for alternative guidewire configurations and methods of manufacture that result in guidewires exhibiting the features of pushability, kink resistance, torqueability, and bendability.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference will now be made in detail to the present exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. The drawing figures of this application are intended to provide a general understanding of the working elements of the underlying system. Accordingly, unless explicitly stated, the figures do not represent a literal depiction of proportional dimensions or the precise locations for the illustrated inter-related components. In addition, for purposes of this application, an &#x201c;unground&#x201d; material includes a material having an exterior surface not further machined (e.g., ground in a centerless grinder, milled, or lathed) from its initial configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a distal portion of a core wire for a guidewire, according to one embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a core wire assembly <b>10</b> having a distal portion <b>12</b> and a proximal portion <b>14</b>. An underlying core wire <b>11</b> is provided as a base component of the core wire assembly <b>10</b>. As will be described in more detail below, the core wire <b>11</b> of the core wire assembly <b>10</b> can be combined with a co-extruded thermoplastic or multiple thermoplastics. The use of thermoplastics combined with an underlying base wire (e.g., either a machined or an &#x201c;unground&#x201d; wire) to form a core wire assembly <b>10</b> allows for control over the resulting flexibility of the device by the selection of thermoplastics with a wide range of durometers.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the co-extruded thermoplastic material(s) is/are depicted generally by reference number <b>32</b>. Additionally, in additional embodiments, items <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and items <b>62</b> and <b>60</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> represent co-extruded materials. Exemplary thermoplastic materials include, but are not limited to, silicone, vinyl, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, acrylic, styrene, polycarbonate, polyether block amide, thermoplastics sold under the trademark PEEK (including a repeat unit that comprises of oxy-1,4-phenylenoeoxy-1,4-phenylene-carbonyl-1,4-phenylene), and fluoropolymers (such as PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)). The potential for a selection of a wide range of materials, with different durometers, allows for variation and control of the resulting guidewire characteristics of pushability, kink resistance, torqueability, and flexibility. In addition, precise control over the resulting material characteristics can produce a guidewire device not requiring an external wrapped coil or the use of a center-less grinder.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A distal portion of the core wire <b>11</b> is not covered with material <b>32</b> and therefore exhibits a smaller cross-sectional profile as compared to the proximal portion <b>14</b>. Accordingly, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the distal portion <b>12</b> may exhibit a smaller diameter circular cross-section, while the proximal portion exhibits a larger cross-sectional profile. In addition, the material <b>32</b> can be provided such that the profile of the proximal portion <b>14</b> tapers down to the smaller diameter of the distal portion <b>12</b> along a tapered portion <b>34</b> at the distal end of the proximal portion <b>14</b>. As described in more detail below, the core wire assembly <b>10</b> can be further manufactured to include polymeric coatings, such as, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene or polyethylene heat shrunk over the distal and proximal portions, thereby forming a completed guidewire.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As will be described in more detail below, material <b>32</b> along the proximal portion <b>14</b> can be formed to have a grooved configuration comprised of fins <b>16</b> extending between troughs <b>18</b> along the outside surface of the proximal portion <b>14</b>. The troughs <b>18</b> along the outside surface of the proximal portion <b>14</b> reduce the amount of exterior surface area available for contact against an internal surface of a working channel in an endoscope during use. Accordingly, as a result of this configuration, friction hindering relative movement between a guidewire having a core wire assembly <b>10</b> and an internal working channel of an endoscope is reduced. Moreover, such a grooved configuration results in increased fluid flow within a working channel by means of the increased area available within the working channel lumen by means of the troughs <b>18</b>. As will be described in detail below, a guidewire using a core wire assembly <b>10</b> exhibits the required characteristics of pushability, kink resistance, torqueability, and flexibility without requiring the use of a core wire formed with a centerless grinding machine and without requiring the inclusion of a wire coil wrapped around the core wire assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a side view of a portion of a guidewire <b>20</b>, according to an embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents an illustration of a distal portion of a guidewire <b>20</b>. Each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> depict different views of the guidewire <b>20</b> after enclosing the underlying core wire assembly <b>10</b> and its components in a polymeric covering (e.g., by means of heat shrinking a polyethylene covering). As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, guidewire <b>20</b> includes a distal portion <b>22</b>, an intermediate portion <b>24</b>, and a proximal portion <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of the guidewire <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> taken along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, guidewire <b>20</b> includes a core wire <b>11</b> forming the base of, and extending substantially the entire length of, the guidewire <b>20</b>. The core wire <b>11</b> can be comprised of a various metallic materials, including, but not limited to, stainless steel (including 400 series stainless steel), titanium (including titanium Ti-Beta # alloys), metallic alloys of nickel/titanium (commonly referred to as nitinol), copper, cobalt, vanadium, chromium, iron, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, core wire <b>11</b> can be provided as a rod or other cylindrical shaped metal structure. In addition, the core wire <b>11</b> can comprise an unground material having an exterior surface that has not been further machined (e.g., ground in a center-less grinder, milled, or lathed) from the configuration in which it is initially provided. Accordingly, where core wire <b>11</b> is an unground material, the profile and cross-section of the core wire <b>11</b> remains substantially uniform (i.e. constant) along the length thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts the guidewire <b>20</b> after enclosing the underlying core wire assembly <b>10</b> in a polymeric covering. For example, guidewire <b>20</b> includes a distal portion <b>22</b> and an intermediate portion <b>24</b> having a polymeric coating <b>28</b>. Guidewire <b>20</b> also includes an additional coating for the remaining proximal portion of the guidewire <b>20</b>. For example, a proximal polymer coating <b>30</b> can cover the proximal portion <b>26</b> of the guidewire <b>20</b>. Exemplary materials for the polymeric coatings <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> include, but are not limited to, various thermoplastic materials, such as, silicone, vinyl, polyethylene, polypropylene, PTFE, nylon, acrylic, styrene, polycarbonate, and fluoropolymers. In an embodiment, coating <b>30</b> is a PTFE heat shrink coating. It is contemplated that either coating <b>30</b> or <b>28</b> could be provided first during manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Extrusion is an exemplary process for applying material <b>32</b> to wire <b>11</b>. Extrusion is a manufacturing process by which, for example, a base material is melted and pumped (or otherwise forced) through a preformed die and then cooled into a specific shape that is dependent on the shape of the die. The process of co-extrusion is similar, except that multiple extruders pump more than one material through different portions of a die forming a final product. In addition, operators can extrude a material onto a primary product as an additional overall layer or coating. Alternately, material can be placed in a predetermined defined area of the die, such as, for example, in a stripe or a sequentially alternating material pattern. In the context of thermoplastics for use in medical device applications, many different types of plastics can be extruded into tubing or cylindrical type shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Using a co-extrusion process, depending on among other things the materials used, the resulting products can have very different physical performance characteristics. For example, depending on the materials combined, the resulting product can be soft or hard, clear or opaque, and with varying flexibility along the length thereof. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, reference number <b>32</b> represents a co-extruded material of guidewire <b>20</b>. Co-extruded material <b>32</b> can comprise any of a variety of thermoplastic materials selected based on the resulting features of pushability, kink resistance, torqueability, and flexibility (for example, by selection of particular durometer for material <b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">During a manufacturing procedure, an unground wire forming the base for core wire <b>11</b> can be extruded through one portion of a die, while material <b>32</b> is extruded through another portion of the die (or through a separate die used in combination with a die for the unground wire material). Alternatively, the core wire <b>11</b> could be provided as a stock material onto which material <b>32</b> is then extruded, without any portion of wire <b>11</b> passing through a die. The resulting product of this co-extrusion is a structure where material <b>32</b> hardens to form a layer surrounding the underlying unground base core wire <b>11</b>, thereby forming the core wire assembly <b>10</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a distal portion of the material <b>32</b> can be tapered to provide stiffness transition leading to a more flexible distal portion of guidewire <b>20</b>. The taper results in a tapered portion <b>34</b> along the material <b>32</b>. The taper can be formed through a buffing or tipping process, such as those used in conventional catheter forming processes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is contemplated that the coating provided along the distal portion <b>22</b> and the intermediate portion <b>24</b> may also be a co-extruded material. For example, the co-extrusion may include a first material <b>28</b> formed of an outer layer of &#x201c;Black Tecothane&#x201d; having a certain amount (e.g., approximately 60%) of radiopaque filler material (e.g., tungsten), thereby providing the benefits of a radiopaque material that can be detected via imaging devices. In addition, where co-extruded, the combined coating can be provided with an inner melt liner <b>29</b> that exists in a liquid state when heated to a predetermined temperature and then transitions to a solid state upon cooling a certain relative amount. This melt liner (e.g., depicted as item <b>29</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>) fills all the gaps and irregularities of the core wire. Exemplary materials for use as the inner melt liner include, but are not limited to, EVA (Ethyl Vinyl Acetate) or LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene) materials.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The materials for items <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> may be selected to exhibit a lower durometer than that of the material selected for co-extruded material <b>32</b>. In this manner, the guidewire characteristics of pushability, kink resistance, torqueability, and flexibility may be controlled such that the distal portion of guide wire exhibits greater flexibility than the proximal portion. For example, the material properties of items <b>28</b> and <b>29</b> may work in combination with the tapered portion <b>34</b> along the material <b>32</b> to provide an intermediate stiffness transition zone between a more flexible distal and a more rigid proximal end.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Due to the wide range of materials available for extrusion (and the differing physical characteristics for those materials), in addition to the ability to precisely control stiffness and flexibility via tapering along the guidewire <b>20</b>, the guidewire <b>20</b> can be provided without a wrapped coil along its length. The elimination of a coil further reduces cost and manufacturing time as compared with prior art guidewires. In addition, the elimination of a wrapped coil is of further benefit since current designs featuring stainless steel coil outer layers can cause a guidewire to hang up in tortuous anatomical conditions due to gaps or ledges created along the guidewire from the coil.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, another benefit of the co-extrusion formation process for guidewire <b>20</b> is the capability to form distinct cross-section profiles for the shape of material <b>32</b> surrounding the base wire <b>11</b> of core wire assembly <b>10</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of the guidewire <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> taken along line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As one example, the cross-sectional shape of co-extruded material <b>32</b> is a star shaped pattern forming a predetermined number of fins <b>16</b> alternating between troughs <b>18</b> along an exterior perimeter of material <b>32</b>. A wide range of shapes (e.g., including, but not limited to, rectangular, triangular, or any other polygon cross-sectional shape) could be provided along the exterior perimeter of material <b>32</b> depending on the predetermined shape of the extrusion die.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the exterior perimeter of material <b>32</b> (forming a star shape in the illustrated example) can be covered with a snug lubricous friction reducing polymer coating <b>30</b>, such as, for example, a heat shrink PTFE (polyyetrafluoroethylene) coating. In the distally directed cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the distally spaced circular shape of polymeric coating <b>28</b> is visible with the core wire <b>11</b>, material <b>32</b>, and polymer coating <b>28</b> shown in cross-hatched lines depicting a cross-section. As an alternative to the illustrated star cross-section pattern, guidewire profiles could be manufactured to dictate the bend direction of the guidewire. For example, sections or grooves could be cut into the plastic portion of the core wire for this purpose. Such grooves or sections could be provided along particular portions of the guidewire such that a resulting guidewire cross section exhibits a particular desired moment of inertia relative to other portions of the guidewire in order to control bending or flexibility in one direction or another.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The illustrated star pattern for material <b>32</b> (and its polymeric covering <b>30</b>) is advantageous in that it provides a profile along a portion of the guide wire having a reduced area along the guidewire perimeter that is susceptible to contact with an internal surface of a working channel in an endoscope. In other words, due to the troughs <b>18</b> along an exterior perimeter of material <b>32</b>, less area is capable of contact within an internal surface of a working channel in an endoscope. Accordingly, the configuration results in reduced friction during movement of the guidewire <b>20</b> within a endoscope working channel. In addition, the material displaced by the formation of the troughs <b>18</b> along an exterior perimeter of guidewire <b>20</b> allows more area for fluid flow or additional treatment instruments within a working channel.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a perspective view of a core wire assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; for use with a guidewire. Core wire assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; illustrates further options for controlling flexibility and other guidewire performance characteristics. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a core wire assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; having a distal portion <b>12</b>&#x2032; and a proximal portion <b>14</b>&#x2032;. An underlying core wire <b>11</b>&#x2032; is provided as a base component of the core wire assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;. Similar to the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, core wire assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; includes a co-extruded material <b>32</b>&#x2032; formed along a proximal portion of the core wire assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;. The co-extruded material <b>32</b>&#x2032; forms an exterior configuration having a plurality of fins <b>16</b>&#x2032; alternately arranged between a plurality of troughs <b>18</b>&#x2032;. The material <b>32</b>&#x2032; can form a star shaped pattern along the exterior surface of proximal portion <b>14</b>&#x2032;. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the fins <b>16</b>&#x2032; and troughs <b>18</b>&#x2032; are provided in a twisted configuration to exhibit a spiral star shaped pattern. The spiral star pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> could be twisted to at any given pitch in order to provide any predetermined flexibility to the core wire assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is depicted a side view a portion of a guidewire <b>50</b>, according to another embodiment of the invention. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> cross-section, the guidewire <b>50</b> includes an unground core wire <b>52</b>, a distal portion <b>54</b>, and a proximal portion <b>56</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>, instead of including a co-extruded material <b>32</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, an unground core wire <b>52</b> is wrapped or cabled with wound wire along the proximal portion <b>56</b> of guidewire <b>50</b>. Just as in the embodiments described above, the core wire <b>52</b> of guidewire <b>50</b> can be unground, extend substantially the entire length of the guidewire <b>50</b>, and be comprised of a various metallic materials, including, but not limited to, stainless steel (including 400 series stainless steel), titanium (including titanium Ti-Beta # alloys), metallic alloys of nickel/titanium (commonly referred to as nitinol), copper, cobalt, vanadium, chromium, iron, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An inner polymer layer <b>61</b> (such as, e.g., PTFE or Polyimide) is provided over the core wire <b>52</b>. Then a proximal portion of core wire <b>52</b> and the inner polymer layer <b>61</b> are wrapped with a wire <b>58</b>. An additional, outer polymer layer <b>64</b> is then provided over wrapped wire <b>58</b>, thereby sandwiching the wire <b>58</b> between the inner <b>61</b> and outer <b>64</b> polymer layers. For purposes of explanation, a portion of the outer polymer layer <b>64</b> is omitted from the proximal end of the guide wire <b>50</b>, thereby depicting an exposed portion of the wrapped wire <b>58</b>. It should be understood that the outer layer <b>64</b> may extend proximally to the terminal proximal end of guide wire <b>50</b>. The proximal portion of the core wire <b>52</b>, wrapped with wire <b>58</b>, controls the performance characteristics of pushability, kink resistance, torqueability, and flexibility. The wire <b>58</b> terminates a certain distance before the distal end of the inner polymer layer <b>61</b>, thereby exposing a length <b>63</b> of the inner polymer layer <b>61</b> beyond the wire <b>58</b>. This configuration provides more of an intermediate transition between a more stiff proximal arrangement to a more flexible arrangement at the distal end. Exemplary materials for the inner <b>61</b> and outer <b>64</b> polymers include, but are not limited to, various thermoplastic materials, such as, silicone, vinyl, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon, acrylic, styrene, polycarbonate, and fluoropolymers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Just as described above for an alternate arrangement at a distal portion of the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is also contemplated that a coating provided along the distal portion <b>54</b> may be a co-extruded material. For example, the co-extrusion for may include a first, outer layer <b>62</b> of &#x201c;Black Tecothane&#x201d; having a certain amount (e.g., approximately 60%) of a radiopaque filler material (e.g., tungsten), thereby providing the benefits of a radiopaque material detectable via imaging devices. In addition, where co-extruded, the first layer <b>62</b> can be combined with an inner melt liner <b>60</b> covering a distal portion of wire <b>58</b>, the exposed length <b>63</b> of the inner polymer layer <b>61</b>, and the distal portion of the core wire <b>52</b>. In other words, the melt liner <b>60</b> is provided between the outer layer <b>62</b> and the core wire <b>52</b> along a distal portion of the guide wire <b>50</b>. The melt liner material <b>60</b> exists in a liquid state when heated to a predetermined temperature and then transitions to a solid state upon cooling down a certain relative amount. This melt liner <b>60</b> fills all the gaps and irregularities of the core wire. Exemplary materials for use as the inner melt liner include, but are not limited to, EVA (Ethyl Vinyl Acetate) or LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene) materials.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Just as described above regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>, the materials for items <b>62</b> and <b>60</b> may be selected to provide greater flexibility at the distal end of the guide wire. In this manner, the guidewire characteristics of pushability, kink resistance, torqueability, and flexibility may be controlled such that the distal portion of guide wire exhibits greater flexibility than the proximal portion.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>, there is a transition zone in the region where the exterior surface of the guide wire <b>50</b> transitions between that of the outer layer <b>62</b> and that of the outer polymer layer <b>64</b>. In one embodiment, a portion of the outer polymer layer <b>64</b> may be removed from a distal portion of the wrapped wire <b>58</b>. This reduced diameter distal portion of the wrapped wire <b>58</b> is then coated with a proximal portion of the co-extruded material (i.e., the co-extruded material comprised of outer layer <b>61</b> and the inner melt liner <b>60</b>) described above. The co-extruded material may provide an outer diameter substantially equal to that of the outer polymer layer <b>64</b> such that the guide wire exhibits a relatively constant outer diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the guidewire of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> taken along line <b>8</b>-<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. For purposes of clarity, however, the wound wire <b>58</b> is not depicted in cross-section. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the wrapping of wire <b>58</b> over the inner polymer layer <b>61</b> and around the proximal portion of core wire <b>52</b> can be customized to produce any variety of flexibility and/or stiffness along guidewire <b>50</b>. At the distal portion of the guidewire <b>50</b> where the wire <b>58</b> terminates, melt liner <b>60</b> and outer layer <b>62</b> provide a stiffness transition element along a distal portion of the guidewire to shift to a more flexible distal end from a more stiff proximal end. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref>, the wrapped wire <b>58</b> can be provided over an unground core <b>52</b>. Accordingly, the use of the wrapped wire is advantageous in that the wrapping can be customized in order to provide a wide range of performance characteristics to the guidewire, without requiring the costly procedure of machining a core with a center-less grinder.</p>
