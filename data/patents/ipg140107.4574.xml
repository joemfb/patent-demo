<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is related to U.S. patent application Ser No. 12/464,843 entitled Pulse Edge Demodulation and filed on May 12, 2009, which issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,284,830 on Oct. 9, 2012.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for the pulse edge modulation of digital carrier signals for communications systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an implantable battery powered biomedical device, the size and mass of the battery and the associated integrated circuits, as well as other passive components may not allow such a system to be directly attached to body parts, such as nerve bundles and cortices, directly. As a result, the implantable device may be separated into two units: a remote unit and a main unit. The remote unit may include microelectrode arrays with lighter mass and smaller size and may attach to the body parts where sensing of biosignals or stimulation of the nerves are actually applied. The main unit may have a greater mass and larger size and may be placed at a location inside the body suitable for mounting the larger unit. When an implantable device is separated into a remote and main unit, problems can arise in transmitting power and data between the remote unit and the main unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems and method for pulse edge modulation of digital carrier signals for communications systems are described which are useful in body implanted electronics. A digital carrier signal is generated by a main system. The carrier is pulse edge modulated with digital data. The modulated signal is sent from a main system to a remote system over a first set of transmission lines (downlink). The modulated signal can be a multiphase signal used to transmit power and data to the remote unit from the main unit. The modulated signal is demodulated by the remote system to obtain the transmitted digital data. The remote system sends data to the main system over a second set of transmission lines (uplink), during time periods when the modulated signal sent by the main system to the remote system is in a steady state, thus minimizing interference between the downlink and uplink transmissions.</p>

The term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; means a direct connection between items, an indirect connection through one or more intermediaries, or communication between items in a manner that may not constitute a physical connection. The term &#x201c;circuit&#x201d; can mean a single component or a plurality of components, active and/or passive, discrete or integrated, that are coupled together to provide a desired function. The term &#x201c;signal&#x201d; means at least one current, voltage, charge, data, or other such identifiable quantity.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A multiphase signal is defined as a set of digital signals with the individual signal components having spaced phase differences and a monotonic increase of phase when going from one signal to the next one.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary communications system <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>100</b> includes a main unit <b>110</b> and a remote unit <b>150</b> that are coupled together by a first set of transmission lines <b>121</b> and a second set transmission lines <b>171</b>. The first set of transmission lines <b>121</b> has G conductors, where G is an integer of at least 2. Transmission line <b>121</b> is used to transmit (downlink) a pulse edge modulated signal (herein: PEM) from downlink transmitter <b>120</b> in main unit <b>110</b> to the downlink receiver <b>160</b> in remote unit <b>150</b>. The second set of transmission lines <b>171</b> has H conductors, where H is an integer of at least 2. Transmission line <b>171</b> is used to transmit (uplink) serial communications signals from uplink transmitter <b>170</b> in remote unit <b>150</b> to uplink receiver <b>130</b> in main unit <b>110</b>. In other embodiments, such as the those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the first set <b>121</b> of transmission lines can be used to transmit a multiphase signal including DC power using three conductors from main unit <b>110</b> to remote unit <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an implanted biomedical system, transmission or signal lines <b>121</b> and <b>171</b> between the main and remote units can be formed into a wire bundle that is connected between main unit <b>110</b> and remote unit <b>150</b>. The number of wires between main <b>110</b> and remote <b>150</b> systems should be minimized to reduce the size and weight of the wire bundle. The wire bundle of system <b>100</b> has at least 4 conductors. System <b>100</b> can include a reduced number of wires that transmit power and data signals safely using AC coupled signals. For example, the wire bundle in the embodiment of the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> includes five wires.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">For safety reasons, the wires that carry data and power signals between implanted biomedical systems, such as, units <b>110</b> and <b>150</b> should not carry DC power, but should carry AC coupled signals to prevent any damage to adjacent tissue, which could occur if there were any leakage of DC current into the surrounding tissue. Commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,439,821 discloses a system for transmitting DC power from a main to a remote system using a multiphase signal. U.S. Pat. No. 7,439,821 is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The discussion below of the various timing, block and process diagrams refer to various examples and embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating digital carrier signal <b>210</b>, digital data input <b>220</b> and pulse edge modulated signal <b>230</b>, in a system or process for modulation according to an embodiment of the present invention. Digital data <b>220</b> is an input to a PEM modulator. Modulated signal <b>230</b> is the output of a PEM modulator. Modulated signal <b>230</b> is generated by the pulse edge modulation of carrier <b>210</b> with digital data bits <b>222</b> and <b>223</b>. Digital carrier signal (herein: carrier) <b>210</b> is either generated within a PEM modulator or is provided by another source in a transmitter. Carrier <b>210</b> is a pulse stream with a predetermined pattern, a square wave, such as a clock, where the time interval between successive transition edges is a fixed constant time interval. Pulse edge modulation (PEM) of carrier <b>210</b> uses data <b>220</b> to generate modulated signal <b>230</b> by moving each edge of carrier <b>210</b> relative to its original position in time, depending on the value of the digital bit to be modulated on that edge. In the PEM system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a digital bit state of &#x201c;0&#x201d; results in delaying an edge by a first amount of time, e.g., a fixed time interval. A digital bit state of &#x201c;1&#x201d; results in advancing an edge by a second amount of time, e.g., a fixed time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other embodiments, a PEM system can also modulate in the reverse of the above, by delaying an edge by a fixed time interval in response to a digital bit state of &#x201c;1&#x201d; and by advancing an edge by a fixed time interval in response to a digital bit state of &#x201c;0&#x201d;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the first and second amounts of time are equal. In other embodiments, the first and second amounts of time can be unequal. In some embodiments, the first and second amounts of time can both delay edges, but by different amounts of time. In other embodiments, the first and second amounts of time can both advance edges, but by different amounts of time.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should also be noted that pulse edge modulation as shown in this and subsequent figures applies to both rising and falling edges of a carrier.

Carrier <b>310</b> is a pulse stream. Edge <b>331</b> of modulated signal <b>330</b> is used as a timing reference to mark the start of frame <b>341</b>. Edge <b>331</b> can also be understood as a frame synchronizing edge, since it marks the start of frame <b>341</b>. Frame <b>341</b> of modulated signal <b>330</b> includes start of frame reference edge <b>331</b> and modulated edges <b>332</b>-<b>336</b> corresponding to data word <b>342</b> made of five data bits <b>322</b>-<b>326</b>. Modulated signal <b>330</b> is generated by the pulse edge modulation of carrier <b>310</b> with digital data bits, such as <b>322</b>-<b>326</b>, <b>328</b>, etc. Each edge <b>312</b>-<b>316</b> of carrier <b>310</b> is modulated by each respective value of digital bits <b>322</b>-<b>326</b> to produce modulated edges <b>332</b>-<b>336</b> of modulated signal <b>330</b>.

Each frame synchronizing edge, such as <b>331</b>, can be used by remote unit <b>150</b> as a timing reference to generate a local clock.

The timing diagram illustrates clock <b>410</b>, downlink multiphase signal <b>470</b> made of three phases: first phase <b>420</b>, second phase <b>430</b> and a third phase <b>440</b>, digital data bits <b>461</b>-<b>465</b> and uplink signal <b>450</b>. Frame <b>480</b> of the transmitted signal <b>470</b> includes unmodulated edge <b>421</b> and modulated edges <b>431</b>, <b>441</b>, <b>422</b>, <b>432</b> and <b>442</b>. Signal <b>470</b> is transmitted from main unit <b>110</b> to remote unit <b>150</b> over a transmission line, such as <b>121</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but with three conductors. Frame synchronization edge <b>421</b> is a start of frame edge for frame <b>480</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Clock <b>410</b> is generated in main unit <b>110</b>, and is not transmitted to remote unit <b>150</b>. A similar clock signal can be recovered from the multiphase signal <b>470</b> received by remote unit <b>150</b>. In the main unit <b>110</b>, an unmodulated multiphase signal (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is generated and is pulse edge modulated by data <b>415</b> consisting of digital data bits <b>461</b>-<b>465</b> and results in modulated signal <b>470</b>. Signal <b>470</b> includes signals <b>420</b>, <b>430</b> and <b>440</b>. The unmodulated multiphase signal is a set of square wave carriers and can be generated from clock <b>410</b>, so that each edge of the unmodulated multiphase signal is coincident with a respective edge of the clock in main unit <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each phase of the unmodulated multiphase signal is equally spaced and separated by a 120 degree phase difference. As discussed previously and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,439,821, a multiphase signal can be used to transmit DC power from the main unit <b>110</b> to the remote unit <b>150</b>, without risking possible damage to surrounding tissue, which could occur, if DC power were sent over a set of transmission lines and some leakage of the DC power to surrounding tissue took place. Although illustrated as three phases, any other number of phases may also be employed (e.g., 2 phases, 4 phases, 5 phases, etc.) without departing from the present invention. The number of lines in transmission line <b>121</b> used to transmit the downlink signal from main unit <b>110</b> to remote unit <b>150</b> is equal to the number of phases of the modulated signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first edge <b>421</b> of the first phase <b>420</b> is unmodulated and used as a timing reference edge or a start of frame edge. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, start of frame edge <b>421</b> is aligned with the rising edge of clock pulse <b>2</b> in time interval <b>411</b>. The original, unmodulated position of edge <b>431</b> is aligned with the rising edge of pulse <b>2</b> in time interval <b>412</b>. If the value of digital data bit <b>461</b>=&#x201c;0&#x201d;, then edge <b>431</b> is modulated by retarding edge <b>431</b> by a fixed amount of time, e.g., half a clock cycle, and is aligned with the falling edge of clock pulse <b>1</b> in time interval <b>412</b>. If the value of digital data bit <b>461</b>=&#x201c;1&#x201d;, then edge <b>431</b> is modulated by advancing edge <b>431</b> by a fixed amount of time, e.g., half a clock cycle, and is aligned with the falling edge of clock pulse <b>2</b> in time interval <b>412</b>. Thus, modulated edge <b>431</b> is aligned with either the falling edge of clock pulse <b>1</b> or the falling edge of clock pulse <b>2</b> in time interval <b>412</b>, depending on the value of digital bit <b>461</b>. Similarly, each of edges <b>441</b>, <b>422</b>, <b>432</b> and <b>442</b> are either retarded or advanced relative to their original timing, depending on the value of data bits <b>462</b>, <b>463</b>, <b>464</b> and <b>465</b>. Five bits of data can be transmitted per cycle of the downlink signal <b>470</b> in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a general case, <b>470</b> can be modulated by N digital data bits, where N is an integer greater than one and in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, N=5. After the next unmodulated timing reference edge or frame synchronization edge is transmitted, another N modulated edges are transmitted and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The remote <b>150</b> transmits uplink signal <b>450</b> from the remote <b>150</b> to the main unit <b>110</b> over a second set of transmission lines, such as <b>171</b>. Transmission lines <b>121</b> and <b>171</b> between the main unit <b>110</b> and the remote <b>150</b> are in the same wire bundle. The uplink signal <b>450</b> is a serial link transmission, of which there are many suitable types, such as a LVDS (low voltage differential signaling) signal. If <b>470</b> is used to transmit power and data to remote unit <b>150</b>, then uplink signal <b>450</b> can be much smaller in amplitude than multiphase signal <b>470</b>, since <b>450</b> is used only to transmit data. In order to avoid interference caused by transitions of multiphase downlink signal <b>470</b>, the uplink signal <b>450</b> is not sent during periods <b>451</b> when any phase of the multiphase signal <b>470</b> is in transition. If uplink signal <b>450</b> is sent on <b>171</b> during time periods <b>451</b>, the uplink signal <b>450</b> can be subject to signal interference, crosstalk, ground bounce, or other adverse transient effects due to the proximity of transmission line <b>121</b> to transmission line <b>171</b>, which could result in invalid data. By not transmitting data during periods <b>451</b>, reception errors due to interference from the <b>470</b> signals on transmission line <b>121</b> are minimized. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, time periods <b>451</b> are each two clock cycles in length because the downlink signal can transition during either the first or second clock cycle depending on the state of each digital data bit <b>461</b>-<b>465</b> (logic 0 or logic 1).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a three-phase signal that is modulated by a single bit of data in a window of two clock cycles at each transition of the downlink signal <b>470</b>, except for the unmodulated edge <b>421</b>. Alternative embodiments can utilize another arbitrary number of phases (two or more) with a different number of signal lines. For example in a four-phase system, four signal lines are utilized where the transmitted multiphase signals are arranged ninety degrees (90&#xb0;) apart, with seven (7) bits of data encoded in the edge transitions of one frame. Similarly, a five-phase system can utilize five signal lines with transmitted multiphase signals arranged seventy-two (72&#xb0;) degrees apart and nine (9) bits of data encoded in the edge transitions of one frame. Other embodiments can utilize any number of appropriate signal lines in a transmission line, and any number N of data bits per frame as may be designed for a particular system, where N is an integer greater than one.</p>

Edge <b>511</b>, when pulse edge modulated, is temporally displaced in time, either to retard edge <b>511</b> to position <b>513</b> or <b>515</b> or to advance edge <b>511</b> to position <b>517</b> or <b>519</b>, depending on which digital binary bit state is being modulated onto edge <b>511</b>. Temporal displacement time intervals <b>512</b> and <b>516</b> are equal in time interval and time intervals <b>514</b> and <b>518</b> are also equal in time interval, but in other embodiments, they can be unequal. Since modulation of edge <b>511</b> can reposition <b>511</b> to four possible time positions, then multi-bit modulation of edge <b>511</b> is facilitated. Each of the four possible locations can, for example, map to binary data states of 00, 01, 10 and 11. In a system using PEM, the more possible locations available for the modulation of an edge, the more binary states can be modulated using that edge of a carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows various methods of modulating falling edge <b>521</b> of carrier <b>520</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, except that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is for a falling edge of a carrier. Edge <b>521</b>, when pulse edge modulated, is temporally displaced in time, either to retard edge <b>521</b> to position <b>523</b> or <b>525</b> or to advance edge <b>521</b> to position <b>527</b> or <b>529</b>, depending on which digital binary bit state is being modulated onto edge <b>521</b>.

Digital signal A is a pulse train signal which is input to delay <b>810</b> and is delayed by a fixed time interval <b>821</b>, resulting in carrier signal B. Carrier signal B is connected to the input of delay <b>820</b> and signal B is delayed by a fixed time interval <b>822</b>. Time intervals <b>821</b> and <b>822</b> are equal in time duration. Signals A, B and C are timing reference signals connected to signal selector switch <b>830</b>. The inputs to signal selector switch <b>830</b> include digital data <b>801</b> and frame timing <b>805</b>. Carrier signal B is a pulse train waveform. Relative to the edges of carrier B, the edges of digital signal A are retarded in time by time interval <b>821</b>. Relative to the edges of carrier B, the edges of digital signal C are advanced in time by time interval <b>822</b>. The low to high transition of frame timing pulse <b>805</b> is used by switch <b>830</b> to switch edge B<b>1</b> of signal B to the output as part of output signal <b>811</b>. Edge B<b>1</b> is switched to the output <b>811</b> as edge <b>812</b>. Since edge <b>812</b> of output <b>811</b> is not modulated, then edge <b>812</b> is a frame start or frame synchronization edge. Alternatively, a high to low transition of frame signal <b>805</b> can be used to notify switch <b>830</b>, so that the next transition of the output signal <b>811</b> should not be modulated, since it is a start of frame edge.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The next digital data bit <b>802</b> determines the operation of switch <b>830</b>. If data bit <b>802</b> is a &#x201c;0&#x201d;, then switch <b>830</b> selects the next edge A<b>2</b> of signal A. With edge A<b>2</b> switched to the output <b>811</b>, then edge <b>814</b> becomes part of the output signal <b>811</b>. Edge <b>814</b> is retarded in time compared to the unmodulated position of edge <b>813</b> and represents digital data bit=&#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If data bit <b>802</b> is a digital &#x201c;1&#x201d;, then switch <b>830</b> selects the next edge C<b>2</b> of signal C as part of output signal <b>811</b>. With edge C<b>2</b> switched to the output <b>811</b>, then edge <b>815</b> becomes part of output signal <b>811</b>. Edge <b>815</b> is advanced in time compared to the unmodulated position of edge <b>813</b> and represents digital data bit=&#x201c;1&#x201d;. The subsequent digital data bits after <b>802</b> will modulate subsequent edges of the output signal <b>811</b>, until the end of that frame of modulated signal <b>811</b>. The next low to high (or alternatively high to low) transition of frame signal <b>805</b> will result in switch <b>830</b> switching edge B<b>5</b> of signal B to the output signal <b>811</b> as unmodulated edge <b>816</b> and the start of the next frame.</p>

The N timing references edges TREF(<b>1</b>)-TREF(N) of the recovered carrier are points in time representing the positions of the respective modulated edges M-EDGE(<b>1</b>) . . . M-EDGE(N), prior to modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">From block <b>1301</b>, flow proceeds to block <b>1302</b> and frame synchronization edge EDGE(<b>0</b>) is detected. Frame synchronization edge EDGE(<b>0</b>) is an unmodulated edge of the modulated signal. From block <b>1302</b>, flow proceeds to block <b>1303</b> and edge counter K is set equal to 1. The edge counter K is used by process <b>1300</b> to keep track of which edge M-EDGE(i) is being demodulated. From <b>1303</b>, flow proceeds to block <b>1305</b>, and the first of the N edges, M-EDGE(<b>1</b>), of the modulated signal is selected to be demodulated. From block <b>1304</b>, flow proceeds to block <b>1305</b>, and the temporal displacement of the first modulated edge M-EDGE(<b>1</b>) is evaluated. The timing of M-EDGE(<b>1</b>) is compared to the timing of its respective TREF(<b>1</b>). If the difference in time between M-EDGE(<b>1</b>) and TREF(<b>1</b>) is equal to a first displacement in time, then flow proceeds to block <b>1306</b>. A first displacement in time can be equal to a retarding in time of a modulated edge, such as, the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, where modulated edge <b>333</b> is retarded prior to recovered carrier edge <b>353</b>. If the difference in time between M-EDGE(<b>1</b>) and TREF(<b>1</b>) is equal to a second displacement in time, then flow proceeds to block <b>1307</b>. A second displacement in time can be equal to an advancing in time of a modulated edge, such as, the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, where modulated edge <b>332</b> is advanced in time with respect to recovered carrier edge <b>352</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In block <b>1306</b>, the value of DATA(<b>1</b>) is set to the value that corresponds to a first displacement of the modulated edge EDGE(<b>1</b>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a first displacement, i.e., a retarding in time of a modulated edge, corresponds to a digital data bit=&#x201c;0&#x201d;. In block <b>1307</b>, the value of DATA(<b>1</b>) is set to the value that corresponds to a second displacement of the modulated edge EDGE(<b>1</b>). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a second displacement, i.e., an advancing in time of a modulated edge, corresponds to a digital data bit=&#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">After blocks <b>1306</b> and <b>1307</b>, flow proceeds to block <b>1308</b> and the edge counter K is incremented by 1. From block <b>1308</b>, flow proceeds to block <b>1309</b>, and the value of K is compared with the value of N. If the value of K is greater than N, then all N edges of the modulated signal have been demodulated. If the value of K is less than or equal to N, then flow proceeds back to block <b>1304</b> and the next M-EDGE(K) of the modulated signal is demodulated and an output is generated with a digital data value of DATA(K). Process <b>1300</b> continues in this loop until the process ends when all N edges of the modulated signal have been demodulated.</p>
