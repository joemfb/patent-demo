<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to an alarm system, and especially to an alarm system for producing an alarm as an object is getting physically close to the system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A machine tool is a powered mechanical device, typically used to fabricate metal components by the selective removal of metal. The term machine tool is usually reserved for tools that use a power source other than human movement, but the power source can be human if appropriately set up. Many historians of technology consider that the true machine tools were born when direct human involvement was removed from the shaping or stamping processes of the different kinds of tools. When the machine tool starts shaping or stamping, people may unthinkingly or enthusiastically get close to the machine tool and put themselves in danger of injury.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, in the lack of an effective proximity alarm, there is a room for improvement in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of an alarm system for producing an alarm when a distance from an object (not shown) is less than a threshold distance, includes a signal generating circuit <b>100</b>, a distance detecting circuit <b>200</b>, a gate circuit <b>300</b>, a voltage conversion circuit <b>400</b>, a distance judging circuit <b>500</b> and an alarm circuit <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The signal generating circuit <b>100</b> generates a first signal. The distance detecting circuit <b>200</b> receives the first signal and detects a distance between the object and the alarm system, and it outputs a second signal and a third signal according to a predetermined plurality of distances.

The alarm circuit <b>600</b> receives the control signal and produces the alarm when the distance between the object and the alarm system is less than the threshold distance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the signal generating circuit <b>100</b> includes a first operational amplifier U<b>1</b>, an crystal oscillator X, a first resistor R<b>1</b> and a first capacitor C<b>1</b>.

The first operational amplifier non-inverting input terminal is grounded via the first resistor R<b>1</b>. The first operational amplifier inverting input terminal is grounded via the first capacitor C<b>1</b>. The first operational amplifier non-inverting input terminal is electrically connected to the first operational amplifier output terminal via the crystal oscillator X.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The distance detecting circuit <b>200</b> includes a second operational amplifier U<b>2</b>, a third operational amplifier U<b>3</b>, a metal slice <b>201</b>, a bead F, a second resistor R<b>2</b>, a third resistor R<b>3</b>, a fourth resistor R<b>4</b> and a second capacitor C<b>2</b>. The second operational amplifier U<b>2</b> includes a second operational amplifier non-inverting input terminal, a second operational amplifier inverting input terminal and a second operational amplifier output terminal. The third operational amplifier U<b>3</b> includes a third operational amplifier non-inverting input terminal, a third operational amplifier inverting input terminal and a third operational amplifier output terminal. The bead F includes a bead first terminal and a bead second terminal. The fourth resistor R<b>4</b> includes a fourth resistor first terminal and a fourth resistor second terminal. The second capacitor C<b>2</b> includes a second capacitor first terminal and a second capacitor second terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The second operational amplifier non-inverting input terminal is electrically connected to the bead first terminal via the second resistor R<b>2</b>. The bead second terminal is electrically connected to the metal slice <b>201</b> to detect the distance between the object and the alarm system. The second operational amplifier non-inverting input terminal is electrically connected to the second capacitor first terminal via the second resistor R<b>2</b>. The second capacitor second terminal is grounded. The third operational amplifier non-inverting input terminal is electrically connected to the fourth resistor first terminal via the third resistor R<b>3</b>. The fourth resistor second terminal is electrically connected to a first connection point between the bead F and the second resistor R<b>2</b>. The third operational amplifier non-inverting input terminal is electrically connected to the first operational amplifier output terminal via the third resistor R<b>3</b>. The third operational amplifier inverting input terminal is electrically connected to the second operational amplifier inverting input terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The gate circuit <b>300</b> includes an Exclusive OR logic chip U<b>4</b>. The Exclusive OR logic chip U<b>4</b> includes a first input terminal P<b>1</b>, a second input terminal P<b>2</b> and an Exclusive OR logic chip output terminal P<b>3</b>. The first input terminal P<b>1</b> is electrically connected to the second operational amplifier output terminal. The second input terminal P<b>2</b> is electrically connected to the third operational amplifier output terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The voltage conversion circuit <b>400</b> includes a fifth resistor R<b>5</b> and a third capacitor C<b>3</b>. The fifth resistor R<b>5</b> includes a fifth resistor first terminal and a fifth resistor second terminal. The fifth resistor first terminal is electrically connected to the Exclusive OR logic chip output terminal P<b>3</b>. The fifth resistor second terminal is grounded via the third capacitor C<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The distance judging circuit <b>500</b> includes a comparator U<b>5</b> and a variable resistor RP. The comparator U<b>5</b> includes a comparator non-inverting input terminal, a comparator inverting input terminal and a comparator output terminal. The variable resistor RP includes a variable resistor first terminal, a variable resistor second terminal and a variable resistor adjust terminal. The comparator non-inverting input terminal is electrically connected to a second connection point between the fifth resistor R<b>5</b> and the third capacitor C<b>3</b>. The comparator inverting input terminal is electrically connected to the variable resistor adjust terminal. The variable resistor first terminal receives a +5 volts first DC voltage. The variable resistor second terminal is grounded. The comparator output terminal outputs the control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In use, when the metal slice <b>201</b> detects that the object is getting close to the alarm system, a dynamic capacitance (dynamic capacitor) is formed between the object and the metal slice <b>201</b>. The capacitance of the dynamic capacitor increases as the distance between the object and the alarm system decreases. The dynamic capacitor and the second capacitor C<b>2</b> form a parallel capacitor. The capacitance of this parallel capacitor increases as the capacitance of the dynamic capacitor increases. The fourth resistor R<b>4</b>, the parallel capacitor and the metal slice <b>201</b> form a delay circuit at the second operational amplifier non-inverting input terminal. The first signal generated by the signal generating circuit <b>100</b> is delayed by the delay circuit and input into the second operational amplifier U<b>2</b>. The first signal generated by the signal generating circuit <b>100</b> is also input into the third operational amplifier U<b>3</b> but without being delayed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">There is a phase difference between the second signal from the second operational amplifier output terminal and the third signal from the third operational amplifier output terminal. The first input terminal P<b>1</b> and the second input terminal P<b>2</b> have different signal inputs and the Exclusive OR logic chip output terminal P<b>3</b> outputs a high voltage level signal. The voltage conversion circuit <b>400</b> converts the high voltage level signal to a linear DC voltage. A duty cycle of the high voltage level signal increases as the phase difference between the second signal and the third signal increases. Therefore the duty cycle of the high voltage level signal and the linear DC voltage increase as the distance between the object and the alarm system decreases. The +5 volts first DC voltage generates the reference voltage at the comparator inverting input terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">If the linear DC voltage is greater than the reference voltage, the comparator output terminal outputs a high voltage level control signal to drive the alarm circuit <b>600</b> to produce the alarm. In one embodiment, a resistance of the variable resistor RP can be adjusted by the variable resistor adjust terminal to adjust the reference voltage and therefore the threshold distance. The alarm circuit <b>600</b> can emit light or make a sound in producing the alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages have been set forth in the foregoing description of the preferred embodiments, together with details of the structures and functions of the preferred embodiments, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and the arrangement of parts within the principles of the disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
