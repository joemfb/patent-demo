<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a charged particle beam writing apparatus configured to write a pattern on a substrate such as a wafer, a mask, or a reticle by using a plurality of charged particle beams.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With an advancement in semiconductor production technology achieved in recent years, a great reduction in circuit pattern size and a great increase in integration density have been achieved. In such a situation, there is a great need for an increase in throughput to achieve higher productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is also a need for higher throughput in direct writing technology, which is a technique to directly write a pattern on a substrate using a charged particle beam and which is one of candidates for next-generation lithography technology.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To meet the above requirement in charged particle beam writing apparatuses, there is a trend toward increasing an area that can be irradiated with a charged particle beam at a time. An example of the charged particle beam writing technique is a point beam technique in which a charged particle beam generated in the form of a point in cross section is used. Another example is a variable rectangular beam technique in which a charged particle beam generated in the form of a variable rectangle in cross section is used. However, it is clear that these techniques are not suitable for mass production because they do not provide a high throughput in writing fine patterns with a high density. In another technique known as a cell projection technique, a particular pattern that appears frequently is written using a charged particle beam formed in a shape corresponding to the particular pattern using a cell mask. This technique is effective in particular for semiconductor circuits such as memory circuits in which the same pattern appears periodically. However, for semiconductor circuits such as logic circuits having patterns with low periodicity, it is necessary to prepare a cell mask for a large number of different patterns, which is practically difficult to achieve.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve the above problems, a particle beam writing apparatus of a multibeam type has been proposed (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-267221, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-319532, and Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-116743). In the charged particle beam writing apparatus of this type, a substrate is irradiated with a plurality of charged particle beams. The substrate is scanned by the beams while simultaneously deflecting the plurality of charged particle beams. A pattern is formed by controlling the plurality of charged particle beams individually depending on the pattern to be written while scanning the beams across the substrate. This charged particle beam writing apparatus is capable of forming an arbitrary writing pattern without using a mask and can provide a large angle field that covers a large writing area, and thus an improvement in throughput can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an example of a multibeam-type charged particle beam writing apparatus is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A charged particle beam emitted from an electron gun (not shown) is focused as a crossover image <b>101</b> and is passed through a condenser lens <b>102</b> to obtain a collimated charged particle beam <b>101</b><i>a</i>. An aperture array <b>103</b> has a plurality of openings <b>103</b><i>a </i>arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array. A lens array <b>104</b> has a plurality of electron lenses arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array. Deflector arrays <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>107</b> each have a plurality of deflectors arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array. Each deflector can be controlled independently.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The charged particle beam <b>101</b><i>a </i>is divided into a plurality of charged particle beams <b>101</b><i>b </i>by openings <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the aperture array <b>103</b>. Each of the plurality of charged particle beams <b>101</b><i>b </i>formed is passed through a corresponding electron lens of the lens array <b>104</b> thereby forming an intermediate image <b>101</b><i>c </i>of the crossover image <b>101</b> at a height corresponding to the deflector array <b>107</b>. In this process, the deflectors of the deflector arrays <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> are controlled individually such that the intermediate image <b>101</b><i>c </i>of each charged particle beam <b>101</b><i>b </i>passes through a predetermined location in the deflector array <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The deflector array <b>107</b> controls the plurality of charged particle beams <b>101</b><i>b </i>to fall on a substrate <b>115</b> or to be blocked independently for each of the plurality of charged particle beams <b>101</b><i>b</i>. That is, a charged particle beam <b>101</b><i>b </i>that is deflected by the deflector array <b>107</b> is blocked by a blanking aperture (blocking plate) <b>109</b> and does not reach the substrate <b>115</b>. On the other hand, a charged particle beam that is not deflected by the deflector array <b>107</b> passes through an opening <b>109</b><i>a </i>of the blanking aperture <b>109</b> via an electron lens <b>110</b> and reaches the substrate <b>115</b> via electron lenses <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b>. A deflector <b>114</b> deflects charged particle beams in a direction perpendicular to a scanning direction of a stage <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the deflector array <b>107</b> is described in further detail below. Note that, for simplicity, the electron lens <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Charged particle beams <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, and <b>203</b> are controlled by deflectors <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, and <b>253</b> of the deflector array <b>107</b> in such a manner as described below. When the deflectors <b>251</b> and <b>253</b> are controlled such that no deflection is performed, the charged particle beams <b>201</b> and <b>203</b> pass through an opening <b>109</b><i>a </i>of a blanking aperture <b>109</b> and reach the substrate <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">On the other hand, by controlling the deflector <b>252</b> to perform deflection, the path of the charged particle beam <b>202</b> can be changed such that the charged particle beam <b>202</b> strikes an area outside the opening <b>109</b><i>a </i>of the blanking aperture <b>109</b> without reaching the substrate <b>115</b>. In the present example, of the deflectors <b>251</b>, <b>252</b>, and <b>253</b>, only the deflector <b>252</b> performs deflection. Note that all deflectors may perform deflection or any deflector may not perform deflection. A desired pattern is formed on the substrate <b>115</b> by switching whether or not each deflector performs deflection depending on the position on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the conventional multibeam-type charged particle beam writing apparatus, if a defect occurs in an element such as a deflector, following problems can occur.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">(1) It can become impossible for a particular charged particle beam to reach the substrate <b>115</b> (irradiation is not correctly performed).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">(2) A particular charged particle beam can continue to strike the substrate <b>115</b> (necessary blocking is not performed).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">(3) A particular charged particle beam can be moved to an unpredictable position (position control is not correctly performed).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">To solve the above problems, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-116743 discloses a technique in which a plurality of charged particle beams are deflected all together by a common blanker located above a deflector array (on the side of the charged particle beam source), and charged particle beams are deflected by normal deflectors of the deflector array such that the charged particle beams pass through openings of a blanking aperture. In this technique, a charged particle beam passing through a defective deflector in the deflector array is blocked by a non-opening part of the blanking aperture, and thus only normal deflectors are used in forming a pattern on a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, in this technique, because charged particle beams corresponding to defective deflectors are not used in forming a pattern, an additional wiring process is needed to obtain a complete pattern. That is, writing is performed twice to obtain the complete pattern, which causes a reduction in throughput.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In view of the above, the present invention provides a charged particle beam writing apparatus capable of forming a desired pattern without a reduction in throughput even when elements such as deflectors include defective ones.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to an aspect of the present invention, a charged particle beam writing apparatus includes an aperture array configured to be capable of forming a plurality of charged particle beams using a plurality of openings, an element array including a plurality of main elements and a plurality of auxiliary elements different from the main elements, and a control unit configured to acquire information associated with a defect of the plurality of main elements and control the element array in accordance with the information, wherein the control unit controls the element array such that only the main elements are used when there is no defect, while when there is a main element having a defect, an auxiliary element is used without using the main element having the defect.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a multibeam-type charged particle beam writing apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention is described below. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, AX denotes a main axis (extending in a direction perpendicular to a substrate surface) of a plurality of charged particle beams. The direction of the main axis is defined as a Z direction, and two additional directions perpendicular to the Z direction are defined as an X direction and a Y direction.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A charged particle beam emitted from an electron gun (not shown) is focused as a crossover image <b>101</b> and is passed through a condenser lens (electron lens) <b>102</b> so as to obtain a collimated charged particle beam <b>101</b><i>a</i>. An aperture array <b>103</b> has a plurality of openings <b>103</b><i>a </i>arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array. A lens array <b>104</b> includes a plurality of electron lenses arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array. Deflector arrays <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>107</b> each have a plurality of deflectors arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array. Each deflector can be controlled independently.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The aperture array <b>103</b> is capable of forming a plurality of charged particle beams <b>101</b><i>b </i>using a plurality of openings <b>103</b><i>a</i>. Each of the plurality of charged particle beams <b>101</b><i>b </i>formed is passed through a corresponding electron lens of the lens array <b>104</b> thereby forming an intermediate image <b>101</b><i>c </i>of the crossover image <b>101</b> at a height corresponding to the deflector array <b>107</b>. In this process, the deflector arrays <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> are controlled such that the intermediate image <b>101</b><i>c </i>of each charged particle beam <b>101</b><i>b </i>passes through a predetermined location in the deflector array <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The deflector array <b>107</b> controls the plurality of charged particle beams <b>101</b><i>b </i>to fall on the substrate <b>115</b> or to be blocked by a blocking plate <b>109</b> independently for each of the plurality of charged particle beams <b>101</b><i>b</i>. That is, a charged particle beam <b>101</b><i>b </i>deflected by the deflector array <b>107</b> is blocked by the blocking plate <b>109</b> and does not reach the substrate <b>115</b>. On the other hand, a charged particle beam that is not deflected by the deflector array <b>107</b> passes through an opening <b>109</b><i>a </i>formed in the blocking plate <b>109</b> via the electron lens <b>110</b> and reaches the substrate <b>115</b> via the electron lenses <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b>. A deflector array <b>114</b> deflects charged particle beams in a direction perpendicular to a scanning direction of a stage <b>116</b> on which substrate <b>115</b> is mounted. On the stage <b>116</b>, there is disposed a detector <b>420</b> for detecting charged particle beams.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the present embodiment, a deflector array <b>301</b> (first deflector array) and deflector array <b>302</b> (third deflector array) are disposed above (upstream of) the deflector arrays <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>107</b> and below (downstream of) the aperture array <b>103</b>. Furthermore, a deflector array <b>303</b> (second deflector array) and a deflector array <b>304</b> (third deflector array) are disposed at locations below the deflector arrays <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>107</b> and above the blocking plate <b>109</b>. Deflectors of these deflector arrays are capable of deflecting corresponding charged particle beams of the plurality of charged particle beams.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The deflectors and the electron lenses described above may include a pair of electrodes opposing each other via an opening in a known manner. However, the configuration is not limited to that described above. For example, magnetic poles may be used instead of the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A control unit <b>500</b> includes a controller module <b>402</b> that controls the lens array <b>104</b>, a controller module <b>403</b> that controls the deflector arrays <b>105</b> and <b>106</b>, a controller module <b>404</b> that controls the deflector array <b>107</b>, and a controller module <b>406</b> that controls the electron lenses <b>102</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b>. The control unit <b>500</b> further includes a controller module <b>407</b> that controls the deflector array <b>114</b>, a controller module <b>408</b> that controls the driving of the stage, and a controller module <b>405</b> that controls the deflector arrays <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>304</b>. These controller modules are configured to be capable of communicating with a main control unit <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The deflector arrays (element arrays) <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>107</b> include a plurality of main deflectors (main elements) <b>311</b> disposed in areas corresponding to the plurality of openings <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the aperture array <b>103</b>, and also include a plurality of auxiliary deflectors (auxiliary elements) <b>312</b> disposed in areas different from the above-described areas.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a view of the deflector array <b>105</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as seen from above (from the side of the charged particle beam source). In the present embodiment, 5&#xd7;5 charged particle beams are formed by the openings <b>103</b><i>a</i>. The main deflectors <b>311</b> are disposed at locations corresponding to those charged particle beams. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the main deflectors <b>311</b> are illustrated by circles, and the auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b> are illustrated by squares.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the present embodiment, as many main deflectors <b>311</b> are disposed in the form of a two-dimensional array as there are openings <b>103</b><i>a</i>, and the auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b> are disposed in a two-dimensional plane in which the main deflectors <b>311</b> are disposed such that the main deflectors <b>311</b> are surrounded by the auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b>. Note that the configuration associated with the auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b> is not limited to the present example, but the auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b> may be arranged in other ways although there has to be at least one auxiliary deflector.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An operation is described below for a case in which part of the main deflectors <b>311</b> of the deflector arrays <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>107</b> have a defect. If part of the deflector arrays <b>105</b> and <b>106</b> are uncontrollable due to a defect, the position control described above is not performed correctly, which makes it difficult to form a fine pattern. On the other hand, if part of the deflector arrays <b>107</b> are uncontrollable due to a defect, a pattern is formed at an incorrect location on a substrate without forming the pattern at a correct location. In the present embodiment of the invention, to avoid the above problem, an auxiliary deflector is used instead of a defective deflector to form a correct pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The control unit <b>500</b> is capable of acquiring information associated with defects of the main deflectors <b>311</b>. More specifically, defective deflectors of the plurality of main deflectors <b>311</b> are identified by a user via an interface or via an automatic detection performed by the apparatus. The control unit <b>500</b> controls the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> such that part of the plurality of charged particle beams corresponding to the defective deflectors do not pass through the defective deflectors of the main deflectors <b>311</b> but instead pass through auxiliary deflectors. In the present embodiment, the deflector array <b>302</b> is disposed below the deflector array <b>301</b> so that the charged particle beams are incident at a right angle on a plane in which the deflectors of the deflector array <b>105</b> are disposed. In other words, the deflector array <b>302</b> deflects the charged particle beams incident thereon after passing through the deflector array <b>301</b> such that the charged particle beams become parallel (or substantially parallel) to the main axis AX of the plurality of charged particle beams. In a case where the distance between the deflector array <b>301</b> and the deflector array <b>105</b> is set to be large enough so that the charged particle beams incident on the deflector array <b>105</b> are substantially parallel, only the deflector <b>301</b> may be disposed without providing the deflector array <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, the control unit <b>500</b> controls the deflector arrays <b>303</b> and <b>304</b> such that the charged particle beams passing through the auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b> further pass through the opening of the blocking plate <b>109</b>. In the present embodiment, the deflector array <b>304</b> is disposed below the deflector array <b>303</b> such that the charged particle beams are incident at a right angle on the surface of the electron lens <b>110</b>. In other words, the deflector array <b>304</b> deflects the charged particle beams incident thereon after passing through the deflector array <b>303</b> such that the charged particle beams become parallel (or substantially parallel) to the main axis AX of the plurality of charged particle beams. In a case where the distance between the deflector array <b>303</b> and the deflector array <b>107</b> is set to be large enough so that the charged particle beams incident on the electron lens <b>110</b> are substantially parallel, only the deflector <b>303</b> may be disposed without providing the deflector array <b>304</b>. Note that the function of the deflector <b>303</b> may be provided by the deflector <b>107</b>. In this case, the deflectors <b>303</b> and <b>304</b> may not be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a charged particle beam passing though an opening <b>103</b><i>a </i>corresponding to a defective deflector <b>311</b><i>a </i>is deflected by the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> such that the charged particle beam is led to a deflector <b>311</b><i>b </i>located outwardly adjacent to the defective deflector <b>311</b><i>a</i>. The charged particle beam that has passed through the opening <b>103</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the deflector <b>311</b><i>b </i>is deflected by the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> such that the charged particle beam is led to an auxiliary deflector <b>312</b><i>a </i>located outwardly adjacent to the deflector <b>311</b><i>b</i>. That is, the deflectors used are shifted outwardly until the auxiliary deflector <b>312</b><i>a </i>is reached. After the charged particle beams have passed through the deflectors described above, the charged particle beams are deflected by the deflectors <b>303</b> and <b>304</b> such that the charged particle beams return to their original positions. Herein, the original position refers to a position that would be reached by the charged particle beam when the charged particle beam was not deflected by the deflectors <b>301</b> and <b>302</b>. In the present embodiment, not only in the case where some deflectors of the deflector array <b>105</b> are defective but also in a case where some deflectors of the deflector arrays <b>106</b> and <b>107</b> are defective, the defective deflectors can be bypassed in a similar manner.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The control unit <b>500</b> further includes control signal exchanging circuits <b>410</b> and <b>411</b>. The control signal exchanging circuits <b>410</b> and <b>411</b> are configured to exchange control signals applied to deflectors such as to form the same correct pattern as that obtained without using the deflector arrays <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>304</b> when there is no defect. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral <b>413</b> denotes a control signal applied to the auxiliary deflectors, reference numeral <b>414</b> denotes a control signal applied to the main deflectors, and reference numeral <b>415</b> denotes other control signals.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present embodiment, the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> are disposed above the deflector array <b>105</b>, and the deflector arrays <b>303</b> and <b>304</b> are disposed below the deflector array <b>107</b> so that even when some deflectors of the deflector arrays <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>107</b> are defective, a correct pattern can be written on the substrate by bypassing the defective deflectors. Note that the deflector arrays may be configured in other manners. For example, the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> may be disposed above one of the deflector arrays <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>107</b>, and, below this one of the deflector arrays, the deflector arrays <b>303</b> and <b>304</b> may be disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Note that the present invention may be applied not only to an array of deflectors but also to an array of other elements. For example, the lens array <b>104</b> may be configured to have auxiliary electron lenses, and the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> may be disposed above the lens array <b>104</b> and the deflector arrays <b>303</b> and <b>304</b> may be disposed below the lens array <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Next, an explanation is given below as to a method of identifying a defective deflector in the plurality of main deflectors <b>311</b> automatically by the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">First, with predetermined timing, the detector <b>420</b> is moved together with the stage <b>116</b> to an irradiation location at which the detector <b>420</b> is to be irradiated with the charged particle beam <b>101</b><i>d</i>. The predetermined timing may be once every substrate or once every lot. The timing may be set by a user as required. At this irradiation location, the detector <b>420</b> is irradiated with the charged particle beam via the main deflector <b>311</b> such that the charged particle beam is detected by the detector <b>420</b>. As for the detector <b>420</b>, for example, a combination of a Faraday cup and an ammeter may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Note that the number of Faraday cups is not limited to one, but a plurality of Faraday cups may be disposed in the form of an array. This configuration allows it to simultaneously detect a plurality of charged particle beams, which allows a reduction in detection time.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A controller module <b>421</b> includes a storage unit in which a current value required to perform writing is stored in advance. The controller module <b>421</b> compares a current value detected by the detector <b>420</b> with the current value stored in advance to determine whether the detected current value is normal. A current value in a state in which there is no irradiation of charged particle beam is also stored in advance in the storage unit. A current value is measured in a state in which a charged particle beam is deflected by a deflector array and the deflected charged particle beam is blocked by the blocking plate <b>109</b>, and the current value detected by the detector <b>420</b> in this state is compared with the current value measured in advance in the state where no irradiation is performed. From the comparison, a determination is made as to whether the charged particle beam is deflected normally. Via the process described above, it is determined whether the deflector arrays <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>107</b> have a defective deflector.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a case where it is determined that there is a defective deflector, the control signal exchanging circuits <b>410</b> and <b>411</b> exchange the control signal output from the controller modules <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> such that the defective deflector is bypassed, and the controller module <b>412</b> controls the deflectors <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>304</b> such that the defective deflector is bypassed. By exchanging the controls signal in the above-described manner, it becomes possible to simplify the control system.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the present embodiment, as described above, even when an array of elements has a defective element, it is possible to continuously perform writing on a substrate. This makes it possible to replace the defective element with a normal element when the apparatus is not used, for example, when the apparatus is subjected to a maintenance operation, and thus it is possible to increase the throughput of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When some deflector is defective, an auxiliary deflector is used instead of the defective deflector, which allows the plurality of charged particle beams to be fully used without waste. In contrast, in the conventional techniques, a charged particle beam passing through a defective deflector is blocked by a blocking plate, and thus the blocked charged particle beam functions as an unnecessary heat source. In the present embodiment, no unnecessary heat source is created, which reduces the necessity of taking measures against an influence of heat on heat-sensitive parts. Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional techniques that need to perform the writing process twice or more to obtained a complete pattern, the present embodiment allows it to form a pattern by perform the writing process only once, which provides a great advantage in terms of the throughput.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A second embodiment is described below. The second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment except for what is described below. In the second embodiment, when a plurality of defective main deflectors are defective, the defectiveness is handled in such a manner as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a view of the deflector array <b>105</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as shown from above (from the side of the charged particle beam source). The main deflectors <b>311</b> are disposed at locations corresponding to those charged particle beams. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the main deflectors <b>311</b> are illustrated by circles, and the auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b> are illustrated by squares. Symbols x are used to indicate defective main deflectors. As can be seen, when there are plurality of defective main deflectors, charged particle beams are controlled so as to bypass the defective main deflectors and pass through auxiliary deflectors by deflecting the charged particle beams in directions denoted by arrows.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A third embodiment is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment except for what is described below. In this embodiment, the deflector arrays <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>304</b> are configured such that each deflector thereof is capable of deflecting a plurality of charged particle beams. In the present embodiment, by way of example, it is assumed that each deflector is capable of deflecting 2&#xd7;2 charged particle beams. Note that there is no particular restriction on the number of charged particle beams deflected by one deflector. In the first embodiment described above, the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> are disposed upstream of the deflector array <b>105</b>. In contrast, in the third embodiment, the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> are disposed upstream of the deflector array <b>107</b>. Note that the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> may be disposed differently. For example, the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> may be disposed in a similar manner to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a view of the deflector array <b>107</b> as shown from above (from the side of the charged particle beam source). The main deflectors <b>311</b> are disposed at locations corresponding to charged particle beams. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, main deflectors <b>311</b> are illustrated by circles, and auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b> are illustrated by squares. Symbols x are used to indicate defective main deflectors. The deflectors <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> are capable of simultaneously deflecting all charged particle beams passing through an area denoted by reference numeral <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After charged particle beams <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b> pass through openings of the aperture array <b>103</b>, the charged particle beams <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b> are deflected by the deflector array <b>301</b> such that the defective deflector <b>321</b> is bypassed. That is, the charged particle beams <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b> are deflected in a direction denoted by arrows <b>321</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The deflection causes the charged particle beam <b>211</b> to be led to an auxiliary deflector of the deflector array <b>301</b>. On the other hand, the charged particle beams <b>214</b> and <b>215</b> are not deflected by the deflector array <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The deflector array <b>303</b> deflects the charged particle beams <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b> such that the charged particle beams return to their previous positions in which the charged particle beams were located before they were deflected by the deflector array <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the present embodiment, the deflectors of the deflector arrays <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>304</b> can be set to be great in size. That is, it is possible to configure each deflector to have a large opening between electrodes. This allows the deflector arrays <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>304</b> to be produced by a simple production process at a lower production cost in a shorter production time. The increase in size of the opening between electrodes of each deflector results in a reduction in the probability that some of deflectors of the deflector arrays <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>303</b>, and <b>304</b> is defective.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, a fourth embodiment is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The fourth embodiment is similar to the first embodiment except for what is described below. In the fourth embodiment, the apparatus does not have the deflector arrays <b>303</b> and <b>304</b> used in the first embodiment, but the aperture array <b>103</b> has openings at locations corresponding to the auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the present embodiment, the charged particle beam writing apparatus has shutters <b>117</b> configured to open and close openings. When there is no defective deflector, the openings corresponding to the auxiliary deflectors <b>312</b> are closed in the writing process. When there is a defective deflector, an opening corresponding to the defective main deflector is closed and an opening corresponding to an auxiliary deflector <b>312</b> is opened. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the main deflector <b>311</b> has a defective deflector at a second position as measured from the left end.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the present embodiment, even when there is no defect, charged particle beams are formed redundantly, and thus the present embodiment is disadvantageous in terms of energy consumption or unnecessary heat generation compared with the first embodiment. However, because the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> are not provided, it is possible to reduce cost and prevent a trouble that can occur due to a failure of the deflector arrays <b>301</b> and <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Instead of providing the shutters, charged particle beams passing through defective deflectors may be deflected after the passage through the defective deflectors such that the charged particle beams are blocked by the blocking plate. This configuration may be combined with a technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-116743.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Embodiment of Device Production Method</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Devices (such as semiconductor integrated circuit devices, liquid crystal display devices, etc.) can be produced by a process including exposing a charged-particle sensitive resist coated on a substrate (such as a wafer, glass plate, etc.) by using an exposure apparatus according to one of the embodiments described above, and developing the exposed resist. The substrate is then subjected to a process including etching, resist removal, dicing, bonding, packaging, etc.</p>
