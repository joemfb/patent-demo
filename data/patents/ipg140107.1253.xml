<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A printed sheet product comprises a thin core having a pair of opposing major planar sides. A plurality of sets of variable data fields are printed on at least a first side of the core. One or more of the variable data fields of each set may be printed on the opposing second side of the core. Each set of printed variable data fields includes at least a first data field printed with a numeric code, the numeric code of each variable data field set being different from that of each other set printed on the first side of the core. Each set of variable data fields further includes a second data field printed with either a name and mailing address uniquely associated with a numeric code or with another representation of the numeric code. Where printed, the name and address of each variable data set differs from that of each other variable data set printed on the first side of the core. The sheet product is scored to at least define one removable element containing the first variable data field from each set printed on the sheet product. Where name and address data fields are printed, the sheet product may further be scored to separate the sheet product into individual sheet sections which can be inserted without folding into envelopes for direct mailing of the removable first element to an appropriate recipient.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to mailers and sheet products for use as parts of mailers and, in particular, to sets of uniquely encoded cards, tags, labels and other sheet elements used in mailers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A substantial market has developed in recent years for inexpensively manufactured, individually encoded, transaction cards for such uses as store credit cards, membership cards, I.D. cards, etc. The transaction cards typically bear the code in a bar format to permit automatic machine scanning of the card. Such cards typically are supplied in sets with one or more labels, tags, etc. being supplied with each card and bearing the same individual code number as the card for attachment to application forms, membership lists, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Previously, it has taken many separate manufacturing steps to provide such sets. Perhaps the most efficient prior method has been printing in multiple steps, individual sheets of uniquely encoded, typically sequentially numbered, transaction cards, printing separate strips of release paper back adhesive labels with the same, unique codes as the cards, in the same sequence of codes as the codes appear on the cards of the sheets, and attaching the strip(s) with the appropriate code numbers to each sheet with the labels adjoining the like coded card(s).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In practice, this apparently simple, straightforward method requires several labor intensive steps. The appropriate labels for each sheet of cards must be identified and applied by hand to the sheet so that the labels properly adjoin the associated transaction cards. Because this correlation of the separate elements of each sheet is done by hand, considerable time and effort also must be spent in checking the final product to assure accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, because the transaction card sheets and label strips must be printed separately, more time is needed to complete the task if the same printer is used to print the transaction card sheet and label strips. Alternatively, several printers must be available to simultaneously print the cards and the strips.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention is directed to solving the twin problems of relatively high cost and errors associated with hand production of sets of plural related printed elements, all bearing some code unique to each set of elements, by eliminating hand collation and assembly of the separate elements into the sets as well as the material costs associated with such elements.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is also directed to solving the problem of the numerous printing steps which are currently required to produce related sets of card sheets and separate label strips, by reducing the number of required printing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is also directed to solving problems associated with mailing other types or card or card-sized objects that, in some way, require the provision of multiple, variable data sets with each mailer.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect, the invention is a card mailer comprising: a generally rectangular envelope having a length and width and a front face with a window; and an integral card/insert sheet section of generally rectangular configuration having length about the length of the envelope or less and a width about the width of the envelope or less, the sheet section being received in the envelope without folding, the sheet section being printed in a first data field with a unique code in a machine readable format and in a second, separate data field with a name and mailing address of an individual assigned the unique code, the second data field being located on the sheet section aligned with and visible through the window of the envelope, the sheet section including a generally rectangular shaped scoring extending at least sufficiently through the sheet section to define a generally rectangular card portion removable from a remainder of the sheet section, the card portion including at least the first data field with the unique code, the card portion having a given material composition and the remainder of the sheet section adjoining the scoring having a material composition identical to the material composition of the card portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, the invention is a method of making a transaction card mailer comprising the steps of printing a plurality of sets of variable data fields on at least a first of a pair of opposing major planar sides of a thin core, each set of printed variable data fields including at least a first data field printed with a unique code in a machine readable format, the unique code of each variable data field set printed on at least the first side of the core being different from the unique code of each other set of variable data fields printed on the first side of the core, and each set of variable data fields including a second data field printed with a name and mailing address uniquely associated with the unique code of the set of printed variable data fields, the name and address of the second data field of each set being different from the name and address of the second data field of each other set of data fields printed on the core; scoring the core to divide the core into a plurality of individual, generally rectangular sheet sections and to further define at least one element in each sheet section removable from the sheet section, each sheet section containing a separate one of the plurality of said printed variable data fields, and one removable element of each sheet section containing at least the first variable data field of the one set of variable data fields printed on the sheet section; and inserting at least one of the sheet sections with at least the one removable element of the one sheet section still in the one sheet section into a generally rectangular envelope without folding the sheet section, the envelope having a window and the printed name and mailing address of the inserted sheet section being visible through the window.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> depict, in varying views, a first printed sheet product of the present invention indicated generally at <b>10</b>. The product <b>10</b> includes a thin, flexible core <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which is, in this embodiment, the size of the product <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and which has two major planar opposing sides <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>. As will be seen, core sides <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> effectively form the imprinted sides of the product <b>10</b> as well. Side <b>14</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Side <b>16</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is printed on the first major side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b>, a plurality of sets of code fields. In the depicted product <b>10</b>, eight code field sets of two code fields each are preferred but larger or smaller numbers of code field sets with equal or larger numbers of code are possible. A first code field of each of the eight code field sets is identified generally at <b>20</b><i>a </i>through <b>27</b><i>a</i>, respectively, while a second code field of each of the eight code field sets is indicated generally at <b>20</b><i>b </i>through <b>27</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Printed in each of the first code fields <b>20</b><i>a </i>through <b>27</b><i>a </i>and second code fields <b>20</b><i>b </i>through <b>27</b><i>b </i>are unique codes, examples of which are actually shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The code of each of the eight sets of code fields <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>21</b><i>b</i>, etc., is unique to the set and differs from the unique code of each of the remaining sets of fields printed on the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b>. In the depicted example, each code has six decimal digits. The first five digits are sequential between 01000 and 01007. The sixth digit in each code is a check digit. The six digit codes are merely examples. More or fewer digits and even letters and other symbols can be incorporated into the codes, although it will be appreciated that letters and other symbols may not be usable in some code formats, for example, in some bar code formats. Also, although it is a preferred method of encoding, the unique codes need not be numerically sequential, merely uniquely identifiable.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The unique code of each set of code fields is printed in at least a machine readable format and, preferably, in both machine readable bar and machine and human readable numeral formats in the first code field <b>20</b><i>a </i>through <b>27</b><i>a</i>, respectively, of each of the eight sets of code fields. The same unique code of the set preferably is printed in at least numeral format in the second code field <b>20</b><i>b </i>through <b>27</b><i>b </i>of each set of code fields as indicated. The second code field <b>20</b><i>b </i>through <b>27</b><i>b </i>of each code field set is spaced from the first code field of the set, <b>20</b><i>a </i>through <b>27</b><i>a</i>, respectively, on the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b> and the sheet product <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Also printed on the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b> are a first plurality of static graphic fields, represented by various dot and dashed blocks, indicated collectively at <b>30</b> through <b>37</b>, respectively. Such fields typically contain text and/or graphic designs. In the embodiment being depicted, each static graphic field has four separate components, numbered individually for a first of the fields <b>30</b> as <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, <b>30</b><i>c</i>, <b>30</b><i>d</i>. The numbers and locations of the components of the static graphic fields are not significant per se to the invention. The static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b> are usually identical to one another, but need not be so. Preferably, the number of static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b> printed is at least equal the number of sets of code fields, in this case eight, whereby one of the static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b> is associated with a separate one of the code field sets. One of the code fields of each of the sets of code fields is positioned substantially identically with respect to one of the static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b>. In this case, the first code field <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>of each set of code fields is located in the same position with respect to each of the static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b>, slightly below and to the right of the various components of the static fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b>, for reasons which will be apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">One feature of one aspect of the invention is the printing of the code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b </i>in different directions on the same side of the sheet <b>10</b>. One or more of the components of the static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b> printed on the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b> typically contains text which is printed left to right across the sheet <b>10</b> when sheet <b>10</b> is viewed in the orientation it is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with its shorter sides horizontal and located at the top and bottom of the sheet <b>10</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the bar and numeral format codes in the first code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>are printed in a first direction, namely the horizontal direction in each of those first code fields. The numeral format codes in each of the second plurality of code fields <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b </i>are printed in a direction transverse to the horizontal direction of the corresponding first code field <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>of each set, preferably in a vertical direction, perpendicular to the horizontal direction in which the codes of the first plurality code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>are printed. While perpendicular directions are preferred for the first direction and the transverse direction in which the code sets are printed, the first and transverse directions need not be perpendicular. Nor do the first code fields all have to be printed in the same first direction, even though such an orientation is usually employed, nor do the second code fields have to be printed in the same transverse direction. As was indicated above, the first code field <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>of each set of code fields is located in the same orientation and position, namely, partially below and partially to the right of a proximal one of the first plurality of static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b>, respectively. This conveniently permits the static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b> and first code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>to be grouped together to produce an identical plurality of removable elements, as will be shortly described.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second side <b>16</b> of the core <b>12</b> preferably may be printed with a second plurality of static graphic fields, each field being indicated collectively at <b>40</b>-<b>47</b>, respectively. Each of the second static graphic fields <b>40</b>-<b>47</b> in the depicted embodiment includes, for example, four separate components indicated by rectangular dot dashed lines and shading. These are numbered individually for the first field <b>40</b> as <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>, <b>40</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>d </i>for clarity. Again, the details of the second plurality of static graphic fields are immaterial to the invention. Typically, each of the second plurality of static graphic fields <b>40</b>-<b>47</b> is identical to one another and is preferably positioned identically opposite with respect to separate ones of the first code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>and the first plurality of static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b> on the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably, after printing, there is applied to the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b>, a first covering which is indicated generally at <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Its edges can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and one edge is numbered <b>56</b>. The first covering <b>54</b> suggestedly covers at least a central portion of the first side <b>14</b>, overlying all of the code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>and first static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b>. In this embodiment, the first covering <b>54</b> may extend to the long side edges of the core <b>12</b> covering the second printed code fields <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b </i>as well. Preferably, the covering <b>54</b> is at least sufficiently transparent to read the underlying printed fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b </i>and <b>30</b>-<b>37</b>. One of ordinary skill will appreciate that code fields can be &#x201c;read&#x201d; in various ways. The first covering must be sufficiently transparent in the visible light spectrum to permit human reading of the code field. However, the first covering may be transparent only in some other spectrum, for example, the infrared spectrum or ultraviolet spectrum. While not transparent to human visual examination, such a covering can be sufficiently transparent to known optical reader devices to permit reading of the machine readable representation of the unique code underlying the covering by such devices. A second covering <b>56</b> is preferably applied to the second side <b>16</b> of the core <b>12</b>. Preferably, the second covering overlies only a central portion of the second side <b>16</b> containing at least a major portion of the second plurality of static graphic fields <b>40</b>-<b>47</b> printed on the second side. Preferably, the second covering is directly opposite at least the first plurality of code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>and at least most if not all of the first plurality of printed static fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b>. Again, the second covering <b>56</b> is at least sufficiently transparent to read the underlying printed static fields <b>40</b>-<b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Also, preferably applied to the second side <b>16</b> of the core <b>12</b> are two stripes <b>60</b> and <b>64</b> of pressure sensitive adhesive. Preferably, the stripes <b>60</b> and <b>64</b> are applied directly opposite the second code fields <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>23</b><i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b</i>, respectively. In the embodiment of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, strips of release paper <b>62</b> and <b>66</b> directly overlie the stripes of pressure sensitive adhesive <b>60</b> and <b>64</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sheet product <b>10</b> is scored through the core <b>12</b> and, where present, the first covering <b>54</b>, second covering <b>56</b> and adhesive layer <b>60</b>, <b>64</b>. This scoring is indicated by diagrammatically by unnumbered, bold dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The scoring defines a plurality of sets of elements which are removable from the sheet product <b>10</b>. In particular, eight sets of removable elements, a number of sets equal to the numbers of sets of code fields, first plurality of static graphic fields and second plurality of static graphic fields printed on the core <b>12</b>, are provided in product <b>10</b> by the scoring. Preferably, a first removable element of each of the eight sets of removable elements is a generally rectangular, transaction element and is indicated at <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>77</b><i>a</i>. Each of the elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>77</b><i>a </i>includes on one side, which is the second side <b>16</b> of the core <b>12</b> and product <b>10</b>, a substantially identical portion of one of the second plurality of static graphic fields <b>40</b>-<b>47</b> which was printed on that side. Each element <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>77</b><i>a </i>also includes on an opposing side, which is the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b> any product <b>10</b>, a separate, substantially identical portion of one of the first plurality of static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b> and an at least one of the first and second plurality of code fields, preferably, the first plurality of code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a</i>. The elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>77</b><i>a </i>can be used as a credit card (with or without magnetic stripe as will be discussed), identification card, membership card, etc. If desired, a closed perimeter opening can also be scored through the sheet product within each removable element <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>77</b><i>a</i>, to permit the element <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>77</b><i>a </i>to be mounted on a key chain or other key holder like a key or to receive a key chain or ring or the like and be used as a key fob supporting one or more keys on such chain or ring or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The second removable element of each set is denoted at <b>70</b><i>b</i>-<b>77</b><i>b </i>and consists of a portion of the product <b>10</b> having on one side, which was the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b> and product <b>10</b>, one of the second set of code fields <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Each removable element <b>70</b><i>b</i>-<b>77</b><i>b </i>includes on its remaining side, which was the second side <b>16</b> of the core <b>12</b> and product <b>10</b>, a portion of one of the two stripes <b>60</b> and <b>64</b> of pressure sensitive adhesive. Elements <b>70</b><i>b</i>-<b>77</b><i>b </i>can be used as labels or tabs on an application or membership form, etc., of the person receiving the corresponding card element <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>77</b><i>a </i>of the set.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The scoring has been indicated diagrammatically for several reasons. First, the exact type of scoring used, e.g., long, continuous cuts with short breaks, closely spaced perforations, etc. is a matter of choice. Furthermore, the product <b>10</b> without the scoring and without the release paper strips <b>62</b> and <b>66</b>, is an intermediate sheet product which can be used to make a somewhat different sheet product indicated generally at <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Product <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref> is so similar to the sheet product <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> that only a top portion of product <b>110</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> to highlight the differences between the two embodiments <b>10</b> and <b>110</b>. The sheet product <b>110</b> is formed from an intermediate sheet product also used to form the sheet product <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>. That intermediate product includes the core <b>10</b>, the pluralities of code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b </i>and the first plurality of static graphic fields <b>30</b>-<b>37</b> printed on the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and the second plurality of static graphic fields <b>40</b>-<b>47</b>, respectively, printed on the second side <b>16</b> of the core <b>12</b>. Stripes <b>60</b> and <b>64</b> of pressure sensitive adhesive are also provided along the second side <b>16</b> of the core <b>12</b> adjoining the longer side edges of the core <b>12</b> and directly opposite the second code fields <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>23</b><i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b</i>, respectively, only fields <b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>being indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This intermediate sheet product is therefore identical to the sheet product <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> except that it lacks the strips of release paper <b>62</b> and <b>66</b> and the scoring. The side edge portions of the first covering <b>54</b>, overlying the second code fields <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b </i>can also be eliminated as a cost savings. This intermediate product is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> at <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In converting this intermediate product <b>100</b> into the sheet product <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, the first and second longitudinal edge portions <b>67</b> and <b>68</b> of the core <b>12</b>, bearing the adhesive stripes <b>60</b> and <b>64</b>, respectively, of the sheet product <b>100</b> are turned, as is indicated diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, onto an adjoining portion of the core <b>12</b> and sheet product <b>100</b> forming a double thickness of the core <b>12</b> along the longitudinal edges of the resulting sheet product <b>110</b> part of which is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The sheet product <b>110</b> formed in this manner is thereafter scored, the scoring again being indicated by the unnumbered, bold dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. The scoring defines plural sets of plural elements removable from the sheet product <b>110</b> and removably adhered to one another by the intervening adhesive stripe <b>60</b> or <b>64</b>. In the depicted embodiment <b>110</b> continuous cuts have been made along the longer, folded side edges of the intermediate product <b>100</b> to define the outer side portions of the removable elements</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> depict a third printed sheet product of the present invention indicated generally at <b>210</b>. The sheet product <b>210</b> again includes a thin, flexible core <b>212</b> like core <b>12</b> of products <b>10</b> and <b>100</b>/<b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) which, again, is the size of the product <b>210</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and which has a pair of major planar opposing sides <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a first major planar side <b>214</b> of which is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. There is printed on the first major planar side <b>214</b> of the core <b>212</b> a plurality of sets of variable data fields. In the depicted product <b>210</b> three variable data field sets of three variable data fields each are printed but as few as two and more than three separate variable data fields could be printed for each set. Again, a first variable data field of each of the three variable data field sets is a code field identified generally at <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Another data field of each of the three data field sets is a second code field indicated at <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>c </i>and <b>22</b><i>c</i>. Each of these data fields <b>20</b><i>a </i>through <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>through <b>22</b><i>c </i>is printed with a unique code, preferably in both bar code and numeric formats. As with the previous sheet products, the unique code of each variable data field set is unique to the set and different from the unique code of each other set of variable data fields printed on the first side <b>214</b> of the core <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, each set of variable data fields includes another data field indicated at <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>d</i>, respectively, printed with a name and mailing address uniquely associated with the unique code of the set of printed variable data fields. The name and address of each of the data fields <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>d </i>is unique to the set <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> or <b>22</b> and is different from the name and address of each of the other data fields <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>d </i>also printed on the first side of the core.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As is depicted in the figure, each of the various individual variable data fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b </i>and <b>22</b><i>c </i>is spaced from one another for purposes which, if not already apparent from the previous discussion, will become apparent from the following discussion.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first side <b>214</b> of the core <b>212</b> may also be printed with a first plurality of static graphic fields, represented by the various dashed and double-dotted blocks indicated collectively at <b>30</b> through <b>32</b>, respectively. Such static graphic fields typically contain text and/or graphic designs which are repeated. In the embodiment being depicted, each static graphic field has five separate components numbered individually for the first of the static graphic fields as <b>30</b><i>a </i>through <b>30</b><i>e</i>, respectively. In this embodiment, each of the unique codes in the code-type variable data fields <b>20</b><i>a </i>through <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>through <b>22</b><i>c </i>is printed in the same orientation but could be printed in directions transverse to one another, if desired. As was the case with the previously discussed embodiments, the second major planar side <b>216</b> of the core <b>212</b> of the sheet product <b>210</b> can be printed with static graphic fields backing any of the fields printed on the first side of the core depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Preferably, a first covering is applied over a portion of the first side <b>214</b> after printing the static graphic fields and the variable data fields on the first side <b>214</b> of the core <b>212</b> of the depicted sheet product <b>210</b>. The first covering of sheet product <b>210</b> is indicated generally at <b>254</b>, the lead line of which extends to an edge of the first covering in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In this particular sheet product <b>210</b>, the first covering <b>254</b> preferably covers only the right half of the sheet product overlying each of the variable data code fields <b>20</b><i>a </i>through <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>through <b>22</b><i>c</i>. The first covering <b>254</b> avoids the printed variable data address field <b>20</b><i>d </i>through <b>22</b><i>d</i>. Again, the first covering <b>254</b> is preferably at least sufficiently transparent to humans and/or machines to read the underlying printed variable data code field <b>20</b><i>a </i>through <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>through <b>22</b><i>c</i>. As was the case with sheet product <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, a second covering <b>256</b> is preferably applied to the second major planar side <b>216</b> of the core <b>212</b> of the sheet product <b>210</b> directly opposite the first covering <b>254</b> and the variable data code fields <b>20</b><i>a </i>through <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>through <b>22</b><i>b</i>. The second covering <b>256</b> again can be transparent, if desired, to permit the reading of any variable data or static graphic fields which may be printed on the second major planar side of the core of the sheet product <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The sheet product <b>210</b> is preferably scored through its core and, where present, its first covering <b>254</b>, second covering <b>256</b> and any other covering, such as an adhesive layer (not depicted). The scoring is indicated diagrammatically by bold, dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Sheet product <b>210</b> differs from the previously described sheet product in that the scoring preferably includes two horizontal score lines, which are indicated at <b>201</b> and <b>203</b>, respectively, which define the sheet product <b>210</b> into three sheet sections indicated at <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>, respectively. Each of the sheet sections <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> contains a separate one of the plurality of sets of printed variable data fields (<b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively). Thus, sheet section <b>202</b> includes the three variable data fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>d </i>constituting the first variable set of data fields of sheet product <b>210</b>. Sheet section <b>204</b> contains the second set of variable data fields <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>c </i>and <b>22</b><i>d </i>while the third sheet section <b>206</b> contains the third set of variable data fields <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>c </i>and <b>22</b><i>d</i>. In addition, scoring preferably defines at least one and preferably sets of two or more elements which are removable from each sheet section <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>. In particular, three sets of removable elements, equal to the number of sets of printed variable data fields, are provided in the sheet product <b>210</b> by the scoring. Preferably, the first removable element of each of the three sets of removable elements is a generally rectangular, card-sized transaction element and is indicated at <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>71</b><i>a </i>and <b>72</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Again, each of the elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>72</b><i>a </i>can include on a second side of the core of the product <b>210</b> a substantially identical portion of identical static graphic fields which may be printed on that side of the core and product. Again, each element <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>72</b><i>a </i>also includes substantially identical portions of the first plurality of static graphic fields <b>30</b>, <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> which are printed on the first side <b>214</b> of the core <b>212</b> forming the first side of sheet product <b>210</b>. Each of the indicated first removable elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>71</b><i>a </i>and <b>72</b><i>a </i>is generally rectangular and about two inches by about three inches in size, approximating the size of a business card or credit card and may be used as a credit card, identification card, membership card, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The second removable element of each sheet section <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> defined by the scoring is identified at <b>70</b><i>c</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>and <b>72</b><i>c</i>, respectively. Like the first removable element, each second removable element <b>70</b><i>c</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>and <b>72</b><i>c </i>may include identical portions of static graphic or variable data fields printed on a second side of the core of sheet product <b>210</b> (not depicted). Removable elements <b>70</b><i>c</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>and <b>72</b><i>c </i>are preferably generally rectangular and smaller than removable elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>71</b><i>a </i>and <b>72</b><i>a</i>, respectively, preferably less than two inches along one side, such as either vertical side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and less than three inches along another side, namely either horizontal side adjoining either vertical side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, to define a slightly smaller, removable element. Preferably the scoring defines a closed perimeter <b>70</b><i>d</i>, <b>71</b><i>d </i>and <b>72</b><i>d </i>opening through the sheet product <b>210</b> within each of the removable elements <b>70</b><i>c</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>and <b>72</b><i>c</i>, respectively. The closed perimeter openings <b>70</b><i>d</i>, <b>71</b><i>d </i>and <b>72</b><i>d</i>, extend transversely through the plane of the sheet product <b>210</b> and of each of the elements <b>70</b><i>c</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>and <b>72</b><i>c </i>and permit the element <b>70</b><i>c</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>72</b><i>c </i>to be used as a key tag lying flat and parallel planar with keys on a key chain or ring or in a key case. Alternatively, each element <b>70</b><i>d</i>, <b>71</b><i>d </i>and <b>72</b><i>d</i>, coated with suitably strong coverings <b>254</b> and <b>256</b> could be sufficiently strong, rigid and durable enough to act as a key fob supporting a key chain, key ring or like key fastener. Preferably, each of the removable elements <b>70</b><i>c</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>and <b>72</b><i>c </i>is approximately two and one-half by one inches in size for more convenient interleaving with conventionally sized keys.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each of sheet sections <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> is also preferably sized to fit into a standard-size envelope without folding. For example, each of the sheet sections can be formed by one-third of an eight and one-half by eleven inch single sheet product to be easily inserted into standard No. 9 or No. 10 size envelopes. Other standard envelope sizes may be used. For example, each section <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> need only be less than four and one-half inches in height and ten and five-sixteenths inches in width to be capable of being inserted without folding in a standard No. 11 size business envelope. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts diagrammatically the insertion of sheet section <b>202</b> into a standard business size (No. 10) envelope indicated at <b>290</b>. Preferably, the variable data address field <b>20</b><i>d </i>is positioned on the sheet section <b>202</b> to align with a window <b>292</b> through the front wall of the envelope. In this way, each sheet section <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> is self-addressed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts the division of a sheet product <b>210</b> into three individual sheet sections, each sized to essentially fully fit a standard size business envelope (e.g. No. 9 or No. 10) without folding of the section or significant movement of the section within the envelope, one of ordinary skill will appreciate that other sheet product and sheet section sizes can be conveniently employed. For example, a standard eight and one-half by eleven inch sheet product according to the present invention can be provided and scored to define into six sheet sections of equal size, namely about three inches in height by about four inches in width. One such sheet section <b>302</b> is indicated diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. A first variable data code field <b>20</b><i>a </i>includes bar and numeral or other machine readable representations of a unique code and forms part of a removable element <b>70</b><i>c </i>of the sheet section. A second, variable data address field <b>20</b><i>d </i>is printed below. Removable element <b>70</b><i>c </i>may be provided with a closed perimeter opening indicated in phantom at <b>70</b><i>d </i>permitting use of the element <b>70</b><i>c </i>as a key tag or fob. The sheet section <b>302</b> can be inserted without folding into a comparably sized envelope or tipped onto a carrier <b>301</b> about four inches high and eight to nine inches wide, which can itself be received in a standard No. 9 or 10 size envelope without folding.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Advantages of the invention in the form of the sheet product <b>210</b> and like sheet products including sheet sections with a variable data address field is that both the address field and the unique code field(s) can be printed at the same time in a single pass of the core of the sheet product through a single printer. This insures accuracy and integrity between the variable data address field and unique code field(s) of each sheet section.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The core <b>12</b> of each sheet products <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>/<b>110</b> and <b>210</b> can be any thin sheet or web material having two major planar opposing sides, which can be printed upon. Preferably, the core is a flexible material which can be used with conventional, high speed, offset printing machines. Acceptable materials include metal foils, cellulose based products, fabrics, cloths and preferably plastics including, for example, ABS, acetates, butyrates, phenolics, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polystyrenes, polyurethanes and polyvinyl chlorides as monomers, copolymers and/or laminates. For example, the following specific trademarked products may be useful: Polyart I and II of Arjobex Synthetic Papers; various grades of GP700 from Bexford Limited (Engl.); Kapton, Tedlar and Telar of DuPont; Fascal, Fasprint and Crack n' Peel Plus of Fasson; Lasercal, Compucal II and Datacal Coating of Flexcon; Kimdura of Kimberly Clark; various grades of Pentaprint PR of Klockner Pentaplast; various grades of LLM-LV and Data Graphic II LLM of Lamart; Teslin of PPG Industries; the following products of Stanpat: APL-100, -110, -120, -150, -200, UM-546, UC-546, PPC-410, -450 and -460; and the following products of Transilwrap: Proprint, Transilprint, Transilmatte, T.X.P., Eve, Trans-Alley, Transglaze, Trans-AR, Trans V.L. and T Print; and others. These brand name products are treated or constructed in some fashion to make them particularly suited for use in one or more types of printing processes. Details regarding these products and companies and others are available to those of ordinary skill in the art through various sources including but not limited to published references such as <i>AUTOMATED ID NEWS </i>1993-1994 <i>REFERENCE GUIDE AND DIRECTORY</i>, published and distributed by Advanstar Communications, Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Each of the first and second coverings <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> can be any material which is suitably and sufficiently transparent and which can be applied to the core material selected in any suitable fashion for the material(s) selected without adversely affecting the core or the printing thereon. The coverings might be, for example, sheets or webs of any of a variety of transparent Transcote FG and Copolymer plastic films of Transilwrap, Inc. of Chicago, Ill., which are transparent in at least the visible and infrared light spectrums or any of a variety of similarly transparent Durafilm plastic films of Graphic Laminating, Inc. of Cleveland, Ohio. The plastic films are preferably adhered to the core with an adhesive appropriate for use with the materials selected for the core and transparent covering. Typically, polymer based adhesives are used with the exemplary plastic films identified above.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, such laminate films can be obtained from various commercial sources incorporating one or more magnetic (magnetizable) stripes, of the type found on most common credit cards. Alternatively, a separate magnetic stripe can be applied to the transparent covering in a conventional manner for such materials, such as by hot stamping. In such case(s), the removable elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>77</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>), <b>170</b><i>a</i>-<b>177</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) and <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>72</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) may be vertically oriented on each sheet <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>/<b>110</b> and <b>210</b> (90&#x2032; from the indicated orientation in the figures) to run the magnetic stripe(s) continuously along columns of such elements.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For the particular removable elements being made in the preferred embodiments disclosed in this application, namely, transaction size elements such as cards, key tags and fobs and labels, the above-identified coverings are preferred, as they provide a layer of polyester having good strength, wear and soil resistant properties which can be used on the outer side of the products <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>. The pressure sensitive adhesive used may be any conventional, commercially available, pressure sensitive contact adhesive suitable for use with the particular materials selected for the sheet product. For the embodiments being described, double coated, permanent adhesive transfer tapes, such as those available from Enterprise Tape Company of Dalton, Ill., for example, are suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The preferred methods of manufacturing the preferred sheet products <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> are quite similar and straightforward. Preferably, the static graphic fields are printed first on each selected side of the core material selected. Any known, conventional type of printer and printing process may be used including, for example, flexographic, offset lithographic, silkscreen, letter press, thermal transfer, thermal direct, ink jet, color laser, formed character impact, hot stamp, electrostatic, ion deposition, magnetographic, dot matrix, cycolor, photographic silver halide, sublimation, diffusion, pad, gravure, spray painting, dyeing, electrolytic plating, electroless plating, sputter deposition, in-mold decorating, flocking, embossing, vacuum evaporation metallizing, engraving, hot transfer, electro-photographic printing or electro ink printing process. Preferably, a high speed printing process such as flexographic or offset lithography is used to print on continuous webs of thin flexible planar material for efficiency and cost. A printing method and machine capable of simultaneously printing the first and second sets of static graphic fields on the first and second sides of the web in one pass through the printer is preferred for efficiency, but single side printing in separate passes may be preferred for quality.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, the core bearing the printed static graphic fields preferably is passed through a variable data field printer, preferably a programmable printer capable of printing variable data fields in at least bar and character format on at least one side of the core, which becomes the first side of the sheet products, in a single pass of the core through that printer. &#x201c;Character&#x201d; encompasses at least alphanumerics and conventional punctuation symbols. Commercially available printers having this capability include thermal transfer, thermal direct, ink jet, color laser, formed character impact, electrostatic, ion deposition, magnetographic, dot matrix, photographic and sublimation and are available from almost an innumerable list of suppliers. Again, printers printing on continuous webs are preferred for efficiency but printers printing on individual sheets (cut lengths of web) are preferred for quality. Currently, thermal transfer and laser printers are preferred in the industry for variable format printing, particularly of characters and bar codes. Generally speaking, existing thermal transfer printers provide high quality, sharp characters and bars while laser printers provide characters and bars which are not as sharp but more consistent in thickness. Improvements continue to be made to both ink jet and ion deposition printers as well. Ink jet and/or ion deposition printers may be preferred for speed. However, at least currently available machines, generally speaking, do not provide the quality provided by currently available thermal transfer and laser printers. Currently, laser printing is preferred for the particular embodiments <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> and <b>110</b> being described. For example, laser printers are made and/or distributed in the United States by such well-known corporations as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Kodak, NCR, Panasonic, Pentax, Ricoh, Siemans, Toshiba and Xerox. In addition, literally dozens of other, smaller manufacturers offer programmed or programmable printers which can be used or can be configured to be used to perform the steps indicated above. Again, the material selected for the core <b>12</b> should be compatible with the preferred printing method and equipment or the printing methods and equipment selected to be compatible with a preferred material. For example, for laser printing, a microvoided polysilicate plastic sheet material, having at least about sixty percent porosity is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The programmable code field printer selected preferably is configured to print each of the variable data fields. With respect to sheet products <b>10</b>, <b>100</b>/<b>100</b> the first plurality of code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>are printed in a first direction and the second plurality of code fields <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b </i>in a direction transverse to the first direction of the first code field of the set on the one side of the sheet or web constituting the first side <b>14</b> of the core <b>12</b>. As is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, the bars and numerals of the first plurality of code fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>27</b><i>a </i>are printed in a portrait mode running horizontally across the sheet <b>10</b>, while the second plurality of code fields <b>20</b><i>b</i>-<b>27</b><i>b </i>are printed in a landscape mode running vertically along the side edges of the sheet <b>10</b>. This is accomplished in straightforward fashion by simply programming the computer to identify the characters to be printed at predetermined locations on the web in defined angular orientations to the web. In this way, all of the code fields are printed on the web in a single pass of the web through the printer. Preferably, the first and second coverings <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> are then applied to the opposing sides <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> of the web in a conventional manner for the covering material selected. The stripes of pressure sensitive adhesive <b>60</b> and <b>64</b> are also applied, with or without release paper <b>62</b> and <b>66</b>, respectively, for the embodiment <b>10</b>, <b>100</b> or <b>110</b> selected.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Separate printing of static graphic and variable data fields is presently preferred for speed, cost and quality. However, the capabilities of programmable printers continues to improve in all three categories. In some instances, it is already possible to simultaneously print certain types of static graphic and variable data fields at the same time using the same programmable printer in a single pass of the core through the printer. Duplex printers are now becoming available which permit the printing of variable data fields on both sides of a core in a single pass through such printers. Sheet products printed by such devices are intended to be encompassed by the present invention. The present invention is also intended to cover all instances where static graphic fields may be printed before, after or simultaneously with the variable data fields on one or both sides of a continuous or cut length core.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, if the first embodiment sheet product <b>10</b> is produced, the printed, covered web is preferably fed through a cutter which scores the sheet products <b>10</b> through the core <b>12</b>, covering <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> and stripes <b>60</b> and <b>64</b>, where present, to define the sets of removable elements <b>70</b><i>a</i>-<b>77</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>b</i>-<b>77</b><i>b </i>and cuts a continuous web into the individual sheet product lengths if a continuous web is used. If the second embodiment sheet product <b>110</b> is being made, the side edge portions <b>67</b>, <b>68</b> bearing the pressure sensitive adhesive strips <b>60</b> and <b>64</b> may be folded by conventional stock folding equipment upon an immediately adjoining central portion of the web. The longitudinal edge folded web product is thereafter preferably fed through a cutter which scores each of the individual sheet products <b>110</b> to define the plurality of sets of removable elements <b>170</b><i>a</i>-<b>177</b><i>a </i>and <b>170</b><i>b</i>-<b>177</b><i>b </i>and cuts the continuous web into the individual sheet product lengths <b>110</b> if a continuous web is used.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Sheet product <b>210</b> and similar sheet products are made in a similar fashion. In particular, the plurality of sets of variable data fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>-<b>22</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>d</i>-<b>22</b><i>d </i>are printed on the first side <b>214</b> of a pair of opposing major planar sides <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> of the thin core <b>212</b>. Each set of printed variable data fields, collectively <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>, includes at least a first data field <b>20</b><i>a </i>or <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>a </i>or <b>21</b><i>c </i>and <b>22</b><i>a </i>or <b>22</b><i>c</i>, printed with a unique code preferably in at least a bar or other machine readable format. The unique code of each set of variable data fields <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, printed on the first side <b>214</b> of core <b>212</b> is different from the unique code of each other set of the variable data fields <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> printed on the first side <b>214</b> of core <b>212</b> and each set of variable data fields further includes a second data field <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>21</b><i>d</i>, <b>22</b><i>d </i>printed with a name and mailing address uniquely associated with the unique code of the set of printed data fields <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. The name and address of the second data field <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>21</b><i>d</i>, <b>22</b><i>d </i>of each of the sets of printed variable data fields <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are different from the name and address of the second data field of each other set of the data fields <b>20</b>, <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> printed on the first side <b>214</b> of the core <b>212</b>. All of the variable data fields <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> preferably are printed in one pass of the first side <b>214</b> of the core <b>212</b> through a suitable printer. A first cover <b>254</b> is applied to the first side <b>214</b> of core <b>212</b> overlying at least one and preferably both variable data fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>c</i>-<b>22</b><i>c</i>, while preferably avoiding each of the name and address variable data fields <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>and <b>22</b><i>d</i>, to save manufacturing costs. Again, the preferred plastic film coverings identified are adhered or otherwise laminated in suitable, known ways for the materials involved to the first side <b>214</b> of the core <b>212</b> and are sufficiently transparent in the visible light and infrared spectrum to permit observers and suitable optical equipment, such as conventional infrared laser-equipped bar code readers, to read and decipher the bar format code underlying the first covering <b>254</b>. Again, a second, similar, if not identical, covering <b>256</b> is applied to the second major planar side <b>216</b> of the core <b>212</b>, opposite the first covering <b>254</b>. The sheets <b>210</b> are thereafter scored completely, or nearly completely, through the core <b>212</b> and coverings <b>254</b>, <b>256</b> to divide the sheet product <b>210</b> into the plurality of sheet sections <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> and to define at least one, and in the case of sheet product <b>210</b>, two elements <b>70</b><i>a </i>and <b>70</b><i>d</i>, <b>71</b><i>a </i>and <b>71</b><i>d </i>and <b>72</b><i>a </i>and <b>72</b><i>d</i>, in each sheet section <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>, respectively, removable from the sheet section. Simultaneously, closed perimeter openings <b>70</b><i>d</i>, <b>71</b><i>d </i>and <b>72</b><i>d </i>are similarly scored through the sheet product <b>210</b> within one of the two removable elements of each of the sheet sections <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> to permit those elements <b>70</b><i>c</i>, <b>71</b><i>c</i>, <b>72</b><i>c </i>to be used as key tags or fobs. Each sheet section <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> of the sheet product <b>210</b> can thereafter be inserted into a separate envelope <b>290</b> with the address field <b>20</b><i>d</i>-<b>22</b><i>d</i>, respectively, aligned with the window <b>292</b> through the envelope <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the above-described embodiments. For example, in addition to printing unique code fields for each associated set of elements, other fields can be reserved for printing other data uniquely associated with the code or with the person or entities ultimately assigned the codes, for example, names, addresses, phone numbers, dates, vital statistics, etc. Many if not most programmable printers are capable of reading such data from a conventional data storage device, such as a tape drive, disk drive, etc. and printing the information in fields which are predefined with respect to the core <b>12</b> and, preferably, with respect to one or more of the removable elements which are ultimately defined on the core.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Also, although one transaction sized laminated card and one adhesive back tab or label have been identified in the disclosed embodiments as constituting each set of removable elements, additional and/or alternate elements can be provided. For example, multiple transaction sized cards, multiple labels, and other elements including, for example, an element having a hole or opening cut therethrough for attachment to a key ring, hook or the like, can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">One of ordinary skill will appreciate the order in which steps are taken may be immaterial. For example, while printing a static graphic field initially on a continuous web is preferred for rapid, inexpensive printing, static fields can be printed directly on cut sheets. Typically, it will also be immaterial whether the code fields are printed before, after or during the printing of the static graphic fields. Further, the order in which coverings are applied is generally not critical, and coverings could be applied to one side of a core after printing upon that side is completed and before printing is performed on the other side of the core.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, one of ordinary skill should be aware that it is now also possible to first laminate a tough, protective transparent film of vinyl or polyester to a relatively inexpensive core of PVC or other inexpensive backing or stock material and print variable data (and/or static graphic) fields directly onto the vinyl or polyester laminate layer. Smudge resistant, scratch resistant, high resin thermal transfer films now available from such manufacturers as Sony and Ricoh are sufficiently adhesive and tough that they do not require a protective film covering. The invention is intended to cover such sheet products as well. In such instances, the core will actually be a laminate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> depict a fifth printed sheet product of the present invention indicated generally at <b>410</b>. The sheet product <b>410</b> includes a thin, flexible core <b>412</b> similar but not identical to cores <b>12</b> and <b>212</b>, but which still has a pair of major planar opposing sides <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The first major planar side <b>414</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. There is preferably printed on the first major planar side <b>414</b> of the core <b>412</b> a plurality of sets of variable data fields. In the depicted sheet product <b>410</b>, one full set of and two partial adjoining sets of data fields are shown. Again, each data field set includes at least two or more separate variable data fields, three data fields <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>c </i>and <b>21</b><i>d </i>of the full data set being depicted while adjoining data fields <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>d </i>of one set and <b>22</b><i>c </i>of another set are shown. Again, the individual variable data fields are spaced from one another in each set and between sets. Either or both sides <b>414</b>, <b>416</b> of core <b>412</b> may also be printed with a first plurality of static graphic fields, again indicated collectively and by example only at <b>30</b><i>d </i>and <b>31</b><i>a</i>-<b>31</b><i>e</i>. Again, the second major planar side <b>416</b> can be printed as indicated earlier for any of the previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it will be seen that the core <b>412</b> differs from the previous cores <b>12</b> and <b>212</b> in that it is formed of two separate sheets of material <b>412</b><i>a </i>and <b>412</b><i>b </i>which generally adjoin one another longitudinal edge to longitudinal edge&#x2014;side by side. The sheets <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>are preferably held together by at least a first covering <b>454</b>, which preferably overlaps at least portions of each of the sheets <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>and further overlaps at least over the unique, at least machine readable code variable data fields <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>22</b><i>c </i>on the one sheet <b>412</b><i>b </i>and yet does not extend over the name and address variable data field <b>21</b><i>d </i>on the remaining sheet <b>412</b><i>a</i>. First covering <b>454</b> is preferably at least sufficiently transparent to machines and preferably humans to read the underlying printed variable data code fields. Again, as was the case with the previous embodiments, a second covering <b>456</b> is preferably applied to the second major planar side <b>416</b> of the core <b>412</b> directly opposite the first covering <b>454</b> and a numeric variable data field code on the first side of the core <b>412</b>. Preferably, each covering <b>454</b> and <b>456</b> includes a solid film layer <b>454</b><i>a</i>, <b>456</b><i>a </i>which is adhered to the core <b>412</b> by an adhesive layer <b>454</b><i>b</i>, <b>456</b><i>b</i>. Preferably, adhesive layers <b>454</b><i>b</i>, <b>456</b><i>b </i>can be activated in some way, for example by heat, ultraviolet or visible light, to permanently bond the separate sheets <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>and coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> together so as to provide a protective outer covering on either side of removable portions of the sheet product <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The sheet product <b>410</b> is again preferably scored through its core <b>412</b> and, where present, first covering <b>454</b>, second covering <b>456</b> and any adhesive layers adhering those coverings to the core. Horizontal score lines <b>401</b> and <b>403</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> define opposing upper and lower edges of one of the plurality of sheet sections <b>404</b>, which sections are scored or otherwise separated from the longer sheet product <b>410</b>. Each sheet section <b>404</b> taken from the sheet product <b>410</b> contains a separate one of the plurality of sets of printed data fields. In addition, the scoring preferably defines at least one element which is removable from the sheet section <b>404</b>. In particular, first element <b>71</b><i>a </i>is removable from the sheet section <b>404</b> and is defined physically by scoring which is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> by the bold broken lines indicated by the lead line of reference numeral <b>71</b><i>a</i>. Scoring is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> by solid vertical lines <b>71</b><i>a</i>, which define cut sides of the removable element <b>71</b><i>a</i>. A second removable element <b>71</b><i>c </i>is defined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> by scoring and is also indicated by the lead line from that reference numeral. Again, a closed perimeter opening <b>71</b><i>d </i>may be scored within the one removable element <b>71</b><i>c</i>, as was the case with the third embodiment <b>210</b>. It will be appreciated that although broken lines <b>401</b>, <b>403</b>, <b>71</b><i>a</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>and <b>71</b><i>d </i>are used to represent scoring, the score lines <b>401</b>, <b>403</b> and preferably the score lines defining elements <b>71</b><i>a</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>and <b>71</b><i>d </i>are continuous cuts.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">If desired, another covering <b>458</b> can be applied to one side of one of the existing coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> in phantom. Preferably the covering <b>458</b> is releasably bonded to one of the coverings <b>456</b> with a pressure sensitive adhesive <b>458</b><i>a</i>, which will adhere to but release from the opposing covering <b>456</b> without delaminating that covering <b>456</b> from the core <b>412</b> or from the other covering <b>454</b>. The preferred purpose of providing such an additional covering <b>458</b> is to permit the remainder of the sheet section <b>404</b> to be scored entirely through the core <b>412</b> and immediately facing layers <b>454</b> and <b>456</b>. Conventional scoring equipment can be dimensioned sufficiently accuracy to permit full scoring through the core <b>412</b> and coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> while leaving the remaining covering <b>458</b> substantially if not essentially unscored. Less desirably, covering <b>458</b> can be deleted and small continuous strips of material left between elements <b>71</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>71</b><i>c </i>and the remainder of section <b>404</b> to retain elements <b>71</b><i>a</i>, <b>71</b><i>c </i>in place in the section <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> depicts diagrammatically the components of a line for making the component of an assembling a transaction card mailer. For the embodiment sheet product <b>410</b>, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, two separate continuous webs of core material <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>are fed from separate supply rolls through a pair of aligning nips <b>460</b>, <b>462</b> which hold the two sheets <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>in adjoining side by side position until the sheets can be bonded together downstream in the laminating process. The sheets <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>may be preprinted with static data fields or printed while being passed through the line, for example, by a continuous web printer indicated diagrammatically and in phantom by opposing print rolls <b>464</b>, <b>466</b>. The statically printed sheets are then preferably passed through a variable data field printer <b>468</b> which prints all variable data fields on a first side <b>414</b> in a single pass of the sheets <b>412</b><i>a</i>, <b>412</b><i>b </i>through the printer <b>468</b>. If desired, a second printer, indicated diagrammatically and in phantom at <b>470</b>, can be provided opposing the first printer <b>468</b> to print on the remaining side <b>416</b> of the resulting sheet product <b>410</b>. After printing, first and second coverings <b>454</b> and <b>456</b> are preferably applied to opposing sides of the core <b>412</b> at least partially overlapping both of the sheets <b>412</b><i>a </i>and <b>412</b><i>b</i>. Opposing rolls <b>460</b>, <b>462</b> or other suitable means are preferably configured to activate the adhesive layer supplied with each covering <b>454</b>, <b>456</b>, for example by heating or by generating a visible or ultraviolet light while pressing the coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> to the core <b>412</b> and preferably to permanently bond and laminate the coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> to the core <b>412</b>. If provided, the third covering <b>458</b> is preferably applied downstream from the rolls <b>460</b>, <b>462</b> so as to not interfere with the activation of the adhesive on the coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b>. The continuous sheet product <b>410</b> is scored, for example by a pair of opposing roll cutters <b>470</b>, <b>472</b>, to define the plurality of individual, scored sheet sections <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, etc. which may thereafter be inserted individually into standard, rectangular, business size envelopes <b>290</b><i>a</i>, <b>290</b><i>i </i>through a conventional insertion machine, which is indicated diagrammatically at <b>476</b>. One completed mailer <b>480</b> comprising envelope <b>290</b><i>a </i>and sheet section <b>402</b> is indicated. Paper sheet material <b>412</b><i>a </i>may be any paper stock compatible with the adhesive materials selected for use on the first and second coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b>, while sheet material <b>412</b><i>b </i>is preferably one of the aforementioned materials suitable for laser printing. The pressure sensitive, adhesive backed third covering <b>458</b> if used, might be a high density polyethylene or polypropylene 4 mils thick, low tack pressure sensitive adhesive, self-wound, packaging film available from any of a number of tape suppliers including Consolidated Graphic Materials of Somerset, N.J., Flexcon Co., Inc. of Spencer, Mass. or Tape Rite of New Hyde Park, N.Y.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> depicts a sixth embodiment printed sheet product of the present invention particularly for mailers indicated generally at <b>510</b>. The sheet product <b>510</b> includes a thin flexible core identical to core <b>412</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> having major planar opposing sides, a first side of which is seen in the figure. Preferably printed on the first major planar side of the core shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, are a plurality of sets of variable data fields, two full sets of variable data fields being shown. Again, each data field set includes at least two or more separate, variable data fields. Three variable data fields <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and <b>21</b><i>d </i>of the first full data set are depicted, while variable data fields <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and <b>22</b><i>d </i>of the other adjoining set are shown. Again, the individual variable data fields are spaced from one another in each set and between sets. Either or both sides of the core may be printed with a first plurality of static graphic fields which are indicated by example at <b>31</b><i>d</i>, <b>31</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; and <b>31</b><i>e</i>. Again, the second major planar side can be printed with any desired static or variable data fields or left unprinted as indicated earlier for any of the previous embodiments. Again, the laminate construction of sheet product <b>510</b> is identical to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> for sheet product <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Sheet product <b>510</b> is also preferably scored through the core and, where present, first and second outer covering (e.g. coverings <b>454</b> and <b>456</b>) and any adhesive layers adhering those coverings to the core. Horizontal score lines <b>501</b>, <b>503</b>, <b>505</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> define opposing upper and lower edges of a plurality of adjoining sheet sections <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, etc. which are separated from the longer sheet product <b>510</b> for individual mailing. Each sheet section <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> taken from the sheet product <b>510</b> contains a separate one of the plurality of sets of printed variable data fields. In addition, in this particular embodiment, the scoring additionally defines two irregularly yet identically shaped elements, indicated at <b>571</b>, <b>571</b>&#x2032; which are removable from the sheet section <b>504</b>. The scoring is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> by both solid, horizontal and vertical lines <b>571</b><i>a</i>, <b>571</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and by intermediate solid line <b>571</b><i>c</i>. Each half of solid line <b>571</b><i>c </i>is a reversed mirror image of the other half of that line such that the two irregularly yet identically shaped elements <b>571</b>, <b>571</b>&#x2032; are provided. Again, if desired, a closed perimeter opening <b>571</b><i>d</i>, <b>571</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; can be provided within the boundaries of each of the elements <b>571</b>, <b>571</b>&#x2032; to enable their attachment to a key holder, key chain or the like. Again, the scoring <b>571</b><i>a</i>-<b>571</b><i>d </i>is preferably continuous down to an underlying covering like covering <b>458</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, to releasably retain each of the elements <b>571</b>, <b>571</b>&#x2032; within each sheet section <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> when the sheet sections <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> are separated from one another for individual mailing. The removable card elements <b>571</b>, <b>571</b>&#x2032; can collectively have a size of a standard transaction card, e.g. about 2.125&#xd7;3.375 inches with the portions of each card bearing openings <b>571</b><i>d</i>, <b>571</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; being wider than the width of the immediately adjoining portion of the adjoining removable card element. The narrow portion of each card should be sufficiently wide to enable the code thereon to be machine read, particularly through a swipe reader. That would be at least about one inch for one-dimensional printed bar code or one-half inch for encoded magnetic strip. Other dimensions may be or may become possible for different swipe readers. For printed bar codes, closed perimeter openings <b>571</b><i>d</i>, <b>571</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; preferably should be positioned at least one inch from the longest straight outer edge of the card <b>571</b>, <b>571</b>&#x2032; to avoid passing through the &#x201c;read&#x201d; area of the bar code reader.

Each sheet section <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, etc. can be processed after separation from the main sheet product <b>610</b> by machine reading of the machine readable code (<b>21</b><i>a</i>) and thereafter applying the appropriate code and/or other information to the magnetic strip material <b>652</b>, if such code/information is preassigned in the system being employed. Alternatively but less desirably, the magnetic strip <b>652</b> may be precoded and then the strip <b>652</b> and the machine readable code <b>21</b><i>a </i>read together in a post-assembly step to collate preassigned code on the magnetic strip with the machine readable code printed on the sheet section <b>604</b>. It should be appreciated that the alphanumeric code in field <b>21</b><i>a </i>could be printed on removable card element <b>671</b> in addition to or in place of the magnetic strip and that plural removable cards rectangular or irregular but identically shaped like cards <b>571</b>, <b>571</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, could be provided with pairs of parallel magnetic strips on the sheet product by rotating elements <b>571</b>, <b>571</b>&#x2032; 90&#xb0; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> depict an eighth embodiment printed sheet product of the present invention indicated generally at <b>710</b>. Referring to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the sheet product <b>710</b> is formed by a one-piece flexible, printable core <b>712</b> having a pair of major planar opposing sides <b>714</b> and <b>716</b>, seen together in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. There is preferably printed on the first major planar side <b>714</b> of the core <b>712</b>, a plurality of sets of variable data fields. In the depicted sheet product <b>710</b>, three full sets of data fields are shown. Each data field set includes at least two separate variable data fields, data fields <b>21</b><i>d</i>, <b>21</b><i>e </i>of the first full set, <b>22</b><i>d</i>, <b>22</b><i>e </i>of the second full set and <b>24</b><i>d</i>, <b>24</b><i>e </i>of the third set being shown. Again, each of the variable data fields are spaced from one another in each set and between sets. Either or both sides <b>714</b>, <b>716</b> of core <b>712</b> may be printed with a first plurality of static graphic fields, again indicated collectively and by example only at <b>31</b><i>d</i>, <b>31</b><i>e</i>. Again, the second major planar side <b>716</b> can be printed in any manner desired as indicated earlier for any of the previous embodiments. Core <b>712</b> preferably is of two piece construction but includes a flexible carrier sheet <b>712</b><i>a </i>to which is releasably adhered a flexible polymer magnetic strip <b>712</b><i>b </i>by adhesive layer <b>712</b><i>c</i>. Magnetic strip <b>712</b><i>b </i>can be obtained with a printable vinyl surface <b>712</b><i>d</i>. If desired, first and/or second coverings like coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, can be provided on either or both sides of the core <b>712</b> after printing but before scoring. Sheet product <b>710</b> is preferably completely scored through in continuous, spaced parallel lines <b>701</b>, <b>703</b>, <b>705</b>, <b>707</b>, <b>709</b>, etc. to define separate sheet sections <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>708</b>, etc. and only partially scored through in continuous closed circuit cuts <b>771</b><i>a</i>, <b>772</b><i>a</i>, <b>778</b><i>a </i>so as to define flexible magnetic card elements <b>771</b>, <b>772</b>, <b>778</b>, etc. removable from each individual sheet section <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>708</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an alternate construction, the magnetic strip <b>712</b><i>b </i>can be permanently adhered to the &#x201c;rear&#x201d; side (i.e. side <b>716</b>) of carrier <b>712</b><i>a </i>and the exposed surface of the carrier used for printing.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Regardless of whether first and/or second outer coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> are provided, there is suggestedly provided at least one outer covering <b>458</b>, including a strong yet flexible carrier <b>458</b><i>b</i>, preferably supporting a pressure sensitive adhesive layer <b>458</b><i>a </i>releasably attached to the rear major side <b>716</b> of the core <b>712</b> &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; such magnetic layer <b>712</b><i>c</i>. The sheet product <b>710</b> preferably would be scored completely through the core <b>712</b> with a continuous, closed circuit cut, but not through the outer covering <b>458</b>, to define a removable magnetic element within each sheet product and along parallel, horizontal lines <b>701</b>, <b>703</b>, <b>705</b> and <b>707</b> entirely through the core and the outer layer <b>458</b>, if provided, to separate individual sheet sections <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> and <b>708</b> from the sheet product <b>710</b>. Again, each sheet section <b>702</b>, <b>704</b> and <b>708</b> is preferably sized to approximately the internal dimensions of a window-type envelope (e.g. envelope <b>290</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) with which the mailer would be used (not separately depicted) so as to remain in view of the window. Uncoated or printable white vinyl coated flexible magnetic material can be obtained in roll form from any of the variety of manufacturers, including RJF International Corp., Koroseal Magnetics and/or Flexing Industries, Inc., all of Cincinnati, Ohio. Such flexible magnetic material strip can be ordered precoated with a pressure sensitive adhesive or ordered without adhesive and coated with a selected pressure sensitive or other adhesive to releasably or permanently retain it on the core carrier <b>712</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> also depicts yet another variation of the invention in which only part of the variable data set associated with each sheet section is unique. Each particular sheet section may or may not include an alphanumeric code unique to the individual named on that sheet section. Rather, the sheet product is printed with consecutive data sets that include a unique name and address for each data set but a semi-variable data set such as an address and telephone number, which would be common to some individual sheet sections (e.g. <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>) but change for others (e.g. <b>708</b>). Services are now available which can identify customers or potential customers which frequent particular locations of multi-location businesses or which are located most closely to particular locations of multi-location businesses. Such information would be provided to the sheet product preparer which would, with appropriate data processing support, print the core <b>712</b> with the appropriate data fields. If desired, the data can be clustered so as to print simultaneously all of the unique names and addresses associated with each individual business location address and phone number as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> or could, for example, provide names and addresses for a particular zip code and print the appropriate business location address and phone number associated with each name in that zip code. The static data field would identify the common name of the business (i.e. &#x201c;JOE'S PIZZA&#x201d;) in the static data field <b>31</b><i>d</i>, <b>32</b><i>d</i>, <b>34</b><i>d </i>while semi-variable data field <b>21</b><i>e</i>, <b>22</b><i>e</i>, <b>24</b><i>e </i>would change within runs of the sheet product (as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>) or from run to run. Thus, each removable element <b>771</b>, <b>772</b>, <b>778</b>, etc. could be used as a refrigerator magnet and would bear the address and phone number of the nearest location of the business also identified on the magnet in the static data field.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> depicts diagrammatically a ninth sheet product of the present invention indicated generally at <b>810</b>. A first major planar side <b>814</b> of the sheet prouct <b>810</b> is depicted in that figure. Preferably printed on the first major planar side <b>814</b> are a plurality of sets of variable data fields, two complete sets being shown in the figure. The first set includes a variable, machine readable code field <b>21</b><i>a </i>and a variable name and address field <b>21</b><i>d</i>. The second set includes a similar variable machine readable code field <b>22</b><i>a </i>and variable name and address field <b>22</b><i>d</i>. The variable code of each set is uniquely associated with the name and address of the other variable code field of the set. Applied to the first major planar surface <b>814</b>, preferably by an adhesive layer <b>860</b> is a strip <b>862</b> containing a series of individual radio frequency transponders indicated in phantom at <b>864</b>, <b>866</b>, etc. Such transponders would have the characteristic of broadcasting in response to a predetermined radio frequency signal, a coded radio frequency reply, which can be received and decoded to identify the individual transponder <b>864</b>, <b>866</b>, etc. As a final step, the sheet product <b>810</b> would be scored into at least separate consecutive individual sheet sections <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, etc., which could be individually mailed. Each transponder <b>864</b>, <b>866</b>, etc. will be removable from each sheet section <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, but the sheet product <b>810</b> can be configured in a variety of ways depending upon the desired end form of the removable element containing the transponder. For example, the sheet product <b>810</b> can be scored at regularly spaced intervals, for example, along spaced apart lines <b>801</b>, <b>803</b>, <b>805</b>, to define the individual, mailable sheet segments <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, etc., the scoring cutting completely through the transponder strip <b>862</b>. The strip <b>862</b> can be lightly adhered to a continuous, flexible printable sheet core by a pressure sensitive adhesive layer <b>860</b>, which would remain with the core allowing individual removable elements <b>863</b>, <b>865</b> with transponders <b>864</b>, <b>866</b>, etc. to be removed from the individual sheet portion <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, etc. It may be desired to permit each removable element <b>863</b>, <b>865</b>, to carry a layer of pressure sensitive adhesive, in which case it may be desirable to adhere one side of a release strip bearing the pressure sensitive adhesive (not depicted) and the transponder strip <b>862</b> directly to the core. The release strip would remain on the core while the element <b>863</b>, <b>865</b> is removed carrying away the pressure sensitive adhesive layer releasably attaching the element to the release strip. Also, if desired, protective coverings could be provided on either or both sides of the core. Also, each removable element <b>864</b>, <b>866</b> can be separately scored within the edges of each sheet section <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, etc. if it is desirable that the removable element be smaller in its maximum dimension than the minimum dimension of the sheet section.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">At some point following the application of the transponder strip <b>862</b> and the printing of the machine readable variable data fields <b>21</b><i>e</i>, <b>22</b><i>e</i>, etc., each machine readable code <b>21</b><i>e</i>, <b>22</b><i>e </i>should be associated with each unique transponder <b>864</b>, <b>866</b> in a database, for example, by simultaneously or sequentially reading a machine readable code <b>21</b><i>a</i>, activating its associated transponder <b>864</b> and decoding the transponders unique responsive coded reply signal. In an alternate version of the invention, each unique transponder <b>864</b>, <b>866</b> can be pre-assigned uniquely in a database to a unique individual and the process of printing of the variable name and address databases <b>21</b><i>d</i>, <b>22</b><i>d </i>controlled by activating each transponder <b>864</b>, <b>866</b>, identify the unique code and then the individual preassociated with that transponder and printing either the name and address of that individual on the printable core of the sheet product either with or without a machine readable code. Transponder strip <b>862</b> should be sought from a manufacturer of such products such as, for example, Hughes Identification Devices of Tustin Calif., or from other manufacturers of such transponders such as Cotag International of Wilmington, Del.; Abbhafo Incorp. of San Diego, Calif.; Balogh T.A.G. of Ann Arbor Mich.; Motorola of San Diego, Calif. and Texas Instruments of Attleboro Mass. It may be necessary to package individual transponders <b>864</b>, <b>866</b>, etc., into a strip <b>862</b>, for example by laminating the transponders between outer coverings such as coverings <b>454</b>, <b>456</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-13</figref> if the named manufacturers will not supply such transponders in continuous rolls. Also the sheet product <b>810</b> could include such outer protective layers <b>454</b>, <b>456</b>, if the outer material of the strip <b>862</b> is deemed to be insufficiently protective. It will further be appreciated that so-called &#x201c;smart cards&#x201d;, which can also be polled directly or from a small distance, can be conveniently and inexpensively handled in the same way for mailing or distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that other changes can be made to the above-described embodiment disclosed and suggested without departing from the broad, inventive concepts thereof. For example, each of the variable data field sets may include only two variable data fields printed on opposing sides of a core by a duplex printer. Each cut sheet section would therefore have only one variable data field on either of its two sides. More than one variable data field per set can be provided on either or both sides of the core. However, all variable data fields of the one set would be printed on one or both sides of the sheet section in a fashion similar in concept to the other previously described embodiments of the invention. While single ply cores are preferred for cost and simplicity in most uses, multiple plies might be used for various reasons. It will further be appreciated that sheets <b>412</b><i>a </i>and <b>412</b><i>b </i>might be partially overlapped to be directly joined together by an intermediate adhesive layer. It will further be appreciated that in most cases, it is only necessary that the unique code be identified with a unique name or unique name and address as, in some instances, it may be desirable to assign multiple unique codes to one person or entity. It should be understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but is intended to cover any modifications which are within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
