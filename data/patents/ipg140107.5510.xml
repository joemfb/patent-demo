<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage application of International Application No. PCT/JP2010/061896, filed 14 Jul. 2010, which claims priority to Japanese Application No. 2009-172319, filed 23 Jul. 2009, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an art to manage an inspection work, a maintenance work, and so on of equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a conventional schedule maintenance of equipment, respective business steps such as management of a maintenance standard, management of a maintenance schedule, management of a maintenance work performance, management of a maintenance history have been performed based on perceptions and experiences of experts, and thereby, the schedule maintenance has been established. In recent years, an approach in which the respective business steps are individually assigned to computers to effectively operate the maintenance schedule has also been made.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is an art disclosed in Patent Document 1 as an example using a computer system for the maintenance work. In this conventional example, information relating to performance of a maintenance work of a plant inputted from a terminal is consolidated to a maintenance history database.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, there is a possibility in which an oversight of data occurs when the number of equipment and so on being maintenance objects is very large. There is a possibility in which defectiveness occurs in transfer of data when a calculation result of one computer is used by another computer, because respective computers are independent from one another in the conventional art in which respective business steps are assigned to the computers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An object of the present invention is to avoid the possibility in which defectiveness occurs in the transfer of data by connecting input/output of calculation results of the computer in the respective business steps, and to constantly maintain a master including standard information for maintenance and inventory in an optimum state.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, operations of the equipment total management system according to the present embodiment are described with reference to the configuration chart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and flowcharts from FIG. <b>14</b> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a flow of the process of the equipment total management system for the business division of the &#x201c;inspection&#x201d;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the inspection calendar creating part <b>103</b> creates an inspection calendar by referring to the inspection standard master <b>102</b> (step S<b>1401</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a view illustrating a configuration example of the inspection standard master <b>102</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, information such as an inspection apparatus, an inspection cycle, an inspection method is held in the inspection standard master <b>102</b>. Namely, the inspection calendar creating part <b>103</b> refers to the inspection cycle inside the inspection standard master <b>102</b>, and creates the inspection calendar indicating an inspection date by each inspection apparatus. For example, the inspection calendar with flags indicating that the inspection is to be performed by every one week from a standard date (first inspection date) is created when the inspection cycle of an apparatus A is one week.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view illustrating an example of the inspection calendar created by the inspection calendar creating part <b>103</b>. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there are a &#x201c;welding machine hydraulic pressure inspection&#x201d;, an &#x201c;electric cleaning driving apparatus inspection&#x201d;, and a &#x201c;front surface hydraulic pressure apparatus inspection&#x201d;, as inspection apparatuses, and flags of &#x201c;/1&#x201d; are added to the dates (inspection planned dates) when these apparatuses are to be inspected. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, concrete inspection planned dates are not indicated, but the inspection planned dates are defined in the inspection cycle determined by each inspection apparatus. Note that there are flags of &#x201c;1/1&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2212;/1&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in which an &#x201c;actual performance/plan&#x201d; is represented by the flag. The &#x201c;1/1&#x201d; represents that the inspection is already performed at the corresponding inspection planned date, and the &#x201c;&#x2212;/1&#x201d; represents that the inspection is not performed yet at the corresponding inspection planned date.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Subsequently, the inspection performance management part <b>104</b> refers to the inspection calendar, and judges whether or not today is the inspection planned date (step S<b>1402</b>). When today is not the inspection planned date, the judgment of the step S<b>1402</b> is repeated until it is the inspection planned date. On the other hand, when today is the inspection planned date, the inspection performance management part <b>104</b> notifies maintenance workers that today is the inspection planned date (step S<b>1403</b>). There is no limitation in notification modes of this notification method, and a mail notifying the inspection planned date may be sent to a corresponding maintenance worker, or a screen notifying the inspection planned date may be displayed on a display.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, the inspection performance management part <b>104</b> creates and outputs an inspection work instruction data, (step S<b>1404</b>). This inspection work instruction data is created by referring to the inspection standard master <b>102</b>, and includes what is an inspection apparatus, how to perform the inspection (inspection method), matters to be attended to at the inspection time, and so on. The created inspection work instruction data is notified to the maintenance worker by means of an action guidance. The maintenance worker performs the inspection work in accordance with contents of the inspection work instruction data.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Subsequently, a result of the inspection work is inputted by an inspection worker (step S<b>1405</b>). Operation states of the apparatus (vibration, temperature, operation speed, and so on of the apparatus), presence/absence of a sign of occurrence of abnormal state, and so on are inputted as the result of the inspection work.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, the equipment state analysis/accumulation part <b>105</b> analyses a state of the inspection apparatus from the inputted result of the inspection work, and accumulates the inspection result (step S<b>1406</b>). As a concrete example of an analysis method of the inspection apparatus state, it is judged that an abnormal state occurs when the inspection apparatus does not operate at all, or it is judged that there is a possibility that the abnormal state occurs when the temperature of the inspection apparatus is high and when the operation speed is slow.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The inspection results accumulated by the equipment state analysis/accumulation part <b>105</b> can be referred to on the screen. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a view illustrating an example of an inspection result reference screen. A field of the inspection apparatus is represented in a &#x201c;specialty&#x201d;, an equipment where the inspection apparatus is disposed is represented in an &#x201c;equipment&#x201d;, an inspection apparatus is represented in an &#x201c;apparatus&#x201d;, and an inspection result is represented in a &#x201c;state&#x201d; at an inspection result display area <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When a &#x201c;JUMP to CDT&#x201d; button is pressed, the screen is switched to a screen referring to state information sequentially obtained by a system named an online CDT from the inspection apparatus. The online CDT obtains the detailed state information from the inspection apparatus, and therefore, the user presses the &#x201c;JUMP to CDT&#x201d; button when the more detailed information is to be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An inspection result list of the inspection apparatus belonging to a corresponding field among a machine, an electricity, or an instrumentation can be displayed at the inspection result display area <b>401</b> by pressing a &#x201c;remarks for machine&#x201d; button, a &#x201c;remarks for electricity&#x201d; button, or a &#x201c;remarks for instrumentation&#x201d; button.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Transition of recent inspection results can be displayed in a graphic chart by pressing a &#x201c;trend data&#x201d; button. A transition of the inspection results of which apparatus is to be displayed can be selected from, for example, the apparatuses displayed at the inspection result display area <b>401</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">New information relating to operations such that, for example, a product with a certain tonnage is added to an apparatus is displayed by pressing an &#x201c;operation information&#x201d; button. A history relating to failure of the apparatus is displayed by a &#x201c;failure record&#x201d; button. A relationship between the apparatus and quality is displayed by a &#x201c;quality information&#x201d; button. A result of the analysis process at the step S<b>1406</b> is displayed by an &#x201c;equipment analysis&#x201d; button. The analysis process is performed based on analysis results up to that time, and therefore, reliability becomes higher as the number of inspection times in the past is large. Accordingly, the reliability of the analysis process displayed here corresponds to, for example, the number of analysis processes in the past.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, the equipment state analysis/accumulation part <b>105</b> judges whether or not an abnormal state occurs from the analysis result of the inspection apparatus state (step S<b>1407</b>). When the abnormal state occurs, the equipment state analysis/accumulation part <b>105</b> transmits an alarm and sets a maintenance planned date at a maintenance calendar (step S<b>1408</b>). After that, the process transfers to step S<b>1409</b>. On the other hand, when the abnormal state does not occur, the process transfers to the step S<b>1409</b> without executing the step S<b>1408</b>. Note that it may also be judged at the step S<b>1407</b> whether or not there is a possibility that the abnormal state occurs. When there is the possibility that the abnormal state occurs (when the abnormal state does not occur yet), the equipment state analysis/accumulation part <b>105</b> transmits the alarm. After that, the process transfers to the step S<b>1409</b>. On the other hand, when there is not the possibility that the abnormal state occurs, the process transfers to the step S<b>1409</b> as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, the equipment master updating part <b>101</b> updates the inspection standard master <b>102</b> based on the analysis result by the equipment state analysis/accumulation part <b>105</b> (step S<b>1409</b>). Specifically, for example, when the analysis result is that &#x201c;the abnormal state occurs&#x201d;, the inspection cycle can be updated to a shorter cycle because the occurrence of the abnormal state cannot be prevented by the inspection cycle up to that time, or the inspection method can be updated to another inspection method because the inspection method is not adequate. Similarly, when the analysis result is that &#x201c;there is the possibility that the abnormal state occurs&#x201d;, the inspection cycle can be updated to the shorter cycle to more enhance the alert, or the inspection method can be switched to the one in a direction to enhance the alert.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a flow of the process of the equipment total management system for the business division of the &#x201c;maintenance&#x201d;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the maintenance calendar creating part <b>107</b> creates the maintenance calendar by referring to the maintenance standard master <b>106</b> (step S<b>1501</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a view illustrating a configuration example of the maintenance standard master <b>106</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, equipment basic information (equipment name, model, model number), a maintenance cycle, a maintenance method, an equipment shutdown condition, work contents, expense, required materials, a photograph of a target equipment, drawings and specifications, and a maintenance performed date at the previous time, and so on are held in the maintenance standard master <b>106</b>. The maintenance cycle is the maintenance cycle for the equipment indicated by the equipment basic information. The equipment shutdown condition indicates a case when the equipment is to be shutdown when a result of the maintenance work is in what state. The work contents indicate a work procedure when the maintenance is performed. The expense is expense information required for the maintenance, and the required materials are the required materials necessary for the maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The maintenance calendar creating part <b>107</b> refers to the maintenance cycle in the maintenance standard master <b>106</b>, and creates the maintenance calendar indicating the maintenance date by each component. For example, when the maintenance cycle of a component A is one month, the maintenance calendar with flags indicating that the maintenance is to be performed by every one month from a standard date (a first maintenance date or the previous performance date) is created. Besides, the maintenance method, the maintenance contents of the target component are also set in the maintenance calendar.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref> are views to explain the processes from the generation of the maintenance calendar from the maintenance standard master <b>106</b> to a generation of a construction entry from the maintenance calendar. The previous performance dates (the date when the maintenance work is performed at the previous time) of all equipments are 2005 Nov. 10, and the maintenance cycles are one time/half year in the maintenance standard master illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Accordingly, the maintenance planned dates are set in May when a half year has past since 2005 Nov. 10 in the maintenance calendar illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The user selects the maintenance to be ordered from the maintenance calendar. Here, check marks are added to all check boxes because all maintenances are selected as targets of orders.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, the maintenance performance management part <b>108</b> generates a list of the maintenance contents of the target equipment selected by the user (step S<b>1502</b>). The maintenance performance management part <b>108</b> selects the maintenance contents by an order unit of the construction from the list of the maintenance contents, and generates the construction entry illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> (step S<b>1503</b>). In an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>, all of the construction contents selected by the user (having the check mark in the check box) are included in the same order unit, and therefore, the list of the maintenance contents and the construction entry becomes the same. The specialty, the target equipment name, the maintenance contents, an operator of the construction, a construction period are registered while being corresponded with each other in the list of the maintenance contents and the construction entry.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Note that the required materials for the maintenance work of the corresponding target equipment are displayed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> when a &#x201c;required material&#x201d; button <b>501</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is pressed. In an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is indicated that a material of a maker &#x201c;BB&#x201d;, a model number of &#x201c;PVQ&#x201d;, a component name of &#x201c;hydraulic pump&#x201d; is the required material in a &#x201c;pump replacement&#x201d; work of an equipment name of &#x201c;1CAPL front surface-No. 1 hydraulic pump&#x201d;. Besides, it is indicated that a material of a maker &#x201c;CC&#x201d;, a model number of &#x201c;CR10000&#x201d;, a component name of &#x201c;chain coupling&#x201d; is the required material for a &#x201c;coupling lubrication&#x201d; work of the equipment name of &#x201c;1CAPL front surface-No. 1 hydraulic pump&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view illustrating an example of a screen displayed when a &#x201c;monthly schedule&#x201d; button <b>502</b> in. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is pressed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the dates (&#x201c;2&#x201d; in this example) in May (2006) when maintenance works such as the &#x201c;pump replacement&#x201d;, a &#x201c;coupling inspection lubrication&#x201d;, and a &#x201c;pump coupling inspection&#x201d; are to be performed are displayed when the &#x201c;monthly schedule&#x201d; button <b>502</b> is pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a view illustrating an example of construction draft information. The construction draft information is generated based on the maintenance calendar, the construction entry, and the maintenance standard master. Namely, the construction draft information is generated based on the maintenance work date of &#x201c;May 2&#x201d; defined at the maintenance calendar, the maintenance contents defined at the construction entry, and the presence/absence of the required materials defined at the maintenance standard master.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The generated construction draft information is sent to the operator of the construction by means of e-mail or the like. The operator performs the construction of the target equipment in accordance with the construction draft information. An orderer of the construction verifies the performed construction. Required items (construction quality, verification condition, required voucher and so on) for the construction verification are clearly defined in a construction specification and a safety specification at a construction order time, and rigidity of the verification is achieved by performing the verification in accordance with the defined contents. Verification results are inputted to the equipment total management system.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The maintenance actual performance analysis/accumulation part <b>109</b> analyses (evaluates) and accumulates a construction actual performance based on the verification results (step S<b>1504</b>). A schedule performance rate is analyzed from construction progress information being one of the verification results, and a failure rate is analyzed from failure information being one of the verification results in the analysis of the construction actual performance. These analysis results are accumulated as the construction actual performance.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Subsequently, the equipment master updating part <b>101</b> updates the maintenance standard master <b>106</b> based on the construction actual performance (step S<b>1505</b>). Specifically, for example, it is possible that the construction period of the target equipment is set to be delayed when it is judged that progress of the construction is delayed from the schedule performance rate, on the contrary, it is possible that the construction period is set to be shortened when it is judged that the progress of the construction is fast from the schedule performance rate. Besides, it is also possible to make the maintenance cycle of the target equipment short when the failure rate is high, on the contrary, it is possible to make the maintenance cycle of the target equipment long when the failure rate is low.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a flow of the process of the equipment total management system for the business division of the &#x201c;material management&#x201d;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the shopping register creating part <b>111</b> creates the shopping register by referring to the inventory standard master <b>110</b> and the maintenance calendar (step S<b>1601</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a view illustrating a configuration example of the inventory standard master <b>110</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, material basic information (material name, material number, unit price), a photograph of the material, the drawings and specifications, and an inventory standard by each management section and material characters are held in the inventory standard master <b>110</b>. The management section means a stock room or a site where the materials are managed, and the inventory standard is a minimum inventory quantity of the materials indicated by the material basic information at the management section. Besides, the material characters are information representing a level of importance of the material indicated by the material basic information.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a view illustrating an example of the shopping register. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a purchase planned quantity by each term, and a purchase actual performance of this term as for each material are registered at the shopping register. The purchase planned quantity by each term is set from the maintenance planned date registered at the maintenance calendar, the required material information registered at the maintenance standard master, and a standard delivery date. Namely, the register with the contents is performed in which the required number of materials indicated in the required material information is ordered until the date dating back from the maintenance planned date registered at the maintenance calendar for the standard delivery date. Actually purchased contents are registered as the purchase actual performance.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The created shopping register can be displayed on the screen by the operation of the user. The user refers to the shopping register on the screen, selects the materials to be purchased, then the material order management part <b>112</b> performs an order guidance for the user. The user performs an order process in accordance with the order guidance. Specifically, the user performs the operations specifying a purchase quantity, a desired delivery date, and so on in accordance with the order guidance and determines inputted contents finally, then the material order management part <b>112</b> generates an order entry representing a material number, a name of the material, a model number of the material, the purchase quantity, the desired delivery date, and so on (step S<b>1602</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The generated order entry is transmitted to a section purchase system. The section purchase system orders the materials in accordance with the order entry. The user gets the ordered materials. The user verifies the delivered materials and inputs a delivered quantity of the materials. Here, there are materials of which management sections are the stock room and the site among the delivered materials. The quantities of these materials are separately inputted. The inventory management purchase actual performance management part <b>113</b> registers the inputted quantity to an inventory management table of the corresponding material (step S<b>1603</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a view illustrating a configuration example of the inventory management table. A &#x201c;stock inventory amount&#x201d; and a &#x201c;site inventory amount&#x201d; are registered by each term (&#x2212;6 term to +6 term). These values are set based on the quantities separately inputted at the step S<b>1603</b>. An &#x201c;inventory amount&#x201d; is a sum of the &#x201c;stock inventory amount&#x201d; and the &#x201c;site inventory amount&#x201d;. An &#x201c;order on request&#x201d; represents the material quantity which is currently ordered but not finally purchased yet. A &#x201c;planned order&#x201d; represents the material quantity for the planned order. A &#x201c;usage actual performance/estimated usage&#x201d; represents the material quantity which is already used or is planned to be used. A &#x201c;held inventory amount estimation&#x201d; represents the material quantity in which the &#x201c;usage actual performance/estimated usage&#x201d; is subtracted from a sum of the &#x201c;inventory amount&#x201d; and the &#x201c;planned order&#x201d;. At the step S<b>1601</b>, an order quantity of the material is inputted at the corresponding term on the shopping register when the material quantity becomes equal to or less than the inventory standard (lower limit amount) set at the inventory standard master.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The equipment master updating part <b>101</b> updates the contents of the inventory standard master based on an updated result of the inventory management table (step S<b>1604</b>). For example, when it is registered to the inventory management table that there is a tendency in which a certain material is used frequently, it is possible to increase the inventory standard so as to avoid the possibility in which the corresponding material becomes out of stock, and to make an order request of the corresponding material easy to be set on the shopping register and so on.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the above-stated embodiment, it is possible to avoid a possibility in which defectiveness occurs in a transfer of data by connecting input/output of calculation results of a computer in respective business steps such as, for example, a creation of an inspection calendar, an inspection performance management, a state analysis of an inspection target, and to constantly maintain standards used for an inspection , a maintenance and an inventory in an optimum state by updating an inspection standard master, a maintenance standard master, and an inventory standard master based on a state analysis result of an inspection target, a result of a maintenance work and an updated result of an inventory management table managing a material quantity in the inventory.</p>
