Then, a second transfer operation is performed so as to transfer the superposed toner images onto a sheet. Also, a rotary developing device provided with plural developing units is disposed adjacent to the photoconductor drum. By rotating the rotary developing device, the developing units are sequentially positioned at a position at which they oppose the photoconductor drum, thereby sequentially developing the toner images of the individual colors.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A detailed description of an exemplary embodiment is given below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the configuration of a color image forming apparatus to which this exemplary embodiment is applied. The color image forming apparatus includes a photoconductor drum <b>11</b>, an intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>, a second transfer unit <b>30</b>, a fixing device <b>50</b>, and a controller <b>60</b>. The photoconductor drum <b>11</b> is disposed such that it is rotatable in the direction indicated by arrow A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> is disposed such that it is rotatable in the direction indicated by arrow B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> sequentially transfers toner images of individual colors formed on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> to the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>, and holds the transferred toner images on the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> (first transfer). The second transfer unit <b>30</b> simultaneously transfers superposed toner images that have been transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> onto a sheet S (second transfer). The fixing device <b>50</b> fixes the image subjected to the second transfer operation onto the sheet S. The controller <b>60</b> controls the individual mechanical elements of the color image forming apparatus. The direction of arrow A, which is the rotating direction of the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>, and the direction of arrow B, which is the rotating direction of the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>, are the same direction at a position at which the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> and the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> oppose each other.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Around the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>, which serve as an example of an image carrier, a charging roller <b>12</b>, an exposure device <b>13</b>, a rotary developing device <b>14</b>, a first transfer roller <b>15</b>, and a drum cleaning device <b>16</b> are sequentially disposed. The charging roller <b>12</b> charges the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> in the direction of arrow A. The exposure device <b>13</b> applies light (indicated by an exposure beam Bm in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to the charged photoconductor drum <b>11</b>. The rotary developing device <b>14</b> includes developing units <b>14</b>Y, <b>14</b>M, <b>14</b>C, and <b>14</b>K, and they are attached to the rotary developing device <b>14</b> such that they are individually rotatable. The developing units <b>14</b>Y, <b>14</b>M, <b>14</b>C, and <b>14</b>K respectively contain toners of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K) colors so as to visualize electrostatic latent images formed on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> with the individual colors of toners. The first transfer roller <b>15</b> transfers individual colors of toner images formed on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>. The drum cleaning device <b>16</b> cleans residual toner adhering onto the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>. In this exemplary embodiment, the charging roller <b>12</b> and the exposure device <b>13</b> function as an example of a latent image forming unit.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The charging roller <b>12</b> is disposed such that it is in contact with the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>, and is also rotated in accordance with the rotation of the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>. The first transfer roller <b>15</b>, which serves as an example of a first transfer unit, is disposed such that it is in contact with the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> at a position it opposes the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> with the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> therebetween. The first transfer roller <b>15</b> is rotated in accordance with the rotation of the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>. The drum cleaning device <b>16</b> includes, for example, a blade member that is in contact with the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The photoconductor drum <b>11</b> is configured such that an organic photosensitive layer is formed on the surface of a thin-walled metallic cylindrical drum. In this example, the organic photosensitive layer is made of a negatively charged material. The photoconductor drum <b>11</b> is grounded.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Meanwhile, after the rear end of the superposed toner images of the yellow, magenta, cyan, and black colors that have transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> has passed through the first transfer area, the front end of the superposed toner images advances into the first transfer area in a shorter period of time than that in the short-length mode. Accordingly, the supply of the first transfer bias is restarted (changed from OFF to ON). At this time, the formation of a toner image on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> has not yet started, and the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> is charged to the charging potential VH when passing through the first transfer area.

<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the yellow developing unit <b>14</b>Y located at the developing position Pd, the first stirring transport member <b>143</b> and the second stirring transport member <b>144</b> are rotated in accordance with the feeding of power, whereby the developer is transported within the developing housing <b>141</b> while being stirred. With this stirring transport operation, a toner and a carrier forming the developer rub against each other, causing the toner to be negatively charged and the carrier to be positively charged. As a result, in the developer, the toner is statically attracted to the carrier. Then, when the developer is transported to a portion opposing the developing roller <b>142</b>, part of the carrier is transferred to the developing roller <b>142</b> due to a magnetic force generated between the magnetic poles provided in the magnetic roller <b>142</b><i>b </i>and the carrier contained in the developer. In this case, the carrier transferred to the developing roller <b>142</b> contains the toner which has been statically attracted to the carrier. As a result of this, the developer is transferred to the developing roller <b>142</b>, thereby forming a developer layer on the outer peripheral surface of the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a. </i></p>

The developer removed by the layer-thickness restricting member <b>145</b> is brought back to the first stirring transport member <b>143</b> by gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the yellow developing unit <b>14</b>Y located at the developing position Pd, the DC developing bias VB(DC) and the AC developing bias VB(AC) are supplied to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>in accordance with the feeding of power.

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">After passing through the developing area Ad, the developer layer on the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>is brought back into the developing housing <b>141</b> as the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>is rotated in the direction of arrow D.

<p id="p-0140" num="0139">With the above-described relationship among the charging potential VH, the exposure potential VL, and the DC developing bias VB(DC), the toner To (negatively charged) on the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>passing through the developing area Ad is more easily transferred (flying) to the area having the exposure potential VL (image portion), which is relatively a positive potential on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>, and is less easily transferred (flying) to the area having the charging potential (background portion), which is relatively a negative potential on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>. On the other hand, with the above-described relationship among the charging potential VH, the exposure potential VL, and the DC developing bias VB(DC), in contrast to the toner To, the carrier Ca (positively charged) on the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>passing through the developing area Ad is less easily transferred (flying) to the area having the exposure potential VL (image portion), which is relatively a positive potential on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>, and is more easily transferred (flying) to the area having the charging potential (background portion), which is relatively a negative potential on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>. In the following description, the amount by which the toner To is transferred (flies) to the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> is used as the reference. The difference between the exposure potential VL and the DC developing bias VB(DC) based on the exposure potential VL is referred to as the &#x201c;flying potential difference Vdeve&#x201d;, and the difference between the DC developing bias VB(DC) and the charging potential VH based on the DC developing bias VB(DC) is referred to as the &#x201c;reverse flying potential difference Vcln&#x201d;. In this exemplary embodiment, the magnitude of the DC developing bias VB(DC) with respect to the charging potential VH is determined so that the reverse flying potential difference Vcln ranges from 100 V to 160 V.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The AC developing bias VB(AC), which serves as an example of an AC voltage, is now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In this exemplary embodiment, the first period T<b>1</b> for which the AC developing bias VB(AC) is at a negative polarity corresponds to the flying period (toner transferring (flying) from the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>to the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>), while the second period T<b>2</b> for which the AC developing bias VB(AC) is at a positive polarity corresponds to the reverse flying period (toner transferring (flying) from the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a</i>). The duty ratio DR of the AC developing bias VB(AC) is defined by the ratio of the absolute value of the first peak value Vp<b>1</b> (flying period) to the peak-to-peak value Vp-p (DR=|Vp<b>1</b>|/Vp-p).</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0146">On the other hand, in the long-length mode, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, every time the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> rotates through two revolutions, the first transfer operation for transferring a toner image of one color is performed. Accordingly, in the long-length mode, by rotating the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> through eight revolutions, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, toner images of the four colors are superposed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In this exemplary embodiment, in order to superpose toner images of the individual colors on the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>, toner images of the individual colors are formed on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>, and are then transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> on the basis of the belt revolution period Tb of the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>. Also in this exemplary embodiment, the rotary developing device <b>14</b> is used for developing electrostatic latent images formed on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> so as to form toner images. Thus, in order to position each developing unit at the developing position Pd, time is necessary to rotate the rotary developing device <b>14</b> for a predetermined angle.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">A case where a toner image of one color is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> every time the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> is rotated through one revolution is now considered.

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In this exemplary embodiment, therefore, when the image formation is performed on the sheet S having the first sheet length LS<b>1</b>, which is smaller than the reference length L<b>0</b>, the short-length mode is employed.

As the yellow developing unit <b>14</b>Y passes through the power feed end position Pf<b>2</b> to shift to the retreat position Pe, the supply of the DC developing bias VB(DC) (the first DC developing voltage Vd<b>1</b>) and the supply of the AC developing bias VB(AC) (the first peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>1</b>) to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>provided for the yellow developing unit <b>14</b>Y are stopped. Then, the rotary developing device <b>14</b> stops rotating so as to allow the yellow developing unit <b>14</b>Y to stop at the retreat position Pe and the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M to stop at the waiting position Pw.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Thereafter, as the rotary developing unit <b>14</b> is rotated, the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M starts moving from the waiting position Pw. At this time, in the long-length mode, the yellow toner image transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> have passed through the first transfer area (see &#x201c;Y(2)&#x201d; in (6) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). As the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M passes through the power feed start position Pf<b>1</b> while moving from the waiting position Pw to the developing position Pd, the supply of the DC developing bias VB(DC) and the AC developing bias VB(AC) to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>provided for the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M is started. In this case, a second DC developing voltage Vd<b>2</b>, which is smaller than the first DC developing voltage Vd<b>1</b>, is supplied to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>as the DC developing bias VB(AC), and a second peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>2</b>, which is greater than the first peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>1</b>, is supplied to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>as the AC developing bias VB(AC). Subsequently, the rotary developing device <b>14</b> stops rotating so as to allow the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M to stop at the developing position Pd. In this example, the second DC developing voltage Vd<b>2</b> is set so that the reverse flying potential difference Vcln between the second DC developing voltage Vd<b>2</b> and the charging potential VH is, for example, 150 V, and the second peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>2</b> is set to be, for example, 1000 V.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">After the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M stops at the developing position Pd, the supply of the exposure signal of the magenta color is started, thereby starting the formation of an electrostatic latent image of the magenta color on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>. Then, before the front end of the magenta electrostatic latent image reaches the developing area Ad, the DC developing bias VB(DC) to be supplied to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>is switched from the second DC developing voltage Vd<b>2</b> to the first DC developing voltage Vd<b>1</b>, and also, the AC developing bias VB(AC) to be supplied to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>is switched from the second peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>2</b> to the first peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>1</b>. Then, when the front end of the magenta electrostatic latent image reaches the developing area Ad, the developing operation using the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M is started.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In this example, setting of the DC developing bias VB(DC) to the first DC developing voltage Vd<b>1</b> and setting of the AC developing bias VB(AC) to the first peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>1</b> correspond to a first condition. Setting of the DC developing bias VB(DC) to the second DC developing voltage Vd<b>2</b> and setting of the AC developing bias VB(AC) to the second peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>2</b> correspond to a second condition.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In positioning the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M at the developing position Pd in accordance with the rotation of the rotary developing unit <b>14</b>M, the supply of the DC developing bias VB(DC) and the AC developing bias VB(AC) to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>provided for the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M is started when the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M passes through the power feed start position Pf<b>1</b> before advancing into the developing area Ad.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In this case, in the short-length mode, the magnitude of the DC developing bias VB(DC) is set to be the first DC developing voltage Vd<b>1</b>, and the magnitude of the AC developing bias VB(AC) is set to be the first peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>1</b>. This prevents the carrier Ca from transferring and adhering to the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> from the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>provided for the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M before starting to develop the magenta toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In contrast, in the long-length mode, the magnitude of the DC developing bias VB(DC) is set to be the second DC developing voltage Vd<b>2</b> (Vd<b>2</b>&#x3c;Vd<b>1</b>), and the magnitude of the AC developing bias VB(AC) is set to be the second peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>2</b> (Vp-p<b>2</b>&#x3e;Vp-p<b>1</b>). This prevents the toner To from transferring and adhering to the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> from the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>provided for the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M before starting to develop the magenta toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In the long-length mode, before the magenta electrostatic latent image advances into the developing area Ad, the DC developing bias VB(DC) to be supplied to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>is switched from the second DC developing voltage Vd<b>2</b> to the first DC developing voltage Vd<b>1</b>, and also, the AC developing bias VB(AC) to be supplied to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>is switched from the second peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>2</b> to the first peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the developing conditions for the magenta toner image are the same as those for the yellow toner image.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In this exemplary embodiment, when positioning the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M at the developing position Pd as the rotary developing unit <b>14</b> stops, an impact force is applied, which may cause the magenta toner to scatter from the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>of the magenta developing unit <b>14</b>M. Part of the scattered toner is transferred and adheres to the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>. In the long-length mode, while the rear end of the yellow toner image transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b> is passing through the first transfer area, the magenta toner transferring to and adhering to the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> due to an impact force passes through the first transfer area. Accordingly, an unnecessary magenta toner image is superposed on the rear end of the yellow toner image transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>20</b>. The magenta toner transferring and adhering to the photoconductor drum <b>11</b> due to an impact force is likely to form a streak-like toner image in the axial direction of the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</figref>, <b>12</b>B, and <b>12</b>C illustrate the relationship between the reverse flying potential difference Vcln and the level of streaks (streak level) produced in an image formed on the sheet S. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A</figref>, <b>12</b>B, and <b>12</b>C illustrate the above-described relationship when the toner density Tc in the developer, which is used as a parameter, is about 7.5%, 9.0%, and 10.5%, respectively. Level 0 is the state in which no streaks are produced; level 1 is the state in which streaks are negligible to such a degree that they do not influence the image quality; level 2 is the state in which streaks are barely recognizable visually; level 3 is the state in which streaks are somewhat recognizable visually; level 4 is the state in which streaks are somewhat clearly recognizable visually; and level 5 is the state in which streaks are clearly recognizable visually. Thus, as the level increases, the unnecessary streak-like toner image becomes more noticeable in the image.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A through 12C</figref> show that, as the toner density Tc increases, the streak level increases, i.e., streaks are more noticeable. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A through 12C</figref> also show that, as the reverse flying potential difference Vcln increases, the streak level decreases, i.e., streaks are less noticeable. However, as the reverse flying potential difference Vcln increases, the carrier Ca is more likely to be transferred to the background portion (portion at the charging potential VH) on the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>. Because of those reasons, in this exemplary embodiment, the first DC developing voltage Vd<b>1</b> and the second DC developing voltage Vd<b>2</b> have the relationship of Vd<b>1</b>&#x3e;Vd<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">As the peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p of the AC developing bias VB(AC) increases, the electric field for causing the toner To in the developing area Ad to reversely fly to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>becomes stronger. Because of this reason, in this exemplary embodiment, the first peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>1</b> and the second peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p<b>2</b> have the relationship of Vp-p<b>1</b>&#x3c;Vp-p<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Although a detailed description is not given, if the duty ratio DR of the AC developing bias VB(AC) is set to be small, the electric field for causing the toner To in the developing area Ad to reversely fly to the developing sleeve <b>142</b><i>a </i>becomes stronger than the electric field for causing the toner To in the developing area Ad to fly to the photoconductor drum <b>11</b>. Accordingly, when switching the developing units in the long-length mode, the duty ratio DR may be changed.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The first DC developing voltage Vd<b>1</b> of the DC developing bias VB(DC) may be made different for the short-length mode and the long-length mode.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The charging potentials VH in the short-length mode and the long-length mode may be the same or may be different. The exposure potentials VL in the short-length mode and the long-length mode may be the same or may be different.</p>
