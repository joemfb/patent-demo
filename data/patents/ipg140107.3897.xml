<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-00174, filed on Jan. 4, 2010 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Apparatuses and methods consistent with exemplary embodiments relate to a three-dimensional (3D) glasses driving method and 3D glasses and a 3D image providing display apparatus using the same, and more particularly, to a 3D glasses driving method using a shutter glasses method and 3D glasses and a 3D image providing display apparatus using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic image technology is applicable to various fields such as information communication, broadcasting, medicine, education and training, military, gaming, animation, virtual reality, computer aided drafting (CAD), and industrial technology. Furthermore, 3D stereoscopic image technology is regarded as a core base technology for next generation 3D stereoscopic multimedia information communication, which is used in all of the aforementioned fields.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, a stereoscopic sense that a person perceives occurs from a complex effect of the degree of a change of thickness of the person's eye lens according to the location of an object to be observed, the angle difference of the object observed from both eyes, the differences of location and shape of the object observed from both eyes, the time difference due to a movement of the object, and other various psychological and memory effects.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, binocular disparity, caused by about a 6&#x2dc;7 cm lateral distance between the person's left eye and right eye, can be regarded as the main cause of the stereoscopic sense. Due to binocular disparity, the person perceives the object with an angle difference, which makes the left eye and the right eye receive different images. When these two images are transmitted to the person's brain through retinas, the brain can perceive the original three-dimensional stereoscopic image by combining the two pieces of information exactly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There are two types of stereoscopic image display apparatuses: glasses-type apparatuses which special-use glasses, and nonglasses-type apparatuses which do not use such special glasses. A glasses-type apparatus may adopt a color filtering method which separately selects images by filtering colors which are in mutually complementary relationships, a polarized filtering method which separates the images received by a left eye from those received by a right eye using a light-shading effect caused by a combination of polarized light elements meeting at right angles, or a shutter glasses method which enables a person to perceive a stereoscopic sense by blocking a left eye and a right eye alternately in response to a sync signal which projects a left image signal and a right image signal to a screen.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Of the above methods, the shutter glasses method is a display method using a time difference between a left eye and a right eye. To be more specific, the shutter glasses method is a method which synchronizes image provision of a display apparatus with opening and closing of a left eye glass and a right eye glass, so that a person can perceive a sense of space of the image observed from different angles due to functions of the person's brain.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, a glasses unit of 3D glasses contains liquid crystal. Therefore, in the 3D glasses using the shutter glasses method, if the liquid crystal has a low responding speed, a crosstalk phenomenon where a right eye image is observed from a left eye glass when the left eye glass opens occurs. Thus, the user cannot watch a decent 3D image and, in addition, the user would feel extreme irritation and fatigue in the eyes when watching the 3D image. Therefore, to use the shutter glasses method, there is a need to seek a method to minimize the irritation the user would feel when wearing shutter glasses.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, the same drawing reference numerals are used for the same elements even in different drawings. The matters defined in the description, such as detailed construction and elements, are provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of exemplary embodiment. Thus, it is apparent that an exemplary embodiment can be carried out without those specifically defined matters. Also, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the exemplary embodiments with unnecessary detail. Moreover, expressions such as &#x201c;at least one of,&#x201d; when preceding a list of elements, modify the entire list of elements and do not modify the individual elements of the list.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The operating principle and configuration of a three-dimensional (3D) image providing system will now be explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view of the 3D image providing system according to an exemplary embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the 3D image providing system includes a camera <b>100</b> for generating a 3D image, a television (TV) <b>200</b> for displaying the 3D image on a screen, and 3D glasses <b>300</b> for watching the 3D image.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">To this end, the camera <b>100</b> includes a left eye camera or lens for generating the left eye image and a right eye camera or lens for generating the right eye image. Moreover, the distance between the left eye camera or lens and the right eye camera or lens is determined by taking into account the distance between the left eye and the right eye of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The camera <b>100</b> transmits the photographed left eye image and the photographed right eye image to the TV <b>200</b>. To be more specific, the camera <b>100</b> may transmit the left eye image and the right eye image in the format of a frame including one of the left eye image and the right eye image, or in the format of a frame including both the left eye image and the right eye image. Furthermore, the camera <b>100</b> may predetermines one from among various 3D image formats, generates the 3D image according to the predetermined format, and transmits the 3D image to the TV <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The TV <b>200</b> is a type of display apparatus which receives the 3D image directly from a photographing apparatus such as the camera <b>100</b>, or from a broadcasting station where the 3D image has been transmitted for at least one of editing and processing. The TV <b>200</b> processes the 3D image received from either the camera <b>100</b> or the broadcasting station, and displays the processed 3D image on the screen. In particular, the TV <b>200</b> processes the left eye image and the right eye image taking into account the format of the 3D image, and enables the processed left eye image and the processed right eye image to be displayed alternately in a timesharing manner.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, the TV <b>200</b> generates a sync signal synchronized with the timing when the left eye image or the right eye image is displayed on the screen in a timesharing manner, and transmits the sync signal to the 3D glasses <b>300</b>.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A configuration of the TV <b>200</b> according to an exemplary embodiment will now be explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a TV <b>200</b> according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the TV <b>200</b> includes an image receiving unit <b>210</b>, an image processing unit <b>220</b>, an image output unit <b>230</b>, a controlling unit <b>240</b>, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) generating unit <b>250</b>, a storage unit <b>260</b>, a user command receiving unit <b>270</b>, and an infrared (IR) transmitting unit <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The image receiving unit <b>210</b> receives a broadcast transmitted wirelessly or via cables from a broadcasting station or a satellite, and demodulates the received broadcast. The image receiving unit <b>210</b> may be connected to an external device such as the camera <b>100</b>, and may receive a 3D image therefrom. The external device may be connected wirelessly or via cables through an interface such as S-Video, Component, Composite, D-Sub, DVI, and HDMI.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, the 3D image is an image in the format of at least one frame including either of or both the left eye image and the right eye image. That is, the 3D image is an image generated according to one of various 3D formats. Therefore, the 3D image transmitted to the image receiving unit <b>210</b> may be in various formats. Specifically, the 3D image may be in one of a general frame sequence method, a top-bottom method, a side by side method, a horizontal interleave method, a vertical interleave method, a checker board method, etc. The image receiving unit <b>210</b> transmits the received 3D image to the image processing unit <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The image processing unit <b>220</b> performs operations of processing signals and adding GUIs such as video decoding, format analyzing, and video scaling on the received 3D image. In particular, the image processing unit <b>220</b> generates a left eye image and a right eye image, each of which fits the size of a screen (e.g., 1920&#xd7;1080), using the format of the 3D image transmitted to the image receiving unit <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">That is, in the case when the format of the 3D image is any one of a top-bottom method, a side by side method, a horizontal interleave method, a vertical interleave method, or a checker board method, the image processing unit <b>220</b> extracts the left eye image portion and the right eye image portion from each image frame, and upscales or interpolates the extracted left eye image and the right eye image, thereby generating a left eye image and a right eye image to be provided to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a case where the format of the 3D image is in accordance with a general frame sequence method, the image processing unit <b>220</b> extracts the left eye image or the right eye image from each frame and makes preparations to provide the extracted image to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Herein, the information on the format of the received 3D image may or may not be included in the 3D image signal.

On the other hand, if the information on the format of the received 3D image is not included in the 3D image signal, the image processing unit <b>220</b> processes the received 3D image according to a format input by a user or according to a predetermined format (e.g., a default format). Moreover, the image processing unit <b>220</b> enables a GUI received from the GUI generating unit <b>250</b> which will be explained below to be added to either of or both the left eye image and the right eye image.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The image processing unit <b>220</b> transmits the extracted left eye image and the extracted right eye image alternately in a timesharing manner to the image output unit <b>230</b>.

Furthermore, the GUI generating unit <b>250</b> may generate a 3D glasses duty adjusting menu which is capable of adjusting a duty of the 3D glasses <b>300</b> inter-working with the TV <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The storage unit <b>260</b> is a storage medium which stores one or more programs used to operate the TV <b>200</b>.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The IR transmitting unit <b>280</b> generates a sync signal synchronized with the left eye image and the right eye image output alternately, and transmits the generated sync signal to the 3D glasses <b>300</b> in the form of an infrared ray. Such a sync signal enables the image output unit <b>230</b> to display the left eye image during the period when the left eye of the 3D glasses <b>300</b> is open and to display the right eye image during the period when the right eye glass of the 3D glasses is open by synchronizing the TV <b>200</b> and the 3D glasses <b>300</b> as the 3D glasses <b>300</b> open and close alternately.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, when the duty adjusting command of the 3D glasses <b>300</b> is input through the user command receiving unit <b>270</b>, the IR transmitting unit <b>280</b> may transmit the input duty adjusting command to the 3D glasses <b>300</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Furthermore, the controlling unit <b>240</b> controls the GUI generating unit <b>250</b> so that the GUI which corresponds to the user command received from the user command receiving unit <b>270</b> can be generated.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of 3D glasses <b>300</b> according to an exemplary embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the 3D glasses <b>300</b> include an IR receiving unit <b>310</b>, a controlling unit <b>320</b>, a glasses driving unit <b>330</b>, a glasses unit <b>340</b>, and a user operation unit <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The IR receiving unit <b>310</b> receives the sync signal regarding the 3D image from the IR transmitting unit <b>280</b> of the TV <b>200</b> connected wirelessly or via cables. Specifically, the IR transmitting unit <b>280</b> emits the sync signal using an infrared ray having a straightness characteristic, and the IR receiving unit <b>310</b> receives the sync signal from the emitted infrared ray. For example, the sync signal which is transmitted from the IR transmitting unit <b>280</b> to the IR receiving unit <b>310</b> may be an infrared ray signal having a frequency of 60 Hz.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The IR receiving unit <b>310</b> transmits the received output signal to the controlling unit <b>320</b> according to the sync signal received from the IR transmitting unit <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The controlling unit <b>320</b> controls an overall operation of the shutter glasses <b>300</b>. In particular, the controlling unit <b>320</b> generates a control signal based on the output signal received from the IR receiving unit <b>310</b>, and transmits the generated control signal to the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> to control the glasses driving unit <b>330</b>. In particular, the controlling unit <b>320</b> controls the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> to generate a driving signal for driving the glasses unit <b>340</b> based on the output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The glasses driving unit <b>330</b> generates the driving signal based on the control signal received from the controlling unit <b>320</b>. In particular, since the glasses unit <b>340</b> includes a left eye glass <b>343</b> and a right eye glass <b>346</b>, the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> generates a left eye glass driving signal and a right eye glass driving signal for driving the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b>, respectively. Furthermore, the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> transmits the generated left eye glass driving signal and the right eye glass driving signal to the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The glasses driving unit <b>330</b> adjusts the duty of the driving signal having a transition period between the open period and the closed period of the left glass <b>343</b> and the right glass <b>346</b>, and transmits the driving signal having the adjusted duty to the glasses unit <b>340</b>. Herein, the transition period refers to the period when the left glass <b>343</b> and the right glass <b>346</b> are both closed. Such driving methods of the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> will be described below in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As described above, the glasses unit <b>340</b> includes the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b>, and opens or closes each glass according to the driving signal received from the glass driving unit <b>330</b>. In particular, the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> are made of materials which include liquid crystal. Therefore, due to the responding speed of the liquid crystal, when a glass opens, the crosstalk phenomenon occurs where the right eye image is seen from the left glass <b>343</b> or the left eye image is seen from the right glass <b>346</b>. In order to eliminate such a crosstalk phenomenon, the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> generates the driving signal having a transition period between the open period and closed period of the left glass <b>343</b> and the right glass <b>346</b>, and transmits the generated driving signal to the glasses unit <b>340</b>. As a result, irritation and fatigue which the user may feel while wearing the shutter glasses <b>300</b> is minimized or eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The user operation unit <b>350</b> receives a user operation command for adjusting the transition period, which is when one of the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> closes until the other eye glass <b>346</b> or <b>343</b> opens, i.e., when both glasses <b>343</b> and <b>346</b> are closed. More specifically, when the user operation command is input, the controlling unit <b>320</b> controls the driving unit <b>330</b> to generate a driving signal having a length of duty, that is, regarding when the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> open, corresponding to the user adjusting command. By generating the driving signal having the length of duty when the left eye glass <b>343</b> or the right eye glass <b>346</b> is open corresponding to the user operation command, the 3D glasses <b>300</b> are able to adjust the transition period. As an example, the user adjusting unit <b>350</b> may be a dial switch or a button.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As described above, by adjusting the transition period through the user operation unit <b>350</b>, the user is able to eliminate the crosstalk phenomenon, and watch the 3D image in a desired brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a simple side view of the 3D glasses <b>300</b> to which a dial switch <b>352</b> has been attached, according to an exemplary embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of the user operation unit <b>350</b> being a dial switch <b>352</b>, though it is understood that another exemplary embodiment is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the dial switch <b>352</b> is attached to a rim <b>360</b> of the 3D glasses. Therefore, the user can adjust the transition period of the 3D glasses through the dial switch more easily and conveniently.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Moreover, the dial switch <b>352</b> has gradations, which enable the user to determine how much the transition period has been adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When a particular command of the user is input through the dial switch <b>352</b>, the glasses unit <b>340</b> opens and closes the left eye glass <b>343</b> or the right eye glass <b>346</b> alternately according to the driving signal having the transition period of the length corresponding to the particular command of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The 3D glasses driving method for eliminating the crosstalk phenomenon of the 3D image will now be explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a view explaining a method of adjusting a 3D glasses driving signal according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The 3D glasses <b>300</b> receive an IR sync signal from the TV <b>200</b> through the IR receiving unit <b>310</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the IR sync signal according to an exemplary embodiment has a frequency of 60 Hz, and has three pulses of short wavelengths within one cycle. The reason the IR sync signal has three pulses within a cycle is to evade interference with other infrared ray signals.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">When the IR receiving unit <b>310</b> receives the sync signal having a frequency of 60 Hz from the TV <b>200</b>, the IR receiving unit <b>310</b> generates an output signal to be transmitted to the controlling unit <b>320</b> according to the received IR sync signal. Like the IR sync signal, the output signal also has a frequency of 60 Hz.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Upon receiving the output signal from the IR receiving unit <b>310</b>, the controlling unit <b>320</b> controls the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> to generate a driving signal. Herein, the driving signal includes a left eye glass driving signal for driving the left eye glass <b>343</b> and a right eye glass driving signal for driving the right eye glass <b>346</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> open and close alternately, and thus, as illustrated in the third and fourth graphs from the top in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the left eye glass driving signal and the right eye glass signal have frequencies of 120 Hz. Therefore, each of the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> opens and closes alternately every 1/120 seconds. Herein, the right eye glass <b>346</b> opens the moment the left eye glass <b>343</b> closes. However, if the responding speed of the liquid crystal in the left eye glass <b>343</b> is low, the user would see the right eye image through the left eye glass <b>343</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When a particular operation of the user is input through the user operation unit <b>350</b> in order to eliminate such a crosstalk phenomenon, the controlling unit <b>320</b> controls the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> to generate a driving signal having a transition period between when one of the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> closes until the other eye glass <b>346</b> or <b>343</b> opens. That is, the controlling unit <b>320</b> controls the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> to generate a driving signal having a transition period by controlling the length of the duty when the left eye glass <b>343</b> or the right eye glass <b>346</b> opens.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example, when a command is input through the user operation unit <b>350</b> to reduce the length of the duty when the left eye glass <b>343</b> or the right eye glass <b>346</b> is open to 50%, the controlling unit <b>320</b> controls the glasses driving unit <b>330</b> to generate a driving signal having a length of the duty, each of which is 50% less than a previous length of the duty. Therefore, due to the adjusted left eye glass driving signal, the left eye glass <b>343</b> is open for 1/240 seconds and closed for 3/240 seconds per cycle of the IR sync signal. Likewise, the right eye glass <b>346</b> is open for 1/240 seconds and closed for 3/240 seconds per cycle of the IR sync signal.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Furthermore, as illustrated in the fifth graph from the top in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, between when the left eye glass <b>343</b> closes and the right eye glass <b>346</b> opens, there exists a transition period (t<sub>1</sub>), which is when both the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> are closed. For example, the transition period (t<sub>1</sub>) may be 1/240 seconds. Accordingly, since all the responses of the liquid crystal in the left eye glass <b>343</b> finish during the transition period (t<sub>1</sub>), the crosstalk phenomenon where the right eye image is seen from the left eye glass <b>343</b> can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As illustrated in the sixth graph from the top in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, between when the right eye glass <b>346</b> closes until the left eye glass <b>343</b> opens, there exists a transition period (t<sub>2</sub>), which is when both the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> are closed. In the same manner, the transition period (t<sub>2</sub>) may be 1/240 seconds, and all the responses of the liquid crystal in the right eye glass <b>346</b> finish during the transition period (t<sub>2</sub>). Accordingly, the crosstalk phenomenon where the left eye image is seen from the right eye glass <b>346</b> can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As described above, if there is such a transition period between when the left eye glass <b>343</b> or the right eye glass <b>346</b> closes and opens, the crosstalk phenomenon can be eliminated. Furthermore, since the user can adjust the transition period through the user operation unit <b>350</b>, the user is able to watch the 3D image in a desired brightness without experiencing the crosstalk phenomenon. Therefore, the user can have a more comfortable 3D image watching experience.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flowchart illustrating in detail a process of driving the 3D glasses <b>300</b> according to an exemplary embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the 3D glasses <b>300</b> receive a sync signal from the external device (e.g., the TV <b>200</b>) (S<b>610</b>). While the present exemplary embodiment describes the sync signal as being received from the TV <b>200</b>, it is understood that another exemplary embodiment is not limited thereto. For example, according to another exemplary embodiment, the sync signal may be received from another type of external device, such as a set top box or a stand-alone IR transmitter. Upon receiving the sync signal (S<b>610</b>-Y), the 3D glasses <b>300</b> generate a driving signal for driving the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> (S<b>620</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Thereafter, the 3D glasses <b>300</b> determine whether a particular operation command of the user to adjust the transition period between when the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> open and close is input (S<b>630</b>). If the particular operation command of the user has not been input (S<b>630</b>-N), the 3D glasses <b>300</b> drive the left eye glass <b>343</b> and the right eye glass <b>346</b> through the generated driving signal (S<b>650</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">On the other hand, if the particular operation command of the user has been input (S<b>630</b>-Y), the 3D glasses <b>300</b> generate a driving signal having a transition period which corresponds to the particular operation command. For example, if a command has been input to reduce the length of the duty or the duty ratio, which is the period when the left glass <b>343</b> or the right glass <b>346</b> is open, to be 50%, the 3D glasses <b>300</b> generate a driving signal having a length of duty for each of the left eye glass driving signal and the right eye glass driving signal that is 50% less than a previous length of duty, or a predetermined length of duty (e.g., a default length of duty). For example, as a result of the particular operation command, the driving signal has a transition period which is 50% shorter than a total single period of the driving signal.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the driving signal having the transition period adjusted by the particular operation command of the user is generated as described above, the user is able to watch the 3D image in a desired brightness without experiencing the crosstalk phenomenon as explained above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
