<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to user profiling and more particularly to generating a user interests profile based upon the computing behavior of a corresponding user.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Content browsing refers to the retrieval of content from a content source through a content browser from over a computer communications network. The most common form of content browsing pertains to Web page retrieval from the World Wide Web of documents, known by most as simply the &#x201c;Web&#x201d;. A large portion of the Web incorporates personalized delivery of content. Personalization ranges from recalling basic personal information such as name and address to consummate an e-commerce transaction, to complex and detailed demographic data and psychographic data such as attributes relating to personality, values, attitudes, interests, musical tastes, travel preferences, or lifestyles. Content personalization more recently has acted as a filter to the vast amount of information accessible over the global Internet. Specifically, the vast amount of information can result in &#x201c;information overload&#x201d; for the end user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To facilitate the personalization of content delivery to different individuals, for more than a decade content providers have utilized the venerable &#x201c;cookie&#x201d;. A &#x201c;cookie&#x201d; as it is well known in the art is a text string stored by a Web browser. A cookie consists of one or more name-value pairs containing bits of information, which may be encrypted for information privacy and data security purposes. In operation, the cookie is sent as a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) header by a web server to a web browser and then sent back unchanged by the Web browser each time the Web browser accesses the Web server.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite the desirability of content personalization, many end users of the Web have grown to mistrust the use of the cookie. This mistrust will be apparent in the embedded &#x201c;disable cookie&#x201d; feature of most commercially available content browsers. Yet, much of this mistrust is misguided because as text, cookies are not executable and since cookies are not executed, cookies cannot replicate themselves and are not viruses. However, due to the content browser mechanism to set and read cookies, cookies can be used as spyware. In fact, modern anti-spyware applications warn end users about some cookies because cookies can be used to track end users&#x2014;a privacy concern. Thus, while most modern content browsers permit the end user to opt to reject the use of cookies, or more reasonably, a time period during which a cookie is to be maintained, rejecting cookies renders some Web sites unusable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">User profiling provides a way for end users to experience personalized content with respect to content consumption over the computer communications network without relying upon the use of the venerable cookie. A user interests profile also referred to as an interest contour is a collection of personal data associated with a specific user. User profiling refers to the process of constructing a profile based upon a set of data associated with a target user. The user interests profile when accessed by a content provider, in turn, can provide personalized content to the target user. Web personalization models include rules-based filtering, based on &#x201c;if this, then that&#x201d; rules processing, and collaborative filtering, which serves relevant material to customers by combining their own personal preferences with the preferences of like-minded others.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Modern user profiling systems, implemented in an attempt to address information overload, are not adequate for delivering content which is relevant to the user, the interests of the user and the assignments or roles of the user. In this regard, user profiling systems generally rely upon the selection of interests by the user from a list of various interests. The user profiling systems then rely upon the user to maintain the accuracy and relevancy of the profile interests or career roles of the user change. Further, modern user profiling systems often require the user to complete multiple profile/interest lists. This leaves the user dissatisfied as in an enterprise environment the user expects that the enterprise applications will be interconnected and should be able to &#x201c;net out&#x201d; the user's interests based on the history of the activities, assignments, usage patterns and social networks of the end user. In addition, the user may not fully understand the taxonomy that underpins the selection of interests in various enterprise applications that can use different terminology to describe similar areas of interest. Historically, this approach has proven to be ineffective with profile/interest lists quickly becoming outdated.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present invention address deficiencies of the art in respect to user profiling and provide a novel and non-obvious method, system and computer program product for interest contour computation and management based upon user generated content. In an embodiment of the invention, an interest contour computation and management method is provided. The method includes crawling content sources disposed about a computer communications network for authored content created by an end user. The method further includes identifying meta data such as tags or keywords provided by other end users for the authored content and adding the meta data to a user interests profile of the end user. Of note, the method can further include receiving from the end user a specified time period and limiting the addition of the meta data to the user interests profile to only the meta data applied to the authored content during the specified time period.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one aspect of the embodiment, the method also can include identifying names of other end users interacting with the authored content, validating the identified names against a directory of names and then adding only meta-data provided by validated ones of the identified names to the user interests profile. In another aspect of the embodiment, the method can additionally include providing access to the user interests profile to the end user and modifying the user interests profile according to deletions of added interests in the user interests profile specified by the end user through the provided access or according to additions of interests to the user interests profile specified by the end user through the provided access.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment of the invention, a user profiling data processing system is provided. The system includes a host server with at least one processor and memory. The host server is configured for coupling over a computer communications network such as a private Intranet or global Internet to different content sources serving authored content to requesting clients over the network. A crawler can execute in the memory of the host server and can crawl the content sources to retrieve authored content into a database. Finally, an interest contour module can execute in the memory of the host server. The module can include program code that when executed identifies meta data provided for authored content in the database that had been created by an end user, and adds the meta data to a user interests profile of the end user.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional aspects of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The aspects of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the invention provide for interest contour computation and management based upon user generated content. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, content authored by a user and disposed in fixed storage in a computer communications network such as the Internet can be identified. The content can include by way of example, blog postings of the user, wiki entries authored by the user, published papers, articles, forum posts and the like. The identified content can be retrieved and stored for analysis. During analysis, meta-data including tags or keywords applied to the identified content can be extracted as can terms from the content itself. Finally, a time stamp for the meta-data can be stored in connection with the identified content. Thereafter, a user interests profile for the user can be computed from the meta-data for a period of time specified by the user. Also, social relationships can be determined for the user by identifying other users whom have interacted with the identified content. In this way, the user interests profile for the user can remain fresh and relevant and can be tuned by the user by selecting a time period to filter the computed data requisite to establishing the user interests profile.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In further illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> pictorially shows a process for interest contour computation and management based upon user-generated content. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, content <b>130</b> authored by user <b>110</b> and disposed about a computer communications network such as an enterprise Intranet or the global Internet can be identified as having been authored by the user <b>110</b> and retrieved into storage. Thereafter, meta-data <b>140</b> including tags or keywords applied to the content <b>130</b> by other users <b>150</b> can be identified in the content <b>130</b> now disposed in storage. A time period <b>160</b> can be specified by the user <b>110</b> to filter the meta-data <b>140</b> to that of meta-data <b>140</b> applied to the content <b>130</b> within the specified time period <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Subsequently, names of the users <b>150</b> associated with the content <b>130</b> (such as those who have commented, downloaded, modified or rated the content <b>130</b>) can be associated with the user <b>110</b> in a user interests profile <b>120</b> for the user <b>110</b> as can a normalized set of meta-data <b>140</b> applied to the content <b>130</b> by the other users <b>150</b>. Using the names of the other users <b>150</b> and the normalized set of meta-data <b>140</b>, one or more interests corresponding to the meta-data <b>140</b> applied to the content <b>130</b> by the other users <b>150</b> can be set forth in the user interests profile <b>120</b>. Yet further, the user <b>110</b> can modify the user interests profile <b>120</b> directly by adding or deleting interests in the user interests profile <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The process described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be implemented within a user profiling data processing system. In yet further illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically shows a user profiling data processing system configured for interest contour computation and management based upon user generated content. The system can include a host server <b>230</b> with at least one processor and memory configured for communicative coupling to a computer communications network <b>220</b>, such as a private Intranet or global Internet. Different content hosts <b>280</b> can be coupled to the computer communications network <b>220</b>, and each of the content hosts <b>280</b> can be configured to store and distribute authored content <b>240</b> such as blog postings, wiki contributions, published papers, government documents, bulletin board postings, and the like. The authored content <b>240</b> can be associated with an authoring user and also the commentary, edits, ratings, tags, or other like meta-data applied to the authored content <b>240</b> by the other users.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The host server <b>230</b> can support the execution in memory of a crawler <b>250</b>. The crawler <b>250</b> can scan the computer communications network <b>220</b> to identify and retrieve the authored content <b>240</b> from respective ones of the content servers <b>290</b> and store the retrieved authored content <b>240</b> as a user interest contour <b>270</b> into non-volatile storage <b>260</b>, such as a database. Of note, the host server <b>230</b> also can support the execution of an interest contour module <b>300</b>. The interest contour module <b>300</b> can include program code that when executing in the memory of the host server <b>230</b> can process the authored content <b>240</b> stored in storage <b>260</b> to extract names of other end users associated with the authored content <b>240</b>, meta-data applied to the authored content <b>240</b> by the other end users, and meta-data included in the authored content <b>240</b>. The extracted names and meta-data, in turn, can be included in an interest contour for the end user responsible for having created the authored content <b>240</b>, or mapped to interests for inclusion in the interest contour for the end user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Specifically, the program code of the interest contour module <b>300</b> can include a name extractor <b>300</b>A enabled to extract the associated names from the authored content <b>240</b>, a meta-data extractor <b>300</b>B enabled to extract meta-data such as keywords or tags applied to the authored content <b>240</b>, and also time slicing logic <b>300</b>C. The time slicing logic <b>300</b>C can be enabled to receive a directive from a user through an interface over the computer communications network <b>220</b> and coupled computer <b>200</b> with content browser <b>210</b>. The directive can include a time period for meta-data to be considered in generating an interest contour&#x2014;namely a user interests profile&#x2014;for the end user. In this regard, using the specified time period, the time slicing logic <b>300</b>C can limit the interest contour module <b>300</b> in generating a user interests profile to consider only meta-data for the authored content <b>240</b> applied to the authored content <b>240</b> during the specified time period.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In even yet further illustration of the operation of the interest contour module <b>300</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a process for interest contour computation and management based upon user-generated content. Beginning in block <b>310</b>, content authored by an end user can be retrieved from a computer communications network by way of a crawling operation. In block <b>320</b>, a time period can be specified by the authoring end user, and in block <b>330</b> meta-data such as keywords or tags applied to the content can be extracted. In block <b>340</b>, the meta-data can be limited to that meta-data applied to the authored content during the time period. Thereafter, in block <b>350</b> the extracted meta-data can be normalized to remove redundancies. Optionally, meta-data considered to be synonymous can be collapsed into a single representation of the synonymous meta-data as the case may be. In block <b>360</b>, the normalized meta-data can be added for consideration in producing the interest contour for the end user directly or by mapping the normalized meta-data to a set of interests.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In block <b>370</b>, names associated with the time sliced content can be extracted from the time sliced content, such as names of other end users who have provided responses to, comments about, ratings of, or modifications to the time sliced content. In block <b>380</b>, the names can be filtered to include only those names verified within a directory for the network and in block <b>390</b> the meta-data provided only by those names verified within the directory can be added directly to the interest contour or the names can be used in consideration of producing the interest contour for the end user by mapping the names to a set of interests such as those of the other end users associated with the names.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In block <b>400</b> the interest contour can be modified by the end user by adding, removing or modifying the interests in the interest contour. Finally, in block <b>410</b> the interest contour can be saved for use as a user interests profile of the end user in suggesting content for retrieval from over the network and review by the end user.</p>
