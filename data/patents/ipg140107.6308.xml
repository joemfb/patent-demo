<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Peer-to-peer file-sharing protocols (such as BITTORRENT) are often used to distribute large amounts of data via the Internet. For example, a file provider may choose to reduce the costs typically associated with hosting a large, popular file (such as a game patch or video file) by distributing the file using the BITTORRENT protocol. In the BITTORRENT protocol, peers download pieces of a target file from any number of additional peers while simultaneously providing any previously downloaded pieces of the file to other peers. A group of peers exchanging pieces of a file in this manner is commonly known as a &#x201c;swarm.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">While the BITTORRENT protocol represents a popular method for distributing files (e.g., some researchers estimate that the BITTORRENT protocol alone accounts for up to 50% of all Internet traffic), this protocol also represents a common means for distributing malicious software (&#x201c;malware&#x201d;). Unfortunately, torrent hosting sites (i.e., websites that host files, also known as &#x201c;torrents,&#x201d; that contain the metadata necessary to facilitate a BITTORRENT transaction) generally fail to provide sufficient information to reliably predict whether such files are trustworthy. As such, the instant disclosure identifies a need for a mechanism for evaluating the trustworthiness of files obtained via peer-to-peer file-sharing networks, such as via the BITTORRENT protocol.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As will be described in greater detail below, the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for using reputation information to evaluate the trustworthiness of files obtained via torrent transactions. In some examples, the systems described herein may accomplish such a task by (1) identifying a torrent file that includes metadata for facilitating a torrent transaction involving a target file, (2) identifying at least one entity involved in the torrent transaction, (3) obtaining reputation information (such as a reputation score) that identifies the trustworthiness of the entity in question, (4) determining, based at least in part on the identified reputation information, that the target file represents a potential security risk, and then (5) performing a security action on the target file.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some examples, the metadata included within the torrent file may identify a torrent-tracking server capable of coordinating the torrent transaction (i.e., distribution of the target file) among a group of peers within a file-sharing network. Examples of the types of entities that may be involved in such a transaction include a torrent hosting site that hosts the torrent file, the entity that originally provided or made available the target file (the &#x201c;original seeder&#x201d;), peers capable of providing (&#x201c;seeding&#x201d;) or downloading (&#x201c;leeching&#x201d;) at least a portion of the target file, and/or at least one torrent-tracking server capable of coordinating the torrent transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The systems described herein may identify at least one entity involved in the torrent transaction in a variety of ways. For example, the systems described herein may identify a torrent hosting site that hosts the torrent file by determining (by, e.g., monitoring browser downloads) that the torrent file has been downloaded and then identifying the source (e.g., the torrent hosting site) of the torrent file. The systems described herein may also communicate with the torrent hosting site (which may retain authentication information for original seeders) in order to identify the original seeder of the torrent file.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The systems described herein may also analyze metadata contained within the torrent file itself in order to identify at least one torrent-tracking server capable of facilitating the transaction. In addition, the systems described herein may monitor and parse network traffic in order to identify the IP address of at least one peer involved in the torrent transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to determine whether the target file represents a potential security risk, the systems described herein may obtain reputation information for at least one entity involved in the transaction. As will be explained in greater detail below, this reputation information may identify a community's opinion (e.g., an opinion based on information gathered from potentially millions of computing devices, such as the user base of a security-software publisher) on the trustworthiness of the entity in question. In some examples, the reputation of an entity may be based on whether the entity has been involved in prior torrent transactions that involved malware.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, if an entity has been involved in several torrent transactions that involved malware-infected target files, the reputation information associated with the entity may indicate that the entity has a poor reputation, indicating a high likelihood that the target file represents a potential security risk. In contrast, if an entity has only been involved in torrent transactions involving legitimate (e.g., non-malicious) target files, the reputation information associated with the entity may indicate that the entity has a good reputation, indicating a low likelihood that the target file represents a potential security risk.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If the systems described herein determine, by analyzing the reputation of at least one entity involved in the torrent transaction, that the target file represents a potential security risk, then these systems may perform a security action on the target file. Examples of such security actions include, without limitation, alerting a user of the potential security risk, blocking access to the target file until overridden by the user, blocking network traffic associated with the torrent transaction, quarantining the target file, and/or deleting the target file.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As will be detailed below, the instant disclosure also describes and illustrates various systems and methods for assigning reputation scores to entities involved in torrent transactions. In one example, the systems described herein may accomplish such a task by (1) receiving reporting information from at least one computing device that identifies, for each computing device, (i) a target file obtained via a torrent transaction, (ii) at least one entity that was involved in the torrent transaction, and (iii) the impact of the target file on the health of the computing device (e.g., whether the target file represents malware or otherwise negatively impacted the stability or performance of the computing device), (2) assigning a reputation score to the entity in question based at least in part on the reporting information received from the computing device(s), and then (3) providing the reputation score assigned to the entity to at least one additional computing device (e.g., an additional peer) participating in an additional torrent transaction that involves the entity. As will be explained in greater detail below, this reputation score may enable the additional computing device to determine whether the additional torrent transaction represents a potential security risk.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As detailed below, by collecting, aggregating, and analyzing reporting information from potentially millions of users involved in torrent transactions, the systems and methods described herein may enable security-software publishers to gain a fairly accurate understanding as to the trustworthiness of entities involved in torrent transactions (such as original seeders, torrent hosting sites, torrent-tracking servers, peers, etc.) based at least in part on the types of files (e.g., malicious or non-malicious) commonly associated with such entities. Moreover, by providing this reputation information to client devices, the systems and methods described herein may enable security software installed on such devices to evaluate and potentially reliably predict the trustworthiness of target files obtainable via torrent transactions based at least in part on the reputations of the entities involved in such transactions, thereby potentially preventing or reducing the proliferation of malware via such transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Features from any of the above-mentioned embodiments may be used in combination with one another in accordance with the general principles described herein. These and other embodiments, features, and advantages will be more fully understood upon reading the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at step <b>302</b> one or more of the systems described herein may identify a torrent file that includes metadata for facilitating a torrent transaction that involves obtaining a target file via a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol (such as BITTORRENT). For example, identification module <b>104</b> may, as part of computing device <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, identify torrent file <b>210</b>, which may include metadata for facilitating a torrent transaction for obtaining a target file <b>218</b> from peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N) via the BITTORRENT protocol. In this example, the metadata included within torrent file <b>210</b> may identify a torrent-tracking server (e.g., torrent-tracking server <b>212</b>) capable of coordinating the torrent transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The phrase &#x201c;torrent transaction,&#x201d; as used herein, generally refers to the distribution of a target file identified within a torrent file via a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol, such as BITTORRENT. In this disclosure, each instance of distributing a target file to a different peer may constitute a different torrent transaction. Examples of target files that may be distributed via torrent transactions include, without limitation, executable files, non-executable files, media files (such as video files and/or audio files), archived files (such as ZIP files), compressed files, and/or any other types of suitable files.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The systems described herein may perform step <b>302</b> in a variety of ways. In some examples, the systems described herein may identify a torrent file downloaded via a browser. For example, identification module <b>104</b> may, as part of computing device <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, identify files downloaded by computing device <b>214</b> that end in the &#x201c;.torrent&#x201d; extension.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustration of an exemplary torrent file <b>210</b> that contains metadata for facilitating a torrent transaction. As detailed above, torrent file <b>210</b> may contain metadata for facilitating a torrent transaction involving target file <b>218</b>. For example, torrent file <b>210</b> may provide a URL for a torrent tracking site capable of coordinating the torrent transaction (in this example, &#x201c;&#x2018;announce&#x2019;: &#x2018;http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce&#x2019;&#x201d;), a name that uniquely identifies target file <b>218</b> (in this example, &#x201c;&#x2018;name&#x2019;: &#x2018;example.avi&#x2019;&#x201d;), the number of bytes in each piece of target file <b>218</b> to be obtained from one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N) (in this example, &#x201c;&#x2018;piece length&#x2019;: 262144&#x201d;), a concatenation for each piece of target file <b>218</b> available for download (in this example, &#x201c;&#x2018;pieces&#x2019;: &#x2018;841ae846bc5b6d7bd6e9aa3dd9e551559c82abc1 . . . d14f1631d776008f83772ee170c42411618190a4&#x2019;&#x201d;), and the number of bytes in the entire target file <b>218</b> (in this example, &#x201c;&#x2018;length&#x2019;: 678301696&#x2019;&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at step <b>304</b> the systems described herein may identify at least one entity involved in the torrent transaction. For example, identification module <b>104</b> may, as part of computing device <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, identify at least one entity capable of participating in a torrent transaction involving target file <b>218</b>. Examples of such entities include, without limitation, torrent hosting sites (such as http://thepiratebay.org), the original seeder that originally provided or made available the target file, peers capable of providing (i.e., seeding) or obtaining (i.e., leeching) at least a portion of the target file, a torrent-tracking server capable of coordinating the torrent transaction, and/or any other suitable entities involved in the torrent transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The systems disclosed herein may perform step <b>304</b> in a variety of ways. In some examples, in order to identify the original seeder, the systems described herein may communicate with the torrent hosting site in order to identify a relationship between the original seeder and the torrent file. For example, identification module <b>104</b> may, as part of computing device <b>214</b> and/or reputation service <b>216</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, communicate with torrent hosting site <b>208</b> in order to identify a username or profile associated with the original seeder that uploaded torrent file <b>210</b> to torrent hosting site <b>208</b>. In this example, torrent hosting site <b>208</b> may implement a policy requiring authentication of original seeders in order to track whether such original seeders provide any torrent files associated with malware-infected target files.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another example, the systems described herein may identify the relationship between the original seeder and the torrent file simply by analyzing metadata included within the torrent file itself. For example, although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, torrent file <b>210</b> may contain metadata that identifies the original seeder that uploaded torrent file <b>210</b> to torrent hosting site <b>208</b>. In this example, identification module <b>104</b> may identify the original seeder by simply analyzing the metadata included within torrent file <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one example, the systems described herein may identify the torrent hosting site that hosts the torrent file by (1) determining, by monitoring browser downloads, that the torrent file has been downloaded and then (2) identifying a relationship between the torrent hosting site and the torrent file. For example, identification module <b>104</b> may, by monitoring a browser configured to execute on computing device <b>214</b>, determine that torrent file <b>210</b> has been downloaded from a URL associated with torrent hosting site <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some examples, the systems described herein may identify at least one peer involved in the torrent transaction by monitoring and parsing network traffic. For example, identification module <b>104</b> may, after computing device <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> begins participating in a torrent transaction involving target file <b>218</b> with one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N), monitor network traffic generated by a torrent client running on computing device <b>214</b>. In this example, identification module <b>104</b> may identify, by parsing this network traffic, the IP address of peer <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>), indicating that peer <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>) has been seeding and/or leeching at least a portion of target file <b>218</b> to or from computing device <b>214</b> during the torrent transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the torrent file may contain metadata that identifies a torrent-tracking server capable of coordinating the torrent transaction. In this example, the systems described herein may identify the torrent-tracking server by simply analyzing the metadata included within the torrent file itself. For example, identification module <b>104</b> may, by analyzing torrent file <b>210</b>, identify a URL associated with torrent-tracking server <b>212</b>. In this example, torrent-tracking server <b>210</b> may be configured to use torrent tracking information <b>136</b> to coordinate a torrent transaction involving target file <b>218</b> by identifying one or more peers (e.g., peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N)) capable of seeding and/or leeching at least a portion of target file <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some examples, the systems described herein may identify at least one entity involved in the torrent transaction prior to actually participating in the torrent transaction. For example, identification module <b>104</b> may identify torrent hosting site <b>208</b> and/or torrent-tracking server <b>212</b> prior to attempting to obtain target file <b>218</b> by simply analyzing metadata contained within torrent file <b>210</b>. In other examples, the systems described herein may identify at least one entity involved in the torrent transaction subsequent to beginning participation in the torrent transaction. For example, identification module <b>104</b> may identify one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N) upon attempting to obtain at least a portion of target file <b>218</b> using a torrent client.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>306</b>, the systems described herein may obtain information that identifies the reputation of the entity identified in step <b>304</b>. For example, reputation module <b>106</b> may, as part of computing device <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, obtain reputation information <b>132</b> from reputation service <b>216</b> that identifies the trustworthiness of the entity in question (e.g., torrent hosting site <b>208</b>, the original seeder that uploaded torrent file <b>210</b>, torrent-tracking server <b>212</b>, and/or at least one of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N)).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The term &#x201c;reputation information,&#x201d; as used herein, generally refers to information that conveys the opinion of a specific community (such as the user base of a security-software publisher) on the trustworthiness or legitimacy of a target file and/or entity (such as an original seeder, torrent hosting site, torrent-tracking server, peer, etc.). Examples of reputation information include, without limitation, reputation scores (where, for example, high reputation scores indicate that a file or entity is generally trusted within a community and low reputation scores indicate that a file or entity is generally untrusted within a community), prevalence information (e.g., information that identifies the number or percentage of user devices within a community that contain an instance of a particular file), or any other information that may be used to identify a community's opinion on the trustworthiness or legitimacy of a file or entity.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an illustration of exemplary reputation information <b>132</b>. As illustrated in this figure, reputation information <b>132</b> may include or identify the file name of target file <b>218</b>, a file hash that uniquely identifies target file <b>218</b>, the name (e.g., the username or profile identifier) of the entity that originally provided or made available target file <b>218</b> (i.e., the original seeder), a URL (or another identifier) associated with torrent hosting site <b>208</b>, a reputation score associated with torrent hosting site <b>208</b>, the IP address(es) of one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N), a reputation score associated with one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N) (including, e.g., an average reputation score of one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N)), a URL (or another identifier) associated with torrent-tracking server <b>212</b>, and/or a reputation score associated with torrent-tracking server <b>212</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates reputation information <b>132</b> associated with various entities involved in a torrent transaction, the reputation information obtained in step <b>306</b> may be limited to a community's opinion on fewer entities (e.g., a single entity).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The systems described herein may perform step <b>306</b> in a variety of ways. In some examples, the systems described herein may obtain the reputation information from a reputation service configured to formulate reputation information by collecting, aggregating, and analyzing reporting information from computing devices within a community (such as one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N)). For example, reputation module <b>106</b> may, as part of computing device <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, retrieve reputation information <b>132</b> from reputation service <b>216</b> that has been formulated to represent a community's opinion on the trustworthiness of the entity in question based on reporting information collected, aggregated, and analyzed from one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As detailed above, reputation services may generate reputation information for target files by collecting, aggregating, and analyzing data from user devices within a community (such as the user base of a security-software publisher). Examples of the types of reporting information that may be gathered from user devices within a community and used to determine the trustworthiness of target files include, without limitation, information that identifies the overall health of a user device (i.e., information that identifies the performance, stability, and/or state of security of the user device), information that identifies one or more target files obtained via a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol (including information that identifies the original seeder and/or the source or origin of such files), information that identifies the impact of such files on the health of the user device (e.g., information that identifies the health of the user device both before and after a target file is obtained via a peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol), and any other information that may be used to evaluate the trustworthiness of target files obtained via torrent transactions. In some examples, by collecting, aggregating, and analyzing such reporting information from potentially millions of user devices within a community (such as the user base of a security-software publisher), a reputation service may be able to gain a fairly accurate understanding as to the trustworthiness of a target file obtained via a torrent transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some examples, reputation services may assign reputation scores to entities based at least in part on the trustworthiness of the files commonly associated with such entities. For example, if an entity has been involved in one or more torrent transactions involving target files with poor reputations (e.g., malware-infected files), a reputation service may assign a poor reputation score to the entity in question. For example, an original seeder reputation score of 25% shown as part of reputation information <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may indicate that the original seeder (JohnDoe, in this example) that uploaded torrent file <b>210</b> to torrent hosting site <b>208</b> has been involved in multiple torrent transactions involving malware-infected files. As will be explained in greater detail below, this poor reputation may indicate a high likelihood that future torrent transactions involving this original seeder represent a potential security risk.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In contrast, if an entity has been involved mostly in torrent transactions involving target files with good reputations (e.g., legitimate files), the reputation service may assign a good reputation score to the entity in question. For example, a torrent-tracking server reputation of 99% shown as part of reputation information <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may indicate that torrent-tracking server <b>212</b> has not been involved in many (if any) torrent transactions involving malware-infected files. This good reputation may indicate a low likelihood that future torrent transactions involving torrent-tracking server <b>212</b> represent a potential security risk. As will be described in greater detail below, security module <b>108</b> may apply different magnitudes (or weights) to reputation scores in order to determine whether a particular torrent transaction (or target file associated with the same) represents a potential security risk.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at step <b>308</b> the systems described herein may determine, based at least in part on the reputation information obtained in step <b>306</b>, that the target file represents a potential security risk. For example, security module <b>108</b> may, as part of computing device <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, determine, by analyzing reputation information <b>132</b> obtained from reputation service <b>216</b>, that the poor reputation of torrent hosting site <b>208</b>, the original seeder that uploaded torrent file <b>210</b> to torrent hosting site <b>208</b>, torrent-tracking server <b>212</b>, and/or one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N) indicates that target file <b>218</b> represents a potential security risk. This potential security risk may include the potential for introducing any type or form of unwanted software component (such as malware, computer viruses, spyware, worms, Trojan horses, adware, crimeware, and/or rootkits) into a computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The systems described herein may perform step <b>308</b> in a variety of ways. In some examples, the systems described herein may apply one or more reputation scores identified within the reputation information obtained in step <b>306</b> to a mathematical formula. For example, security module <b>108</b> may input the reputation scores identified within reputation information <b>132</b> into a mathematical formula that applies different magnitudes or weights to the entities in order to make certain reputation scores more or less influential in determining whether target file <b>218</b> represents a potential security risk. In this example, security module <b>108</b> may calculate a result based at least in part on the reputation scores as applied to the mathematical formula, and upon determining that the result fails to reach a particular threshold, security module <b>108</b> may determine that target file <b>218</b> represents a security risk.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In other examples, the systems described herein may determine whether any reputation scores identified within the reputation information are below a particular threshold. For example, security module <b>108</b> may analyze the reputation scores identified within reputation information <b>132</b> in order to determine whether any of the reputation scores are below 40% (on a scale of 0-100%). For example, upon identifying the reputation score for the original seeder, security module <b>108</b> may determine that, because the reputation score for the original seeder is below 40%, target file <b>218</b> represents a potential security risk.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some examples, the systems described herein may also determine that the target file represents a potential security risk by (1) obtaining at least a portion of the target file via the torrent transaction and then (2) determining that the target file negatively impacts the health of the computing device. For example, if reputation information <b>132</b> is unable to provide a sufficient basis for determining whether target file <b>218</b> represents a potential security risk, security module <b>108</b> may allow at least a portion of target file <b>218</b> to be downloaded by computing device <b>214</b>. In this example, after downloading all or a portion of target file <b>218</b>, security module <b>108</b> may analyze the health of computing device <b>214</b> and determine that target file <b>218</b> has negatively impacted the health of computing device <b>214</b> (by, e.g., lowering the overall performance, stability, and/or state of security of computing device <b>214</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At step <b>310</b>, the systems described herein may perform a security action on the target file. For example, security module <b>108</b> may, as part of computing device <b>214</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, perform a security action on target file <b>218</b> either prior to or after obtaining all or a portion of target file <b>218</b> from one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N) via the BITTORRENT protocol. For example, security module <b>108</b> may alert a user of the potential security risk, block access to the target file until overridden by the user, block network traffic associated with the torrent transaction, quarantine the target file, and/or delete the target file.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The systems described herein may perform step <b>310</b> in a variety of ways. For example, security module <b>108</b> may alert a user of computing device <b>214</b> of the potential security risk by causing a dialog to be displayed on an output component (such as a monitor) of computing device <b>214</b>. In other examples, in order to block network traffic associated with the torrent transaction, security module <b>108</b> may monitor network traffic involving computing device <b>214</b> and then block all network traffic associated with the BITTORRENT protocol. Upon completion of step <b>310</b>, exemplary method <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may terminate.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some examples, the systems described herein may provide reporting information to a reputation service in order to enable the reputation service to update the reputation information for the entities involved in torrent transaction. For example, reporting module <b>110</b> may, as part of computing device <b>214</b>, provide reporting information to reputation service <b>216</b>. As detailed above, this reporting information may identify (1) the target file involved in the torrent transaction, (2) at least one entity associated with the torrent transaction, and/or (3) the impact of the target file on the health of the computing device (if, e.g., the computing device downloaded all or a portion of the target file).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow diagram of an exemplary computer-implemented method <b>700</b> for assigning reputation scores to entities involved in torrent transactions (such as the torrent transactions discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be performed by any suitable computer-executable code and/or computing system. In some embodiments, the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may be performed by one or more of the components of system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, system <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, computing system <b>810</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and/or portions of exemplary network architecture <b>900</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, at step <b>702</b> one or more of the various systems described herein may receive reporting information from at least one computing device (such as one or more of peers <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>)-(N)). As detailed above, this reporting information may identify a target file obtained via a torrent transaction, at least one entity that was involved in the torrent transaction, and/or the impact of the target file on the health of the computing device. For example, reporting module <b>110</b> may, as part of reputation service <b>216</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, receive reporting information <b>134</b>(<b>1</b>) from peer <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>) that identifies (1) a target file (e.g., target file <b>218</b>) that was obtained by peer <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>) via a torrent transaction, (2) the identities of each entity that was involved in the torrent transaction, and/or (3) the impact of target file <b>218</b> on the health of peer <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an illustration of exemplary reporting information <b>134</b>(<b>1</b>) that may be received from a peer upon completion of a torrent transaction. As illustrated in this figure, reputation information may include information that identifies the name of the target file obtained via the torrent transaction, a target file hash that uniquely identifies the target file, the name of the original seeder (such as a username or profile identifier of the original seeder that originally made the target file available), the URL (or another identifier) of the torrent hosting site that hosted the torrent file, the IP address(es) of one or more of peers (seeders and/or leechers) that participated in the torrent transaction, and/or the URL (or another identifier) of at least one torrent-tracking server that participated in the torrent transaction. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates reporting information <b>134</b>(<b>1</b>) associated with various entities involved in a torrent transaction, the reporting information received in step <b>702</b> may identify fewer entities (e.g., a single entity) involved in the torrent transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, at step <b>704</b> the systems described herein may assign, based at least in part on the reporting information received from the computing device, a reputation score to at least one entity involved in the torrent transaction. For example, reputation module <b>106</b> may, as part of reputation service <b>216</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, formulate and assign, based at least in part on the reporting information received in step <b>702</b>, a reputation score to at least one entity involved in the torrent transaction reported by peer <b>206</b>(<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As detailed above, the systems described herein may be able to gain a fairly accurate understanding as to the trustworthiness of a target file obtained via a torrent transaction by collecting, aggregating, and analyzing reporting information from potentially millions of user devices within a community (such as the user base of a security-software publisher). In some examples, the systems described herein may also assign reputation scores to entities involved in torrent transactions based at least in part on the trustworthiness of the files involved in such transactions. For example, if an entity has been involved in one or more torrent transactions involving target files with poor reputations (e.g., malware-infected files), reputation module <b>106</b> may assign a poor reputation score to the entity in question. As will be explained in greater detail below, this poor reputation score may indicate a high likelihood that future torrent transactions involving this original seeder represent a potential security risk.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In contrast, if an entity has been involved mostly in torrent transactions involving target files with good reputations (e.g., legitimate files), then reputation module <b>106</b> may assign a good reputation score to the entity in question. This good reputation may indicate a low likelihood that future torrent transactions involving the entity represent a potential security risk.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At step <b>706</b>, the systems described herein may provide the reputation score assigned to the entity to at least one additional computing device (such as computing device <b>214</b>) participating in an additional torrent transaction that involves the entity in question. As detailed above, this reputation score may enable the additional computing device to determine whether the additional torrent transaction involving the entity in question represents a potential security risk.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The systems described herein may perform step <b>706</b> in a variety of ways. In one example, reputation module <b>106</b> may, as part of reputation service <b>216</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, receive a request from computing device <b>214</b> to provide reputation information for the entity in question. In this example, reputation module <b>106</b> may provide the requested reputation information to computing device <b>214</b> in response to the request. As detailed above, this reputation information may enable computing device <b>214</b> to determine whether to participate in torrent transactions involving the entity in question. Upon completion of step <b>706</b>, exemplary method <b>700</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> may terminate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As explained above, by collecting, aggregating, and analyzing reporting information from potentially millions of users involved in torrent transactions, the systems and methods described herein may enable security-software publishers to gain a fairly accurate understanding as to the trustworthiness of entities involved in torrent transactions (such as original seeders, torrent hosting sites, torrent-tracking servers, peers, etc.) based at least in part on the types of files (e.g., malicious or non-malicious) commonly associated with such entities. Moreover, by providing this reputation information to client devices, the systems and methods described herein may enable security software installed on such devices to evaluate and potentially reliably predict the trustworthiness of target files obtainable via torrent transactions based at least in part on the reputations of the entities involved in such transactions, thereby potentially preventing or reducing the proliferation of malware via such transactions.</p>
