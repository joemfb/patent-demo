<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Systems are available for providing television schedule information to a user. For example, U.S. Pat. No. B1 4,706,121 (Young), provides a television schedule system and process. The system disclosed in the Young patent receives television schedule information as a broadcast. In one embodiment of Young, the television schedule information is provided on the user's television screen. The user can then supply selection criteria which are utilized by the Young system to make program selection, to control the television schedule information displayed on the television screen, etc. In addition, Young discloses a system which controls a television receiver to allow for the automatic user selection of programs and the automatic, unattended recording of programs that are listed in the television schedule information. The automatic, unattended recording of programs is achieved by controlling a video tape recorder (VCR) or other recording device. Young also proposes utilizing a personal computer for the television schedule information.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Schedule information is typically displayed on a grid or matrix having program names at time and channel locations on the grid. In some systems, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,353,121 (Young), special buttons on a remote control are utilized to schedule events or access information in special formats.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a television schedule guide as displayed on a computer screen along with a user input device. In the preferred embodiment, the television schedule information is provided in a grid-like display on a television or computer screen <b>50</b>. In this example, various channels are provided on the Y-axis of the grid guide, and various times are provided on the X-axis of the grid guide. This display can also contain special instructions for the user in screen area <b>52</b>. The television schedule guide in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has been customized by a user such that only channels 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, HBO, SHO and PBS are included in the displayed guide. In one embodiment, a television within computer system <b>810</b> or television system <b>830</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) can be used as computer screen <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally, when events are scheduled they are added to a schedule of those events. For example, a schedule of all shows to be recorded may be maintained and displayed to the viewer on request when the schedule button is pushed. Additionally, schedules listing all shows of a particular type, e.g., comedy, or broadcast on a particular station may be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Consumers tend to be uncomfortable with scheduling technology and thus there is a continuing need for creative techniques to make scheduling easier and more accessible to consumers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention provides an interactive computer system which assists a user in utilizing television schedule information. In a preferred embodiment, the user can (1) display television schedule information in a desired format on the computer or television screen, (2) select a chosen program which is listed in the television schedule information to display an action pop-up, and (3) select one or more chosen action items which are listed in the action pop-up to automatically schedule the selected action. To provide this functionality in the preferred embodiment, the present invention includes a computer system, implemented as a dedicated set-top box, a personal computer, or a combination of personal computer and set-top box and a television system. The displays are created and actions scheduled by application software stored in the memory of the computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an action pop-up superimposed over a scheduling grid displayed on a television screen. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart depicting the steps of initiating the display of the action pop-up and selecting an action to be performed. The utilization of the action pop-up and the function of the application programs stored in computer memory will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which depict a user input device configured as a remote control.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The user, via input device <b>60</b>, can scroll throughout the television schedule information provided in the grid guide. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a user input device <b>60</b> in the form of a specially configured IR remote control. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, action buttons <b>61</b> cause actions to be scheduled, a schedule button <b>62</b> causes a schedule of events to be displayed, scroll or cursor <b>64</b> buttons allow the user to choose an item in the grid, a page button <b>66</b> changes the page of the grid displayed, and a select button <b>68</b> selects a chosen program. User input device <b>60</b> can also be, for example, a keyboard with arrow keys, a computer pointing device (e.g., a mouse) or a voice recognition input. By utilizing user input device <b>60</b>, a user can sort, mix, and do a special customized line-up of channels within the television schedule guide displayed on a television or computer screen. In addition, the user can automatically tune to a desired program or can select different programs for automatic recording. For more information on automatic tuning and automatic recording, see U.S. Pat. No. B1 4,706,121 and U.S. patent Ser. No. 07/623,429, now, U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,525; these patents are, like the present patent application, assigned to Starsight Telecast, Inc. U.S. Pat. No. B1 4,706,121 and U.S. patent Ser. No. 07/623,429, now, U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,525 are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The viewer chooses a program in the grid by using the cursor direction buttons <b>64</b> on the remote control <b>60</b>. In this embodiment the select button <b>68</b> is utilized in hypermode where a short press of the select button causes the application software to initiate a tune function and holding the select button down for a predetermined length of time causes the application software to display the action pop-up.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When the action pop-up is displayed, the viewer moves between the listed actions utilizing the up and down direction buttons <b>64</b>. When the desired action is chosen, the select button <b>68</b> is given a short press to select the desired action to be effected on the chosen program in the grid.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, a viewer does not need to understand the use of the special action buttons or keys <b>61</b> on the remote <b>60</b> or the keys can be eliminated to simplify the design and reduce the cost of the remote control device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the actions listed are: &#x201c;Buy&#x201d;; &#x201c;Info&#x201d;; &#x201c;Auto Tune&#x201d;; &#x201c;Record&#x201d;; &#x201c;Make Favorite&#x201d;; and &#x201c;Unlock All&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The &#x201c;Buy&#x201d; item will only appear if a pay-per-view channel is chosen. If the &#x201c;Buy&#x201d; item in the action pop-up is selected then a purchasing screen, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is displayed. The purchasing screen displays the time of the program to be purchased and the price of the program. If the user wishes to purchase the program then SELECT is pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If the &#x201c;Auto Tune&#x201d; or &#x201c;Record&#x201d; items in the action pop-up are selected, these functions are scheduled and implemented as described in the above-referenced patents.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">If the &#x201c;Make Favorite&#x201d; action is selected, the station broadcasting the chosen program is marked as favorite channel for FAV key tuning.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The &#x201c;Unlock All&#x201d; action is displayed only if programming has previously been locked to prevent unauthorized viewing.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternatively, the viewer may activate the pop-up to display options available for a program currently being viewed without the need to first display the scheduling grid guide. In the preferred embodiment, the pop-up is activated by holding the select button <b>68</b> down for the predetermined length of time. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the pop-up would be superimposed over the program currently being watched. The action selected from the pop-up would be directed to program being viewed. For example, it could be made a favorite or recorded by selecting the appropriate options.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, in the preferred embodiment the application software displays an icon next to the program entry in the scheduling grid to associate the icon with action in the viewer's mind.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The icons for the series, record, and tune actions are displayed on the bottom of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> which is a schedule of actions scheduled. Briefly, the series icon is displayed along with one of the other icons to indicate that the action indicated by the other icon has been scheduled to occur repeatedly according to a selected schedule. The record icon indicates that the application software will cause the program marked by the icon to be recorded; the buy icon indicates that a pay-per-view program marked by the icon has been purchased; and the tune icon indicates that the application software will automatically tune to the program marked by the icon when the program is broadcast.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a preferred embodiment, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the application software displays the duration of each scheduled event in a column included in a schedule of events display. The information relating to the programs to be recorded is the most important and is highlighted because the viewer must determine whether a cassette has enough available tape to record the program.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram of a television schedule systems/controller <b>180</b> with which the viewer input device <b>212</b> is used to display action pop-ups. The schedule system/controller <b>180</b> is applicable to existing television equipment, where the schedule system is separate from the basic television equipment. Programmable tuner <b>202</b> is shown as part of a cable decoder. It is clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that the system/controller <b>180</b> may be implemented as a set top box or be integrated into other television equipment, such as a cable decoder or a TV/Monitor receiver. It is also practical to implement the entire system/controller <b>180</b> in a remote controller by adding a text display, such as an LCD screen, on remote controller <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the system <b>180</b>, programmable tuner <b>202</b>, which may be part of a cable decoder unit, receives a TV signal from antenna <b>200</b> and/or from cable input <b>205</b>. Tuner output <b>216</b> goes to a vertical blanking interval (VBI) decoder <b>222</b>, which may be a closed caption decoder or a high speed teletext decoder. Listing information and other support information, such as cable channel assignment data, will be transmitted over the VBI by one or more local stations or cable channels several times a day or continuously.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When update is required, programmable tuner <b>202</b> will be tuned automatically to the station or cable channel carrying the data. After the VBI signal is processed by CPU <b>228</b>, the listing data is stored in schedule memory <b>232</b>, while the cable channel assignment data is stored in cable-specific RAM memory <b>238</b>. This data is used to convert generic TV source names, such as HBO, to channel assignments for the specific cable system.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Other information transmitted to the schedule/tape controller <b>180</b> and stored in the system RAM memory <b>240</b> includes clock update data to set system clock <b>230</b> automatically, schedule update time, which may vary from once a day to a continuously transmitted format, new theme categories, and last minute schedule change data.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To display an action pop-up on the television monitor <b>210</b> in response to receiving a pop-up input device signal, pop-up image data is stored in system RAM/ROM <b>240</b> and is processed by the CPU and output to the video display generator <b>224</b>. The video switcher <b>226</b> is enabled by CPU output <b>246</b> to select the video display generator output whenever a pop-up is to be presented to the TV/monitor <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a computer system coupled to a television system. In the preferred embodiment, computer system <b>810</b> includes standard computer <b>812</b> which is, for example, any available personal computer (e.g., IBM compatible, Macintosh, and the like).

<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition to the computer program, data for the basic schedule information and other related data (e.g., data relating to a particular show) are needed for the generation and maintenance of the television schedule guide. These data can be received via line <b>822</b>; they can also be provided via a satellite broadcast from satellite <b>824</b>. Additionally, the television schedule information and related data can be sent directly to television <b>832</b> via satellite <b>824</b>. In this arrangement, the television schedule information and related data does not have to be transmitted from computer system <b>810</b> to television system <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, line <b>822</b> is a telephone line which provides access to the internet or other on-line service via, for example, a regular modem or direct modem access to a schedule provider. The schedule data are then provided via the internet or other on-line service, or directly from the service provider. As stated above, line <b>822</b> can also be, for example, coax cable, optical fiber or any other land line which can provide data to computer <b>812</b>. The software program saved on hard drive <b>814</b> then utilizes the data received on line <b>822</b> to generate a television schedule guide. The user can retrieve this generated television schedule guide when desired.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In general, the flowcharts in this specification include one or more steps performed by software routines executing in a computer system. The routines may be implemented by any means as is known in the art. For example, any number of computer programming languages, such as Java, &#x201c;C&#x201d;, Pascal, FORTRAN, assembly language, etc., may be used. Further, various programming approaches such as procedural, object-oriented or artificial intelligence techniques may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Many such changes or modifications will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a pop-up could be displayed in any schedule of programs to schedule events for programs displayed. Further, in a PCTV context, actions displayed in a PCTV pop-up could include buying an item being sold on a home shopping station.</p>
