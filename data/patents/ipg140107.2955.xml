<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process for producing an amide compound by Beckmann rearrangement of an oxime compound. In particular, the invention relates to a process for producing an amide compound such as laurolactam useful as a starting material for Nylon 12 using cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime or hydrochloride thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An industrial production of laurolactam by Beckmann rearrangement reaction of cyclododecanone oxime generally employs concentrated sulfuric acid or oleum as a rearranging agent. However, it is necessary to use sulfuric acid in an equimolar amount to the oxime and to, after the reaction, neutralize sulfuric acid with a base such as ammonia, which causes that a large amount of ammonium sulfate is formed as a byproduct. The process, therefore, requires facilities for producing concentrated sulfuric acid and oleum and for treating ammonium sulfate, which is a process with significant environmental burden and facility cost (Patent Document No. 1, Patent Document No. 2).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For solving such a problem, various catalyst reaction systems have been investigated. For example, there have been described Beckmann rearrangement reaction using cyanuric chloride as a catalyst (see Patent Document 3 and Non-patent Document 1), rearrangement of the oxime in the presence of a dialkylamide compound and phosphorous pentoxide (see Patent Document 4), rearrangement of the oxime in the presence of a dialkylamide compound, phosphorous pentoxide and a fluorine-containing strong acid (see Patent Document 5), rearrangement of the oxime in the presence of a dialkylamide compound, a condensed phosphoric acid compound and optionally a fluorine-containing strong acid (see Patent Document 6), rearrangement of the oxime in the presence of a dialkylamide compound, phosphorous pentoxide or a condensed phosphoric acid compound, and a non-fluorinated sulfonic anhydride (see Patent Document 7), rearrangement of the oxime in the presence of a dialkylamide compound, an inorganic acid and a carboxylic anhydride (see Patent Document 8), and rearrangement of the oxime in the presence of an acid anhydride under the condition that the total molar amount of water contained in a reaction system is 15 or less to that of the acid anhydride (see Patent Document 9). However, most of the processes employ a particular catalyst or solvent for which a recovering or recycling method has not been explicitly described and are thus imperfect as an industrial process.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Those that are relatively inexpensive and readily available as industrial chemicals include cyanuric chloride, phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous pentachloride and thionyl chloride. Among these, cyanuric chloride, phosphorous trichloride and phosphorous pentachloride are converted, when inactivated, into compounds insoluble in an organic solvent such as cyanuric acid and phosphoric acid, and therefore when being used in a large amount, they cause pipe blockage or poor heat transfer in an industrial process, and thus they are undesirable. In contrast, since thionyl chloride is finally decomposed to generate hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide without solid precipitation, a simple industrial process can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In terms of Beckmann rearrangement of an oxime compound using thionyl chloride as a catalyst, Patent Document Nos. 11 and 12 have disclosed a process wherein a mixture of thionyl chloride and an oxime compound is heated. It has been, however, found that in the process, a yield varies depending on, for example, a temperature-increase rate and a yield itself is low. In addition, Beckmann rearrangement is a severely exothermic reaction, which cannot be controlled by the process described in Patent Document Nos. 11 and 12 and cannot be expanded to an industrial scale. Furthermore, a process in which thionyl chloride is added to a solution of an oxime compound heated to a predetermined temperature does not provide a target amide compound in a good yield. Therefore, further improvement is required.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantage of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0047">According to the present invention, an inexpensive and industrially available rearrangement catalyst can be used in a process for producing an amide compound by Beckmann rearrangement of an oxime compound whereby the reaction can be completed with a small amount of the catalyst. Furthermore, the present invention allows for providing an amide compound with a high yield without generating byproducts such as ammonium sulfate or precipitation of a catalyst-decomposition product, which is industrially suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0048">The Beckmann rearrangement reaction of the present invention does not generate an insoluble matter, so that a reaction solution is not turbid. In other words, no precipitates deposit in a reactor or pipe and thus occlusion or poor heat transfer can be avoided. Since insoluble substances generally having a high boiling point are absent, it is easy to treat a residual tank bottom and a distillation loss is small in purification by distillation of an amide compound produced.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0049">In particular, cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime or cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime hydrochloride can be not only a rearrangement catalyst but also a starting material in a Beckmann rearrangement reaction for producing an amide compound, so that processing such as catalyst removal can be eliminated, resulting in easiness to treat and purify. Furthermore, the compound is not hygroscopic nor corrosive, and is stable in the air, and can be, therefore, easily handled.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0057">Cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime and its hydrochloride can be produced by, for example, the following process. Thionyl chloride is dissolved in a solvent such as anhydrous dichloromethane. To this solution, cyclododecanone oxime in two molar amount to thionyl chloride is added and dissolved and the solvent is evaporated to give cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime hydrochloride as a white solid. For further purification, it can be purified by column chromatography or recrystallization.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0058">To the cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime hydrochloride, a solvent is added again and the mixture is washed with an aqueous alkaline solution until an aqueous phase becomes alkaline.

<p id="p-0033" num="0059">Cyclododecanone oxime as a reaction material can be produced from cyclododecanone and hydroxylamine sulfate as described in Patent Document No. 10. A molar ratio of cyclododecanone oxime to thionyl chloride is preferably 2:1 (cyclododecanone oxime thionyl chloride). An excessively larger or smaller molar ratio may lead to increase in impurities other than cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime, so that subsequent purification becomes complicated. With a smaller molar ratio than the above value, cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime may be decomposed by unreacted thionyl chloride.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0060">There are no particular restrictions to the above solvent as long as it does not inhibit this reaction, which is preferably aprotic solvent including organohalides such as dichloromethane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, cumene and chlorobenzene, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n-hexane, n-heptane, n-nonane, cyclohexane, isopropylcyclohexane, cyclooctane, cyclodecane and cyclododecane, ethers such as dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, and mixtures thereof.</p>

A reaction time is preferably 60 min or less, and generally a reaction time is within 10 min after dissolution of cyclododecanone oxime. There are no particular restrictions to a reactor, and the reaction can be conducted in a reactor equipped with a common stirrer.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0066">Furthermore, for obtainingcyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime, solid cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime hydrochloride is re-dissolved in a solvent, and the solution is washed with an aqueous alkaline solution including an aqueous solution containing one or two or more of metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate; and metal acetates such as sodium acetate and potassium acetate until the aqueous phase becomes alkaline (pH 7 or more).

<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Process for Producing an Amide Compound Having a Pre-Preparation Step</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0114">Another aspect of the present invention provides a process for producing an amide compound by Beckmann rearrangement of an oxime compound using thionyl chloride as a rearrangement catalyst, having the steps of pre-preparation (described later) and a rearrangement reaction. In the pre-preparation step, a chlorine-containing catalytically active species (intermediate) is formed, and in the rearrangement reaction step, Beckmann rearrangement reaction is conducted using the catalytically active species. The inventors of the present invention have found that when cyclododecanone oxime is used as one of oxime compounds, a catalytically active species in a reaction liquid obtained by the pre-preparation step is the above cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime hydrochloride, which gives cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime by treatment with an alkali. These will be detailed below.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0115">There will be detailed a mechanism of a reaction forming the above catalytically active species in the pre-preparation step. First, hydrogen chloride is eliminated from thionyl chloride and the oxime compound to form a compound having a structure represented by Formula (4), and then an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction of the compound of Formula (4) occurs to give a compound represented by Formula (5). Here, the sulfur atom is eliminated as sulfur dioxide.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0116">It is suggested by the following results. A solution containing a pre-prepared catalytically active species (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;pre-preparation solution&#x201d;) was degassed under a reduced pressure to remove a gas generated by elimination and the residual thionyl chloride. The sample was combusted by an automatic sample combustion apparatus (for example, type AQF-100 from Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation) and a gas generated was absorbed by an aqueous alkaline solution, which was then analyzed by ion chromatography (for example, ICS1000 system from DIONEX). Chlorine was detected in an about 0.5-fold amount of the thionyl chloride fed and a trace amount of sulfur was detected.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0118">Here, bonding electrons are localized to Cl and the nitrogen atom is electron-poor while Beckmann rearrangement proceeds and an amide or lactam intermediate represented by Formula (6) or (6&#x2032;) is formed.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0122">An amide (or lactam) is eliminated from the oxime-amide (or oxime-lactam) intermediate (Formula (7)) to regenerate the compound represented by Formula (5), and thus a catalyst cycle is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0123">When the oxime compound represented by Formula (3) is cyclododecanone oxime, the intermediate represented by Formula (7) can be isolated. An alkali was added for removing hydrogen chloride (HCl) to stabilize the product, which was then recrystallized. Then, it was confirmed that the analysis of X-ray diffraction demonstrated that the product is the above cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime represented by the Formula (1).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0124">A catalytic amount of the isolated intermediate was used in a Beckmann rearrangement reaction of cyclododecanone oxime whereby the reaction quickly proceeds to give laurolactam in a high yield. These results show that the isolated intermediate is the above cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime hydrochloride represented by Formula (2).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0125">Furthermore, a compound represented by Formula (8) which is produced by rearrangement of the oxime moiety in the intermediate (Formula (7)) would be also a catalytically active species. Namely, a cycle in which an amide (or lactam) moiety is eliminated from the compound represented by Formula (8) to regenerate the amide or lactam intermediate represented by Formula (6) or Formula (6&#x2032;) would be also speculated.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0126">In other words, the catalyst cycle in this rearrangement reaction is represented by catalyst cycle (1) or (2) (the numbers in parenthesis in the schemes indicate corresponding compound numbers. For example, (5) indicates the compound represented by Formula (5)). In any reaction path, a stable intermediate is the compound represented by Formula (7) (catalytically active species).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0127">Meanwhile, the intermediate (Formula (7) (catalytically active species)) itself is sometimes decomposed into an amide (or lactam) and an oxime. In this case, the catalyst cycle represented catalyst cycle (1) or (2) is broken, resulting in decrease of turnover of a catalyst. Therefore, in the pre-preparation, the conditions must be selected so that the chlorine-containing intermediate (Formula (7)) as a catalytically active species can be obtained in a high yield.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0128">Furthermore, it is preferable to avoid generation and co-existence of the amide (or lactam) in the pre-preparation for preventing reversal of the catalyst cycle.</p>

</chemistry>
</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0130">There will be described a preferable aspect in the step of pre-preparation.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Apparatus for the Pre-Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0131">An apparatus used for the pre-preparation preferably consists of three units, that is, a mixing unit, a pipe for a mixed liquid and a degassing tank.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0132">As the mixing unit, a unit simply mixing thionyl chloride and an oxime compound in pipes; a line mixer improving blending of thionyl chloride and an oxime compound, or a unit equipped with a stirrer can be used. When the reaction is stirred, its residence time in the mixing unit is preferably short, generally 5 min or less, preferably 2 min or less. With an excessively long residence time, an amide or lactam compound generated by decomposition of a catalytically active species (Formula (7)) (when cyclododecanone oxime is used as a starting material, the compound represented by Formula (2)) inhibits generation of (7) from (6) or (6&#x2032;) and generation of an oxime compound as described above, and therefore, a yield of the catalytically active species (Formula (7)) in the pre-preparation is reduced. Furthermore, such a reaction apparatus can be equipped with a cooling means such as a jacket for allowing a mixing unit temperature to be lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0133">A pipe for a mixed liquid is a tube with a diameter ensuring plug flowability and can be equipped with a cooling means such as a jacket.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0134">A degassing tank is a tank having a gas section. The degassing tank preferably has a configuration in which an inert gas such as nitrogen can be bubbled into a liquid to actively expel a generated gas. Furthermore, the degassing tank can be equipped with a cooling means such as a jacket.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Time for Degassing in the Pre-Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0135">In the pre-preparation, a time from mixing thionyl chloride and an oxime compound to degassing the mixture in a degassing tank varies depending on a temperature of a mixing unit. For example, the time is preferably 40 min or less and 60 min or less at 60&#xb0; C. and 40&#xb0; C., respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0136">A time over the above residence time is undesirable because catalyst activity is deteriorated in a Beckmann rearrangement reaction due to decomposition of a catalytically active species (Formula (7), and when cyclododecanone oxime is used as a staring material, the compound of Formula (2)). Furthermore, an excessively longer residence time is industrially undesirable due to the necessity for a larger apparatus.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Mixing Ratio in the Pre-Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0137">In the pre-preparation step, the whole or a partial amount of an oxime compound to be involved in a rearrangement reaction can be used. A mixing ratio of thionyl chloride to an oxime compound in the pre-preparation (a molar ratio of an oxime compound/thionyl chloride) is 2.0 or more and 10.0 or less, preferably 2.0 or more and 5.0 or less, further preferably 2.0 or more and 3.0 or less.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0138">Thionyl chloride is used in an amount of preferably 0.01 mol % to 20 mol %, more preferably 0.1 mol % to 5 mol % to the whole amount of the oxime compound used in the pre-preparation and the rearrangement reaction steps.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0139">A too small amount of thionyl chloride is undesirable because the rearrangement reaction does not proceed. On the other hand, an excessively large amount of thionyl chloride is industrially undesirable due to increase in a catalyst cost and a cost for post-processing the catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0140">If the mixing ratio in the pre-preparation is too small, a major part of thionyl chloride does not involve in forming a catalytically active species, leading to inefficient pre-preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0141">A too large mixing ratio in the pre-preparation is undesirable due to the necessity for a larger pre-preparation apparatus. For example, when cyclododecanone oxime is used as an oxime compound, cyclododecanone oxime and a catalytically active species generated in the pre-preparation are poorly soluble in a solvent described later at a temperature described later, and therefore, a large amount of solvent is required for preventing precipitation of a solid or clogging in the pre-preparation step, disadvantageously resulting in the necessity for a large pre-preparation apparatus. Furthermore, an energy cost for collection and recycling of a solvent is disadvantageously increased.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Temperature in the Pre-Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0142">A temperature of the mixing unit and the degassing tank in the pre-preparation is a temperature or lower of a Beckmann rearrangement reaction, preferably 100&#xb0; C. or less, more preferably 60&#xb0; C. or less. An excessively higher temperature in the pre-preparation is undesirable because most of a catalytically active species is converted to an amide or lactam compound, leading to deterioration in catalyst activity. There are no particular restrictions to a lower limit of a preparation temperature as long as the reaction system is not solidified at the temperature, but a temperature of 10&#xb0; C. or lower, furthermore 0&#xb0; C. or lower requires a cooling means, which is uneconomical. For example, when the oxime compound is cyclododecanone oxime, a temperature of the mixing unit and the degassing tank in the pre-preparation is preferably 60&#xb0; C. or less. Since industrially a reaction system involving no precipitants is easily handled, a temperature is preferably 25&#xb0; C. or more for preventing a catalytically active species (the compound of Formula (2)) from precipitating when the solvent is toluene.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Solvent for the Pre-Preparation</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0143">Suitable solvents used in the pre-preparation are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0144">There are no particular restrictions to a solvent used in the present invention as long as it is inert to a rearrangement catalyst or an oxime compound. Examples of a solvent which can be used include nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile and benzonitrile; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, octane and cyclododecane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, chlorobenzene and trifluoromethylbenzene; nitro compounds such as nitrobenzene, nitromethane and nitroethane; and mixtures thereof. Among these, aliphatic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons are particularly suitable solvents because a rate of the Beckmann rearrangement reaction in the pre-preparation can be easily controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0145">Unsuitable solvents are those having an active hydroxyl group or a similar functional group such as organic bases including amines, water, alcohols and mercaptanes, and those reactive to thionyl chloride as a chlorinating agent such as carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid esters.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0146">The above solvents can be also used when a Lewis acid is used as a co-catalyst in a rearrangement reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0147">While an amount of a solvent in the pre-preparation is determined depending on, but not limited to, a temperature, the size of a mixing unit, a degassing tank or the like, when an oxime compound is cyclododecanone oxime and a solvent is toluene, a weight concentration of cyclododecanone oxime is preferably 1% or more and 60% or less, particularly preferably 3% or more and 30% or less. A too small amount of toluene is undesirable because cyclododecanone oxime and an intermediate generated cannot be adequately dissolved, while a too large amount of toluene is undesirable because recovery becomes troublesome and thus uneconomical.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0148">The conditions of the pre-preparation beyond the above ranges are undesirable because a molar production ratio of a catalytically active species (Formula (7)) in a pre-preparation solution to thionyl chloride added in the pre-preparation is reduced and at the same time, an oxime conversion in the rearrangement reaction is reduced. A molar production ratio of a catalytically active species (Formula (7)) in a pre-preparation solution to thionyl chloride is 50% or more, preferably 80% or more, further preferably 90% or more when the oxime compound is cyclododecanone oxime. A conversion in the rearrangement reaction is 98% or more, preferably 99% or more, and when laurolactam is purified by distillation, the conversion is further preferably 99.5% or more for size reduction of a distillation apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0149">There will be described aspects of a rearrangement reaction. Here, a solution containing a catalytically active species pre-prepared is introduced into a Beckmann rearrangement reaction tank, and reacts with an oxime compound separately fed into the reaction tank, to generate an amide or lactam compound.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Beckmann Rearrangement Reaction</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0150">When only a part of an oxime compound is used in the pre-preparation, the pre-preparation solution and an additional part of the oxime compound are mixed in a Beckmann rearrangement reaction.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">Co-Catalyst</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0151">In a Beckmann rearrangement reaction, acids such as hydrogen chloride can be added as a co-catalyst to improve a rate of the rearrangement reaction. In particular, a Lewis acid is preferable because it can improve a rate of the rearrangement reaction without accelerating hydrolysis of an oxime compound such as cyclododecanone oxime.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0152">The Lewis acid is a halide of one or two or more metals selected from the group consisting of zinc, cobalt, antimony, tin and bismuth; specifically zinc fluoride, zinc chloride, zinc bromide, cobalt fluoride, cobalt chloride, cobalt bromide, antimony pentafluoride, antimony pentachloride, antimony pentabromide, tin tetrafluoride, tin tetrachloride, tin tetrabromide, bismuth trifluoride, bismuth trichloride and bismuth tribromide. Among these, zinc chloride and tin tetrachloride are suitable and zinc chloride is particularly preferable because an effect in improvement of a reaction rate is significant.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0153">The amount of a co-catalyst is 0.01 to 10 molar, preferably 0.1 to 5 molar to thionyl chloride. A too small amount of a Lewis acid is less effective in improving a rate of the rearrangement reaction while an excessive amount does not contribute further improvement in a rearrangement rate and leads to increase in a cost for post-processing and recycling the co-catalyst, which is industrially undesirable.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Solvent Used for a Beckmann Rearrangement Reaction</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0154">Although preferably a solvent used in a Beckmann rearrangement reaction is identical to the solvent used in the pre-preparation in the light of simplifying a production process, a different solvent can be used. When a different solvent is used, for example, solvent exchange to a rearrangement solvent can be conducted by adding a rearrangement solvent to a pre-preparation solution and then evaporating a pre-preparation solvent. Alternatively, a Beckmann rearrangement reaction can be conducted in a mixture of the pre-preparation solvent and the rearrangement solvent.</p>

<p id="p-0129" num="0155">A temperature of a Beckmann rearrangement reaction is 60&#xb0; C. to 160&#xb0; C., preferably 80&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. A too low reaction temperature is undesirable because a reaction rate becomes so small for the reaction to stop. Furthermore, at a low temperature, solidification of an oxime compound or its poor solubility in a rearrangement solvent may cause its precipitation, leading to problems in operation. Increasing the amount of a solvent in order to avoid the problems is not preferable because it causes problems such that a production cost is increased due to increase of recovering and recycling the solvent. A too high reaction temperature is also undesirable because the rearrangement reaction becomes so exothermic that a temperature rapidly rises and thus the reaction cannot be controlled. Furthermore, at a too high reaction temperature, a rearrangement yield is reduced due to side reactions such as a condensation reaction and product quality is deteriorated due to staining and so on. For example, when the oxime compound is cyclododecanone oxime, a temperature of a Beckmann rearrangement reaction is preferably 80 to 130&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Reaction Time of Beckmann Rearrangement Reaction</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0156">While a reaction time of Beckmann rearrangement varies depending on various factors such as concentrations of an oxime compound and thionyl chloride and a reaction temperature, it is generally 5 min to 10 hours, preferably 10 min to 4 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0157">These reaction conditions of Beckmann rearrangement are determined such that the reaction can be easily controlled and the reaction does not require an extraordinarily large reactor volume.</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Pressure of a Beckmann Rearrangement Reaction</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0158">A Beckmann rearrangement reaction can be conducted under a reduced pressure, ambient pressure or increased pressure.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">Apparatus Used in a Beckmann Rearrangement Reaction</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0159">A continuous flow device used in a Beckmann rearrangement reaction can be a generally used reactor such as a tubular continuous reactor and a stirring tank type continuous reactor, but a multistage continuous tank type reactor is suitable because of easier reaction temperature control and simple operation.</p>
<p id="h-0028" num="0000">Separation and Purification of Reaction Products of Beckmann Rearrangement</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0160">At the end of a Beckmann rearrangement reaction, a product can be separated and purified by a separation procedure such as filtration, concentration, distillation, extraction, crystallization, recrystallization, absorption and column chromatography and combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0161">For example, in terms of treatment of cyclododecanone oxime after the reaction, water is added to a reaction mixture of the Beckmann rearrangement reaction, and the resulting mixture is extracted with an organic solvent and the solvent can be evaporated to give laurolactam, which can be further separated and purified by distillation, crystallization and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0163">In 20 g of dichloromethane, 0.618 g (5.19 mmol) of thionyl chloride was dissolved. Under ice-cooling, 2.05 g (10.39 mmol) of cyclododecanone oxime was added to the solution and dissolved. Immediately after dissolution, dichloromethane was removed from this solution by an evaporator to give a white powder. The white powder was dissolved in dichloromethane. The solution was transferred in a separatory funnel and washed three times with 20 mL of 0.5 N NaOH (a 0.5 N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide) until an aqueous layer became alkaline as determined by a pH test paper. Then, the dichloromethane solution was washed three times with pure water and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was removed by filtration from the dichloromethane solution and dichloromethane was evaporated to give 1.89 g of a white powder (yield: 96.4%). The white powder was recrystallized from a mixture of dichloromethane/acetone (mixed solvent: dichloromethane/acetone=1/4 (by weight), recrystallization temperature: &#x2212;10 to &#x2212;15&#xb0; C.), to give cyclododecanone-O-azacyclotridecen-2-yloxime as colorless crystals (melting point: 85.4 to 87.3&#xb0; C.).</p>

A molar ratio of cyclododecanone oxime to thionyl chloride was 2.5. The mixed solution was fed to a glass degassing tank having an internal volume of 48 mL equipped with a jacket through a pipe. A residence time from the mixing unit to the degassing tank was 1.5 min, and a residence time in the degassing tank was 29 min. An internal temperature of the degassing tank was controlled at 35&#xb0; C. by the cooling medium in the jacket, while the reaction mixture was degassed by nitrogen stream (40 mL/min) with stirring by a stirrer, to initiate pre-preparation and an overflow was allowed to flow down into a rearrangement reaction tank.</p>
