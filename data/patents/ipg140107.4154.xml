<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional patent application of Ser. No. 11/731,530, entitled &#x201c;Multi-Directional Self Servo-Writing for a Disk Drive,&#x201d; filed Mar. 30, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various embodiments described herein relate to apparatus, systems, and methods associated with information storage and processing. More specifically, the apparatus, systems and methods relate to multi-directional self servo-writing to a disk or set of disks in a disk drive.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A disk drive is an information storage device. A disk drive includes one or more disks clamped to a rotating spindle, and at least one head for reading information representing data from and/or writing data to the surfaces of each disk. Disk drives also include an actuator utilizing linear or rotary motion for positioning transducing head(s) over selected data tracks on the disk(s). A rotary actuator couples a slider, on which a transducing head is attached or integrally formed, to a pivot point that allows the transducing head to sweep across a surface of a rotating disk. The rotary actuator is driven by a voice coil motor. Storing data includes writing information representing data to portions of tracks on a disk. Data retrieval includes reading the information representing data from the portion of the track on which the information representing data was stored.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disk drive information storage devices employ a control system for controlling the position the transducing head during read operations, write operations and seeks. The control system includes a servo control system or servo loop. The function of the head positioning servo control system within the disk drive information storage device is two-fold: first, to position the read/write transducing head over a data track with sufficient accuracy to enable reading and writing of that track without error; and, second, to position the write element with sufficient accuracy not to encroach upon adjacent tracks to prevent data erosion from those tracks during writing operations to the track being followed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A servo control system includes a written pattern on the surface of a disk called a servo pattern. The servo pattern is read by the transducing head. Reading the servo pattern results in positioning data or a servo signal used to determine the position of the transducing head with respect to a track on the disk. In one servo scheme, positioning data can be included in servo wedges, each including servo patterns.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an exploded view of disk drive <b>100</b> that uses various embodiments of the present invention. The disk drive <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>102</b> including a housing base <b>104</b> and a housing cover <b>106</b>. The housing base <b>104</b> illustrated is a base casting, but in other embodiments a housing base <b>104</b> can comprise separate components assembled prior to, or during assembly of the disk drive <b>100</b>. A disk <b>120</b> is attached to a hub or spindle <b>122</b> that is rotated by a spindle motor. The disk <b>120</b> can be attached to the hub or spindle <b>122</b> by a clamp <b>121</b>. The disk may be rotated at a constant or varying rate ranging from less than 3,600 to more than 15,000 revolutions per minute. Higher rotational speeds are contemplated in the future. The spindle motor is connected with the housing base <b>104</b>. The disk <b>120</b> can be made of a light aluminum alloy, ceramic/glass or other suitable substrate, with magnetizable material deposited on one or both sides of the disk. The magnetic layer includes small domains of magnetization for storing data transferred through a transducing head <b>146</b>. The transducing head <b>146</b> includes a magnetic transducer adapted to read data from and write data to the disk <b>120</b>. In other embodiments, the transducing head <b>146</b> includes a separate read element and write element. For example, the separate read element can be a magneto-resistive head, also known as a MR head. It will be understood that multiple head <b>146</b> configurations can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A rotary actuator <b>130</b> is pivotally mounted to the housing base <b>104</b> by a bearing <b>132</b> and sweeps an arc between an inner diameter (ID) of the disk <b>120</b> and a ramp <b>150</b> positioned near an outer diameter (OD) of the disk <b>120</b>. Attached to the housing <b>104</b> are upper and lower magnet return plates <b>110</b> and at least one magnet that together form the stationary portion of a voice coil motor (VCM) <b>112</b>. A voice coil <b>134</b> is mounted to the rotary actuator <b>130</b> and positioned in an air gap of the VCM <b>112</b>. The rotary actuator <b>130</b> pivots about the bearing <b>132</b> when current is passed through the voice coil <b>134</b> and pivots in an opposite direction when the current is reversed, allowing for control of the position of the actuator <b>130</b> and the attached transducing head <b>146</b> with respect to the disk <b>120</b>. The VCM <b>112</b> is coupled with a servo system (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that uses positioning data read by the transducing head <b>146</b> from the disk <b>120</b> to determine the position of the transducing head <b>146</b> over one of a plurality of tracks on the disk <b>120</b>. The servo system determines an appropriate current to drive through the voice coil <b>134</b>, and drives the current through the voice coil <b>134</b> using a current driver and associated circuitry (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>). It should be noted that in some transducing head includes two separate elements. One element is for reading information representing data and reading positional information or servo information. This element is known as a read element. The other element, in these embodiments, is for writing information representing data and is known as a write element. One example of such a transducing head is a magnetoresistive (MR) transducing head.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each side of a disk <b>120</b> can have an associated head <b>146</b>, and the heads <b>146</b> are collectively coupled to the rotary actuator <b>130</b> such that the heads <b>146</b> pivot in unison. Typically the rotary actuator <b>130</b> and all of the heads <b>146</b> attached thereto are referred to as a head stack <b>500</b> (shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The invention described herein is equally applicable to devices wherein the individual heads separately move some small distance relative to the actuator. This technology is referred to as dual-stage actuation (DSA).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One type of servo system is an embedded, servo system in which tracks on each disk surface used to store information representing data contain small segments of servo information. The servo information, in this embodiment, is written in two sections. Each disk in a disk drive, <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032; includes two surfaces on which information may be stored. One of these surfaces <b>520</b> of the disks <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032; is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The disk surface <b>520</b> includes a inner diameter, an outer diameter, and an overlap area <b>620</b>. The disk surface <b>520</b> is considered to be divided into an inner zone <b>522</b> (from the inner diameter to the overlap area <b>620</b>), and an outer zone <b>526</b> (from the inner diameter to the overlap area <b>620</b>). The servo information, in some embodiments, is stored in radial servo sectors or servo wedges shown as several narrow, somewhat curved spokes. One set of spokes is positioned in the inner zone <b>522</b> and another set of spokes is positioned in the outer zone <b>526</b>. The overlap area <b>620</b> divides the inner zone <b>522</b> and the outer zone <b>524</b>. The spokes of servo wedges may not necessarily be continuous across the surface <b>520</b> of the disk <b>120</b> The spokes on the outer diameter are represented by one spoke <b>128</b> substantially equally spaced around the outer zone of the disk <b>120</b>. The spokes on the inner diameter are represented by one spoke <b>127</b> substantially equally spaced around the inner zone of the disk <b>120</b>. It should be noted that in actuality there may be many more servo wedges than as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The content of the servo wedge <b>128</b> is further detailed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and in the discussions related to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The disk <b>120</b> also includes a plurality of tracks on each disk surface. The plurality of tracks is depicted by three tracks, such as track <b>129</b>, on the surface <b>520</b> of the disk <b>120</b>. The servo wedges <b>128</b> traverse the plurality of tracks, such as track <b>129</b>, on the disk <b>120</b>. The plurality of tracks, in some embodiments, may be arranged as a set of substantially concentric circles. Data is stored in fixed sectors along a track between the embedded servo wedges <b>127</b>, <b>128</b>. The tracks on the disk <b>120</b> each include a plurality of data sectors. More specifically, a data sector is a portion of a track having a fixed block length and a fixed data storage capacity (e.g., 512 bytes of user data per data sector). The tracks toward the inside of the disk <b>120</b> are not as long as the tracks toward the periphery of the disk <b>110</b>. As a result, the tracks toward the inside of the disk <b>120</b> can not hold as many data sectors as the tracks toward the periphery of the disk <b>120</b>. Tracks that are capable of holding the same number of data sectors are grouped into a data zones. Since the density and data rates vary from data zone to data zone, the servo wedges <b>128</b> may interrupt and split up at least some of the data sectors. The servo sectors <b>128</b> are typically recorded with a servo writing apparatus at the factory (called a servo-writer), but may be written (or partially written) with the disk drive's <b>100</b> transducing head <b>146</b> in a self-servowriting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view of a substantially assembled disk drive, according to an example embodiment described herein. The housing cover <b>106</b> is removed for the sake illustration. In some embodiments, the disk drive <b>100</b> is a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus (hard disk drive). The disk drive housing base <b>104</b> serves as a chassis. Mounted to the chassis or housing base <b>104</b> is a magnetic disk <b>120</b>, a transducing head <b>146</b> including a read head and a write head. The transducing head <b>146</b> includes a slider <b>156</b>. The read head and the write head are formed in and at one end of the slider <b>156</b>, respectively. The slider <b>156</b> is attached to the actuator by a head suspension assembly <b>166</b>. The head suspension assembly <b>166</b> includes a suspension <b>165</b> and an actuator arm <b>164</b> that supports the head slider <b>156</b> in transducing relation with the surface of the disk <b>120</b>. Also attached to the housing base <b>104</b> or the chassis is a printed circuit board (PCB) 5200.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The magnetic disk <b>120</b> is a discrete track media. The magnetic disk <b>120</b> is mounted on a spindle <b>122</b> that is rotated by a spindle motor which typically is mounted within the hub or the spindle <b>122</b>. Various digital data are recorded on the magnetic disk <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the data is recorded with magnetic transitions parallel to the major surface of the disk <b>120</b> while in other embodiments, the magnetic transitions are perpendicular to the major surface of the disk <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the magnetic head incorporated in the head slider <b>156</b> is a so-called integrated head including a write head of a single pole structure and a read head using a shielded MR read element (such as a GMR film or a TMR film). The voice coil motor (VCM) <b>112</b> drives the head suspension assembly about a pivot point <b>131</b> to position the magnetic head <b>156</b> at a radial position of the magnetic disk <b>120</b>. The circuit board <b>108</b> comprises a head IC to generate driving signals for the voice coil motor (VCM) <b>112</b> and control signals for controlling read and write operations performed by the magnetic head <b>156</b>.</p>

Each servo wedge <b>128</b> includes information stored as regions of magnetization. The servo wedge <b>128</b> can be longitudinally magnetized (for example, in the magnified portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> a servo pattern <b>200</b> includes cross-hatched blocks magnetized to the left and white spaces magnetized to the right, or vice-versa) or alternatively perpendicularly magnetized (e.g., the cross-hatched blocks are magnetized up and the white spaces are magnetized down, or vice-versa). Servo patterns <b>200</b> contained in each servo wedge <b>128</b> are read by the transducing head <b>146</b> as the surface of the spinning disk <b>120</b> passes under the transducing head <b>146</b>. The servo patterns <b>200</b> can include information identifying a data sector contained in a data field <b>264</b>. For example, the servo pattern <b>200</b> can include digital information such as a preamble <b>202</b>, a servo address mark (SAM) <b>204</b>, a track identification number <b>206</b>. The servo pattern <b>200</b> also includes a set of servo bursts. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the set of servo bursts include an A servo burst, a B servo burst, a C servo burst, and a D servo burst. There is a servo burst edge <b>210</b> between the A burst and the B burst, and a servo burst edge <b>220</b> between the C burst and the D burst. The pattern shown is a quadrature type pattern. In some embodiments, a disk drive will include a single column of each type of servo burst in each servo wedge <b>128</b>. Each column corresponds to a radial of the disk. As shown in this embodiment, there are two columns of A, B, C, and D bursts which may be used in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the servo wedge <b>128</b> will also include other information such as a wedge number. This can be a single bit to designate an index wedge (wedge #0), or the SAM may be replaced by another pattern (referred to as a servo index mark or SIM), or the wedge may contain a few low-order bits of the wedge number or a complete wedge number. There are many different patterns for servo bursts, such as a null pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This pattern shows four servo bursts and it should be understood that this may also be repeated in columns so as to produce several radial lines of AB and CD bursts on the disk in each servo wedge, such as servo wedge <b>128</b>, on the disk. The servo burst pattern results in a servo burst edge <b>210</b> between the A and B servo bursts, and a servo burst edge <b>220</b> between the C and D servo bursts in the null pattern. In some embodiments, the disk <b>120</b> may be other than a magnetic disk. In such cases, the servo wedge <b>128</b> can include other indicia, such as optical indicia.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a block diagram of the disk drive <b>100</b>, according to an example embodiment. As shown, the disk drive includes a main body unit called a head disk assembly (HDA) <b>4100</b> and a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>4200</b>. Some details of the HDA <b>4100</b> have been discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Therefore, the discussion of the HDA <b>4100</b> will refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>. The head disk assembly (HDA) <b>4100</b> includes at least one magnetic disk <b>120</b>, the spindle motor <b>122</b> for rotating the spindle (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) and the magnetic disk <b>120</b>. The HDA <b>4100</b> also includes a head slider <b>156</b>, including the read head and the write head, a suspension <b>165</b> and an actuator arm <b>166</b>, the voice coil motor (VCM) <b>112</b>, and a head amplifier (HIC), which is not shown. The head slider <b>156</b> is provided with the read head such as a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) element and a write head, such as a thin film head formed on an end of the slider <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The head slider <b>156</b> may be attached to the suspension <b>165</b> a gimbal. The suspension <b>165</b> is attached to the actuator arm <b>166</b>, which is rotatably attached to the pivot <b>131</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). This figure shows the head slider <b>156</b> only above the top surface of the magnetic disk <b>120</b>. It should be noted that generally a head slider is provided above the bottom and top surfaces of the magnetic disk <b>120</b>, respectively. The voice coil motor (VCM) <b>112</b> generates a torque around the pivot <b>131</b> for the actuator arm <b>166</b> to rotate the head slider <b>156</b> over the surface of the disk <b>120</b>. The head amplifier (HIC) is fixed to the actuator arm <b>166</b> to amplify input signals to and output signals from the write and read elements, respectively. The head amplifier (HIC) is connected to the printed circuit board (PCB) <b>4200</b> via a flexible print cable (FPC) <b>419</b>. Placing the head amplifier (HIC) on the actuator arm <b>166</b> shortens the distance between the read head and the head amplifier and may effectively reduce noise in the head signals. However, in some embodiments, the head amplifier (HIC) may be fixed to the HDA main body, such as to the chassis or housing base <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The printed circuit board <b>4200</b> is attached to the exterior of the chassis or housing base <b>104</b>. The printed circuit board (PCB) <b>4200</b> includes four major electronic components, so-called system LSIs. The LSIs are mounted on the printed circuit board (PCB) <b>4200</b>. The system LSIs are a head disk controller (HDC) <b>410</b>, a read/write channel IC <b>420</b>, a microprocessor unit (MPU) <b>430</b>, and a motor driver IC <b>440</b>.</p>

The logic processing unit is an arithmetic processing unit that includes a hardware circuit to execute high-speed calculations. Firmware (FW) for the logic processing circuit is saved to the ROM <b>432</b>. Firmware includes a set of instructions executable by the MPU <b>430</b> to control portions of the disk drive.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The disk controller (HDC) <b>410</b> is an interface unit in the hard disk drive which manages the whole drive by exchanging information with interfaces between the disk drive and a host computer <b>400</b> (for example, a personal computer) and with the MPU <b>430</b>, read/write channel IC <b>420</b>, and motor driver IC <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The read/write channel IC <b>420</b> is a head signal processing unit relating to read/write operations. The read/write channel IC <b>420</b> is shown as including a read/write path <b>412</b> and a servo demodulator <b>404</b>. The read/write path <b>412</b>, which can be used to read and write user data and servo data, may include front end circuitry useful for servo demodulation. The read/write path <b>412</b> may also be used for writing servo information in self-servowriting. It should be noted that the disk drive also includes other components, which are not shown because they are not necessary to explain the example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The servo demodulator <b>404</b> is shown as including a servo phase locked loop (PLL) <b>426</b>, a servo automatic gain control (AGC) <b>428</b>, a servo field detector <b>431</b> and register space <b>432</b>. The servo PLL <b>426</b>, in general, is a control loop that is used to provide frequency and phase control for the one or more timing or clock circuits (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), within the servo demodulator <b>404</b>. For example, the servo PLL <b>426</b> can provide timing signals to the read/write path <b>412</b>. The servo AGC <b>428</b>, which includes (or drives) a variable gain amplifier, is used to keep the output of the read/write path <b>412</b> at a substantially constant level when servo wedges <b>128</b> on one of the disks <b>120</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>) are being read. The servo field detector <b>431</b> is used to detect and/or demodulate the various subfields of the servo wedges <b>128</b>, including a servo address mark (SAM), a track number, a first phase servo burst, and a second phase servo burst. The MPU <b>430</b> is used to perform various servo demodulation functions (e.g., decisions, comparisons, characterization and the like), and can be thought of as being part of the servo demodulator <b>404</b>. In the alternative, the servo demodulator <b>404</b> can have its own microprocessor.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One or more registers (e.g., in register space <b>432</b>) can be used to store appropriate servo AGC values (e.g., gain values, filter coefficients, filter accumulation paths, etc.) for when the read/write path <b>412</b> is reading servo data, and one or more registers can be used to store appropriate values (e.g., gain values, filter coefficients, filter accumulation paths, etc.) for when the read/write path <b>412</b> is reading user data. A control signal can be used to select the appropriate registers according to the current mode of the read/write path <b>412</b>. The servo AGC value(s) that are stored can be dynamically updated. For example, the stored servo AGC value(s) for use when the read/write path <b>412</b> is reading servo data can be updated each time an additional servo wedge <b>128</b> is read. In this manner, the servo AGC value(s) determined for a most recently read servo wedge <b>128</b> can be the starting servo AGC value(s) when the next servo wedge <b>128</b> is read.</p>

Head <b>1</b> is in transducing relationship with the surface <b>531</b> of disk <b>510</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, head <b>1</b>, head <b>2</b>, and head <b>3</b> are shown in two positions. It should be noted that a head stack could have any number of actuator arms and transducing heads. A disk drive can also include any number of disks, although two disks with 4 surfaces and 4 heads are shown here.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the self servo write process is used to write servo pattern in a multi head drive a usual technique is to use bank-write. This technique allows to reduce the overall SSW time and make it essentially equal to the time necessary to servo-write one surface. In this case one of the drive heads (reference head), is used to obtain the position information for that head and for the entire head stack and several heads (non-reference heads) are used for writing of the servo pattern simultaneously. In this case the position of the reference head is determined most accurately since it is using the servo data written on the same surface for feedback position control. The actual position and dynamics of non-reference heads are affected by motion of the heads relative to each other-non-reference heads are functioning &#x201c;open loop&#x201d;. The HDA dynamics such as arm motion and disk motion as well as head stack tilt could make the position of the non-reference heads significantly different that the reference head. With current high track density or tracks per inch (TPI) the DC component of this difference could reach several tracks. The written in position frequency components of could also be significantly different.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Head <b>0</b> always maintains the same (correct) position since it is used as a reference head.

The head stack <b>500</b> is shown in the end position of writing the outer zone or second zone <b>524</b> as depicted by line <b>612</b>.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the minimal amount of overlap that must be written at head <b>0</b> to provide overlap on surface <b>530</b>, as well as disk surface <b>531</b> by head <b>1</b>, and on disk surface <b>532</b> by head <b>2</b>, and on disk surface <b>533</b> by head <b>3</b>. The assumption is that the disk stack will tilt when writing in the direction of the inner diameter to an overlap area <b>620</b> to a position as depicted by reference numeral <b>610</b>. Similarly, the head disk stack <b>500</b> will tilt to a different position when writing servo information from the outer diameter to the overlap area <b>620</b>. The overlap must be at least 2 &#x394; plus &#x3b5;, where &#x3b5; is the width of at least one track. The value &#x394; is the worst possible head stack <b>500</b> tilt as calculated or empirically determined. The value 2 &#x394; accommodates if the worst possible head stack tilt scenario, where maximum tilt occurs in both directions. The &#x3b5; value of at least having one track assures that there will be a overlap of at least one track at any one of the overlap areas <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the overlap <b>620</b> is occurring on disk surface <b>530</b> on disk <b>510</b>. There is also an overlap area <b>621</b> which is the distance between head <b>1</b> and the two positions on surface <b>531</b> of disk <b>510</b>. In addition, there is an overlap area <b>622</b> on surface <b>532</b> of disk <b>512</b> and an overlap area <b>623</b> on surface <b>533</b> of disk <b>512</b>. It should be noted that each of the overlap areas <b>620</b> on disk surface <b>530</b>, overlap area <b>621</b> on disk surface <b>531</b>, overlap area <b>622</b> on disk surface <b>532</b>, or an overlap area <b>623</b> on disk <b>533</b> each have a slightly different width. The width is related to the tilt angle, which is denoted fee in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The width of overlap area <b>620</b> will be equal to approximately the value sine &#x3c6; times the difference in height between head <b>0</b> and head <b>2</b>. Similarly, sine &#x3c6; times the difference or the distance between head <b>2</b> and head <b>1</b> will yield the width of the overlap area <b>621</b>. The width of overlap area <b>622</b> will be sine &#x3c6; times the height of head <b>2</b> with respect to the disk surface <b>532</b>. The width of the overlap area <b>623</b> associated with disk surface <b>533</b> on disk <b>512</b> is equal to the distance between heads <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> times the sine &#x3c6;. Thus, it can be seen that the amount of overlap or the width of the overlap area is proportional to the distance between the various heads <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should also be noted that the amount of overlap when there is a head tilt or tilt angle in the head stack <b>500</b> will generally be different at each of the different disk surfaces <b>530</b>, <b>531</b>, <b>532</b>, and <b>533</b>. In other words, provided that there is some tilt angle with respect to the head stack assembly <b>500</b> the width of the overlap area <b>620</b>, the overlap area <b>621</b>, the overlap area <b>622</b> and the overlap <b>623</b> will all be different. Providing an overlap or at each and every disk surface <b>530</b>, <b>531</b>, <b>532</b>, and <b>533</b> is very important. In order to determine the position on the disk surface there must be positional information or servo information provided on the disk. If there is an overlap area <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, and <b>623</b> for each of the disk surfaces <b>530</b>, <b>531</b>, <b>532</b>, and <b>533</b> then one can be assured that no matter where a particular head <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> is flying or passing over a disk surface, there will always be positional data that can be used to determine the location of that particular head.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The overlapping area also serves as a boundary between the first or inner zone <b>522</b> and the second or outer zone <b>524</b>. Since the tracks adjacent the boundary or overlap area <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b> are written at significantly different times, the servo information may have a different placement in both the radial and tangential directions. As a result, tangential or timing offsets could result in an incoherent servo signal on the boundary or on the overlapping area. This could lead to an inability to properly decode servo position information while the head is moving across the boundary area. The different direction of the servo writing for the first or inner zone <b>522</b> and the second or outer zone <b>524</b> could also result in different geometry of written transitions which could lead to different cross track servo automatic gain control (AGC) variations due to the preamble area transition differences, different position error signal demodulation gains, different cross track positioned error signal linearity.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As a result of all these differences between the first or inner zone <b>522</b> and the second and outer zone <b>524</b>, the servo firmware executed by the MPU or a servo controller under direction of the MPU <b>430</b> has to handle the inner or first zone <b>522</b> and the outer or second zone <b>524</b> as separate zones. For example, repeat up all run out cancellation tables, position error signal gain tables, and position error signal linearization tables need to have separate entries for the tracks of the first or inner zone <b>522</b> and the tracks for the second or outer zone <b>524</b>. The servo firm ware or MPU <b>430</b> that executes the software instructions need to detect the location of the boundary or overlap areas <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, and <b>623</b> for each of the respective disk surfaces <b>530</b>, <b>531</b>, <b>532</b>, and <b>533</b>. After the data heads have crossed the boundary or one of the overlap areas <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b> the various calibrated table values have to be reloaded into the various tables as a result of crossing over from one zone to another zone. Large difference in radial placement of the tracks adjacent the boundary or overlap area such as overlap areas <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b> could cause significant track squeeze and track number inconsistencies. Large offsets in tangential (timing) positioning could result in low quality or completely incoherent servo signal. The servo channel could lose lock when the read head crosses a boundary or overlapping area <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b>. The servo needs to function in a special, more error tolerant mode, during a seek, when the head is expected to pass over one of the overlap or boundary areas <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b> when passing between the first and the second zone or visa verse. It should also be noted that the firmware may disable certain functions that normally occur using the firm ware. For other functions, the trigger mechanisms may be relaxed when the transducer is in the vicinity of the boundary or overlap areas <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b>. For example, if there is a large gap in the numbers of tracks at a boundary crossing, many disk drives have programs which detect shock events and shut down a disk drive or move the head <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> to a park position in preparation of the shock event. This would need to be disabled so that when one of the heads or all of the heads are near the overlap or boundary areas <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b>. Furthermore, another function that may be disabled when considering the tangential or timing and positioning of the servo is that of the spindle motor speed controller. In some disk drives when the distance between the servo address marks or servo wedges occurs in a short time, or in a time longer than a normal time, a motor controller may want to speed or slow down the spindle motor. Such functions will have to be disabled near the overlap areas or border areas <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The more error tolerant mode or relaxed mode would have to be triggered by a calibration that could be run during self test during manufacture. It is contemplated that for each head <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> a number of seeks could be done across there respective boundary or overlap area <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b> at each of the servo wedges on the disk. Discontinuities in the track number as well as discontinuities in the tangential (timing) placement of servo wedges between one side of the boundary and the other side of the boundary or overlapping area could then be recorded for each wedge associated with both the inner diameter and for each wedge associated with the outer diameter so that when a seek requires that the particular head flies or passes over the overlap or boundary areas <b>620</b>, <b>621</b>, <b>622</b>, <b>623</b> a table can be referred too to determine that the disk continuity or the timing change is expected.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>700</b> of self servo-writing servo information to a plurality of disk surfaces in a disk drive, according to an example embodiment. The method <b>700</b> of self servo-writing servo information to a plurality of disk surfaces in a disk drive includes writing servo information to a plurality of disk surfaces in a first direction <b>710</b>, writing servo information to a plurality of disk surfaces in a second direction <b>712</b>, and determining an amount of overlap to be written on a reference surface with the reference head that will produce an overlap of servo information on each of the surfaces in the disk drive to which servo information is to be written <b>714</b>. Writing servo information to a plurality of disk surfaces in a first direction <b>710</b> includes one of writing servo information from an outer diameter of the disk to a middle overlap area. Writing servo information to a plurality of disk surfaces in a second direction <b>712</b> includes the other of writing servo information from an outer diameter of the disk to a middle overlap area. The middle overlap area of each of the disk surfaces differs by an amount related to the distance a particular disk surface in the disk drive is positioned with respect to the reference surface in the disk drive. The reference surface of the disk drive is the surface on which a reference head obtains servo positioning information used for feedback position control of the reference head (and indirectly the whole head stack) and writes the servo information.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The outer diameter to the middle diameter defines a first zone and the inner diameter to the middle diameter define a second zone. The method <b>700</b> also may include compensating for a first difference in track numbers when seeking from the first zone to the second zone on a reference surface <b>716</b>, and compensating for a second difference in track numbers when seeking from the first zone to the second zone on a disk surface other than the reference surface <b>718</b>. The method <b>700</b> may also include compensating for a first difference in distance between servo wedges when seeking from one of the first zone to the second zone to the other of the first zone to the second zone on a reference surface <b>720</b>, and compensating for a second difference in distance between servo wedges when seeking from one of the first zone to the second zone to the other of the first zone to the second zone on other than the reference surface <b>722</b>. What's important is not just a difference in placement of wedges relative to each other in each individual zone, but rather the difference in placement of each individual wedge in one zone relative to the matching wedge in the other zone.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the method <b>700</b> includes disabling a disk drive function when seeking between the first zone and the second zone <b>724</b>. The drive functions that are disabled may be any function. One example includes disabling the automatic shutdown of the drive when the read head detects a large change in the number of tracks which may be due to a shock event. Another example includes speeding up the spindle motor or slowing down the spindle motor in response to a change in the spacing of the servo wedges. Writing servo information can include writing servo information to a plurality of disk surfaces in a first direction substantially simultaneously at a first time. Similarly, servo information can be written to a plurality of disk surfaces in a second direction substantially simultaneously at a second time.</p>

The method <b>800</b> of self servo-writing servo information to a plurality of disk surfaces in a disk drive includes writing servo information to a first zone on a disk surface in a first direction <b>810</b>, writing servo information to a second zone of the disk surfaces in a second direction <b>812</b>, and recording a timing difference between the servo information in the first zone and the second zone <b>814</b>. The method <b>800</b> also includes recording a difference in track numbers between the first zone and the second zone <b>816</b>. The method <b>800</b>, in some embodiments, includes seeking from one of the first zone to the second zone <b>818</b>, and switching to a different set of drive calibration parameters associated with the other of the first zone and the second zone <b>820</b>. The recording of the timing difference and the difference in track number is done for selected servo wedges during a self testing mode.</p>
