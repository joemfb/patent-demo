<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">During a combustion cycle of an internal combustion engine (ICE), air/fuel mixtures are provided in cylinders of the ICE. The air/fuel mixtures are compressed and combusted to provide output torque. After combustion, pistons of the ICE force exhaust gases in the cylinders out through exhaust valve openings and into an exhaust system. The exhaust gases may contain nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HCs).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An exhaust gas treatment system of the ICE may include a catalytic converter and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst to reduce exhaust emissions. As an example, a thee-way catalyst converter (TWC) may be used to reduce NO<sub>x</sub>, CO2 and HCs within an exhaust system. The TWC converts NO<sub>x </sub>to nitrogen and oxygen, CO to carbon dioxide and oxidizes unburnt HCs to produce carbon dioxide and water. The SCR catalyst may be located downstream from the TWC and may further reduce NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust system. A SCR catalyst converts NO<sub>x </sub>into nitrogen N<sub>2 </sub>and water H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An internal combustion engine (ICE) may be operated with a lean air/fuel ratio to minimize fuel consumption and improve operating efficiency of the ICE. The leaner the ICE is operated, the less fuel consumed and the more efficient the ICE operates. An exhaust gas treatment system of the ICE may include a catalytic converter and cascaded selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalysts to reduce exhaust emissions. The SCR catalysts may be located downstream from the TWC and reduce NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust system.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Ammonia stored in the SCR catalysts reduces NO<sub>x </sub>in the exhaust system. The ammonia stored in the SCR catalysts may be provided by operating the exhaust system in a passive SCR mode. During the passive SCR mode, an ICE is operated with a rich mixture or an air/fuel ratio that is less than a stoichiometric ratio (e.g., less than 14.7:1). During rich exhaust operating conditions, the catalytic converter may convert NOx to nitrogen and produces ammonia and carbon monoxide (CO). The ammonia is stored by the SCR catalysts and is used by the SCR catalysts during lean exhaust conditions to convert NO<sub>x </sub>to nitrogen and oxygen. The ammonia is provided to the SCR catalysts without the use of a urea dosing circuit. This minimizes system components.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As stored ammonia in a SCR catalyst may be released as the SCR temperatures rise when the first SCR temperatures exceeds 400&#xb0; C., the cascaded SCR catalysts (multiple serially connected SCR catalysts) are used instead of a single SCR catalyst. This can occur in engine exhaust systems with large temperature differential profiles. The use of multiple SCR catalysts prevents ammonia from reaching oxidation catalysts downstream from the SCR catalysts. The closer a SCR catalyst is to the ICE, the greater the temperature of the SCR catalyst. Ammonia released by an upstream SCR catalyst that is at a temperature greater than 400&#xb0; C. may be absorbed by a downstream catalyst that is at a temperature less than 400&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An oxidation catalyst may be incorporated downstream from the cascaded SCR catalysts to oxidize the CO produced during the passive SCR mode. An average light-off temperature (activation temperature) at which an oxidation catalyst typically begins to function is approximately 200-350&#xb0; C. An oxidation catalyst inserted into an exhaust system upstream of a SCR catalyst may convert ammonia into NO<sub>x</sub>. As the oxidation catalyst is located a substantial distance from the ICE, the temperature of the oxidation catalyst can decrease to a temperature that is less than the activation temperature. This can occur during the passive SCR mode and/or during light load operating conditions (e.g., city driving). As a result, the oxidation catalyst may not oxidize the CO produced.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Implementations disclosed below maintain the oxidation catalysts at an active temperature while operating in a passive SCR mode.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The following description is merely illustrative in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure, its application, or uses.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The temperatures of the CC <b>18</b> and the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b> are maintained while permitting the engine <b>14</b> to operate with pre-combustion lean air and fuel (air/fuel) ratios. The temperatures of the oxidation catalysts are maintained while operating in a passive SCR mode. During the passive SCR mode, ammonia in the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b> is replenished. To replenish the ammonia, the engine <b>14</b> may be operated with rich air/fuel ratios (i.e. ratios less than a stoichiometric ratio (e.g., 14.7:1)) for a predetermined period of time, until NOx levels are below predetermined thresholds, and/or periodically. As an alternative and/or in addition to operating the engine <b>14</b> with rich air/fuel ratios, post fuel injection may be performed, and/or fuel may be injected into the exhaust system <b>16</b>. The CC <b>18</b> converts fuel in the exhaust to produce ammonia and CO. The ammonia is absorbed by the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b>. The oxidation catalysts when activated oxidize the excess produced CO.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Temperatures of the engine <b>14</b> and/or portions of the exhaust system <b>16</b> (other than the CC <b>18</b> and the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b>) may decrease to temperatures less than the light-off and/or minimum active operating temperatures when the engine <b>14</b> is operating with lean air/fuel ratios. Lean engine operation and reduced engine operating temperatures reduces heat losses and improves fuel economy. Temperatures of the exhaust system <b>16</b> (other than the oxidation catalysts) may decrease to temperatures less than a light-off or minimum active operating temperature when operating in the passive SCR mode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The engine system <b>10</b> includes the engine <b>14</b> that combusts an air/fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Although the engine system <b>10</b> is shown as a spark ignition direct injection engine, the engine system <b>10</b> is provided as an example. The thermal management system <b>12</b> may be implemented on various other engine systems, such as stratified engine systems, port fuel injection systems, homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine systems, etc. Stratified engine systems may refer to direct injection engine systems where fuel is ignited upon entering cylinders of an engine.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">During operation, air enters the engine <b>14</b> by passing through an air filter <b>23</b> and may be drawn into a turbocharger <b>24</b>. The turbocharger <b>24</b> when included compresses the fresh air. The greater the compression, the greater the output of the engine <b>14</b>. The compressed air passes through an air cooler <b>25</b> when included before entering an intake manifold <b>26</b>. Air within the intake manifold <b>26</b> is distributed into cylinders <b>28</b>. Fuel may be directly injected into the cylinders <b>28</b> by fuel injectors <b>30</b>. Spark plugs <b>32</b> ignite air/fuel mixtures in the cylinders <b>28</b>. Combustion of the air/fuel mixtures creates exhaust. The exhaust exits the cylinders <b>28</b> into the exhaust system <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The thermal management system <b>12</b> includes the exhaust system <b>16</b> and an engine control module (ECM) <b>40</b>. The exhaust system <b>16</b> includes the CC <b>18</b>, the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b>, the oxidation catalysts, the ECM <b>40</b>, and an exhaust manifold <b>42</b>. In the example shown, the exhaust system <b>16</b> includes in the following order: the exhaust manifold <b>42</b>, a first exhaust conduit <b>124</b>, a second exhaust conduit <b>126</b>, the CC <b>18</b>, a third exhaust conduit <b>128</b>, the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b>, the oxidation catalysts (e.g., the oxidation catalysts <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>), and a fourth exhaust conduit <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As an example, the CC <b>18</b> may include a three-way catalyst (TWC). The CC <b>18</b> may reduce nitrogen oxides NOx, oxidizes carbon monoxide (CO) and oxidizes unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) and volatile organic compounds. The CC <b>18</b> oxidizes the exhaust based on a post combustion air/fuel ratio in the exhaust system <b>16</b>. The amount of oxidation increases the temperature of the exhaust. The cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b> are used to further reduce NO<sub>x </sub>via ammonia absorbed into the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b>. The cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b> convert NO<sub>x </sub>into nitrogen N<sub>2 </sub>and water H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Optionally, an EGR valve (not shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the intake manifold <b>26</b>. The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger <b>24</b> to drive a turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received from the air filter <b>23</b>. Exhaust flows from the turbocharger <b>24</b> to the CC <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The thermal management system <b>12</b> may operate in various modes including the passive SCR mode, an oxidation catalyst heating mode, a CC heating mode, a SCR heating mode, a lean operating mode (or temperature maintaining mode), etc. The modes may be initiated and controlled via the ECM <b>40</b>, a thermal control module <b>60</b>, and/or a passive SCR control module <b>62</b>. The thermal control module <b>60</b> and the passive SCR control module <b>62</b> may be incorporated as part of the ECM <b>40</b>. The thermal control module <b>60</b> may include the passive SCR control module <b>62</b>. The control modules <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> are part of the thermal management system <b>12</b> and are further described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">During the passive SCR mode, ammonia is produced to regenerate the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b>. During certain operating conditions, temperatures of the oxidation catalysts (e.g., the oxidation catalysts <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>) may decrease below a predetermined oxidation threshold THR<sub>OXI</sub>. The certain conditions may include operating under light loads, such as in city driving. Thermal energy generated by the engine <b>14</b> is reduced during light load conditions, which can cause the temperatures of the oxidation catalysts to decrease to temperatures below a minimum active operating temperature. The passive SCR control module <b>62</b> activates the oxidation catalyst heating mode to heat at least one of the oxidation catalysts to maintain the oxidation catalysts at least at the minimum active operating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">One or more of the oxidation catalysts (e.g., the EHC <b>21</b>) may be electrically heated via a heating circuit <b>64</b>. The heating circuit <b>64</b> supplements heating of the oxidation catalysts provided by the exhaust system <b>16</b>. As an example, the heating circuit <b>64</b> may be connected to and heat the most upstream one of the oxidation catalysts (e.g., the electrically heated catalyst (EHC) <b>21</b>). The other oxidation catalysts (e.g., the oxidation catalyst OXI <b>22</b>) may be heated due to heated exhaust passing through the most upstream one of the oxidation catalysts and/or radiant heat transfer from the EHC <b>21</b>. The EHC <b>21</b> receives a selected current and/or a selected voltage from the catalyst heating circuit <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The catalyst heating circuit <b>64</b> includes one or more terminals. In the example shown, two terminals are provided; a supply terminal <b>66</b> and a ground or return terminal <b>68</b>. In the example shown, the EHC <b>21</b> may perform as a resistive element between the terminals <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> and receive current from the supply terminal <b>66</b>. Temperature of the EHC <b>21</b> increases while current is supplied to the supply terminal <b>66</b>. This allows the EHC <b>21</b> to increase to a functioning or active temperature (e.g., a catalyst light off temperature). Different voltage levels may be applied to the terminals <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, such as 12V-42V. Voltage levels greater than 42V may be used. Power supplied to the terminals <b>66</b>, <b>68</b> may be from a power source that includes hybrid vehicle batteries, plug-in type batteries, and/or lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The minimum active operating temperature and/or the maintained temperature of the oxidation catalysts may be 200-350&#xb0; C.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">During the CC heating mode, the CC <b>18</b> is heated to at least a CC light-off temperature (e.g., 200-350&#xb0; C.). In one implementation, the CC <b>18</b> is heated to at least 250&#xb0; C. The ECM <b>40</b> and/or the thermal control module <b>60</b> may set the pre-combustion air/fuel ratio of the engine <b>14</b> to a stoichiometric ratio while retarding spark to heat the CC <b>18</b>. This allows heat from the engine <b>14</b> to be transferred into the exhaust system <b>16</b> and heat the CC <b>18</b>. Spark timing may be delayed from, for example, a spark time associated with top-dead-center (TDC) and/or a currently set spark time to retard spark. The currently set spark time may be prior to or subsequent to TDC.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">During the SCR heating mode, the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b> are heated to at least an active temperature (e.g., 200-350&#xb0; C.).

The ECM <b>40</b> and/or the thermal control module <b>60</b> may perform post fuel injection and/or inject fuel into the exhaust system <b>16</b> to heat the cascaded SCR catalysts <b>20</b>. Post fuel injection may include injecting fuel into the cylinders <b>28</b> subsequent to ignition of air/fuel mixtures in the cylinders <b>28</b> and prior to intake strokes of the cylinders <b>28</b>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The stoichiometric signal STOICH may be provided to an air/fuel ratio control module <b>104</b>. The air/fuel ratio control module <b>104</b> includes an air control module <b>176</b> and a fuel control module <b>178</b>. The air control module <b>176</b> generates an air control signal THR (<b>180</b>) based on the stoichiometric signal STOICH. The air control signal THR may be provided to, for example, a throttle actuator module <b>182</b> to control a position of a throttle plate and adjust the amount of air supplied to the cylinders <b>28</b>.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each system that varies an engine parameter may be referred to as an actuator that receives an actuator value. For example, the throttle actuator module <b>182</b> may be referred to as an actuator and the throttle opening area may be referred to as the actuator value. The throttle actuator module <b>182</b> may achieve a throttle opening area by adjusting an angle of a blade of a throttle valve. The throttle actuator module <b>182</b> may monitor the position of the throttle valve using one or more throttle position sensors (not shown). The air control module <b>176</b> may output a desired area signal to the throttle actuator module <b>182</b> based on the stoichiometric signal STOICH.

The passive SCR status module <b>214</b> may start the timer <b>230</b> to monitor time in the passive SCR mode and/or initiate decrementing a timer when the passive SCR mode is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">During the passive SCR mode, the engine <b>14</b> may be iteratively switched between operating with rich air/fuel ratios (rich mode) and operating with either stoichiometric air/fuel ratios (stoich mode) or lean air/fuel ratios (lean mode). A lean air/fuel ratio may refer to an air/fuel ratio that is greater than a stoichiometric air/fuel ratio (e.g., 14.7:1). The iterative activation and deactivation of the rich mode allows oxygen to mix with fuel in the exhaust system to allow the oxidation catalysts (e.g., the EHC <b>21</b> and the OXI <b>22</b>) to oxidize the CO generated during the passive SCR mode.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At <b>312</b>, the oxi-cat comparison module <b>234</b> determines whether the oxi-cat temperature T<sub>OXI </sub>is less than the threshold THR<sub>OXI </sub>and/or a catalyst light-off temperature (or within a predetermined temperature range) and/or whether the active volume OXI<sub>AV </sub>is less than the catalyst threshold AV<sub>THR</sub>. Task <b>314</b> is performed when the OXI temperature T<sub>OXI </sub>is less than the threshold THR<sub>OXI </sub>and/or the catalyst light-off temperature (or within the predetermined temperature range) and/or when the active volume OXI<sub>AV </sub>is less than the catalyst threshold AV<sub>THR</sub>, otherwise task <b>316</b> is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At <b>314</b>, the oxi-cat temperature control module <b>236</b> increases and maintains temperatures of the oxidation catalysts (e.g., the EHC <b>21</b> and the OXI <b>22</b>) above light-off and/or minimum active operating temperatures during at least the passive SCR mode. The oxi-cat temperature control module <b>236</b> may increase the temperature of the oxidation catalysts to temperatures for CO oxidation. The oxi-cat temperature control module <b>236</b> may generate the oxi-cat activation signal OXIACT to activate electrical heating of one or more of the oxidation catalysts, as described above. The temperatures of the oxidation catalysts may be adjusted based on sensor signals from one or more of, for example, the sensors <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and/or from other sensors of the thermal management system <b>12</b>. The oxi-cat temperature control module <b>236</b> may maintain electrical heating of the oxidation catalysts until temperatures of the oxidation catalysts are maintained above the light-off and/or minimum active operating temperatures via heat transfer from the exhaust.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">At <b>316</b>, the oxi-cat temperature control module <b>236</b> may deactivate electrical heating of the oxidation catalyst(s). The thermal control module <b>60</b> may return to task <b>302</b> upon completing task <b>316</b> or may end at <b>320</b>, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">At <b>318</b>, the passive SCR enable module <b>212</b> may compare the time of the timer and/or the time signal TIME to a predetermined period. Task <b>319</b> may be performed when the time exceeds the predetermined period and/or when the time decreases to 0.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At <b>319</b>, the passive SCR enable module <b>212</b> may disable the passive SCR mode. The passive SCR enable module <b>212</b> may change status of the flag set at 308 and/or the passive SCR mode request signal REQ. The air/fuel ratio control module <b>116</b> may deactivate the rich mode and return to operating in one or more of the lean and stoich modes. The timer <b>230</b> may be reset at 319. The thermal control module <b>60</b> may proceed to task <b>316</b> upon completing task <b>319</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The above-described tasks are meant to be illustrative examples; the tasks may be performed sequentially, synchronously, simultaneously, continuously, during overlapping time periods or in a different order depending upon the application. Also, one or more of the tasks may not be performed. For example, task <b>318</b> may not be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The above-described implementations allow for CO emission standards to be satisfied, allow for lean fuel operation to be maximized, and utilize a minimal electrical power to supplement heating of exhaust system catalysts. Lean fuel operation tends to decrease exhaust system temperatures. As the catalysts are maintained at temperatures greater than light-off or minimum active operating temperature, lean fuel operation is maximized.</p>
