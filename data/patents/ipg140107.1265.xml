<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of German Patent Application, Serial No. 10 2010 050 013.5, filed Nov. 2, 2010, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d), the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a bumper for a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following discussion of related art is provided to assist the reader in understanding the advantages of the invention, and is not to be construed as an admission that this related art is prior art to this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional bumpers are commonly installed across the front and rear of motor vehicles to absorb impact energy caused by small collisions, thereby minimizing damage to the actual support structure of the motor vehicle. Bumpers also enhance crash safety in the event of a frontal crash or rear-end crash because of their interaction with a crash box to absorb kinetic energy and their contribution to crash stiffness of the overall motor vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A bumper is typically constructed of a crossbeam which can be attached transversely to the longitudinal rails of the motor vehicle frame by incorporating crash boxes. The crossbeam deflects energy resulting from an impact into the crash boxes, where the impact energy is converted into deformation energy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Bumpers must comply with regulations and meet the demands by consumer protection organizations with respect to protection of pedestrians. Moreover, bumpers have to meet classification tests of insurance companies (RCAR, GDV). Also automakers demand bumper configurations that allow optimum space utilization, easy installation, maximum energy absorption, and are lightweight as well as economically viable. In particular the desired reduction in CO<sub>2 </sub>emission requires lightweight construction when designing vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would therefore be desirable and advantageous to provide an improved bumper for motor vehicles, which obviates prior art shortcomings and is reliable in operation while yet being lightweight and simple in structure with optimal energy absorption.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present invention, a bumper for a motor vehicle includes a crossbeam having a hat profile defined by a bottom wall, legs respectively adjoining the bottom wall, and flanges respectively extending from the legs, with the hat profile having sections of varying cross sectional configuration in a longitudinal direction, and a face plate closing the hat profile of the crossbeam to define a hollow space, with the crossbeam being mountable with the face plate such as to point outwards, wherein an upper one of the legs has a width which is greater than a width of a lower one of the legs in a center section of the crossbeam, wherein the crossbeam has curved ends oriented in a direction of the motor vehicle, wherein the face plate includes a stiffening embossment in the center section, with the stiffening embossment being oriented into the hollow space defined by the hat profile and the face plate.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the crossbeam is installed, the stiffening embossment of the face plate points to the motor vehicle. The stiffening embossment enhances stiffness of the center section of the crossbeam. This affords the possibility in particular to realize various crash specification profiles for overlapping vehicle classes by additional arrangement and dimensioning of the stiffening embossment. Through positioning and depth of the stiffening embossment, the crash energy absorbing capability of the crossbeam can be adaptively suited beforehand individually from utility vehicle to sports car.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The two legs of the hat profile define an upper leg and a lower leg so that in relation to a vehicle coordinate system an upper leg is arranged above a lower leg in Z-direction. The upper leg can have a width which is greater than a width of the lower leg. In other words, the geometric dimensions of the upper leg are sized in relation to the vehicle coordinate system longer in X-direction than the width of the lower leg pointing in X-direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Overall, this arrangement positively affects frontal crash behavior. The greater width of the upper leg increases stiffness of the crossbeam according to the invention. The smaller width of the lower leg deflects obstacles to an area below the motor vehicle in the event of a frontal crash, without adversely affecting the overall stiffness of the crossbeam in combination with the upper leg.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the face plate can have a joining flange and is thereby so configured as to provide at least one area with an S-shaped cross section in the longitudinal direction. This involves in particular the lower region of the face plate, with the lower region of the face plate relating within the scope of the invention to the vehicle coordinate system in Z-direction. The substantial S-shaped configuration may also involve an overlap of an S-shaped configuration and/or Z-shaped configuration. The substantial S-shaped configuration optimizes a joining capability between the face plate and the lower flange of the crossbeam, provides stiffness in X-direction due to the lower leg, and assists in the attachment to a motor vehicle body due to the bottom wall. Advantageously, the S-shaped configuration extends along the entire length direction of the crossbeam. Optionally, the S-shaped configuration may also be provided only in some areas of the crossbeam.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the bottom wall can be formed in the center section with an embossment which is oriented towards the motor vehicle. The embossment can be configured as a longitudinal embossment in Y-direction of the motor vehicle. The valley of the embossment or orientation of the embossment is configured to point towards the motor vehicle, when the crossbeam is installed. The hollow space defined by the hat profile and the face plate can thus be expanded. The presence of the embossment in the center section enhances stiffness in vehicle X-direction. In particular in concert with the legs, the embossment can be considered as an extension of the width of the legs in X-direction, when viewed in a plan view from Z-direction. The entire width of the crossbeam according to the invention is therefore increased by the embossment in the center section.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the crossbeam may have transitions extending from opposite sides of the center section in a direction of the ends. The presence of the transitions renders manufacture of a crossbeam according to the invention cost-efficient option. The embossment formed in the center section may taper off in the transition so as to eliminate the need for a forming tool to carry out complex forming steps during sheet metal forming of a crossbeam according to the invention. Furthermore, the transitions provide additional reinforcement and stiffening of the crossbeam according to the invention. Thus, there is no weak point even though the embossment tapers off so that the crossbeam does not buckle in the event of a crash.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the embossment in the center section can extend into the transitions and is tapered in the transitions. This also renders the manufacture of a bumper according to the invention cost-efficient. The tapered configuration of the embossment still provides an acceptable stiffness behavior in the transition while allowing easy formability of the hat profile in these sections.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the face plate may have joining flanges provided for connection of the face plate with the hat profile. Advantageously, the face plate is connected via the joining flanges with the hat profile by a material joint. Material joint may involve hereby thermal joining which represents a cost-efficient production process and includes for example spot welding or resistance welding. It is, of course, also conceivable to provide a formfit as connection between the face plate and the hat profile. An example of a formfit includes a tongue and groove joint on at least one flange side, with the other flange side, after being inserted, being connected through a material joint in such a way that the tongue and groove joint is non-detachably connected, e.g. by bonding. Another example of a formfit may include a comb-like engagement between face plate and hat profile in the area of a joining flange.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the face plate and the hat profile may also be coupled by forced engagement. Examples of a forced engagement may include riveting or bolting. Also possible is a combination of material joint, forced engagement and/or formfit. An example of such a combination may include bonding and riveting. Also bolting may be employed for a connection.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The hat profile and the face plate may be made of different materials. For example, one of the structural parts may be made of light metal whereas the other structural part may be made of a metal alloy. It is also possible within the scope of the invention to use different material combinations. It is for example conceivable to manufacture a face plate of plastic or fiber composite and to combine it with a crossbeam of a metallic material. Metallic materials may hereby be hardened or quenched and tempered, in particular hot-formed and press-hardened. Various sections may undergo a local heat treatment to tailor the strength values of different section of the crossbeam according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the transitions can be continued by intermediate sections in the direction of the ends. The intermediate sections may have a substantially rectangular configuration or also round configuration. The presence of intermediate sections enables the realization of different widths of the crossbeam according to the invention in Y-direction, without requiring the use of pressing tools for the stiffness-relevant transition and center sections. Furthermore, the presence of intermediate sections enables the provision of targeted crash properties. For example, it is conceivable to provide the intermediate sections of the crossbeam according to the invention for energy absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the intermediate sections can be continued by end sections. The end sections may advantageously be curved towards the motor vehicle. The whole crossbeam is only slightly curved along its longitudinal direction to best suit the geometric and design dimensions of the motor vehicle and to utilize the available installation space. By the added curvature of the ends, obstacles can be deflected in a targeted manner in the event of a frontal crash or rear-end crash. Furthermore, the curved ends cause also a deflection to the outer side of the motor vehicle, which is important for protection of pedestrians. The end sections also can be used to receive the crash boxes. Of course, the crash boxes may also be arranged in a region between the end sections and the intermediate sections. The positioning of the crash boxes is however ultimately dependent on the demands at hand for a motor vehicle to which a bumper according to the invention is intended to be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the center section of the crossbeam may have in X-direction of the motor vehicle a substantially constant width between the face plate and the bottom wall. The face plate and the bottom wall assume a substantially vertical orientation when installed so that the respective base and/or center areas are spaced by these two geometric bodies at a distance which corresponds to the width between the face plate and the bottom wall. The distance extends substantially constant over the entire center section, i.e. the distance remains the same.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the center section of the crossbeam may have in X-direction of the motor vehicle a substantially constant width between the face plate and the embossment of the bottom wall. An important aspect for determining this width is the distance of the valley or peak of the embossment to the base plane formed by the face plate. This does not involve the stiffening embossment formed in the face plate itself.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the width between the face plate and the bottom wall can be sized 0.6 to 0.7 times the width between the embossment of the bottom wall and the face plate. Advantageously, the width between the face plate and the bottom wall is two thirds the width between the face plate and the embossment. As a consequence of this ratio, the stiffness is positively affected in the center section while the own weight of the overall crossbeam is slight.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the intermediate sections can each have in X-direction of the motor vehicle a substantially constant width between the face plate and the bottom wall. In this way, production of the crossbeam according to the invention is simplified for the area of the intermediate section while at the same time being able to select different geometric dimensions in longitudinal direction for the intermediate section.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, the center section of the crossbeam can have in longitudinal direction of the crossbeam a length which is sized 0.05 to 0.15 times the total length of the crossbeam. Advantageously, the length of the center section of the crossbeam is 0.1 times the total length of the crossbeam. This ensures sufficient crash safety and stiffness of the center section while at the same time simplifying production of the entire crossbeam.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to another advantageous feature of the present invention, each transition can have in longitudinal direction of the crossbeam a length which is 0.1 to 0.2 times the total length of the crossbeam.</p>
