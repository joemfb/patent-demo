<heading id="h-0001" level="1">REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of German Patent Application No. 10 2009 014 446.3, filed Mar. 23, 2009, and European Patent Application No. 10001753.2, filed Feb. 22, 2010, the contents of which prior applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an applicator instrument for applying dental compounds. The applicator instrument comprises an instrument head with a support structure and with a plurality of projections formed on the support structure. The projections are elastic and, in relation to a height extent, have less stiffness than the support structure. Between them, the projections enclose a receiving space for the dental compound.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional instruments for applying dental compounds to a surface that is to be treated have the form of a brush. A multiplicity of bristles, which are secured on an instrument head, lie so close together that they are able to hold the dental compound between them. The instrument head is immersed into a container with the dental compound, such that the bristles can take up the dental compound. On the surface that is to be treated, the dental compound is pressed out of the applicator instrument and spread across the surface to be treated, for example a hole in a tooth. In brushes of this kind, the bristles are mounted on the instrument head in a separate production step. They are therefore relatively expensive to produce and cannot be miniaturized to an unlimited extent. Conventional brushes are often too large for the minimally invasive treatment of teeth that is customary today.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the meantime, microbrushes have become widely used in which the front end has substantially radially oriented fibers affixed to it. The fibers are very thin and have low inherent stability. This has the effect that, in relation to the volume of the instrument head, a large amount of dental compound can be taken up and the dental compound can be easily pressed out of the fibers. However, it is not entirely easy to spread the dispensed dental compound across the surface that is to be treated, because each forward and backward stroke with the microbrush leads to further amounts of dental compound emerging from the microbrush and being applied to the surface. For the same reason, it is not easy to apply a precisely dosed amount of dental compound to the surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the invention is to make available a technically improved applicator instrument which, in particular, is more user-friendly. Proceeding from the prior art mentioned at the outset, the object is achieved by the featuresbroadly disclosed herein. Advantageous embodiments are set forth in the disclosure. According to the invention, the projections have a planar configuration and, in relation to a width extent, are arranged substantially parallel to one another. The greatest diameter of the instrument head is preferably between 2 mm and 3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A number of terms will first be explained. The height extent of a projection denotes the direction in which the projections extend away from the support structure. The width extent runs perpendicular thereto. The projections have less stiffness than the support structure when a force can be exerted on the projections via the support structure, such that the projections deform in relation to their height extent. Details concerning the diameter of the instrument head relate to a diameter oriented transverse to the lengthwise direction of the instrument head.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A receiving space within the meaning of the invention is delimited on two sides by surfaces of the projections. In this context, a plurality of projections is also referred to when the surfaces of the two projections are connected by an intermediate piece, for example a spiral-shaped intermediate piece. Between the projections, there are outlet areas in which the receiving space opens without further restriction into the surrounding environment. Upon suitable deformation of the planar projections, the volume of the receiving space decreases, and dental compound contained in the receiving space emerges from the receiving space via the outlet areas.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the applicator instrument according to the invention is immersed into a dental compound, the receiving space fills with the dental compound. The receiving space is so dimensioned, and adapted to the dental compound, that the dental compound remains in the receiving space when the applicator instrument re-emerges from the dental compound. On the surface that is to be treated, pressure is exerted on the planar projections by way of the support structure, such that the planar projections deform and the volume of the receiving space decreases. The dental compound emerges from the receiving space and adheres on the relevant part of the surface that is to be treated. Since the geometric shape of the receiving space is known and a precisely defined deformation takes place, the dental compound to be dispensed can be precisely dosed. After the projections have been relieved of pressure again and have assumed their original shape, the projections are used to spread the dental compound across the surface. The projections have sufficient stiffness to allow the dental compound to be spread across the surface without further dental compound emerging from the receiving space. The applicator instrument thus offers a high degree of user friendliness.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In its simplest embodiment, the applicator instrument according to the invention has only two projections and one receiving space arranged between the projections. A more uniform spread of the dental compound is possible by having several receiving spaces arranged next to one another. For this purpose, more than two planar projections are arranged substantially parallel to one another, such that a central planar projection separates two adjacent receiving spaces from each other. The distance between two planar projections is preferably smaller than the greatest height extent of the projections. The projections can then be deformed such that they lie directly on each other. The volume of the receiving space decreases to almost zero, and the dental compound can be dispensed almost completely from the receiving space and applied to the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The applicator instrument according to the invention preferably comprises a shaft, the proximal end of which is designed as a grip part. The distal end of the shaft is connected fixedly or releasably to the instrument head. The shaft and the connection to the instrument head are so stable that a force sufficient to deform the planar projections can be transferred to the instrument head.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the height extent of the planar projections runs substantially in the continuation of the shaft. The dental compound can then be pressed out of the receiving space by pressure being exerted in the longitudinal direction of the shaft, and it can be spread across the surface by means of movements in the transverse direction thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other embodiments, the height extent of the planar projections runs substantially radially in relation to the direction of the shaft. The width extent of the projections can in this case be oriented substantially transverse or substantially parallel to the direction of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The applicator instrument according to the invention is intended in particular to be used for applying dental compounds in holes that are to be filled in teeth. For this purpose, the greatest diameter of the instrument head is preferably less than 5 mm, more preferably less than 3 mm. It is also helpful if the instrument head is adapted in terms of its contour to the shape of the hole. In particular, the instrument head can have a spherical contour, or a cylindrical contour in which the axis is oriented substantially parallel to the direction of the shaft. This can be achieved if the applicator instrument has the following features either singly or in combination. The support structure can have a planar configuration and thus provide a surface along which the projections can, in relation to their width extent, be oriented transverse to the direction of the shaft. It is possible to provide a first set and a second set of projections, which are arranged on opposite sides of the planar support structure. The projections can, in relation to their height extent, run substantially perpendicular to the surface of the support structure. The planar form of the support structure can be approximated to a circle shape. At the center of the support structure, projections can be formed which have a greater height extent than do projections at the edge of the support structure. The contour of the projections can be approximated to the shape of a segment of a circle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is desirable that, in relation to the size of the instrument head, as much dental compound as possible can be taken up and dispensed within the tooth. In relation to the volume encompassed by the instrument head, the receiving spaces preferably take up at least 40%, more preferably at least 60%. The volume of the projections is preferably small compared to the volume of the receiving spaces. The distance between two projections that between them enclose a receiving space is preferably greater than the material thickness of the projections.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Receiving spaces of large volume can be achieved in particular if the projections that between them enclose the receiving space are at a great distance from each other. However, if the distance of the projections from each other is too great, there is a danger of the dental compound no longer being held safely in the receiving space. In order to give the dental compound more hold, a first receiving space and a second receiving space can be offset relative to each other in such a way that a projection of the first receiving space is arranged in the lateral continuation of the second receiving space and thus contributes to safely holding the dental compound in the second receiving space.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Looking at a projected view of the projections of the first receiving space and second receiving space, the projections of the first receiving space can be at a lateral distance from the projections of the second receiving space. However, in order to ensure that the dental compound can be dispensed completely from the instrument head, it is preferable if, in a projected view, the projections of the first receiving space terminate with the projections of the second receiving space.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to further improve the hold of the dental compound, an intermediate projection can be arranged inside a receiving space, the surface area of which intermediate projection is small compared to the surface area of adjacent projections. If the intermediate projection projects further in the radial direction than do adjacent projections, it can be used to ensure that dental compound already dispensed from the receiving spaces is spread across the surface. If the receiving spaces in total extend all the way around a central support structure, it is possible, by turning the applicator instrument, to influence whether further dental compound is to be dispensed or the already dispensed dental compound is to be spread.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The dental compound should also be held safely in the applicator instrument when said applicator instrument is moved quickly. In the event of rapid movements of the applicator instrument, it may happen in particular that centrifugal forces oriented in the direction of the distal end of the applicator instrument act on the dental compound. Under the effect of such a centrifugal force, the dental compound is better held in the applicator instrument if the projections, in relation to their width extent, have a convexity directed toward the distal end.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Generally speaking, convexities in the height extent or width extent can contribute to providing the planar projections with greater stability. This may be helpful if the completely flat projections are able to deform too easily and greater stiffness is desired in order to be able to dispense the dental compound from the receiving space in dosed amounts.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The shaft can have one or more kinks. It is often easier to remove dental compound from a container when the shaft is straight, whereas it is easier to treat a hole in the tooth when the shaft is kinked. The shape of the shaft can preferably be plastically modified via the kinks.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The applicator instrument according to the invention can be produced in one piece, for example as an injection-molded part, from a single material. The property whereby the stiffness of the projections is less than the stiffness of the support structure is then achieved by virtue of the fact that the material thickness chosen for the support structure is greater than the material thickness of the projections. Alternatively, the applicator instrument can also be made from more than one material. For example, the support structure can be made from a material with greater stiffness and the projections can be made from a material with lesser stiffness. It is advantageous for the materials to be cohesively interconnected, as can be achieved, for example, in production by multi-component injection molding. A cohesive connection of this kind is more resistant than an adhesive connection obtained, for example, with glue.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A material connection that is resistant is particularly important if the instrument head is intended to be immersed for a considerable length of time in the dental compound. This is because the dental compounds often contain aggressive components that are able to undo adhesive connections. The applicator instrument according to the invention can be present as an applicator unit together with a container in which the dental compound is contained. The applicator instrument is then connected to the container such that the instrument head is arranged in the container and is immersed in the dental compound. After the container is opened, the applicator instrument is free and can be withdrawn. With conventional brushes or microbrushes in which the projections are connected adhesively to the support structure, this is not possible, because the adhesive connection may come undone under the effect of the aggressive dental compound.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An applicator instrument shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> comprises a shaft <b>10</b> and an instrument head <b>11</b>, which is connected to the distal end of the shaft <b>10</b>. The instrument head <b>11</b> comprises a planar support structure <b>12</b>, which has a circular contour. Five planar projections <b>14</b> are formed on each of the two sides of the support structure <b>12</b>. The projections <b>14</b> have a height extent and a width extent. In height, the projections <b>14</b> run perpendicularly across the support structure <b>12</b>. The width extent of the projections <b>14</b> is oriented transverse to the direction of the shaft <b>10</b>. The projections <b>14</b> arranged at the center of the support structure <b>12</b> have a greater height, and the height of the projections <b>14</b> decreases in the direction toward the edge of the support structure <b>12</b>. Each of the projections <b>14</b> has, in contour, the shape of a semicircle, with two opposite projections <b>14</b> complementing each other in terms of contour to form a complete circle. Overall, the support structure <b>12</b> and the projections <b>14</b> form a spherical shape in terms of their contour. The projections <b>14</b> have a convexity which is oriented toward the distal end of the applicator instrument and which runs across the width of the projections <b>14</b>. The greatest diameter of the instrument head <b>11</b> is between 2 mm and 3 mm. The applicator instrument is therefore suitable for treating small holes in teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The planar projections <b>14</b> are arranged substantially parallel to one another. Two adjacent projections <b>14</b> in each case enclose between them a receiving space <b>15</b>. The receiving spaces <b>15</b> are limited on two opposite sides by the projections <b>14</b> and in addition by the support structure <b>12</b>. In the other directions, the receiving spaces <b>15</b> open without restriction into the surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The applicator instrument is produced as a multi-component injection-molded part. The shaft <b>10</b> and the support structure <b>12</b> are made from a first material of greater stiffness, while the projections <b>14</b> are made from a second material, which is cohesively connected to the support structure <b>12</b> and which has less stiffness, i.e. greater flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The applicator instrument is intended to take up dental compounds from a storage container and to apply said dental compounds in a hole in a tooth. Here, the expression dental compound includes in particular dental adhesives, sealants, primers, and etching agents. The instrument head <b>11</b> of the applicator instrument is immersed into the dental compound in the storage container, such that the receiving spaces <b>15</b> fill with the dental compound. The size of the projections <b>14</b> and the distance of the projections <b>14</b> from one another are adapted to the properties of the dental compound. In the case of a dental compound of low viscosity, the projections <b>14</b> are at a smaller distance from one another, so as to ensure that they can hold the dental compound in the receiving spaces <b>15</b>, and, in the case of viscous dental compounds, the distance between the projections <b>14</b> is greater.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the receiving spaces <b>15</b> are filled with the dental compound, the instrument head <b>11</b> is lifted out of the storage container and guided to the tooth with the hole. By virtue of the convexity of the projections <b>14</b>, the dental compound is held in the receiving spaces <b>15</b> even when the instrument head <b>12</b> is guided in a rapid movement. In the tooth, the dental compound should in the first instance be applied to the wall of the hole. For this purpose, the applicator instrument is initially placed with the projections <b>14</b> onto the wall of the hole. Pressure is then exerted via the support structure <b>12</b>, such that the projections <b>14</b> deform as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. By means of the deformation of the projections <b>14</b>, the volume of the receiving spaces <b>15</b> decreases and the dental compound emerges from the receiving spaces <b>15</b>. With forward and backward strokes, the dental compound, initially applied only locally, can be spread across the surface. The projections have sufficient stiffness for the dental compound to be able to be spread across the surface, without this leading automatically to additional amounts of dental compound being applied.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The embodiment of an applicator instrument according to the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> comprises three projections <b>14</b> and, lying between these, receiving spaces <b>15</b>. The shaft <b>10</b> is designed as a grip part with notches <b>16</b>. The height extent of the projections <b>14</b> extends in a continuation of the shaft <b>10</b>, while the width extent runs transverse to the direction of the shaft <b>10</b>. The projections <b>14</b>, in relation to their width extent, are parallel to one another and, in relation to their height extent, enclose a slight angle. The receiving spaces <b>15</b> thus have a slight V-shape in cross section. The applicator instrument is thus suitable for applying dental compounds to the end face of a hole. The dental compound can be dispensed from the receiving spaces <b>15</b> by pressure exerted in the direction of the shaft <b>10</b>, and it can be spread by means of movements in the transverse direction thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the applicator instrument in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the support structure <b>12</b> is cylindrical, and the height extent of the projections <b>14</b> runs in a radial direction from the support structure <b>12</b>. The width extent of the projections <b>14</b> is oriented parallel to the shaft <b>10</b>. By turning the applicator instrument about the axis of the shaft <b>10</b>, the dental compound can be applied to the wall of a hole.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, only two projections <b>14</b> are provided, with a receiving space <b>15</b> lying between them. The support structure <b>12</b> has a planar configuration in the shape of a rectangle. The height extent and the width extent of the projections <b>14</b> run transverse to the direction of the shaft <b>10</b>. The distance between the projections <b>14</b> is almost as great as the height extent of the projections <b>14</b>. The receiving space <b>15</b> thus formed is suitable for receiving rather viscous dental compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the support structure <b>12</b> is cylindrical. The height extent of the projections <b>14</b> is oriented radially, while the width extent is parallel to the direction of the shaft <b>10</b>. The applicator instrument is produced as an injection-molded part from a single material. The reduced stiffness of the projections <b>14</b>, compared to the support structure <b>12</b>, is achieved by the fact that the projections <b>14</b> have a very small material thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the projections <b>14</b> extend in a circle around the cylindrical support structure <b>12</b>. The projections <b>14</b> are arranged parallel to one another and, in their height extent, run radially from the support structure <b>12</b>. In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the projections are designed not in the form of closed circles, but in the form of interrupted circles. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, two projections delimiting a receiving space <b>15</b> are connected to each other in a spiral shape.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an applicator unit comprising an applicator instrument according to the invention and a container <b>17</b> filled with dental compound. The applicator instrument is shown in a schematic representation, in which a spherical contour of the instrument head <b>11</b> is indicated. The shaft <b>10</b> of the applicator instrument extends through a lid <b>18</b> of the container <b>17</b>. After the container <b>17</b> is opened, the applicator instrument can be removed, with the receiving compartments being filled with dental compound. Since the applicator instrument is either made from one uniform material or from several cohesively interconnected materials, it is not attacked by aggressive components of the dental compound.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 to 15</figref> show various views of an embodiment of the invention in which the receiving spaces are offset relative to one another. Thus, on one side of the applicator instrument, there are two projections <b>19</b>, <b>20</b>, which between them enclose a receiving space <b>21</b>. On the other side of the applicator instrument, two projections <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> are formed, which between them enclose a receiving space <b>24</b>. The receiving spaces <b>21</b>, <b>24</b> are offset relative to each other such that the projection <b>19</b> is arranged in the lateral continuation of the receiving space <b>24</b>. Conversely, the projection <b>22</b> is arranged in the lateral continuation of the receiving space <b>21</b>. This combination of receiving spaces offset relative to one another is repeated several times along the length of the instrument head <b>11</b>. Altogether, the receiving spaces <b>21</b>, <b>24</b> extend all the way around the central support structure. Seen in a projected view, the projections <b>19</b>, <b>20</b> of the first receiving space <b>21</b> terminate with the projections <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> of the second receiving space <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Arranged in the receiving space <b>24</b>, there is an intermediate projection <b>25</b> whose surface area is smaller than the surface area of the projections <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>. However, the intermediate projection <b>25</b> projects further in the radial direction than do the projections <b>22</b>, <b>23</b>. In this embodiment, taking the receiving space <b>24</b> as an example, it is not only the adjacent projections <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> by which the dental compound is held in the receiving space <b>24</b>. Instead, the projection <b>19</b> lying in the lateral continuation of the receiving space <b>24</b> also contributes to holding the dental compound. The hold of the dental compound is further supported by the intermediate projection <b>25</b> arranged in the center of the receiving space <b>24</b>. In relation to the volume encompassed by the projections, the instrument head <b>11</b> has a high absorption capacity for dental compound.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 to 18</figref>, projections <b>14</b> that extend all the way around the central support structure are formed in the rear area. Between them, the projections <b>14</b> enclose receiving spaces <b>15</b>. In the front area, receiving spaces <b>21</b>, <b>24</b> are formed which are offset relative to each other. The offset receiving spaces <b>21</b>, <b>24</b> have the effect that, in relation to the volume encompassed by the instrument head, there is a high absorption capacity for the dental compound.</p>
