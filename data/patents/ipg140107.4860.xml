<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An optical fiber ribbon holding member capable of readjusting a position of an optical fiber ribbon without requiring a heating operation is provided. A holding member main body that has a U-shaped cross section and a space to which a plurality of optical fiber ribbons can be accommodate in a laminated state, and a lid body an opening surface of which has a reverse U-shaped cross section are employed. A latch structure is formed on wall portions of a lid body and a holding member main body, and engages to each other when the lid body covers the holding member main body. Heating operation is not required, and the optical fiber ribbons are held by only a simple operation of covering the lid body, so that the operation of holding the optical fiber ribbons is easily performed and readjustment of the position of the optical fiber ribbons can be performed.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a non-provisional application claiming priority to and the benefit of U.S. provisional application 61/306,683, filed Feb. 22, 2010. The entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an optical fiber ribbon holding member that holds an optical fiber ribbon in which an optical connector mounted on a substrate is attached to a tip thereof, and also relates to an optical fiber ribbon holding method, an optical fiber ribbon bundle, and a holding member fixture.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, in the case where a plurality of optical fiber ribbons are held in a laminated state, conventionally, a heat shrinkable tube is used as the optical fiber ribbon holding member that holds the optical fiber ribbons (hereinafter referred to as the ribbons according to the case), in which an optic path change type optical connector, which is mounted on an photoelectric composite substrate, is attached to a tip of the optical fiber ribbon.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a case where the optical fiber ribbons are laminated and held by the heat shrinkable tube, when the heat shrinkable tube covers the laminated optical fiber ribbons and heated at a high temperature of 100 degree or more, the heat shrinkable tube is shrunk to tighten and hold the laminated optical fiber ribbons.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As described above, the optical fiber ribbons held by the heat shrinkable tube are fixed at a device bedplate side by fixing a part of the heat shrinkable tube with, for example, a holding member fixture for fixing the holding member that is fixed at the periphery portion of the photoelectric composite substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each of the optical connectors attached to the tip of each of the optical fiber ribbons must be positioned and arranged on the photoelectric composite substrate accurately. However, when the position of the optical fiber ribbons that are laminated and held by the heat shrinkable tube is misaligned in a longitudinal direction, the optical connector at the tip of the misaligned optical fiber ribbon is misaligned with the position to be mounted on the substrate. As a result, the accurate positioning and arrangement cannot be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Once the heat shrinkable tube has been shrunk, the heat shrinkable tube cannot be returned to the original state. Therefore, when the optical fiber ribbons are shipped as being held by the heat shrinkable tube at the time of shipping, there is a problem that a user cannot move and readjust the position of each of the optical fiber ribbons to the proper position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Meanwhile, as described above, it is required to heat the heat shrinkable tube to a high temperature in order to hold the optical fiber ribbons by the heat shrinkable tube, so there is also a problem that the user who receives the product cannot easily perform the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, an optical fiber ribbon holding member is desired in which the heating operation by the user is not required and readjustment of the position of the optical fiber ribbons can be performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As shown in the drawings, the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>A includes a holding member main body <b>12</b> to which a plurality of optical fiber ribbons can be laminated and accommodated, and a lid body <b>15</b> which covers the holding member main body <b>12</b>. The holding member main body <b>12</b> has a U-shaped cross section with a bottom portion <b>10</b> and both side of wall portions <b>11</b>. The lid body <b>15</b> has a reverse U-shaped cross section with a bottom portion <b>13</b> and both side of wall portions <b>14</b>. The opening surface of the lid body <b>15</b> facing to an opening surface of the U-shaped cross section of the holding member main body <b>12</b>, and the lid body <b>15</b> covers the opening surface of the holding member main body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The holding member main body <b>12</b> may be made of resin, or may be made of metal. The lid body <b>15</b> may also be made of resin or metal.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A latch structure <b>16</b> is arranged at the wall portion <b>14</b> of the lid body <b>15</b> and the wall portion <b>11</b> of the holding member main body <b>12</b>. An engaging click and an engaging recess of the latch structure <b>16</b> engage to each other when the lid body <b>15</b> covers the holding member main body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the latch structure <b>16</b> includes an engaging click <b>14</b><i>a </i>that is protruded to the inside side at a lower end portion of both side wall portions <b>14</b> of the lid body <b>15</b>, and a rectangular shape engaging recess <b>11</b><i>a </i>that is formed at the outside surface of both side wall portions <b>11</b> of the holding member main body <b>12</b> and to which the engaging click <b>14</b><i>a </i>is engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">A longitudinal length of the rectangular shape engaging recess <b>11</b><i>a </i>has a length in which the engaging click <b>14</b><i>a </i>is movable vertically in a constant distance (a distance in which the lid body <b>15</b> is movable from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> at least to the height shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) within, the engaging recess <b>11</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross section view illustrating a state in which a plurality of (four in the illustrated embodiment) laminated optical fiber ribbons (optical fiber ribbon bundle) <b>2</b> are held in the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the embodiment, spacers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are fixed in the bottom surface of the holding member main body <b>12</b> and the inside surface of the lid body <b>15</b> respectively as height adjusting bed of a laminated ribbon accommodating space so that a proper pressing force is applied to the laminated optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">A way to hold four optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> in the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>A is described. Four optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are laminated on the spacer <b>17</b> at the bottom of the holding member main body <b>12</b>. Next, the lid body <b>15</b> covers and pushes down until the engaging click <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the lid body <b>15</b> is entered into the engaging recess <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the holding member main body <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the engaging click <b>14</b><i>a </i>is in an engaged state in which the engaging click <b>14</b><i>a </i>is in contact with the upper end surface of the engaging recess <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and the lid body <b>15</b> lightly presses the laminated optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> to such a degree that the position of the laminated optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are not widely misaligned.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Accordingly, in a state in which the lid body <b>15</b> is engaged to the holding member main body <b>12</b> with the latch structure <b>16</b>, the position of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, rubber tubes <b>19</b> are shown as tightly contacted to the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> without a gap and the rubber tubes <b>19</b> that are vertically adjacent to each other are shown as tightly contacted to each other without a gap. However, the rubber tubes <b>19</b> are in a slightly expanded state, so that a gap is present between the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> and the rubber tube <b>19</b> in practice. Even if the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are laminated in a state in which the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are simply positioned (not pressed), the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> is light so that the vertically positioned optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are not in a state of being laminated in tight contact with each other throughout the entire longitudinal direction, but are in a loosely laminated state, and the lamination has a slight partial gap even between the rubber tubes <b>19</b> that vertically cover the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b>. Accordingly, in a holding state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in which the lid body <b>15</b> is engaged to the holding member main body <b>12</b> with the latch structure <b>16</b>, the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are loosely held to such a degree that the position of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> is not widely misaligned and the position can be adjusted as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Also, if an inner depth of the holding member main body <b>12</b> is lower than the depth thereof shown in the FIGS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>), one or both of the spacers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">When the depth is lower than the depth shown in the FIGS and one or both of the spacers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are arranged, the rubber tube <b>19</b> can be removed from some (one of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> that are vertically adjacent) of the four optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">When the depth is the same as the depth shown in the FIGS and one or both of the spacers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are removed, more than four optical fiber ribbons can be laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the rubber tube <b>19</b> is covered over each of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b>. The rubber tube <b>19</b> has an anti-slip function among the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b>, and has also an anti-slip function between the lowermost optical fiber ribbon (the optical fiber ribbon that is accommodated nearest to the bottom portion <b>10</b> of the holding member main body <b>12</b>) <b>2</b> or the uppermost optical fiber ribbon (the optical fiber ribbon that is accommodated nearest to the bottom portion <b>13</b> of the lid body <b>15</b>) <b>2</b> and the bottom portion <b>10</b> of the holding member main body <b>12</b> or the bottom portion <b>13</b> of the lid body <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In the illustrated embodiment, the rubber tubes <b>19</b> cover all of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> respectively. However, if one of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> that are vertically adjacent is covered by the rubber tube <b>19</b> with respect to the middle optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> except the uppermost and the lowermost optical fiber ribbons, the anti-slip function is effected, so that the rubber tubes <b>19</b> can be omitted every other. In the embodiment, if the spacers <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are made from rubber, the rubber has the anti-slip function so that the rubber tubes <b>19</b> can be omitted at the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> of the uppermost layer and the lowermost layer.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Also, it is not limited to be the rubber tube.

<p id="p-0170" num="0169">A first latch structure <b>26</b> of the two step latch structures <b>26</b> and <b>27</b> includes engaging clicks <b>21</b><i>a </i>and engaging recesses <b>24</b><i>a </i>in which the engaging clicks <b>21</b><i>a </i>are provided in the center portion of the both side wall portions <b>21</b> of the holding member main body <b>22</b>, and the engaging recesses <b>24</b><i>a </i>are provided in the center portion of the both side wall portions <b>24</b> of the lid body <b>25</b> and is engaged with the engaging clicks <b>21</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The first latch structure <b>26</b> is a first step latch structure which functions in an engaged state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>. In this state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the optical fiber ribbon pressing portion <b>28</b> that is also the bottom portion <b>23</b> of the lid body <b>25</b> is slightly elastically deformed so that lightly presses the laminated optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A</figref>, <b>16</b>B, <b>17</b>A, <b>17</b>B, <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B, in this embodiment, the rubber tube <b>19</b> covers each of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> and the optical fiber ribbon pressing portion <b>28</b> of the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>B does not press the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> directly but presses the portion of the rubber tube <b>19</b> that covers the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b>. The rubber tube <b>19</b> has an anti-slip function between the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> and between the lowermost optical fiber ribbon (the optical fiber ribbon that is accommodated nearest to the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the holding member main body <b>22</b>) <b>2</b> or the uppermost optical fiber ribbon (the optical fiber ribbon that is accommodated nearest to the bottom portion <b>23</b> of the lid body <b>25</b>) <b>2</b> and the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the holding member main body <b>22</b> or the optical fiber ribbon pressing portion <b>28</b> of the lid body <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In the illustrated embodiment, the rubber tubes <b>19</b> cover all of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> respectively. However, when one of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> that are vertically adjacent is covered by the rubber tube <b>19</b> with respect to the middle optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> except the uppermost and the lowermost optical fiber ribbons, the anti-slip function is effectively operated so that the rubber tube <b>19</b> can be omitted alternately.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Also, the invention is not limited to the rubber tube, rubber material such as a simple rubber sheet may be inserted between the optical fiber ribbons, between the lowermost layer of the optical fiber ribbon and the bottom portion <b>20</b> of the holding member main body <b>22</b>, and between the uppermost layer of the optical fiber ribbon and the bottom portion <b>23</b> of the lid body <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">When the rubber tube <b>19</b> covers the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b>, the rubber tube <b>19</b> does not cover the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> in a state in which the rubber tube <b>19</b> tightly contacts the outer peripheral surface of the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> but covers the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> in an expanded state in which a gap is present with the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, so that the height (the thickness) becomes large. For example, even though four optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are simply laminated and positioned, since the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are light, the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are in the laminated state in which the vertically adjacent optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are not perfectly tightly contacted to each other overall in the longitudinal direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, when the state of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> is illustrated by dashed lines in a deformed manner, some portion of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are contacted to each other in a longitudinal direction and the height of the lamination becomes large.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">As described above, since the rubber tube <b>19</b> is in an expanded state and the lamination height becomes large while a plurality of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are simply laminated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, in a step in which portions of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> that covered with the rubber tube <b>19</b> are simply laminated in the holding member main body <b>22</b>, the expanded rubber tubes <b>19</b> are laminated with the vertical gap, and then the height becomes large.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Thus, when the height of the wall portion <b>21</b> of the holding member main body <b>22</b> is low, a lateral misalignment (lateral slip) cannot be prevented when the uppermost optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> is slightly deviated laterally along with the rubber tube <b>19</b>. Accordingly, when the lid body <b>25</b> covers and pushes down the holding member main body <b>22</b>, the uppermost optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> is misaligned laterally so that the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> may be easily loaded on the wall portion <b>21</b> of the holding member main body <b>22</b> or fall to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">However, in the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>B, the projecting portions <b>21</b><i>d </i>that are projected to the upper direction at the both ends of the both side wall portions <b>21</b> of the holding member main body <b>22</b> in a longitudinal direction are present. So that the projecting portions <b>21</b><i>d </i>can prevent the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> from being misaligned laterally and the uppermost optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b> can also be reliably accommodated within the holding member main body <b>22</b> when the lid body <b>25</b> covers and pushes down the holding member main body <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In this embodiment, the projecting portions <b>21</b><i>d </i>of the wall portions <b>21</b> of the holding member main body <b>22</b> are provided at both end portions in the longitudinal direction. However, the projecting portions <b>21</b><i>d </i>need not be at both ends, and for example, may be provided at a position near to the center from the both ends, or may be provide only one projecting portion in the center.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In the engaged state by the first latch structure <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the rubber tubes <b>19</b> are compressed at some level and the rubber tubes <b>19</b> are laminated in a state in which the gap between the rubber tubes <b>19</b> is absent or slightly present. However, the rubber tubes <b>19</b> are not completely tightly contacted and restrained on the outer periphery of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> and the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> can be slid by a light force with respect to the rubber tubes <b>19</b>. In other words, the optical fiber ribbon pressing portion <b>28</b> lightly presses the laminated optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> to such a degree that the laminated optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are not widely misaligned. Accordingly, in a state in which the lid body <b>25</b> is engaged with the holding member main body <b>22</b> by the latch structure <b>26</b>, the position of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The second latch structures <b>27</b> are provided at both sides of the first latch structure <b>26</b>, and include engaging clicks <b>21</b><i>b </i>and engaging recesses <b>24</b><i>b </i>wherein the engaging clicks <b>21</b><i>b </i>are provided at both sides of the both side wall portions <b>21</b> of the holding member main body <b>22</b> respectively in the longitudinal direction, and the engaging recesses <b>24</b><i>b </i>are provided at both sides of the both side wall portions <b>24</b> of the lid body <b>25</b> in the longitudinal direction and engaged with the engaging clicks <b>21</b><i>b. </i></p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18B</figref>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>, the state is when the lid portion <b>64</b> of the holding member fixture <b>62</b> is tightened by screws to both sides of a lid fixture portion <b>63</b><i>c </i>of the base portion <b>63</b> of the holding member fixture <b>62</b>, and the lid body <b>25</b> of the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>B is further pushed down by the lid portion <b>64</b>, and the optical fiber ribbon posing portion <b>28</b> presses down the laminated optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> with a stronger elastic force and fixes the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> tightly. At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, the rubber tubes <b>19</b> are further compressed so that the rubber tubes <b>19</b> substantially tightly contact the outer periphery of the optical fiber ribbon <b>2</b>, and become a state in which then movement of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> are restrained.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">When shipping, the lid body <b>25</b> is not deeply pressed and the first latch structure <b>26</b> is in the engaging state.

<p id="p-0187" num="0186">At this time, the parallel rectangular tube portion <b>65</b><i>b </i>at the holding member main body <b>22</b> side is pinched between the posts <b>63</b><i>b </i>having the long slender quadrangular cross section illustrated on right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, so that the protecting boot <b>65</b> which are integrated with the holding member main body <b>22</b> are held in a stable state. On the other hand, a tapered rectangular tube portion <b>65</b><i>c </i>has flexibility without being restrained and has a proper function as a protecting boot that protects the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Next, the lid portion <b>64</b> of the holding member fixture <b>62</b> is tightened by screws to the lid fixture portion <b>63</b><i>c </i>of the base portion <b>63</b>, so that the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>B is fixed to the holding member fixture <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">At this time, the optical connector <b>3</b> that is attached to each of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> that are held in the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>B can be precisely positioned at the position to be mounted on the substrate <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Furthermore, in a case where the position of the optical connector <b>3</b> is misaligned from the position to be mounted, the first step latch structure <b>26</b> loosely engages to such a degree that the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> can be adjusted, so that the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>B is separated from the holding member fixture <b>62</b> and the position of the laminated optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> may be readjusted in a state in which the second step latch structure <b>27</b> is released, the first step latch structure <b>26</b> is engaged and the lid body <b>25</b> is attached.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">As described above, according to the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>B, the holding of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> can be performed by a simple operation of covering the lid body <b>25</b>, so that the operation of laminating and holding the optical fiber ribbons can be easily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The position of the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> can be readjusted in a state in which the second step latch structure <b>27</b> is released, the first step latch structure <b>26</b> is engaged and the lid body <b>25</b> is attached, so that the optical fiber ribbons are easily readjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Since a heating operation is not required unlike the conventional heat shrinkable tube, the lid body is detachably mounted and the position of the optical fiber ribbons can be readjusted, so that even though the optical fiber ribbons are not positioned with high precision when shipping, the user can easily and precisely adjust the position and then the optical fiber ribbons can be laminated and held.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">Since the protecting boot <b>65</b> is employed, so when the optical fiber ribbons are routed from the rear side of the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>B after the optical fiber ribbon holding member <b>1</b>B is fixed to the holding member fixture <b>62</b>, the optical fiber ribbons <b>2</b> can be prevented from generating sharp bending, and the optical fiber can be prevented from being damaged or increasing optic loss.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In this embodiment, the protecting boot <b>65</b> is integrally formed with the holding member main body <b>22</b> so that the operation for covering the protecting boot is not separately required, and the operation of assembly is good. Some (parallel rectangular tube portion <b>65</b><i>b</i>) of the protecting boot <b>65</b> is also fixed to the holding member fixture <b>62</b> so that the protecting boot effectively performs the protection of the optical fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The optical fiber ribbons pressing portion <b>28</b> has a structure such that the bottom portion <b>23</b> of the lid body <b>25</b> has a plate spring shape.

<p id="p-0304" num="0303">According to the embodiments, since the protecting boot is arranged at the rear portion of the holding member main body, when the optical fiber ribbons are handled at the rear portion of the optical fiber ribbon holding member after the optical fiber ribbon holding member is fixed by the holding member fixture, the optical fiber ribbons can be prevented from bending sharply.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">According to the structure in which the protecting boot is integrally resin molded with the holding member main body as described in the embodiments, the operation in which the optical fiber ribbons that are held by the optical fiber holding member are fixed to the holding member fixture can be easily and effectively performed so that increasing of the damage on the optical loss of the optical fiber cannot occur. In this case, as described in the embodiments, the holding member main body and the protecting boot may be made of a material of which the hardness is lower than that of the lid body.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">According to the embodiments, when the protecting boot is detachably attached to the holding member main body, the protecting boot can be a proper shape, dimensions and material according to the usage environment, and the optical fiber ribbon holding member can correspond to a case where the protecting boot is not required.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">According to the optical fiber ribbon holding member of the embodiments, the optical fiber ribbons pass through the through hole of the second member and pass through the optical fiber ribbon passing through hole of the first member via between the upper and lower pinch pieces. Next, the first member and the second member are engaged by the latch structure with the operation in which the second member moves to the base portion side of the first member and then the optical fiber ribbons can be held in a laminated state.</p>

<p id="p-0310" num="0309">The heating operation is not required so that the operation is easily performed unlike the conventional heat shrinkable tube. The first member and the second member can be engaged and released so that the readjustment of the position of the optical fiber ribbons can be performed, and even though the positioning is not performed with high precision when shipping, the user may easily perform positioning with high precision so that the optical fiber ribbons can be laminated and held.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">The optical fiber ribbon holding member according to the embodiments is not limited to a case where the optical fiber ribbon holding member is fixed to the device bedplate on which the substrate is attached and the optical connector is mounted. In the case where the optical fiber ribbons are required to be held, the optical fiber ribbons are properly held by the optical fiber ribbon holding member regardless of whether the number of the optical fiber ribbon is one or plural.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">According to the optical fiber ribbon holding member in the embodiments, when optical fiber ribbons are passed through the two the optical fiber ribbon passing through portions respectively, the height dimension h of each of the optical fiber ribbon passing through portions becomes the height dimension in which the optical fiber ribbons that are passed through the optical fiber ribbon passing through portions are engaged to such a degree that light friction force can be generated. Thus, the optical fiber ribbons can be held by the optical fiber ribbon holding member.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">As described above, the optical fiber ribbons can be held simply by an operation in which the optical fiber ribbons pass through the optical fiber ribbon passing through portions, so that the holding operation of the optical fiber ribbons is easily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">Also, the holding is performed to such a degree that light friction force is generated and the optical fiber ribbon can move with respect to the optical fiber ribbon holding member so that the readjustment of the position of the optical fiber ribbons in the longitudinal direction thereof can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">The heating operation is not required so that the operation is easily performed unlike the existing heat shrinkable tube. The readjustment of the position of the optical fiber ribbons can be performed so that even though the positioning is not performed with high precision when shipping, the user may easily perform positioning with high precision so that the optical fiber ribbons can be held.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">The optical fiber ribbon holding member of which the structure is simple and the above effect is present can be made in extremely easily and at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">According to the optical fiber ribbon holding member in the embodiments, the optical fiber ribbon passing through portion is the laterally long U-shaped groove and the optical fiber ribbons are received and passed through the laterally long U-shaped groove from the side, so that the operation of the holding of the optical fiber ribbons is further easily performed.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">According to the optical fiber ribbon holding method in the embodiments, the rubber or the rubber tube has the anti-slip function between the optical fiber ribbon and the optical fiber ribbon holding member and between the optical fiber ribbons, and the variation of the position of the optical fiber ribbons is effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">According to the optical fiber ribbon bundle in the embodiments, the workability of the work that is performed by the user who receives the product can be greatly enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">In the holding member fixture of the embodiments, when the lid portion of the holding member fixture is fixed to the base portion, the lid portion descends while the declined surface of the vertical portion slides along the declined surface of the second member of the optical fiber ribbon holding member. Accordingly, the second member moves toward the base portion side of the first member with the wedge operation force due to the descending of the declined surface of the lid portion. When the second member moves toward the base portion side of the first member, the upper and lower tapered surfaces of the through hole of the second member slide and move on the upper and lower of the outside tapered surfaces of the pinch pieces of the first member respectively. Accordingly, the upper and lower pinch pieces are bent inwardly with the wedge operation force by the movement of the upper and lower surfaces of the through hole and the pinched optic fiber ribbons are tightened from both the upper and lower sides so that the optic fiber ribbons are tightly fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">According to the holding member fixture in the embodiments, when the optical fiber ribbon holding member that is positioned on the base portion of the holding member fixture is pressed by the lid portion and the optical fiber ribbon holding member is fixed on the base portion, the projections of the upper surface of the base portion and the lower surface of the lid portion have the anti-slip function that prevents the sliding with respect to the lid portion or the base portion of the optical fiber ribbon holding member</p>
