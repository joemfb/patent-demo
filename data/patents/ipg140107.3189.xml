<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from an application earlier filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on 8 Dec. 2010 and there duly assigned Serial No. 10-2010-0124863.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an organic light emitting display device and a manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly, to an organic light emitting display device having a simplified manufacturing process and satisfying all of a patterning characteristic, an electrical characteristic, and a pad reliability of a pad unit, and a method of manufacturing the organic light emitting display device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Flat panel display devices such as organic light emitting display devices or liquid crystal display devices are manufactured on a substrate on which a pattern including thin film transistors (TFTs), capacitors, and wiring connecting the TFTs and capacitors is formed. In general, to form a fine pattern including TFTs on a substrate on which a flat panel display device is manufactured, the pattern is transferred to the substrate by using a mask where the fine pattern is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A process to transfer a pattern using a mask generally uses a photolithography process. According to the photolithography process including a series of sub-steps, photoresist is uniformly formed on a substrate on which a pattern is to be formed. The photoresist is exposed to light using an exposure equipment such as a stepper. In the case of positive photoresist, the exposed photoresist is developed. After the photoresist is developed, the pattern is etched using the remaining photoresist as a mask, thereby removing unnecessary photoresist.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the process of transferring a pattern using a mask, a mask having a necessary pattern thereon is needed. Accordingly, as the number of steps in which a mask is used increases, a manufacturing cost for preparing a mask increases. Also, since the above-described complicated steps are needed, a manufacturing process is complicated, a manufacturing time is extended, and a manufacturing cost rises.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To solve the above and/or other problems, the present invention provides an organic light emitting display device having a simplified manufacturing process and satisfying all of a patterning characteristic, an electrical characteristic, and a pad reliability of a pad unit, and a method of manufacturing the organic light emitting display device.</p>

In detail, the pixel electrode <b>414</b> is formed by removing the second conductive layer <b>415</b>, which is exposed by the opening H<b>4</b>, of the electrode pattern <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). The capacitor upper electrode <b>314</b> is formed by removing the second conductive layer <b>315</b>, which is exposed by the opening H<b>5</b>, of the electrode pattern <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Thus, the gate lower electrode <b>214</b>, the capacitor upper electrode <b>314</b>, the pixel electrode <b>414</b>, and the pad lower electrode <b>514</b> are formed of the same material and in the same layer. The capacitor lower electrode <b>312</b> may be doped by injecting n-type or p-type impurities through the opening H<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The impurities injected during doping may be the same as or different from one used during the doping of the active layer <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a pixel define layer (PDL) <b>418</b> is formed on the substrate <b>10</b>. In detail, a fourth insulation layer (not shown) is deposited on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b> where the pixel electrode <b>414</b>, the source and drain electrodes <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b</i>, the capacitor upper electrode <b>314</b>, and the second pad electrode <b>517</b> are formed. The fourth insulation layer may be formed of one or more organic insulation materials selected from a group consisting of polyimide, polyamide, acryl resin, benzocyclobutene, and phenol resin, in a method such as spin coating. Also, the fourth insulation layer may be formed of an inorganic insulation material selected from a group consisting of SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN<sub>x</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, CuO<sub>x</sub>, Tb<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and Pr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, in addition to the above organic insulation material. The fourth insulation layer may be formed in a multilayer structure in which the organic insulation material and the inorganic insulation material are alternately arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The PDL <b>418</b> for defining a pixel is formed by patterning the fourth insulation layer in a mask process using a fifth mask (not shown) to form an opening H<b>7</b> that exposes the center portion of the pixel electrode <b>414</b> and an opening H<b>8</b> that exposes the center portion of the second pad electrode <b>517</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the ion doping layer <b>517</b><i>a </i>is formed by doping ions such as nickel (Ni) or lanthanum (La) ions in the upper portion of the second pad electrode <b>517</b> exposed by the opening H<b>8</b>. In detail, the organic light emitting display device according to the present embodiment includes the first pad electrode <b>515</b> and the second pad electrode <b>517</b>, in which the ion doped layer <b>517</b><i>a </i>is characteristically formed on the upper surface of the second pad electrode <b>517</b> and will be described below in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The requirements of a pad electrode may include a patterning characteristic, an electric characteristic, and pad reliability. Although there is a demand to develop a pad electrode that satisfies all three requirements, no pad electrode satisfies all the requirements until now. For example, when a pad electrode is configured in a tri-layer structure of molybdenum (Mo)-aluminum (Al)-molybdenum (Mo), while a patterning characteristic with respect to wet etch is superior, Mo may be oxidized and a galvanic reaction occurs between Mo and Al so that the pad reliability requirement may not be satisfied. When a pad electrode is configured in a tri-layer structure of titanium (Ti)-aluminum (Al)-titanium (Ti), while there is no worry of oxidization and corrosion and a pad reliability is superior, it is a problem that wet etch may not be employed. Also, when a pad electrode is formed in a dual structure of Mo and Al only, an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>oxide is generated on a surface and thus Al is corrodes. That is, it is impossible to configure a pad electrode with the same material as one for forming a source/drain electrode. To address this problem, a method of forming a pad electrode with the same material as a pixel electrode in the same layer has been considered, but it is a problem that a transparent electrode such as ITO forming a pixel electrode has too high resistance and a low structural reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">To address the above problems, in the organic light emitting display device according to the present embodiment, while the second pad electrode <b>517</b> is formed of the same material as the source and drain electrodes <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>in the same layer, the ion doped layer <b>517</b><i>a </i>is formed on the surface of the second pad electrode <b>517</b> so that the patterning characteristic, the electrical characteristic, and the pad reliability are all satisfied. That is, as ions such as nickel (Ni) or lanthanum (La) ions are doped in the upper portion of the second pad electrode <b>517</b> that is formed of a material such as aluminum (Al), the ion doped layer <b>517</b><i>a </i>which is a low resistance and simultaneously capable of functioning as a capping layer may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The ion doped layer <b>517</b><i>a </i>may be formed by, for example, an ion implantation process. That is, the ion doped layer <b>517</b><i>a </i>is formed by injecting ions such as nickel (Ni) or lanthanum (La) ions in the upper portion of the second pad electrode <b>517</b> that is formed of a material such as aluminum (Al), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The acceleration voltage of ions I being injected may be controlled such that the ions I may be doped only in the surface and the upper portion of the second pad electrode <b>517</b>, not in the entire portion of the second pad electrode <b>517</b>. For example, by controlling the acceleration voltage of the ion implantation process at a level of about 10-40 keV, the ions I may be doped only in the surface and the upper portion of the second pad electrode <b>517</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As such, since the ion doped layer <b>517</b><i>a </i>prevents the second pad electrode <b>517</b> formed of a material such as aluminum (Al) from being oxidized and corroded, the pad reliability may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It is preferred to perform ion doping only in the upper portion of the second pad electrode <b>517</b>, not in the source and drain electrodes <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b</i>. This is because, when ions are doped into pure aluminum, resistance may slightly increase. However, since the resistance of a wiring should be low at its maximum in the source and drain electrodes <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b</i>, a slight increase in resistance may be problematic. In contrast, the pad area is not much sensitive to the slight resistance increase and may have a characteristic of being strong to corrosion because the second pad electrode <b>517</b> is exposed to the outside. Thus, while the resistance of the source and drain electrodes <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>needs to be maintained as low as possible by preventing the ion doping into the source and drain electrodes <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>that are sensitive to the resistance increase, the second pad electrode <b>517</b> has a high anti-corrosion characteristic by performing ion doping into the second pad electrode <b>517</b> that is sensitive to oxidization and corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, since the ion injection process is performed after the PDL <b>418</b> is formed, even when ions are doped in the entire surface of the organic light emitting display device, the ions are not doped in the source and drain electrodes <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>that is protected by the PDL <b>418</b>, but only in the second pad electrode <b>517</b> that is exposed to the outside, so that the ion doping layer <b>517</b><i>a </i>where ions are doped may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> schematically illustrates the shape of a pad electrode of an organic light emitting display device manufactured by a manufacturing method of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> schematically illustrates the shape of a pad electrode of a conventional organic light emitting display device, in which the pad electrode is formed in a tri-layer structure of molybdenum (Mo)-aluminum (Al)-molybdenum (Mo).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in the organic light emitting display device manufactured by a manufacturing method of the present invention, after the source and drain electrodes <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>and the second pad electrode <b>517</b> are all etched, it can be seen that a CD lateral skew is about 1.2 &#x3bc;m and a taper angle after etching is an ideal angle of 72&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In contrast, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, when a pad electrode is configured in a tri-layer structure of molybdenum (Mo)-aluminum (Al)-molybdenum (Mo), after the source and drain electrodes and the pad electrode are all etched, it can be seen that a CD lateral skew is about 1.59 &#x3bc;m and a taper angle after etching is 45&#xb0; or less that is too much inclined. As such, when the taper angle too low, actually applied resistance may increase.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">When a pad electrode is configured by the first pad electrode <b>515</b> formed of molybdenum (Mo), the second pad electrode <b>517</b> formed of aluminum (Al), and the ion doped layer <b>517</b><i>a </i>that is doped with nickel (Ni) or lanthanum (La) ions and disposed on the second pad electrode <b>517</b>, since resistivity of Al and AlNiLa is about 1/100 to ITO, resistance may be reduced to 1/1000 compared to a pad wiring in which a pad electrode is formed of ITO.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Also, comparing the present invention with the molybdenum (Mo)-aluminum (Al)-molybdenum (Mo) structure in terms of a wiring, it can be seen that the patterning characteristic of the present invention is improved, that is, the CD lateral skew is improved to about 1.2 &#x3bc;m. Also, since the taper angle approaches an ideal value after etching and the top portion of the pad is formed of AlNiLa, not Mo, it can be seen that the pad electrodes of the present invention may have a high anti-corrosion characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Also, when the pad electrodes of the present invention and the ITO structure are compared, while the thickness of the pad electrode of the present invention is about 500 nm, the thickness of the ITO pad structure is merely about 30 nm so that it can be seen that the structural stability of the present invention is much higher. Therefore, according to the present invention, the patterning characteristic, the electric characteristic, and the pad reliability of the pad portion are all satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Meanwhile, after the ion implantation process is performed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an annealing process is additionally performed to diffuse the injected ions so that a concentration profile according to a depth may become uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a graph showing a concentration profile as a function of a depth after an ion implantation process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a graph showing a concentration profile as a function of a depth after an annealing process is performed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, rather than performing the ion implantation process only, when an annealing process is additionally performed, it can be seen that the concentration distribution of ions is uniform and smooth.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the intermediate layer <b>419</b> including an organic light emitting layer and the opposed electrode <b>420</b> are formed in the opening H<b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) that exposes the pixel electrode <b>414</b>. The intermediate layer <b>419</b> may be formed by depositing an emissive layer EML, and at least one of other function layers such as a hole transport layer HTL, a hole injection layer HIL, an electron transport layer ETL, and an electron injection layer EIL, in a single or combined structure.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The intermediate layer <b>419</b> may be formed of a low molecule organic material or a polymer organic material. When the intermediate layer <b>419</b> is formed of a low molecule organic material, the HTL and the HIL are deposited in a direction toward the pixel electrode <b>414</b> with respect to the organic light emitting layer and the ETL and the EIL are deposited in a direction toward the opposed electrode <b>420</b> with respect to the organic light emitting layer. Also, a variety of layers may be deposited as necessary. A usable organic material may include copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), N,N&#x2032;-Di(naphthalene-1-yl)-N,N&#x2032;-diphenyl-benzidine (NPB), or tris-8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq3).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">When the intermediate layer <b>419</b> is formed of a polymer organic material, the HTL only may be included in a direction to the pixel electrode <b>414</b> with respect to the organic light emitting layer. The HTL may be formed on the pixel electrode <b>414</b> in a method such as inkjet printing or spin coating using poly-(2,4)-ethylene-dihydroxy thiophene (PEDOT) or polyaniline (PANI). A usable organic material may include a poly-phenylenevinylene (PPV) based or polyfluorene based polymer organic material.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The opposed electrode <b>420</b> may be formed as a common electrode by being deposited on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b>. In the organic light emitting display device according to the present embodiment, the pixel electrode <b>414</b> is used as an anode electrode and the opposed electrode <b>420</b> is used as a cathode electrode. Also, the polarities of the electrodes may be reversely applied.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In a bottom emission type organic light emitting display device in which an image is presented in a direction toward the substrate <b>10</b>, the pixel electrode <b>414</b> is a transparent electrode and the opposed electrode <b>420</b> is a reflection electrode. The reflection electrode may be formed by thinly depositing metal having a low work function, for example, Ag, Mg, Al, Pt, Pd, Au, Ni, Nd, Ir, Cr, Li, Ca, LiF/Ca, LiF/Al, or a compound thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">During each mask process for forming the above-described organic light emitting display device, a deposition layer may be removed by dry etching or wet etching. In the above-described embodiment, an organic light emitting display device is described as an example. However, the present invention is not limited thereto and a variety of display devices including a liquid crystal display device may be employed. Also, although one TFT and one capacitor are illustrated in the drawings that illustrate the embodiment according to the present invention, this is for convenience of explanation and the present invention is not limited thereto. A plurality of TFTs and a plurality of capacitors may be included without increasing the number of mask processes according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As described above, according to the organic light emitting display device according to the present invention, a manufacturing process is simplified, and all of a patterning characteristic, an electrical characteristic, and a pad reliability of a pad unit are satisfied.</p>
