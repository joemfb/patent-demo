<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to dice shaker systems and, more particularly, relates to self-contained dice shaker containers that sense and assure the quality of the shake during a shaking event.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the gaming industry has expanded in recent years, so has the proliferation of casino establishment games of chance that require the use of one or more dice. For example, such games include, amongst others, craps, pai gow poker, pai gow (tiles), sic bo, chuck-a-luck, Dice Duel, etc. Although many games that include the use of dice have recently been added, as mentioned, there has always been a need to assure that there is no potential for players or dealers to purposely influence the outcome, and that the outcome of the dice roll is truly random&#x2014;even in, for example, the bar game of Liar's Dice. When players initiate dice outcomes, for example, casino operators want to ensure that players cannot cheat by influencing the dice outcome. When a dealer initiates dice outcomes, players want to ensure that the dealer does not influence the dice outcome to cause players to unfairly lose. Additionally, casino operators want to ensure that a dealer does not cheat to his or her own advantage (e.g., to benefit a confederate posing as a player). Thus, persons initiating a dice outcome must be able to cause a new outcome but must not be able to influence what the outcome is. In view of this, great lengths are undertaken to assure that each die is substantially symmetrical, and is substantially equally weighted about its center. In some instance, even more extreme measures are applied, such as measuring the amount of paint filling the pips, so as to retain a more balanced die that will not influence the dice roll outcome. Accordingly, improved dice shakers would be desirable.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">One or more different inventions may be described in the present application. Further, for one or more of the invention(s) described herein, numerous embodiments may be described in this patent application, and are presented for illustrative purposes only. The described embodiments are not intended to be limiting in any sense. One or more of the invention(s) may be widely applicable to numerous embodiments, as is readily apparent from the disclosure. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice one or more of the invention(s), and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical, software, electrical and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the one or more of the invention(s). Accordingly, those skilled in the art will recognize that the one or more of the invention(s) may be practiced with various modifications and alterations. Particular features of one or more of the invention(s) may be described with reference to one or more particular embodiments or figures that form a part of the present disclosure, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments of one or more of the invention(s). It should be understood, however, that such features are not limited to usage in the one or more particular embodiments or figures with reference to which they are described. The present disclosure is neither a literal description of all embodiments of one or more of the invention(s) nor a listing of features of one or more of the invention(s) that must be present in all embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Headings of sections provided in this patent application and the title of this patent application are for convenience only, and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Devices that are described herein as being configured for communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other, unless expressly specified otherwise. In addition, devices that are configured for communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries. A description of an embodiment with several components configured for communication with each other does not imply that all such components are required. To the contrary, a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of possible embodiments of one or more of the invention(s).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, although process steps, method steps, algorithms or the like may be described in a sequential order, such processes, methods and algorithms may be configured to work in alternate orders. In other words, any sequence or order of steps that may be described in this patent application does not, in and of itself, indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of described processes may be performed in any order that is practical. Further, some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non-simultaneously (e.g., because one step is described after the other step). Moreover, the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto, does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to one or more of the invention(s), and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When a single device or article is described, it will be readily apparent that more than one device/article (whether or not they cooperate) may be used in place of a single device/article. Similarly, where more than one device or article is described (whether or not they cooperate), it will be readily apparent that a single device/article may be used in place of the more than one device or article.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The functionality and/or the features of a device may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices that are not explicitly described as having such functionality/features. Thus, other embodiments of one or more of the invention(s) need not include the device itself.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Due to the potential for dice substitution and/or to minimize any effects of a throwing technique, gaming establishments typically require the use of a dice cup during a dice roll in certain games. Typically, these two-part dice cups consist of a container portion, defining an opening into a container cavity, and an end cover portion, that cooperates with the container portion to cover an end or the cavity opening thereof. More recent dice shaker designs have improved the mounting security between the end cover and container portion, for example, by adding mating threaded portions that cooperate to threadably secure the cover to the container portion or by adding removable locking features.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While such designs have improved the containment of the dice within the shaking assembly, a skilled person may still be able to influence the outcome of the dice by a controlled shake, or non-shake, of the dice cup. As more advanced gaming systems trend toward dealerless gaming tables, such potential of influencing the outcome is more problematic. Accordingly, there is a need to provide a self-contained dice shaker container that has the ability to provide human-discernable information regarding the correctness and quality of the shake during a shaking event.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some embodiments of the present invention relate to a self-contained dice shaker assembly including a container device defining an opening into an interior thereof that is configured for receipt of one or more dice. A cover member that cooperates with the container device to selectively cover the opening into the container interior, in a closed condition, may also be provided. A sensor assembly, in communication with the container interior, may be configured to monitor the shake quality of the dice in the container during a shaking event, in accordance with one or more predetermined parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, the shake of the self-contained dice shaker may monitored during the shaking event to assess the quality and/or correctness of the shake. For example, a dice shake may be considered &#x201c;correct&#x201d; or &#x201c;valid&#x201d; (e.g., useable for game play), only if certain criteria and/or parameters are met. Such criteria and/or parameters may include one or more of minimum detected acceleration levels, minimum number of contacts between the dice and one or more surfaces of the dice shaker assembly, and/or other types of detected motion.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In at least one embodiment, the entire dice shaker assembly may be configured to be lifted and manually shaken by a user, thus resulting in a dice shake outcome. Alternately, the dice shaker assembly may be operable to automatically shake the dice using one or more techniques for inducing dice motion, such as vibration. In either case, the dice shaker assembly may include one or more sensors for monitoring the quality of the dice shake (e.g., to ensure a correct and/or valid shake).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the dice shaker assembly may be operable to determine the outcome of a dice shake. Various techniques may be used to determine the shake outcome. For example, the dice shaker assembly may include one or more sensors operable to ascertain the number of dots on the bottom, top, and/or sides of the dice after a valid shake has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The dice shaker assembly may be operable to communicate the outcome of a dice shake. For example, the dice shaker assembly may communicate human-discernable information related to the outcome of the dice shake directly to a dealer and/or players through an audible and/or visible indicator. As a different example, the dice shaker assembly may be operable to communicate the outcome of a dice shake to a device, such as a gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some uses, a dealer may operate the dice shaker assembly. For example, the dealer traditionally rolls dice in pai gow poker. Use of the dice shaker assembly in this context may, for example, ensure that the dealer's dice shake is valid and reassure both the casino and players who are participating in the game that the dealer is not cheating (e.g., for the benefit of a confidante). In other uses, a player may operate the dice shaker assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An increasing number of casinos are installing gaming systems that include one or more video displays in a horizontal table-top style play area. These systems, sometimes referred to as eTables, can in some embodiments provide electronic equivalents of playing chips and/or gaming elements such as cards or dice. In some systems, such as the DigiDeal Digital Table System (&#x201c;DTS&#x201d;)-Hosted Electronic, Multi-Player Table Game system, available from DigiDeal Corp. of Spokane, Wash., a live dealer may oversee an eTable that uses, for example, physical chips for wagering and award payments, but virtual cards for providing the game. Some other systems, such as the DigiDeal DTS-X Non-Hosted Electronic, Multi-Player Table Game system where the gaming chips and the gaming elements (virtual cards for card games, virtual dice for dice games) may only exist in virtual form, may not require direct casino staff attendance or oversight.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Many casinos have replaced at least some gaming tables with eTables, for example to greatly reduce the staffing costs associated with a gaming area. An eTable may require only the general security oversight given to other machine-based game systems instead requiring a dedicated dealer overseen by a managing pit boss overseen by additional security. However, many player are attracted to dice-based games because of their trust in the fairness of physical dice. Typically, the use of physical dice requires significant oversight by casino personnel, which may negate many of the advantages of eTables. It is anticipated that a dice shaker according to some embodiments described herein may allow the use of physical dice in conjunction with eTables or other dealerless or electronic table games without requiring additional supervision by casino personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Certain players are attracted to dice games such as craps which afford players the ability to directly interact with the dice. Similarly, certain players place greater trust in human-driven dice shaking than machine-driven dice shaking. It is anticipated that a dice shaker according to some embodiments described herein could allow human-driven dice shaking while providing improved security and/or requiring less casino staff oversight to assure a certain level of security.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The dice shaker assembly may include one or more security features, such as for example securing the dice against tampering. In some embodiments, a security device may allow adding or removing of dice from the dice shaker assembly only with a physical or electronic key. By preventing tampering with dice, use of the dice shaker assembly in a casino environment may reduce the occurrence of cheating.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some embodiments of the dice shaker assembly may include a mechanism for preventing unauthorized removal of the dice shaker assembly from a particular location, such as an area near an electronic gaming table or a casino floor. Various types of mechanisms for monitoring the location and/or removal of the dice shaker assembly may be used. For example, the dice shaker assembly may include one or more communication device(s) operable to maintain a communication link with one or more communication device(s) located in a casino. As another example, the dice shaker assembly may include a GPS device for monitoring the location of the dice shaker assembly. If unauthorized removal of the dice shaker assembly is detected, one or more components associated with the dice shaker assembly and/or one or more device(s) located in the casino may be operable to emit an audible and/or silent alarm, notify casino personnel, cease operation, etc. In some embodiments, a dice shaker assembly may be associated with a unique identifier so that it can be tracked in a casino environment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, use of the dice shaker assembly may allow a greater density of table games (e.g., on a casino floor). For example, use of the dice shaker assembly may allow a table with a large surface for dice rolling to be replaced with a much smaller table, since the dice rolling activity can be performed with the dice shaker assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a specific example of a dice shaker assembly. Dice shaker assembly <b>100</b> includes dice receptacle <b>104</b>, cover member <b>108</b>, and sensor assembly <b>112</b>. According to various embodiments, dice shaker assembly <b>100</b> may include one or more additional component(s) not depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At <b>104</b>, a dice receptacle is depicted. According to various embodiments, a dice receptacle may be any container, cavity, platform, and/or compartment configured to receive and/or contain one or more dice. For example, dice shaker assembly <b>100</b> may include a housing, and dice receptacle <b>104</b> may be a compartment and/or cavity associated with the housing. As another example, a dice receptacle may be a platform on which one or more dice may rest. Some such components are described below and are illustrated in FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Dice receptacle <b>104</b> is configured such that one or more dice may be contained therein while the dice are shaken. Further, dice receptacle <b>104</b> is configured such that after the dice are shaken, the dice come to rest such that the outcome of the dice roll is apparent. For example, dice receptacle <b>104</b> may include a substantially flat bottom surface such that after one or more traditional 6-sided dice are shaken, it is usually the case that one and only one side of each of the one or more dice faces up when the dice shaker assembly is placed on a substantially flat surface. In different embodiments, dice receptacle <b>104</b> may be configured in different ways to receive and/or contain various types of dice. In at least one embodiment, a dice shaker assembly includes a single dice receptacle. In different embodiments, a dice shaker assembly may include a plurality of dice receptacles, each receptacle configured to receive and/or contain one or more dice.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At <b>108</b>, a cover member is depicted. In some embodiments, each dice receptacle may be associated with one or more cover members. In different embodiments, a single cover member may be used for more than one dice receptacle. However, a cover member may not necessarily be present in all embodiments. For example, a dice shaker assembly configured for use in chuck-a-luck may not have a cover member separate from the dice receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to various embodiments, a cover member may be any surface configured to cover one or more dice receptacles. Thus, according to different embodiments, many different types of cover members may be used. For example, cover member <b>108</b> may be opaque, clear, translucent, have varying degrees of light transparency, or some combination thereof. In one embodiment, a cover member may be a clear dome, such as a glass or plastic dome. Alternately, a cover member may be an opaque cup that must be removed to view the dice enclosed in dice receptacle <b>104</b>. As yet another example, a cover member may be operable to have varying degrees of light transparency or opacity, such as for example being made of smart glass. Examples of such types of materials and/or surfaces include smart glass, light valves, suspended particle devices, liquid crystal devices, electrochromic devices, light-sensitive surfaces, or others that are operable to change in opacity in response to stimulus (e.g., an electronic signal, an electric current, ultraviolet or other type of light, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In at least one embodiment, the cover member may be fixed to the dice shaker assembly. However, in some embodiments the cover member may be removable so that, for example, dice may be added or removed from dice receptacle <b>104</b>. Removal of the cover member may be governed by one or more security features. For example, removal of the cover member may require the insertion of a physical key, the transmission of a digital security key, the use of a keypad device on the dice shaker assembly, a biometric authentication technique, etc. Thus, some embodiments of dice shaker assembly <b>100</b> may be configured such that a dealer may easily add or remove dice, such as for example in use with games that require different numbers of dice. Alternately, in one or more embodiments a dealer may be unable to easily add or remove dice. In at least one embodiment, a single component may be used to contain one or more dice during shaking rather than a separate receptacle and cover member components. For example, in a dice shaker assembly configured for use with the game of chuck-a-luck, dice may be contained in an hourglass-shaped receptacle that is not associated with a separate cover member component.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments the dice may be visible during shaking. However, in at least one embodiment, the dice shaker assembly may be configured to conceal the dice during shaking. Concealing the dice during shaking may, for example, reduce the ability of a user to influence the outcome of a dice shake. Various techniques may be used to conceal the dice. For example, as discussed herein, the dice shaker assembly may include a cover member configured to vary in transparency (e.g., become opaque during shaking). As another example, the dice shaker assembly may include a separator, such as a camera-type iris, scissor shutters, or other type of separator, that visually and physically seals off the shaking compartment from view. As yet another example, one cover member may be used to contain the dice and a separate cover member may be used to conceal the dice. In on such embodiment, the dice may be covered by a clear glass dome. Then, an opaque shield may be fitted over the dome in order to conceal the dice. In a different embodiment, the dice shaker assembly may include a shutter or flap to contain the dice in during shaking and a clear dome outside the shutter or flap through which to see the dice when the shutter or flap is open.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, in some embodiments, the dice may be concealed from view during shaking without shaking the device in a different compartment from the one in which they are displayed. This may, for example, increase player satisfaction with the dice game since the experience for the player may more closely approximate the use of traditional dice shakers.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As discussed herein, in some embodiments the dice shaker assembly is configured to be manually shaken by a user. However, in different embodiments the dice shaker assembly may be configured with a shaking mechanism operable to mechanically and/or automatically shake the dice. Many different types of automatic dice shaking mechanisms may be used. According to various embodiments, a shaking mechanism may include one or more of a manual and/or automatic crank for rotating the dice receptacle, a rod connecting a stepper motor to a driving cam, a vibrating surface associated with the dice receptacle, etc. In some embodiments, shaking may be a combination of manual and automatic activity, such as if a user depresses an actuator which triggers some automatic shaking activity.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At <b>112</b>, a sensor assembly is depicted. In various embodiments, sensor assembly <b>112</b> may include various types, numbers, and combinations of sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In at least one embodiment, the sensor assembly includes one or more sensors operable to determine information related to the quality or outcome of a shake. For example, the sensor assembly may include sensors operable to analyze motion related to a shake, such as for example one or more accelerometers, tilt sensors, tip over sensors, dice floor contact sensors, dice dome contact sensors, inversion sensors, audio sensors, etc. (or some combination thereof). As another example, the sensor assembly may include one or more sensors operable to detect information related to the outcome of a shake, such as one or more optical sensors operable to detect the light reflected by a number of pips on the bottom, sides, and/or top of a die.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The sensor assembly may include one or more cover sensors operable to detect information related to the cover member. For example, the sensor assembly may include a cover sensor operable to determine whether cover member <b>108</b> is correctly positioned. As another example, sensor assembly <b>112</b> may include one or more lock sensors operable to detect whether the cover member is locked in place. Such cover sensor and lock sensor assemblies may include, for example, one or more electromechanical actuators, magnetic sensors, electrical switches, etc. (or some combination thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the sensor assembly may include one or more sensors operable to determine whether the dice shaker assembly is resting on a table. For example, the sensor assembly may include one or more of, an optical sensor, a level sensor, eddy current sensor, audio sensor, etc. (or some combination thereof). In at least one embodiment, the dice shaker assembly is configured such that the dice shaker assembly must be placed on a table after a shaking event in order for the shaking event to be valid. For example, a valid shake may require that the dice shaker assembly be placed on a flat surface with a cover member in place or the dice otherwise concealed. As another example, the dice shaker assembly may include with a mechanical shaking device and a valid shake may require that the dice shaker assembly is not removed from the table during and/or after shaking.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a specific example of a dice shaker assembly <b>200</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, dice <b>204</b> are contained within a dice receptacle <b>104</b> and a cover member <b>108</b>. As discussed herein, various types of dice, dice receptacles, and cover members may be used. For example, the cover member <b>108</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a clear glass dome through which the dice are visible.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At <b>112</b>, an example of a sensor assembly is illustrated. According to various embodiments, various types, numbers, and configurations of components may be used in a sensor assembly. As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one or more electronic components may be located within the dice shaker assembly. For example, the electronic components may include one or more of a power supply, a processor, a memory device, a communication device, a sensor assembly, etc. (or some combination thereof). In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the components include transmitter/receiver <b>234</b>, motion unit <b>232</b>, battery <b>236</b>, processor <b>238</b>, and sensor <b>228</b>, and ports <b>244</b>. Components such as these will be discussed in greater detail below. It should be noted that the components included in the example dice shaker assembly are only an example configuration of components. In different embodiments, different types, configurations, and/or numbers of components may be used. For example, as will be discussed herein, in some embodiments the dice shaker assembly may include one or more mechanical, rather than electronic, components.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The electronic components present in some embodiments of a dice shaker assembly are powered by one or more power sources, such as a rechargeable battery. Various techniques may be used to provide power to the dice shaker assembly, such as human kinetics (e.g., during shaking), electronic induction, and/or physically coupling the dice shaker assembly to an external power source. As will be described herein, however, in some embodiments the dice shaker assembly may operate without any electric power, such as through the use of mechanical sensors, switches, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the dice shaker assembly may include a power indicator. A power indicator may provide an indication of how much power is left in a battery associated with the dice shaker assembly or indicate a lower power condition. Various types of power indicators may be used, such as audible alarms, LED displays, LCD displays, etc. Additionally, or alternately, in some embodiments information related to the amount of power remaining in the dice shaker assembly may be transmitted to one or more external devices.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, a dice shaker assembly may also include one or more external ports. According to various embodiments, external ports may be operable to perform various functions. For example, in some embodiments one or more external ports may be operable to couple with an external power source to charge a rechargeable battery in the dice shaker assembly. Alternately, one or more external ports may be operable to communicate with one or more external devices, such as to convey information related to shake quality and/or shake outcome.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a specific example of a Shake Quality Output Procedure <b>300</b>. A Shake Quality Output Procedure may be used in conjunction with a dice shaker assembly to determine whether dice associated with the dice shaker assembly have been sufficiently shaken. For example, a Shake Quality Output Procedure may be used to determine whether a dice shake satisfies one or more criteria and/or parameters related to the quality of a dice shake. If a dice shake satisfies the criteria and/or parameters, then the dice shake may be considered a valid dice shake for use in one or more games of chance. Determining whether a dice shake is valid may, for example, ensure that the result of the dice shake is substantially random. Thus, a player may be prevented from exercising control over the result of the dice shake by insufficiently shaking the dice.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, each operation associated with Shake Quality Output Procedure <b>300</b> may be initiated and/or implemented at a dice shaker assembly. In different embodiments, one or more operations associated with a Shake Quality Output Procedure may be initiated and/or implemented at, for example, a device configured for communication with a dice shaker assembly. In at least one embodiment, a thread or instance of a Shake Quality Output Procedure may be initiated in response to one or more conditions and/or events, such as for example, turning on a dice shaker assembly, detecting motion associated with a dice shaker assembly, termination of a previous thread or instance of a Shake Quality Output Procedure, etc. In some embodiments, a Shake Quality Output Procedure may be used in conjunction with, for example, a Dice Roll Identification Procedure that will be described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At <b>304</b>, motion is detected. As discussed in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a dice shaker assembly may include a sensor assembly (e.g., sensor assembly <b>112</b>). A sensor assembly may include one or more sensors operable to detect motion, such as for example one or more the following (or some combination thereof): accelerometers, tilt sensors, tip over sensors, dice floor contact sensors, dice dome contact sensors, inversion sensors, audio sensors, etc. (or some combination thereof). Thus, the types of motion detected at <b>304</b> may include, for example, one or more of the following (or some combination thereof): acceleration, inversion, tilt, tip over, contact between one or more dice and some portion of the dice shaker assembly, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At <b>308</b>, a determination is made as to whether the detected motion satisfies one or more predetermined criteria and/or parameter(s) related to shake quality. In various embodiments, various types and combinations of shake quality criteria and/or parameters may be used. The following are examples of the types of criteria and/or parameter(s) that may be used to determine whether a shake is correct: (1) The cover member is in place and the dice shaker assembly is inverted at least three times. (2) The cover is locked in place and has at least six changes of direction with sufficient force. (3) The dice shaker assembly is lifted from the table and the dice contact the cover member at least four times. (4) The dice shaker assembly is accelerated by a sufficient force for at least 2 seconds. (5) An automatic shaking device has sufficiently shaken the dice (e.g., an optical disk on a rod connecting a stepper motor to a driving cam of an automatic shaker has rotated a sufficient number of sectors and/or the dice have sufficiently moved from their original position).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In various embodiments, a combination of different criteria and/or types of criteria may be used, such as for example a minimum number of contacts detected and a minimum number of inversions detected. As yet another example, in some embodiments different types of criteria may be combined and then compared to one or more predetermined criteria and/or parameters. For example, a combined value representing both acceleration and tilt information may be compared against a threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At <b>312</b>, shake quality output information is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to one or more embodiments, the dice shaker assembly may be configured to transmit human-discernable information related to shake quality. In at least one embodiment, shake quality output information may be transmitted by an audible indicator, such as an audio speaker and/or clacker device. For example, the dice shaker assembly may include one or more speakers operable to emit an audible alarm if a valid shake is detected and/or a different audible alarm if an invalid shake is detected. In some embodiments, shake quality output information may be transmitted by a visible indicator. For example, the dice shaker assembly may include one or more LCD displays, LED displays, seven segment displays, or other types of lights and/or displays that convey information relating to shake quality. As another example, the dice shaker assembly may include a fixed indicator that is hidden and/or revealed by a mechanical trigger, such as a spring, when a valid dice shake is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Many different techniques for signaling human-discernable information regarding the correctness of the shake may be used. The following are examples of such techniques that may be used according to one or more embodiments. (1) Lights and/or sound turn on when a shaking event qualifies or is deemed valid. (2) Lights and/or sound turn on when a shaking event begins and turn off when the shaking even qualifies as a valid shake. (3) An opaque dice cover locks in place until a shake qualifies as a valid shake, at which point it unlock. (4) Warning lights and/or sound occurs when the dice shaker assembly is placed on a flat surface but has not yet met one or more conditions and/or parameters necessary for a valid shake.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to various embodiments, the dice shaker assembly may be configured to transmit information related to shake quality to another device. For example, the dice shaker assembly may include one or more of a wireless device, infrared device, optical device, or other communication device operable to transmit information related to shake quality. In some embodiments, information related to shake quality may be transmitted over a network and/or directly to a gaming table.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The dice shaker assembly may be configured to transmit shake quality output information only upon detection of a valid shake, only upon detection of an invalid shake, or both. Transmitting an indication that a valid shake was detected may permit the dice shake outcome to be utilized by the player, game table, dealer, etc. Transmitting an indication that an invalid shake was detected may permit a user to recognize that a shake was invalid and try again.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At <b>316</b>, a determination is made as to whether to continue. According to different embodiments, various criteria may be used to determine whether to continue. For example, in some embodiments the dice shaker assembly may be configured to continue detecting motion and/or monitoring shake quality until an indication to shut down is received. However, in some embodiments a dice shaker assembly may be configured to cease monitoring after transmitting shake quality output information. In such a configuration, the dice shaker assembly may be configured to resume monitoring after receiving an indication to do so. Other examples of criteria that may affect whether to continue at <b>316</b> in various embodiments include detection of a predefined number of invalid shakes, a lower power condition, an end of a game and/or gaming session, a determination that the dice shaker assembly has been placed on a surface (e.g., an electronic gaming table), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments a Shake Quality Output Procedure may include operations not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Additionally, or alternately, one or more operations associated with a Shake Quality Output Procedure may be omitted or performed by a different device. For example, raw data associated with the motion detected may be transmitted directly to a remote communication device which makes the determination as to whether the motion satisfies one or more predetermined motion parameter(s).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a specific example of a Dice Roll Identification Procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A Dice Roll Identification Procedure may be used in conjunction with a dice shaker assembly to determine the validity and/or outcome of a dice shaking event. For example, a Dice Roll Identification Procedure may be used to determine whether a dice shake satisfies one or more criteria and/or parameters related to the quality of a dice shake. If a dice shake satisfies the criteria and/or parameters, then the dice shake may be considered a valid dice shake for use in one or more games of chance. A Dice Roll Identification Procedure may also be used to determine the outcome of a dice shaking event. For example, one or more sensors may determine the number of pips on each die at rest in the dice receptacle of a dice shaker assembly after a valid shaking event is detected. Determining the validity and/or outcome of a dice shaking event may allow the outcome to be used for gaming purposes, such as in conjunction with a traditional dice game and/or a video gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, each operation associated with Dice Roll Identification Procedure <b>300</b> may be initiated and/or implemented at a dice shaker assembly.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">At <b>404</b>, motion is detected. As discussed herein, a dice shaker assembly may include a sensor assembly (e.g., sensor assembly <b>112</b>). A sensor assembly may include one or more sensors operable to detect motion, such as for example one or more the following (or some combination thereof): accelerometers, tilt sensors, tip over sensors, dice floor contact sensors, dice dome contact sensors, inversion sensors, audio sensors, etc. Thus, the types of motion detected at <b>404</b> may include, for example, one or more of the following (or some combination thereof): acceleration, tilt, tip over, inversion, contact between one or more dice and some portion of the dice shaker assembly, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">At <b>408</b>, a determination is made as to whether the detected motion satisfies one or more predetermined criteria and/or parameter(s) related to shake quality. In various embodiments, various types and combinations of shake quality criteria and/or parameters may be used, as discussed for example with respect to operation <b>308</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">At <b>412</b>, the outcome of the dice roll is identified. In some embodiments, as discussed herein, the dice shaker assembly may include one or more sensors operable to identify various kinds of information about dice located in the dice shaker receptacle to determine the outcome of the dice shake. For example, one or more sensors may be used to determine the number of pips on the top, bottom, or sides of one or more dice. Alternately, or additionally, an external device may determine the outcome of a dice shake. For example, the dice shaker assembly may be substantially or partially transparent to one or more types of sensors located in another device, such as the Microsoft Surface&#xae;, available from Microsoft, Inc. of Redmond, Wash. The device may then be used to determine information about the dice shake outcome (e.g., when the dice shaker assembly is placed on the device).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to various embodiments, various types of sensors may be used to determine the dice shake outcome. For example, sensor assembly <b>112</b> may include one or more optical sensors operable to detect light reflected by the pips on one or more of the top, bottom, and/or sides of the dice. In at least one embodiment, one or more sensors may be operable to detect visible light, infrared light, ultraviolet light, or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The incident light may be provided by ambient light sources, or it may be provided by one or more lights included in the dice shaker assembly. For example, dice receptacle <b>104</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may include one or more visible, infrared, and/or ultraviolet light sources designed or configured to illuminate the pips on dice contained in the dice receptacle. In some embodiments, visible, infrared, and/or ultraviolet light may be provided by a light source in a gaming environment external to the dice shaker assembly, such as a light source included in a gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Thus, according to various embodiments, different sensors or combinations of sensors may be used in conjunction with different types of dice to determine the dice shake outcome. The following are a few examples of such configurations. (1) One or more sensors may be operable to sense light pips on dark dice, and/or dark pips on light dice. (2) One or more sensors may be operable to sense pips of different colors (e.g., the pips on the &#x201c;2&#x201d; side of a 6-sided dice may be green, while the pips on the &#x201c;3&#x201d; side of a 6-sided dice may be red.) (3) One or more sensors may be operable to detect ultraviolet and/or infrared color tints, which may be difficult to perceive or invisible to the naked eye, on the pips of one or more dice. (4) Different configurations of pip colors may be used to determine dice outcome. For example, in one embodiment, if a six-sided die has a side with 3 pips, each having a different color or tint, then sensing those colors in combination with the orientation of the pips may be used to infer the value shown on the top of the die.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">At <b>416</b>, dice shake information is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to various embodiments, the dice shaker assembly may be configured to transmit dice shake outcome information to another device.

In some embodiments, information related to dice shake outcome may be transmitted over a network and/or directly to a gaming table. However, as discussed herein, in some embodiments the dice shaker assembly may be configured such that one or more sensors located in another device can determine the dice shake outcome. In such embodiments, the transmission of information may involve moving the dice shaker assembly into a proper position for the external sensors to read the dice outcome, rather than active communication by the dice shaker assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The dice shaker assembly may be configured to transmit human-discernable information related to the dice shake outcome.

(1) The value of each die may be transmitted. (2) The sum of the die values may be transmitted. (3) Information related to whether or not a player won or lost may be transmitted. For example, LEDs may light up if any player wins. As another example, a player-specific light color may light up for each winning player. As yet another example, celebratory music and/or sound effects may occur if a dealer loses. (4) Other game related information may be transmitted. Such information may include, for example, a craps outcome (e.g., &#x201c;boxcars,&#x201d; &#x201c;crapped out,&#x201d; &#x201c;point made,&#x201d; etc.), dice courage specific outcomes (e.g., the sum of the first two, first three, and all four dice), the dice total and the current game sum for a game of Steamroller, a player color associated with the outcome of a dice shake in a game of pai gow poker, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">At <b>420</b>, a determination is made as to whether to continue. According to different embodiments, various criteria may be used to determine whether to continue.

<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a specific example of a gaming table that may be used in conjunction with a dice shaker assembly. As discussed herein, the dice shaker assembly may be used in conjunction with various types of gaming tables. However, the gaming table illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an electronic, multiplayer gaming table incorporating a Microsoft Surface or other suitable touch-screen display.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Additional details relating to various aspects of gaming table technology are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/265,627, by Wells, et al., entitled &#x201c;INTELLIGENT MULTIPLAYER GAMING SYSTEM WITH MULTI-TOUCH DISPLAY&#x201d;, filed Nov. 5, 2008, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates an intelligent multi-player electronic gaming system <b>500</b> configured as a multi-player electronic table gaming system which includes four player stations (e.g., A, B, C, D), with each player station having a respective funds center system (e.g., <b>504</b><i>a</i>, <b>504</b><i>b</i>, <b>504</b><i>c</i>, <b>504</b><i>d</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, electronic table gaming system <b>500</b> includes a main display <b>502</b> which may be configured or designed as a multi-touch, multi-player interactive display surface having a multipoint or multi-touch input interface. According to different embodiments, various regions of the multitouch, multi-player interactive display surface may be allocated for different uses which, for example, may influence the content which is displayed in each of those regions. For example, the multi-touch, multi-player interactive display surface may include one or more designated multi-player shared access regions, one or more designated personal player regions, one or more designated dealer or house regions, and or other types of regions of the multi-touch, multi-player interactive display surface which may be allocated for different uses by different persons interacting with the multi-touch, multi-player interactive display surface. As another example, the multi-player interactive display surface may be used to display information associated with the dice shaker assembly, such as for example dice shake quality and/or dice shake outcome information.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Additionally, as illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, each player station may include an auxiliary display (e.g., <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b</i>) which, for example, may be located or positioned below the gaming table surface. In this way, content displayed on a given auxiliary display (e.g., <b>506</b><i>a</i>) associated with a specific player/player station (e.g., Player Station A), may not readily be observed by the other players at the electronic table gaming system. According to various embodiments, one or more of the auxiliary displays may be used to display information associated with the dice shaker assembly, such as for example dice shake quality and/or dice shake outcome information.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In at least one embodiment, each auxiliary display at a given player station may be provided for use by the player occupying that player station. In at least one embodiment, an auxiliary display (e.g., <b>506</b><i>a</i>) may be used to display various types of content and/or information to the player occupying that player station (e.g., Player Station A). For example, in some embodiments, auxiliary display <b>506</b><i>a </i>may be used to display (e.g., to the player occupying Player Station A) private information, confidential information, sensitive information, and/or any other type of content or information which the player may deem desirable or appropriate to be displayed at the auxiliary display. Additionally, in at least some embodiments, as illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, each player station may include a secondary auxiliary <b>30</b> display (e.g., <b>508</b><i>a</i>, <b>508</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In some embodiments, use of the dice shaker assembly in conjunction with gaming table <b>800</b> may permit the casino to offer a dice game without the presence of a dealer. However, the dice shaker assembly may be used in conjunction with the gaming table even if a dealer is present.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Use the dice shaker assembly in conjunction with gaming table <b>800</b> may also permit various types of communication using sensing and/or communication capabilities of the gaming table. For example, in some embodiments, the dice shaker assembly may include a device operable to generate and/or read optical tags recognized by a vision based system included in the gaming table. Types of optical tags that may be used for transmission of information could include one or more one-dimensional barcodes, two-dimensional barcodes, matrix codes, symbols, glyphs, or any other code for encoding data. In some embodiments, the dice shaker assembly can generate the appropriate image using one or more electronic displays, such as LEDs, LCDs, smart paper displays, etc. Alternately, or additionally, the dice shaker assembly may use one or more electro-mechanical shutters, smart glass panes, etc. to reveal all or selected portions of encoded data present in or on the dice shaker assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Additionally, in some embodiments, gaming table <b>800</b> may perform one or more functions described herein as being performed by the dice shaker assembly. For example, an electronic gaming table may be operable to determine whether the dice shaker assembly is removed from the table and/or when the dice shaker assembly is placed on the table. In some embodiments, such information may be communicated back to the dice shaker assembly from the gaming table. Thus, in some embodiments, the dice shaker assembly may be able to perform one or more actions (e.g., activating one or more audible and/or visible indicators, transmitting information regarding shake quality and/or shake outcome, etc.) in accordance with information determined at an external device, such as a gaming table.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some embodiments, the dice shaker assembly may be designed and/or configured such that external sensors could determine the dice outcome. For example, in one embodiment the bottom of the dice shaker assembly is transparent to infrared light. The dice shaker assembly may include dice with &#x201c;white&#x201d; portions that reflect infrared light (e.g., white dice with dark dots, and/or dark dice with white dots). In this way, the pattern of dots on the dice may be illuminated to one or more infrared sensors. When the dice shaker assembly is placed on the surface of a surface table having infrared sensors, the infrared sensors can be used to determine the outcome of the dice shake. Benefits of such embodiments may include, for example, a lower production cost of the dice shaker assembly, decreased power consumption by the dice shaker assembly, and/or greater security against tampering.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In at least one embodiment, use of the dice shaker assembly in conjunction with a gaming table may permit the operation of a dice shaker assembly without any power source or with reduced power needs. For example, the dice shaker assembly may be designed and/or configured with a mechanical shake sensor and/or vibration sensor. Further, the dice shaker assembly may be configured such that one or more sensors associated with the gaming table (e.g., infrared cameras) can verify the correctness of the dice shake and/or ascertain the dice outcome without the presence of electric components on the dice shaker assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">For example, a mechanical shake and/or vibration sensor associated with the dice shaker assembly may combined a timed value with an angle of force. The shake sensor may be reset by a push button, a lever, or some other mechanism. When the mechanical shake sensor is triggered, it may trip a mechanical notification device. For example, triggering the mechanical shake sensor may flip an infrared reflector into a transparent window located in an area of the dice shaker assembly for reading by an external device. Thus, the gaming table could sense the external device while reading the dice outcome and could, for example, ignore any dice shake outcome where the infrared reflector is not visible.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">It is anticipated that in such an embodiment, a player might seek to manipulate the dice outcome after triggering the mechanical shake sensor. Thus, some embodiments may be equipped with a mechanical device, such as a shutter or iris, for concealing the dice when the dice shaker assembly is shaken and resetting when the mechanical shake sensor is reset.</p>
