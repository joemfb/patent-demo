<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A front panel, a pair of side panels, a top panel, and a bottom panel connect to form a cabinet. Optionally, the cabinet includes a rear panel. The front panel includes a pair of master keyways. Each of side panels has a groove and a pair of side keyways. Each groove provides the side panel with an edge profile that connects with one master keyway to couple the side panels with the front panel. Each of top and bottom panels includes a pair of grooves. Each groove provides top and bottom panels with an edge profile that connects with one side keyway to couple the top and bottom panels with the side panels. Optionally, one of the top or bottom panels includes an extender and the front panel includes a groove wherein the extender is received within the groove to limit movement of the side panels.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a cabinet system used in kitchens or furniture design. Specifically, the present disclosure includes a front panel, a pair of side panels, a top panel, and a bottom panel that fit together to form a cabinet. Optionally, the cabinet can include a back panel or a rear panel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Several techniques and systems have been developed for manufacturing and assembling cabinets. In a typical system, cabinet components are assembled using mechanical fasteners. In this type of system, often a skilled carpenter is required to assemble the cabinets, either in the manufacturing facility or at the final site of installation, for example a kitchen. The cabinets that are assembled in the manufacturing facility can be shipped in the assembled form to the final destination; however, this often requires large amounts of packing materials and shipping costs to do so. Unassembled cabinets can be shipped to the final destination, assembled, and installed at the final site of installation. However, these unassembled cabinets often require a skilled carpenter to assemble the cabinets which requires the homeowner to pay an additional cost of the carpenter to assemble and install the cabinets.</p>
