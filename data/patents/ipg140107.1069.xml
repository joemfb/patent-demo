<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A mixing device and method for mixing at least one first ingredient and at least one second ingredient. The device includes a body which has a wall defining a cavity. A first inlet communicates with the cavity for introducing the first ingredient and a second inlet communicates with the cavity for introducing the second ingredient. An outlet is provided in communication with the cavity receiving the mixed first and second ingredient which have been mixed in the cavity. The ingredients are mixed by introducing one ingredient as a stream and the second ingredient as a forcefully introduced stream. An area upstream of the ingredients is provided for mixing ingredients. Once mixed the ingredients must flow through the body before reaching the outlet. Multiple mixing devices can be cascaded to produce additional variations and mixing methods. The device can be in the form of a kit for retrofitting on existing devices such as beverage dispensers.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is a Continuation of copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/166,704, filed Jun. 23, 2005, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/583,153, filed Jun. 25, 2004; 60/617,106, filed Oct. 8, 2004; 60/661,193, filed Mar. 11, 2005; 60/683,279, filed May 20, 2005. The disclosures set forth in the referenced applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, including all information as originally submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the food preparation industry, it is important to mix ingredients to achieve an interim or final product. Prior mixing devices include passive, as well as active, mixing devices. Examples of passive mixing devices are devices which, by way of example, but not limitation, introduce beverage concentrate flowing into a stream of diluent, such as water. In some situations, this passive mixing may be acceptable depending on the type and nature of the concentrate as well as the diluent material, such as water.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An example of such a passive mixing device might be a venturi mixing apparatus in which two ingredients or components are brought together to produce a final mixed product. In a venturi device a stream of diluent, such as water, flows through a water feed line. Water flow is restricted and then expanded to produce a desired flow characteristic. On the expansion side of the venturi device is a connection to a second component. For example, the second component may be a beverage concentrate. The beverage concentrate connection or tube is connected to and communicates with the expansion side of the venturi device. When water flows through the water line and flows through the venturi device the venturi device creates a vacuum on the second component line thereby drawing second component from its source or container.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another example of a passive mixing device occurs in the beverage industry in which concentrate is mixed with water by use of two separate lines and corresponding controllable valves. For example, the controllable valves are operated to allow the diluent, such as water, to be dispensed and a second component, such as a beverage concentrate, to be dispensed into the water stream. The water and beverage concentrate can be pumped to the valve, pressurized, fed by gravity or otherwise delivered to the corresponding valve. When the valves are activated, the ingredients or components come together for mixing in a passive manner. The combined stream produces some degree of turbulence thereby mixing or at least combining the components.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Examples of active mixing may include dispensing ingredients into a conical mixing chamber that may include rotating blades or other agitators. While mechanical mixing is essential in some situations, it requires additional time and effort to periodically cleanse the mechanical mixing components. Additionally, the use of mechanical mixing components results in a more complex and, possibly, more expensive system. Further, the use of mechanical mixing or active mixing components often requires a cleansing cycle. The clean-out cycle often involves rinsing the system with the diluent at the end of a dispensing cycle. The dispensing of the diluent such as water at the end of a dispense cycle may not be preferred because it adds a very diluted juice on the top of the cup. This may appear to the consumer as an improperly mixed solution or over diluted solution. In some situations the user or consumer of the product may find this rinsing unattractive or question whether their product is being over diluted or improperly diluted or watered-down.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In situations where passive mixing may be preferable for a variety of reasons, it is also important to make sure that the desired mixing results are achieved. Recently, in the area of beverage concentrates, the trend by the concentrate manufacturers is to increase the viscosity of the concentrate material. For example, while concentrate to diluent ratios of 4:1 are common, beverage concentrate manufacturers are increasing ratios to 5:1 and beyond. This increase in concentrate viscosity requires new systems, methods and apparatus for mixing the concentrate with water.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional features will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of drawings exemplifying the best mode as presently perceived.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">While the present disclosure may be susceptible to embodiment in different forms, there is shown in the drawings, and herein will be described in detail, embodiments with the understanding that the present description is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the disclosure and is not intended to limit the disclosure to the details of construction and the arrangements of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of a mixing device <b>20</b> is generally shown. The mixing device <b>20</b> is shown in diagrammatic form to present the general principles and structures associated with the system, method and apparatus used in the present disclosure. The mixing device includes a body <b>22</b> having at least one wall <b>24</b> generally defining a cavity <b>26</b>. Reference to the body <b>22</b> and the wall <b>24</b> should be generally, broadly defined and interpreted. It is expected that a wide variety of body shapes, sizes and structures may be developed to achieve the device as set forth in this disclosure as well as improvements thereon and that the specific embodiments illustrated herein do not limit this disclosure. Additionally, reference to a wall should be broadly interpreted as being any particular structure whether solid or permeable, foraminous, slotted or any other structure including rigid, semi-rigid, flexible, articulated, or other characteristics which might be used to define the wall.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The body <b>22</b> includes a first inlet <b>28</b> communicating with the cavity <b>26</b> and through which at least one first ingredient, for example, juice concentrate <b>30</b> is dispensed into the cavity. An outlet <b>32</b> also communicates with the cavity <b>26</b> and is positioned spaced apart from the inlet <b>28</b>. Concentrate <b>30</b> is introduced through the inlet <b>28</b> for mixing with a second ingredient, for example, water <b>34</b> which is introduced through a second or water delivery inlet <b>38</b>. The concentrate <b>30</b> and water <b>34</b> flow into the chamber <b>26</b> for mixing therein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Water <b>34</b> is introduced into the cavity <b>26</b> by a water delivery inlet <b>38</b>. The inlet <b>38</b> includes a passage <b>40</b> defined in the illustration as a tube which has a dispensing end <b>42</b>. The dispensing end <b>42</b> has at least one opening <b>43</b> through which water is dispensed. The opening <b>43</b> is positioned at or proximate to the dispensing end <b>42</b>. The dispensing end <b>42</b> and at least one opening <b>43</b> are to be broadly interpreted and are not limited to the specific construction shown and described herein. The dispensing end <b>42</b> is positioned in the cavity <b>26</b> generally spaced between the inlet <b>28</b> and the outlet <b>32</b>. Further, in at least one embodiment, the dispensing end <b>42</b> is positioned generally downstream of the inlet <b>28</b> and generally upstream of the outlet <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used throughout, various terms are intended to be broadly interpreted. In this regard, the term &#x201c;concentrate&#x201d; is intended to be broadly interpreted as a second ingredient, which in one embodiment is a concentrate for beverages and other food substances including, by way of example, but not intended to be limited to, juice, tea, coffee, sugar-based beverages, dairy-based beverages, soda-fountain beverages, sports drinks, combinations of any beverages or beverage concentrates, as well as other food substances which might also benefit from the device, system and apparatus for mixing as disclosed herein. Similarly, the term &#x201c;diluent&#x201d; or &#x201c;water&#x201d; is intended to be broadly interpreted as a first ingredient which in one embodiment is water. While the present disclosure uses the term &#x201c;water&#x201d; and &#x201c;diluent&#x201d; generally interchangeably, it is anticipated that a variety of diluent materials may be used to produce a variety of beverage products. For example, diluent may be another ingredient such as another flavor or base ingredient other than water. Further, the diluent could be another form of ingredient such as, liquid gel, gas, ice crystals, or any other substance that is mixed with at least one other substance to produce the desired resultant product.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In at least one embodiment, a chamber <b>50</b> is defined within the cavity <b>26</b>. The chamber <b>50</b> is generally positioned proximate to the inlet <b>28</b> and the dispensing end <b>42</b> of the water inlet <b>38</b>. The chamber <b>50</b> is generally positioned spaced from and generally at least partially in opposition to the dispensing end <b>42</b> of the water inlet <b>38</b>. The chamber <b>50</b> is positioned in any position to receive the first and second ingredients. As such, when water <b>34</b> is dispensed through the water inlet <b>38</b> and out through the end <b>42</b>, water is directed toward the chamber <b>50</b>. Also, the chamber <b>50</b> is generally positioned upstream of the flow out of the chamber <b>50</b> or generally out of the direct flow path of concentrate <b>30</b> flowing through the inlet <b>28</b>. The position of the chamber <b>50</b> relative to the inlet <b>28</b> and dispensing end <b>42</b> results in some volume of concentrate <b>30</b> and water <b>34</b> being pushed or flowed into at least a portion of the chamber <b>50</b> for mixing within at least a portion of the chamber <b>50</b> before it is allowed to flow downstream toward the outlet <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The inlet <b>28</b>, opening <b>43</b> of dispensing end <b>42</b> and the outlet <b>32</b> are shown in general diagrammatic form. For example, the inlet <b>28</b> and outlet <b>32</b> are generally shown as circular or otherwise tubular passages through which fluid can flow. Similarly, opening <b>43</b> of dispensing end <b>42</b> is shown as the reduced diameter tip of the tube at the dispensing end <b>42</b> of the delivery inlet <b>38</b>. Each of these passages or tubes can be configured in any variety of forms to achieve a desired result. The diagrammatic embodiments are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the opening associated with the inlet <b>28</b> and the outlet <b>32</b> may be in a flare outwardly or inwardly to produce a desired flow characteristic. For example, the concentrate entry point may be a reduced diameter relative to the diameter of the corresponding flow path <b>45</b> to change the flow characteristics of the concentrate <b>30</b> introduced into the device. Similarly, the outlet <b>32</b> may include an increased diameter opening in a corresponding tube <b>47</b> so as to facilitate draining, streamlining, columnating or otherwise making the fluid flow exiting the device flow in a predetermined manner, for example more cohesive or less cohesive. It is expected that these variations and other variations which are inspired by the present disclosure are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present configuration of the device <b>20</b> prevents only a direct, gravity-induced fall of concentrate <b>30</b> and water <b>34</b> through the body <b>22</b> to the outlet <b>32</b>. Rather, the flow action of the pressurized water from the dispensing end <b>42</b> directed toward the flow of concentrate <b>30</b> through the inlet <b>38</b> causes a driving or forcing of the water <b>34</b> and concentrate <b>30</b> into the chamber <b>50</b> for mixing. The pressurized water (a first ingredient) impinging on the concentrate (a second ingredient) causes mixing of the two ingredients in a manner not known in the prior art. This general concept applies to this disclosure regardless of the type and characteristics of the two or more ingredients mixed or the structure or orientation of the device used to mix the two or more ingredients. The force of the pressurized water impinging on the concentrate flow will cause the water and concentrate to mix. The chamber <b>50</b> has an end <b>52</b> which does not allow water and concentrate to flow there beyond. The directional flow of pressurized water <b>34</b> from the dispensing end <b>42</b> and the generally positively pressurized flow of concentrate <b>30</b> through the inlet <b>28</b> result in an accumulation of ingredients in the chamber <b>50</b>. While it is mentioned that the flow of concentrate <b>30</b> through the inlet <b>28</b> is generally positively pressurized, it is expected that a gravity flow of concentrate <b>30</b> will also function in this application. The gravity flow also produces some degree of pressurization as a result of the influence of gravity on the concentrate flow and this embodiment is included in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Eventually, the accumulation in the chamber <b>50</b> is a volume which is greater than the volume of the chamber <b>50</b>. This occurs when the pressure in the chamber exceeds the forces associated with the inlet flow of the pressurized water <b>34</b> from the dispensing end <b>42</b> and the inlet flow of the concentrate <b>30</b> through the inlet <b>28</b>. At this point, a mixture <b>54</b> of concentrate and water will tend to flow <b>56</b> away from the chamber <b>50</b> and toward the outlet <b>32</b>. The mixture <b>54</b> will continue to mix as it continues to flow <b>56</b> toward the outlet <b>32</b> whereupon it is dispensed as a generally integrated, homogeneous product, in this case a beverage <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The consistency of the beverage is a result of the physical agitation impact, or collision of the mixture <b>54</b> in the chamber <b>50</b> and flow <b>56</b> through the cavity <b>26</b>. The mixture <b>54</b>, once mixed in the chamber, is generally already homogeneous and fully dissolved, mixed or otherwise is a chemical combination of the at least two ingredients such as water and concentrate. This thorough mixing prevents separation, stratification or other settling or separation of the concentrate and water once it is dispensed from the outlet <b>32</b>. As the volume of the chamber <b>50</b> is finite and water <b>34</b> and concentrate <b>30</b> continue to flow therein, the mixture <b>54</b> will tend to accumulate. The consistency of the beverage <b>36</b> may be, at least in part, due to the dissolution of the concentrate <b>30</b> into the water <b>34</b>. This is in contrast to prior art mixing devices which merely may have combined the ingredients, yet not caused the concentrate <b>30</b> to dissolve, combine or otherwise transform into solution with the water <b>34</b> creating a generally homogeneous beverage <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The homogeneity of the beverage <b>36</b> can be tested by a Brix Scale measurement or Brix measurement. Preliminary tests show that the beverage <b>36</b> dispensed through the outlet <b>32</b> provides a consistent Brix measurement throughout different levels of a beverage volume dispensed into a container. Prior art devices may exhibit noticeably defined changes or variations in Brix measurements at different levels in the same container. In other words, the concentrate and the diluent or water are not thoroughly mixed or integrated. In contrast, the present mixing method and device causes the concentrate <b>30</b> to be thoroughly mixed in the water <b>34</b> creating a generally homogeneous beverage <b>36</b> as measured by the Brix measurements in a standard container. In contrast, the prior art devices dispensing beverage into the same container resulted in a change in the Brix measurement from the bottom of the container toward the top of the container. The variations in the Brix measurement are an indication that the beverage has not been thoroughly mixed and that, at least some portions of concentrate may not have been integrated or dissolved into the solution.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be noted that the various dimensions, shapes, proportions and relationships may be varied to some degree to achieve the same or similar results as generally described and disclosed herein. For example, while the general parameters of an inlet <b>28</b> communicating with the cavity <b>26</b> and an outlet <b>32</b> also communicating with the cavity <b>26</b> can be found in various embodiments, the generally horizontally, or at least partially horizontally, oriented configuration of these components will be used in various embodiments as well. Similarly, it is believed that the configuration of the chamber or holding area <b>50</b> providing a dead-end or cul-du-sac area in which water <b>34</b> and concentrate <b>30</b> collide and impinge upon each other to cause mixing is found in other configurations based on the concepts taught herein.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The flow of water and concentrate into the body <b>22</b> can be accurately controlled for controlled mixing by use of mixing control components <b>51</b>. The mixing control components are to be broadly interpreted but may include, by way of example and not limitation, such components as a controllable inlet valve <b>53</b> on the water line and a controllable inlet valve <b>55</b> on the concentrate line. Further, a flow regulator <b>57</b> may be used on the water inlet line and a flow regulator <b>59</b> may be provided on the concentrate inlet line. The controllable valves <b>53</b>,<b>55</b> may be coupled to a controller <b>61</b> having a control panel, switch or other control device <b>63</b> also coupled to the controller. Additionally, pumping devices <b>71</b>,<b>75</b> or other flow pressurizing or accelerating devices may be coupled to the controller <b>61</b> for further control of the components. These flow control components <b>57</b> help to achieve the required or preferred mix of concentrate and water.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">These components <b>51</b> can be actively controlled to modify the flow and dispensing of water and concentrate into the body <b>22</b>. In this regard, one or more mixture sensors or detectors <b>65</b>, <b>67</b>, <b>69</b> may be positioned in the device or proximate to the device as necessary for detecting one or more of the concentration, Brix, specific gravity, conductivity or other measurable characteristics of the mixture at one or more locations to provide information to the controller <b>61</b>. The sensors provide information which can be used by the controller to modify the operation of the components such as the control valves <b>53</b>,<b>55</b>, pumps or other devices which are controllable and may have an effect on the resultant product <b>36</b>. For example, if the concentration or other characteristics of the mixture as sensed by the sensors indicates that more concentrate is needed, the controllable valve <b>55</b> may be opened to allow more concentrate to flow. Alternatively, the pump <b>71</b> coupled to the controller <b>61</b> may be operated to increase the pumping rate to deliver more concentrate <b>30</b> from the ingredient or concentrate source <b>73</b>. Similarly, the rate of pumping of a pump <b>75</b> communicating with the inlet line and coupled to the controller <b>61</b> may be reduced so as to reduce the quantity of water flowing into the inlet line.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It should be noted that the system as described above may include all of the aforementioned additional components or none of the components. In its simplest embodiment the device <b>20</b> includes the inlet line <b>38</b>, inlet line <b>45</b> and body <b>22</b>. The water inlet line <b>38</b> is a second ingredient source, in this case water, coupled to a pressurized or gravity fed source and the concentrate is coupled to a pressurized or gravity fed source. Desired pressures are provided to produce the desired result. However, more complicated variations may be provided by combining the simplest form with one or more of the aforementioned components. It is also envisioned that other components may be added to various embodiments to provide additional control, sensing, quality or other characteristics of the resultant beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In its simplest form, the device eliminates extra components, parts or structures used for mixing. In the more complicated form the device provides increased control and accuracy of mixing. The resultant beverage is produced consistently and is mixed properly to produce a desired end product.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is anticipated that the general principles are covered hereunder as well as all the other various modifications and variations that can be conceived by one of ordinary skill in the art having been taught the principles herein. For example, the dispensing end <b>42</b> can be a nozzle to provide a defined flow configuration such as in the form of a fan, ring, point or any other dispensing end <b>42</b> and associated opening <b>43</b> or openings configuration. A variety of dispensing ends <b>42</b> may be used to achieve specific results depending on the mixing conditions and the components used in the mixing operation and the ingredients, such as concentrate <b>30</b> and water <b>34</b>, used in the mixing method. The nozzle or dispensing end <b>42</b> generally creates an upstream flow having a flow generally directed into the chamber <b>50</b>. In at least one configuration, the dispensing end or nozzle <b>42</b> is configured to provide a jet action of measurable force. In this embodiment, the flow of the water causes movement of the concentrate <b>30</b> dispensed through the inlet <b>28</b> into the chamber <b>50</b> for subsequent agitation and mixing to form the mixture <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is also envisioned that a variety of configurations of the chamber <b>50</b> are included within the scope of this disclosure. While a generally tubular, rounded, dead-end configuration is provided for the chamber <b>50</b>, it is envisioned that various cross-sections, end <b>52</b> configurations and other features may be incorporated into the chamber <b>50</b> to provide the desired mixing effect depending upon the specific conditions used in the mixing method. Similarly, the configuration of the body <b>22</b> defining the shape, volume and surface features of the cavity <b>26</b> is to be broadly interpreted to include various embodiments. Likewise, the configuration, angular orientation, size, dimension, flow rate and other characteristics associated with the inlet <b>28</b> and the outlet <b>32</b> are envisioned to be broadly interpreted.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Consistent with the broadening of the various terms and characteristics of the present device, method and system, the introduction of water through the inlet <b>38</b> is shown as being positioned towards an end <b>62</b> generally positioned opposite the chamber <b>50</b>. The inlet <b>38</b> could be introduced into the cavity <b>26</b> through the body <b>22</b> at various portions along the wall <b>24</b>. Also, the position of the nozzle <b>42</b> in the cavity <b>26</b> can be adjusted to produce desired mixing results. In this regard, the nozzle <b>42</b> can be positioned upwardly, downwardly or angled towards or angled away from the inlet <b>28</b>. As will be described in greater detail below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an angled nozzle <b>42</b> is disclosed. Additionally, as further disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> and <b>9</b> variations of the external surface of the inlet <b>38</b> and use of multiple and directed nozzles <b>42</b> is disclosed. Also, the relative dimensions of the inlet <b>28</b> and the end of the chamber defined by dimension <b>64</b> may be adjusted to increase or decrease the relative volume of the chamber <b>50</b>. Similarly, the dimension <b>66</b> defined between the inlet <b>28</b> and dispensing end <b>42</b> can be adjusted to produce the desired effect of the water flow <b>68</b> impinging upon the concentrate <b>30</b> to produce the mixture <b>54</b>. Similarly, the dimension <b>70</b> of the outlet flow path <b>56</b> from the dispensing end <b>42</b> to the outlet <b>32</b> may be adjusted to increase the dimension <b>70</b> or decrease the dimension <b>70</b> as might be necessary in different configurations and mixing requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The mixing device of this disclosure can be configured in a cascading arrangement as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this regard, initial mixture <b>54</b> is combined from the inlet water <b>34</b> and concentrate <b>30</b>. In a cascading arrangement the outlet <b>32</b> of one device <b>20</b> becomes the inlet <b>28</b><i>a </i>of a second device <b>20</b><i>a </i>positioned in a series or cascading configuration. In this configuration, the outlet <b>32</b> becomes the inlet <b>28</b><i>a </i>with the beverage mixture <b>36</b> becoming the concentrate <b>30</b><i>a</i>. Additional water <b>34</b><i>a </i>can be introduced to the concentrate <b>30</b><i>a </i>to produce a new mixture <b>54</b><i>a</i>. This can be done several times, if necessary, with water, other mixing ingredients. The system can also be used to introduce components or ingredients having different temperatures to achieve a desired result such as helping to dissolve or otherwise provide a chemical or mechanical advantage in mixing the components or ingredients. Also, another configuration of this embodiment may include a pump <b>80</b> or other device which adds energy to the beverage <b>36</b> from the first device <b>20</b> as it is dispensed to the second device <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The cascading or serial configuration, with or without the pump <b>80</b>, may be useful in situations in which a high density concentrate <b>30</b> may require mixing with water having an elevated temperature to produce a desired beverage or secondary concentrate result. It is envisioned that multiple cascading configurations which might have different characteristics can be used to produce a desired resultant beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present device also includes benefits with regard to concentrates which might include fibrous material. For example, some orange juice and other citrus juice concentrates may include relatively high levels of fibrous content or pulp. In prior art mixing devices, juice concentrate containing fibrous material may accumulate within the mixing device clogging the flow path in the system. In the present device, the surfaces are generally smooth and continuous allowing for easier, more efficient cleaning and sanitizing. In this regard, during a cleaning cycle, cleaning material could be introduced through the inlet <b>28</b> and agitated in the same manner as when diluting a beverage concentrate. In this regard, the water <b>34</b> can be adjusted to a desired flow rate for mixing with sanitizing solution introduced through the inlet <b>28</b>. The mixture then flows through the cavity <b>26</b> cleansing the interior surfaces of the cavity. The cleansing material flows through the outlet <b>32</b> for thorough cleaning of the mixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, the device <b>20</b> can be configured to remove the body <b>22</b> to facilitate cleaning. This can be achieved in any one of many configurations which will allow disengagement of the body <b>22</b> from the dispensing device with which it may be used. If the body <b>22</b> is removable it can be placed into a sanitizing or dishwashing system to sanitize all the appropriate surfaces. Such a configuration may require a removable connection between the inlet passage <b>45</b> and the body <b>22</b> or may include a portion of the tube <b>45</b> and the outlet tube <b>47</b>. It is anticipated that it may be preferable to allow one of the ends <b>52</b>,<b>62</b> to be removable so as to allow water to flush through the tube <b>22</b> defining the body. It is expected that many configurations can be developed which will allow the device to be removed from the machine for cleaning. Such developments might also include quick release connectors between the tube <b>47</b> and the tube <b>45</b>, as well as a quick release between the water line <b>38</b> and the system. Further, it is envisioned that the body <b>22</b> could be separated at some location between the ends <b>52</b>,<b>62</b> to allow each portion to be placed into a cleaning or sanitizing system for thorough cleansing of the corresponding portions of the chamber <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In use, concentrate is introduced through the inlet <b>28</b> and impacted, collided with or otherwise impinged or impacted by pressurized water <b>34</b> flowing from the dispensing end <b>42</b>. The water and concentrate <b>30</b> form a mixture <b>54</b> which backs up in a dead end chamber <b>50</b>. The chamber <b>50</b> is positioned generally upstream from the outlet <b>32</b> and proximate to the inlet with the inlet <b>28</b> being positioned between the dispensing end <b>42</b> and the primary volume of the chamber <b>50</b>. During the mixing method, the system and apparatus cause a volume of mixture <b>54</b> to back up in the chamber <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At a point when the volume and pressure created by the mixture <b>54</b> in the chamber <b>50</b> is greater than the flow rate of the flow path of water <b>68</b> flowing into the chamber <b>50</b>, in combination with the volume and flow pressure of the juice concentrate <b>30</b> flowing therein, the mixture <b>54</b> tends to flow along the flow path <b>56</b> through the cavity <b>26</b>. In this regard, the buildup of mixture <b>54</b> in the chamber <b>50</b> reaches a point where no additional mixture can accumulate in the chamber, the volume of the mixture <b>54</b> exceeds the volume of the chamber <b>50</b>, and the mixture flows against the opposing flow <b>68</b> of water <b>34</b> from the water inlet <b>38</b>. The mixture having the concentrate thoroughly combined in solution with the water flows through the outlet <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is envisioned that the mixing device <b>20</b> as disclosed herein may also be provided as a kit for use with existing machines or to retrofit existing machines. In this kit, the device <b>20</b> can include a connection between the inlet tube <b>38</b> and the existing water line. Additionally, the inlet <b>28</b> can be coupled to an existing concentrate dispensing line. In this manner, the device <b>20</b> can be used with a variety of existing or yet to be designed beverage dispensers. The overall configuration of the device <b>20</b> can be adjusted or modified to accommodate the particular characteristics, inputs and desired outputs of the beverage dispenser.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, another embodiment of the device is disclosed. This embodiment of the device includes at least two water inlets <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>in the form of two tubes extending into the cavity and may include two or more concentrate inlets <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b</i>. It should be noted that various combinations and configurations of multiple water inlets <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b</i>, and a single concentrate inlet as well as a single water inlet and multiple concentrate inlets <b>28</b><i>a</i>, <b>28</b><i>b </i>may be provided. The one or more concentrate streams <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>may be introduced into the chamber <b>50</b> for subsequent mixing with water provided from the water inlets <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b</i>. Of course, the details of the mixing of the concentrate and water is described in detail above. The combination of the water or other diluent with the concentrate occurs in a similar manner if not identical manner as described above except that there will be multiple concentrate streams of the same flavor, multiple flavors or multiple ingredients being introduced. The flow of water from the openings <b>43</b><i>a</i>, <b>43</b><i>b </i>of the dispensing ends <b>42</b><i>a</i>, <b>42</b><i>b </i>is generally non-coaxial.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is envisioned that multiple water inlets <b>38</b><i>a</i>, <b>38</b><i>b </i>may be used to increase the mechanical combination or agitation of the water with a single stream of concentrate. Also it is envisioned that a single water inlet may be used to combine two different flavors or two identical flavors of concentrate flowing in through the multiple inlets <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>. With the foregoing in mind, there may be advantages to introducing smaller streams of identical concentrate flavors from two different directions so as to further result in combination with the dilution water.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is another embodiment of the device as disclosed. This embodiment of the device includes a water inlet <b>38</b><i>c </i>which includes a dispensing end or nozzle <b>42</b><i>c </i>which has been directed at an angle <b>80</b> in relation to a longitudinal axis <b>82</b>. The nozzle <b>42</b><i>c </i>being angled (<b>80</b>) towards an inside surface <b>84</b> of the body <b>22</b>. By having the jet <b>34</b><i>c </i>directed at an angle it deflects against the inside surface <b>84</b> to further enhance the mixing of the concentrate <b>54</b> introduced through the inlet <b>28</b>. Generally, this will enhance the movement of the concentrate and water into the chamber <b>50</b> and improve mixing of the components. Additionally, by deflecting the nozzle <b>42</b><i>c </i>towards the inlet <b>28</b>, a burst of water at the end of the dispensing cycle causes the water to clean the outlet <b>28</b>. The configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides one embodiment of a self cleaning system. This system helps to remove left over juice pulp which might be included in the concentrate dispense from inlet <b>28</b>. The angled deflection of the water jet caused by the angled nozzle <b>42</b><i>c </i>creates increased turbulence to further facilitate mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> show another embodiment of the inlet structure <b>38</b><i>d</i>. The inlet structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> can be substituted for the diagrammatic inlet structure <b>38</b>, <b>38</b><i>c</i>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in FIGURES in <b>5</b>-<b>8</b>, an exterior surface <b>86</b> of the inlet <b>38</b><i>d </i>includes a series of protrusions <b>88</b>. The protrusions as shown are in the form of ribs which are positioned generally spirally about the exterior surface <b>86</b>. While ribs are shown it is intended that a broad interpretation of the protrusions <b>88</b> is included in this disclosure. The pattern of the ribs as shown provides the structures which interrupt or disrupt an otherwise generally smooth flow path along the exterior surface <b>86</b> of the inlet <b>38</b><i>d</i>. Additionally, similar protrusions can be added to the interior surface <b>84</b> of the body <b>22</b>. The function of the protrusions whether on the exterior surface <b>86</b> of the inlet <b>38</b><i>d</i>, interior surface <b>84</b> of the body <b>22</b> or any combination of such structures is to disrupt and increase turbulence in the flow of the mixed concentrate and water as it flows from the chamber <b>50</b> towards the exit <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> and more specifically in the enlarged partial fragmentary view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the inlet <b>38</b><i>d </i>may include multiple openings at the dispensing end <b>43</b>. First opening <b>90</b> and a second opening <b>92</b> may be formed on or near the dispensing end. Such multiple openings may be used to enhance the mixing and turbulence of the water as it is dispensed to mix with the concentrate.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, another embodiment of the inlet <b>38</b><i>e </i>is shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the inlet <b>38</b><i>e </i>includes an opening <b>96</b> in the dispensing end <b>43</b><i>e</i>. The opening <b>96</b> is provided at an angle to provide the angled deflection benefits described herein above. Additionally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a protrusion <b>88</b><i>e </i>is positioned at least partially around a circumferential outer surface <b>86</b> of the inlet <b>38</b><i>e</i>. The circumferential protrusion <b>88</b><i>e </i>or dam is positioned spaced from the opening <b>96</b>. The opening <b>96</b> is angled towards the inlet <b>28</b>. The protrusion <b>88</b><i>e </i>in the form of a barrier or dam prevents bypassing of concentrate from the top side which might otherwise escape mixing in the water stream or jet. This configuration of the inlet <b>38</b><i>e </i>further enhances the mixing of the concentrate and water. A lower portion of the inlet exterior surface <b>86</b> does not include the protrusion <b>88</b><i>e </i>so as to allow mixed concentrate and water to flow away from the chamber <b>50</b>.</p>

The mixing device includes the body <b>22</b> and the inlet <b>38</b>. The inlet <b>38</b> is fitted to the body with a gasket <b>100</b>. An O-ring <b>102</b> is attached to a fitting elbow <b>104</b> which couples to a fitting seat <b>106</b> on the body <b>22</b>.

Water is introduced into a primary chamber <b>122</b> that communicates with a secondary chamber <b>124</b> that communicates with the inlet <b>38</b>. Operation of the controllable valve <b>112</b> opens and closes against a rear portion <b>128</b> of the inlet <b>38</b> by means of moveable stopper <b>130</b>.

None of the structures or devices need to be opened and there is no contact between the concentrate retained within the BIB, tube and mixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a mixing device similar to that as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is provided. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, however, several inlet ports <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are provided. These inlet ports are provided for the dispensing of an additional ingredient to a mixture of at least two ingredients. For example, when at least a first and second ingredient are mixed in the mixing device <b>20</b> to still be added at one or more of the inlet ports <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>. The third ingredient such as a distillate may be added. Additionally, distillate may be added to a second mixing device <b>20</b><i>a </i>which combines the product of the first mixing device <b>20</b> and an additional dilution ingredient <b>34</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">While three different inlet port locations are shown, <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, any number of inlet ports may be used, and any variety of locations may be used. The inlet ports <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> are provided by way of example and not in any way providing a limitation on the specification.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, the inlet ports, <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> may be used to inject or introduce a distillate to a mixture. For example, when a tea concentrate dispensing system tea concentrate <b>30</b> may be introduced into the chamber for mixing with water <b>68</b> to produce a tea product <b>54</b>. However, additional dilution may be required and as such the product <b>54</b> can flow into a second mixing device <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Whereas the first mixing device <b>20</b> may have introduced a heated water or dilution material, the second mixing device <b>20</b><i>a </i>may introduce a cool or unheated water or dilution material. The product of the second mixing chamber <b>54</b><i>a </i>may be the final product or may be the final produce before introduction of a distillate. The distillate provides additional flavor, aroma, and other beverage characteristics which may not be found or may not be as prominently expressed in the concentrate or the dilution materials. As such, such a distillate may enhance the beverage experience. The introduction of the distillate may depend on such conditions such as the temperature of the beverage product or the timing of the beverage product as well as any number of additional conditions. As such, such inlet ports may be needed to be placed at any one or more locations throughout the dispensing process. All of the various locations of the inlet ports <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and any other desired or preferred location is within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
