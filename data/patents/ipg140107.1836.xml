<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to spinal implants, and in particular to vertebral staples and tools for implanting the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Spinal fixation devices are used in orthopedic surgery to align and/or fix a desired relationship between adjacent vertebral bodies. Such devices typically include a spinal fixation element, such as a relatively rigid fixation rod, that is coupled to adjacent vertebrae by attaching the element to various anchoring devices, such as hooks, bolts, wires, or screws. Alternatively, two rods can be disposed on the lateral or anterior surface of the vertebral body in a substantially parallel relationship. The fixation rods can have a predetermined contour that has been designed according to the properties of the target implantation site, and once installed, the rods hold the vertebrae in a desired spatial relationship, either until desired healing or spinal fusion has taken place, or for some longer period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several plate and screw systems have been designed for instrumentation of the spinal column. A typical construct utilizes vertebral staples, spinal screws and locking nuts, and two spinal fixation rods. A staple is implanted in each adjacent vertebra and two screws are inserted through holes formed in the staple such that the screw heads rest against the staple. The spinal fixation rods are then positioned within the screw heads such that the rods are substantially parallel to one another and they span across multiple adjacent vertebrae. The rods are then locked in place using the locking nuts, thereby maintaining the vertebrae in a fixed position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most vertebral staples are used to impair toggling action by the screws implanted therethrough, and they are intended to prevent motion which can cause the screw to bone interface from breaking down. Each vertebral staple typically includes two or more spikes, often placed on each corner of the staple, to secure the staple to a vertebra. The staple is implanted in the vertebra by positioning it against the vertebra and applying a force thereto to impact the staple into the bone.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While current vertebral staples are effective, one drawback is that they do not allow the position of the staple to be adjusted once the staple is implanted in the vertebra. If the staple is not properly aligned, the surgeon is required to remove the staple and re-position it. One other draw back of current vertebral staple designs is that they can be difficult to manipulate using existing insertion tools. In particular, most vertebral staples are not planar, but rather they have uneven surfaces. As a result, it can be difficult to grasp the staple using an insertion tool, and to evenly impact the staple into the vertebra.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there remains a need for an improved vertebral staple that includes features which allow the position of the staple with respect to the vertebra to be adjusted prior to fully implanting the staple. There also remains a need for improved methods and devices for grasping and implanting a vertebral staple.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides implantable vertebral staples and tools for use with the same. In one embodiment, an implantable vertebral staple is provided and it includes a staple body having superior and inferior surfaces and at least two holes extending therethrough, at least one perimeter spike formed on the inferior surface of the staple body, and a central spike preferably formed at a substantial mid-portion of the inferior surface of the staple body. The staple body can have a variety of shapes and sizes, but preferably it has a shape that is adapted to match the contour of an anterior surface of a vertebral body. More preferably, the staple body includes superior and inferior ends with a longitudinal axis extending therebetween, and the staple body is curved about a transverse axis that intersects the longitudinal axis. The staple body can also include two holes formed in substantially diagonally opposed corners of the body opposite to the first and second perimeter spikes.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The spikes formed on the staple body can also have a variety of configurations. In one exemplary embodiment, the central spike has a length that is greater than a length of the perimeter spike(s), and more preferably the difference between the length of the central spike and the length of the perimeter spike(s) is in the range of about 2 mm to 5 mm. The staple body also preferably includes first and second perimeter spikes. While the perimeter spikes can be formed anywhere on the body, in one embodiment the staple body is substantially rectangular in shape and the first and second perimeter spikes are formed adjacent to substantially diagonally opposed corners of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the staple body can include first and second bores formed therethrough for mating with an insertion tool. The first and second bores are preferably formed on opposed sides of the central spike. The plate can also include a mid-portion that is substantially planar, and the first and second bores can be formed in the mid-portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another embodiment, an implantable vertebral staple is provided having a staple body with opposed thru-holes formed therein, a long spike, and at least one short spike. The short spike(s) is adapted to allow rotation of the body when the long spike is partially inserted in bone, and it is adapted to prevent rotation of the body when the long and short spike(s) are fully inserted into bone.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also provides a spinal implant kit that includes a vertebral staple having a plurality of spikes formed thereon and adapted to be implanted in bone, and an inserter tool that is adapted to removably engage the vertebral staple. At least one of the spikes on the staple preferably has a length that is greater than a length of the remaining spikes such that the vertebral staple is freely rotatable when the vertebral staple is partially inserted into bone. In an exemplary embodiment, the inserter tool includes a staple-engaging member that is adapted to removably engage the staple. More preferably, the staple-engaging member has first and second opposed grasping arms that are movable between an extended position and a retracted in which the arms are effective to engage the staple. The arms can optionally be biased to the extended position and they can be moved toward one another in the retracted position. Each arm can optionally include a hook-member formed on a distal end thereof and adapted to engage the staple. The present invention also provides a drill guide that is removably matable to the inserter tool such that at least one lumen extending through the drill guide is aligned with at least one hole formed in the staple.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other aspects of the invention, an inserter tool for use with a vertebral staple is provided having an elongate shaft with a proximal handle and a distal end, and a staple-engaging member that is coupled to the elongate shaft and that is movable between an extended position and a retracted position in which the opposed grasping arms are adapted to engage the vertebral staple. In an exemplary embodiment, the staple-engaging member extends through an inner lumen extending through the elongate shaft, and the distal end of the elongate shaft includes a housing that is adapted to receive at least a portion of the grasping arms on the staple-engaging member. The inserter tool can also include an actuating mechanism formed therein and adapted to move the staple-engaging member between the retracted and extended positions. The actuating mechanism can be, for example, a rotatable member that is mated to the staple-engaging member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The inserter tool can also optionally include a drill guide that is removably matable to the elongate shaft and that has at least one lumen extending therethrough for receiving a tool. In an exemplary embodiment, the drill guide includes a cavity formed therein for receiving the housing. The drill guide and/or the housing can also optionally include a mating element formed thereon to allow the components to be removably mated to one another. In one exemplary embodiment, the mating element is a T-shaped member formed on the housing and a corresponding T-slot formed within the guide for removably receiving the T-shaped member on the housing of the inserter tool.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention also provides a method for implanting a spinal staple that includes the steps of partially inserting a long spike formed on a staple into a vertebra, rotating the staple about the long spike to position at least one hole formed in the staple relative to the vertebra, and fully inserting the central spike into the vertebra such that one or more short spikes on the staple extend into the vertebra to prevent rotation of the staple relative to the vertebra. An inserter tool can optionally be used to facilitate insertion of the staple into a vertebra.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention provides implantable vertebral staples and tools for use with the same. In general, an exemplary vertebral staple according to the present invention includes a staple body having at least one long spike formed thereon for allowing rotation of the body when the long spike is partially inserted in bone. The staple body can also include one or more short spikes formed thereon and adapted to prevent rotation of the body when the long and short spikes are fully inserted into bone. The present invention also provides an inserter tool that can be used to implant a vertebral staple, and also a drill guide that can be used, preferably in combination with the inserter tool, to guide tools through one or more holes formed in a vertebral staple.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref> illustrate one exemplary embodiment of a vertebral staple <b>10</b>. As shown, the staple <b>10</b> includes a staple body <b>12</b> having opposed first and second ends <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, opposed transverse sides <b>12</b><i>c</i>, <b>12</b><i>d</i>, and opposed superior and inferior surfaces <b>12</b><i>e</i>, <b>12</b><i>f</i>. The shape, size, and configuration of the body <b>12</b> can vary depending on the intended use, but preferably the body <b>12</b>, or at least the inferior surface <b>12</b><i>f </i>of the body <b>12</b>, has a shape and size that is adapted to be positioned against a vertebra in a patient's spine. In an exemplary embodiment, as shown, the body <b>12</b> is curved about a transverse axis T that extends between the opposed transverse sides <b>12</b><i>c</i>, <b>12</b><i>d</i>, and that extends in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis L extending between the opposed first and second ends <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>12</b>. The curvature is preferably adapted to conform to the shape of a surface of a vertebral body, such as an anterior surface, preferably for use in an anterior surgical approach. In some embodiment, the curvature can be adapted to conform to the shape of a lateral face of a vertebral body for use in an anterio-lateral approach. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the body <b>12</b> can have virtually any shape and size, and that the shape and size can vary depending on the intended implant location.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The body <b>12</b> of the vertebral staple <b>10</b> can also include one or more thru-holes formed therein for receiving spinal screws or other spinal implants. In the illustrated embodiment, two holes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> are formed in diagonally opposed corners of the body <b>12</b> such that the first hole <b>14</b> is formed adjacent to the first end <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the first transverse side <b>12</b><i>c </i>and the second hold <b>16</b> is formed adjacent to the second end <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the second transverse side <b>12</b><i>d</i>. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the number of holes as well as the position of the holes can vary. The shape and size of the thru-holes can also vary and the holes can include features known in the art to facilitate insertion of a spinal screw or other implant therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The body <b>12</b> of the staple <b>10</b> can also include one or more spikes formed on the inferior surface <b>12</b><i>f </i>thereof and adapted to extend into bone to affix the staple <b>10</b> to the bone. In an exemplary embodiment, at least one of the spikes is configured to allow the body <b>12</b> to rotate freely when the spike is partially inserted into bone. Once the staple is properly positioned, the spike can be fully inserted into bone, thereby causing one or more additional spikes on the body <b>12</b> to extend into the bone to prevent rotation of the staple <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the body <b>12</b> includes a central spike <b>18</b> formed at a substantial mid-portion thereof, and one more additional spikes, and preferably two additional spikes referred to as the first and second perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, formed adjacent to the ends <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>and sides <b>12</b><i>c</i>, <b>12</b><i>d </i>of the body <b>12</b>. The central spike <b>18</b> preferably has a length l<sub>18 </sub>that is greater than a length l<sub>20</sub>, l<sub>22 </sub>of the first and second perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. Such a configuration allows the central spike <b>18</b> to be inserted in bone to allow the body <b>12</b> to rotate thereabout without interference from the perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>. The difference in length l<sub>18</sub>, l<sub>20</sub>, l<sub>22 </sub>between the central spike <b>18</b> and the perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> should thus be sufficient to allow at least a portion of the central spike <b>18</b> to be inserted into bone without the perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> coming into contact with the bone. While the length l<sub>18</sub>, l<sub>20</sub>, l<sub>22 </sub>of each spike <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can vary, in an exemplary embodiment the difference between the length l<sub>18 </sub>of the central spike <b>18</b> and the length l<sub>20</sub>, l<sub>20 </sub>of each perimeter spike <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> is in the range of about 2 mm to 5 mm. This difference preferably remains the same for surgical staples <b>10</b> have various sizes and various spike lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The location of each spike <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can also vary. In particular, while central spike <b>18</b> is shown at a substantial center-point of the body <b>12</b>, the spike <b>18</b> can be positioned anywhere on the body <b>12</b>. Likewise, the perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can also be formed anywhere on the body <b>12</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are formed in diagonally opposed corners of the body <b>12</b> such that the first perimeter spike <b>20</b> is positioned adjacent the first end <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the second side <b>12</b><i>d</i>, and the second perimeter spike <b>22</b> is positioned adjacent the second end <b>12</b><i>b </i>and the first side <b>12</b><i>c</i>. The perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are also positioned on opposed sides of the longitudinal and transverse axes L, T relative to the thru-holes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> formed in the body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The shape of each spike <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can also vary, but the spikes <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> should be adapted to extend into bone. In an exemplary embodiment, the central spike <b>18</b> has a generally elongate cylindrical shape with a pointed distal tip <b>18</b><i>a </i>that is configured to penetrate into bone. The cylindrical shape facilitates rotation of the body <b>12</b> about the central spike <b>18</b>. The perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can also have a substantially cylindrical shape, but as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> have a substantially triangular-shaped cross-section such that each spike <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> includes three sides extending there along. The spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can also include a beveled tip <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>a</i>, as shown, to facilitate penetration of the spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> into bone.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As indicated above, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the location, quantity, shape, and size of the spikes on the body <b>12</b> can vary depending on the intended use, as well as the shape and size of the body <b>12</b> itself. The drawings are merely illustrative of an exemplary embodiment of a vertebral staple <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In use, the staple <b>10</b> can be positioned at a desired implant site, preferably adjacent to a vertebral body, and a force can be applied to the body <b>12</b> to at least partially impact the central spike <b>18</b> into the vertebra. The staple <b>10</b> can then be rotated to position the thru-holes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> in the body <b>12</b> at a desired location for screw placement therethrough, and once properly positioned an additional force can be applied to the body <b>12</b> to fully impact the central spike <b>18</b> into the vertebra, thereby impacting the perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> into the vertebra. As a result, the perimeter spikes <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> will prevent the body <b>12</b> from rotating with respect to the vertebra, thereby securely implanting the surgical staple <b>10</b>. The vertebral staple <b>10</b> can thereafter be used to protect the vertebra, provide enhanced stability, and/or to prevent pullout of one or more spinal screws or other spinal implants inserted through the one or more thru-holes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> formed in the body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present invention also provides an inserter tool <b>100</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref>, that can be used to manipulate and implant the vertebral staple <b>10</b>. While the inserter tool <b>100</b> can have various configurations, it is preferably adapted to grasp and removably engage a portion of a staple such that the tool <b>100</b> can be used to position the staple against bone. The tool <b>100</b> can also receive the force that is necessary to impact the staple into bone, and it can optionally include features to facilitate preparation of the bone for receipt of one or more spinal screws or other implants.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref>, the inserter tool <b>100</b> generally includes an elongate shaft <b>102</b> having a proximal end <b>102</b><i>a </i>and a distal end <b>102</b><i>b</i>. The proximal end <b>102</b><i>a </i>can include a handle <b>104</b> formed thereon or mated thereto, and the distal end <b>102</b><i>b </i>is preferably effective to grasp and removably engage a vertebral staple, such as staple <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>. In an exemplary embodiment, a staple-engaging member <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) is disposed through a lumen in the elongate shaft <b>102</b> and it is movable between an extended position in which opposed grasping arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> formed on the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> extend from the distal end <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the elongate shaft <b>102</b>, and a retracted position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in which the opposed grasping alms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are at least partially retracted into the elongate shaft <b>102</b> and they are adapted to engage a vertebral staple. The inserter tool <b>100</b> can also include an actuating mechanism, such as rotating knob <b>114</b>, that is effective to move the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> between the extended and retracted positions, thereby allowing the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> to selectively grasp and release a staple.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The elongate shaft <b>102</b> can have a variety of shapes of sizes, but, as noted above, it preferably includes a handle <b>104</b> that is formed on or mated to a proximal end <b>102</b><i>a </i>thereof. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the handle <b>104</b> is threadably matable to the shaft <b>102</b> and it is effective to allow a user to grasp and manipulate the tool <b>100</b>. The handle <b>104</b> also includes a lumen extending therethrough for receiving a proximal end <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> to allow the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> to couple to an actuating mechanism, as will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The distal end <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the elongate shaft <b>102</b> preferably includes a housing <b>112</b>, shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, that is effective to receive the opposed grasping arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> of the staple-engaging member <b>106</b>. The housing <b>112</b> can have virtually any shape and size, but it should be adapted to receive the opposed grasping arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> and to cause the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> to move toward one another to engage a vertebral staple. The housing <b>112</b> can also be configured to mate with a drill guide, which will be discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Moreover, the housing <b>112</b> can include features such as a window <b>113</b> formed therein to facilitate visual access to a vertebral staple mated to the inserter tool <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The staple-engaging member <b>106</b> can also have a variety of configurations, but in an exemplary embodiment it is in the form of an elongate shaft having a proximal end <b>106</b><i>a </i>that is configured to mate to an actuating mechanism, such as rotatable knob <b>114</b>, and a distal end <b>106</b><i>b </i>that is configured to engage a staple. As indicated above, the distal end <b>106</b><i>b </i>can include first and second opposed arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> for grasping a staple. The arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> can vary in shape and size, but they are preferably effective to move toward one another when the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> is retracted into the housing <b>112</b> formed on the distal end of the elongate shaft <b>102</b>, and they are effective to move apart from one another to engage a staple when the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> is extended from the housing <b>112</b> formed on the distal end of the elongate shaft <b>102</b>. As shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> can be spaced a distance apart from one another in their original state, and they can each include an enlarged or angled portion <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>a </i>formed on an end thereof. In other words, the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> increase in width in a distal direction. The angled portion <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>a </i>allows the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> to be moved toward one another when the angled portion <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>a </i>is retracted into the housing <b>112</b>, as the housing <b>112</b> will preferably have an inner width w<sub>h </sub>that is less than a width w<sub>a </sub>of the angled portions <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>a</i>. When the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> is returned to the extended state, the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> will preferably return to their original spaced-apart condition, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. The arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> can optionally be biased to the open, extended position such that the housing <b>112</b> applies a force to the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> sufficient to overcome the biasing force when the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are retracted into the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each arm <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> can also include an engagement mechanism formed thereon for engaging a vertebral staple. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, each arm <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> includes a hook <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> formed on a distal-most end thereof. The hooks <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> are preferably adapted to extend into corresponding bores formed in a vertebral staple to engage the staple. Preferably, the hooks <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> extend toward one another such that, when the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> is in the extended position and the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are spaced apart, the hooks <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> can be inserted through adjacent bores formed in a vertebral staple, or they can be positioned adjacent opposed edges of a staple. Conversely, when the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are moved to the retracted position, the hooks <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> move toward one another to engage the staple. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that the hooks <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> can extend away from one another such that the arms <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are effective to engage a staple when the arms are in the extended position. Moreover, a variety of other techniques can be used to engage the staple, including a sliding connection, a threaded connection, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As noted above, the inserter tool <b>100</b> can also include an actuating mechanism that is effective to move the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> between the extended and retracted positions. While various actuating mechanisms can be used, in an exemplary embodiment a knob <b>114</b> is threadably mated to a distal end <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> such that rotation of the knob <b>114</b> in a first direction is effective to move the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> proximally with respect to the elongate shaft <b>102</b> into the retracted position, and rotation of the knob <b>114</b> in a second opposite direction is effective to move the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> distally with respect to the elongate shaft <b>102</b> into the extended position. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of techniques can be used to move the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> between the extended and retracted positions.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In use, the inserter tool <b>100</b> can be configured to engage virtually any portion of a vertebra staple. However, in an exemplary embodiment, the inserter tool <b>100</b> is preferably configured to engage a substantial mid-portion of a staple. Referring to the staple <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, the staple <b>10</b> is preferably substantially planar along the transverse axis T to facilitate engagement of the staple <b>10</b> by the inserter tool <b>100</b>. The staple <b>10</b> can also include one or more bores formed therein for receiving the hooks <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>. While the bores can be formed anywhere on the staple <b>10</b>, in an exemplary embodiment the staple <b>10</b> includes first and second bores <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> formed on opposed sides of the central spike <b>18</b> along the transverse axis T of the staple <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the inserter tool <b>100</b> can be configured for use with a drill guide that is adapted to allow one or more tools to be inserted therethrough in alignment with one or more holes formed in a staple, such as holes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> formed in staple <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a drill guide <b>200</b> for use with the present invention. While the drill guide <b>200</b> is described in connection with staple <b>10</b>, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the drill guide <b>200</b> can be used with a variety of staples. As shown, the drill guide <b>200</b> is in the form of a generally elongate housing having opposed proximal and distal ends <b>200</b><i>a</i>, <b>200</b><i>b</i>. The housing can have virtually any shape, but as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the housing has a generally rectangular or square shape, preferably with rounded edges extending between the proximal and distal ends <b>200</b><i>a</i>, <b>200</b><i>b</i>. The distal end <b>200</b><i>a </i>of the drill guide <b>200</b> is adapted to be positioned against the superior surface <b>12</b><i>e </i>of the staple <b>10</b>, thus the distal end <b>200</b><i>a </i>preferably has a shape that is adapted to match the shape of the superior surface <b>12</b><i>e </i>of the staple <b>10</b>. In particular, the distal end <b>200</b><i>a </i>of the drill guide <b>200</b> is preferably substantially concave such that is conforms to the curved shape of the staple <b>10</b>. The shape can, of course, vary depending on the particular shape and configuration of the staple used in connection with the drill guide <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The drill guide <b>200</b> also includes at least one lumen extending therethrough for receiving a tool. While the guide <b>200</b> can include any number of lumens, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates four lumens <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> extending through the guide <b>200</b> between proximal and distal ends <b>200</b><i>a</i>, <b>200</b><i>b </i>thereof. The lumens <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are preferably positioned to align with one or more holes, such as holes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, formed in the staple <b>10</b>. The lumens <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> can also extend at a particular angle through the housing to serve as a trajectory guide for a tool being inserted therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In use, the drill guide <b>200</b> is preferably adapted to removably attach to inserter tool <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the guide <b>200</b> and/or the inserter tool <b>100</b> can include one or more mating elements formed thereon to facilitate mating of the two devices <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. While virtually any mating technique can be used, in an exemplary embodiment the drill guide <b>200</b> is configured to slidably receive the housing <b>112</b> on the distal end <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the elongate shaft <b>102</b>. More particularly, the drill guide <b>200</b> can include a central opening or cavity <b>210</b> formed therein and extending therethrough for seating the housing <b>112</b>. The cavity <b>210</b> should have a shape that conforms to the contour of the housing <b>112</b> to allow the housing <b>112</b> to be received therein. The cavity <b>210</b> can also include a T-shaped slot <b>212</b> formed therein and configured to receive a T-shaped member <b>115</b> formed on the housing <b>112</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>. An engagement mechanism can optionally be provided to prevent the drill guide <b>200</b> from becoming disengaged with the inserter tool <b>100</b>. By way of non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a leaf spring <b>214</b> that is disposed within the cavity <b>210</b> in the drill guide <b>200</b> and that is effective to be receive within a corresponding detent <b>117</b> formed in the housing <b>112</b>. In use, the leaf spring <b>214</b> extends into and engages the detent <b>117</b> when the drill guide <b>200</b> is fully inserted over the inserter tool <b>100</b>. The biasing connection can simply be overcome by pulling the two components <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> apart from one another. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of other techniques can be used to removably mate the drill guide <b>200</b> to the inserter tool <b>100</b>, and that the illustrated T-connection and leaf spring are merely one exemplary technique.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the inserter tool <b>100</b> and drill guide <b>200</b> coupled to staple <b>10</b>. As shown, the staple <b>10</b> is engaged by the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> of the inserter tool <b>100</b>, and the drill guide <b>100</b> is passed over the inserter tool <b>100</b> such that the housing <b>112</b> on the distal end <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the elongate shaft <b>102</b> is received within the cavity <b>210</b> formed in the drill guide <b>100</b>. Lumens <b>202</b> and <b>208</b> in the drill guide <b>100</b> are thus aligned with holes <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> in the staple, thereby allowing one or more tools to be inserted through the lumens <b>202</b>, <b>208</b> and the holes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> to prepare the vertebra. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an awl <b>300</b> is passed through lumen <b>202</b> in the drill guide <b>200</b> and through hole <b>14</b> in the staple <b>10</b>. Once the vertebra is prepared, the staple <b>10</b> can be released from the inserter tool <b>100</b> by rotating the actuating knob <b>114</b> to move the staple-engaging member <b>106</b> to the extended position, and then one or more screws can be inserted through the holes <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> in the staple <b>10</b> to implant them in the vertebra. The screws can optionally be inserted through the drill guide <b>200</b> prior to removing the inserter tool <b>100</b> and drill guide <b>200</b> from the staple <b>10</b>.</p>
