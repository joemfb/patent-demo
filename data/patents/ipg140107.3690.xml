<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuous in part (CIP) application of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/554,281, entitled &#x201c;Wide Viewing Angle Indicators for Network Devices&#x201d;, filed on Sep. 4, 2009, hereby incorporated into the present application by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application contains subject matter that may be related to the subject matter in U.S. application Ser. No. 13/330,313 entitled: &#x201c;METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DISPLAYING SYSTEM STATUS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF VIEWING ANGLE&#x201d;, filed on Dec. 19, 2011.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A high-speed network environment typically includes network devices such as routers and switches used for facilitating delivery of information packets and/or data traffic from source devices to destination devices via communication networks such as IP and/or packet-based networks. Information pertaining to the transfer of data packet(s) and/or frame(s) through the network(s) is usually embedded within the packet and/or frame itself. Each packet, for instance, traveling through multiple nodes via one or more communication networks such as Internet and/or Ethernet can typically be handled independently from other packets in a packet stream or traffic. Each node which may include routing, switching, and/or bridging engines processes incoming packet(s) or frame(s) and determines where the packet(s) or frame(s) should be forwarded.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical modern local area network (&#x201c;LAN&#x201d;) includes various types of networks such as a home area network (&#x201c;HAN&#x201d;), a residential LAN, and/or a network gateway used for connecting multiple network devices within an enclosure like a building or home. Devices can be computers, printers, Internet connections, servers, televisions, gaming units, and the like. With increasing popularity of home networking and triple play services (voice, video and data), high-speed computing network devices for handling information such as IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) are in demand. A network switch for HAN, for example, can operate over existing wiring, such as coax cables or power lines, for transmitting network information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With increasing capabilities of a typical network device, managing and monitoring network performance have become increasingly difficult. A problem associated with a typical network device is limited viewing and/or monitoring performance of functional icons on the device. For example, current LED indicators are typically shown on one vertical surface by illuminating a functional icon which has limited viewing angle. When a user moves toward the device (router or switch), the viewing angle of the illuminated icon becomes acute and the icons are difficult to observe.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A device and method for improving performance monitoring capabilities using wide view angle indicators are disclosed. A device includes a network device, a multimedia device, a handheld device, a gaming device, and the like. A network device capable of providing data transmission includes a first plate, an OTST (or second) plate, and a light source. The first plate is situated at a first side of the network device wherein the first side can be the front side of device. The OTST plate is situated at a second side of the network device and positioned substantially perpendicular to the first plate, wherein the OTST plate having a first surface and a second surface further includes status indicators showing performance status associated with the network device. The light source, in one embodiment, can be an LED device capable of projecting a column of light beam with a predefined angle onto the first surface of OTST plate illuminating one or more status indicators. At least one status indicator is viewable from the second surface or bottom surface of OTST second plate when at least a portion of OTST plate is illuminated.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Base plate <b>1110</b>, in one aspect, is fabricated with optical transparent and/or semitransparent (OTST) material capable of transmitting optical light. For example, base plate <b>1110</b> may be fabricated by glass, plastic, polymer, resin, fiberglass, epoxy, or a combination of glass, plastic, polymer, resin, fiberglass, epoxy. Status indicators <b>1104</b>, in one embodiment, can be molded, inscribed, and/or printed on a surface of edge lip <b>1111</b>. The surface can be either the top surface or bottom surface of edge lip <b>1111</b>. Alternatively, status indicators <b>1104</b> can be inscribed or embedded inside of edge lip <b>1111</b>. The inscribed words and/or symbols representing status indicators <b>1104</b> are configured to be viewable from a distance with a wide range of angle when the inscribed symbol(s) or word(s) are illuminated. Note that OTST base plate <b>1110</b> is designed to transmit light from light source <b>1106</b> to edge lip <b>1111</b> with minimal optical degradation.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">For an UV light application, base plate <b>1110</b>, in one aspect, includes multiple sub-layers wherein each sub-layer containing various status indicators is configured to respond to a specific UV light or a particular range of UV wavelengths. For instance, when an UV light with a first specific wavelength illuminates a first set of status indicators printed by first kind of UV ink, and a second UV light with a second specific wavelength illuminates another set of status indicators printed by second kind of UV ink. Note that specific UV ink is designed to be illuminated when the UV ink is shone by a specific corresponding UV light. As such, depending on the status of network system, a particular UV light may be selectively generated to illuminate a particular set of status indicators in a sub-layer of base plate <b>1110</b>. Note that one or more molded-in or inscribed status indicators <b>1104</b> on the base plate <b>1110</b>, in one instance, become visible when they are illuminated by a light generated by one or more light sources <b>1106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">PCB <b>1102</b> is used to house various components and/or integrated circuits (&#x201c;ICs&#x201d;) including multiple light sources <b>1106</b> and light guides <b>1108</b>. Light sources <b>1106</b> include an array of lighting elements which, for example, can be LEDs. Each lighting element of light sources <b>1106</b>, in one aspect, may be designated to a corresponding status indicator on edge lip <b>1111</b>. Note that every status indicator indicates a particular status associated with network device <b>1002</b>. PCB <b>1102</b> may include other networking components such as transmitter(s), receiver(s), power management, memory, wireless and LAN transceivers, routing controller(s), packet processor(s), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Light guides <b>1108</b> are used to provide light passages, conduits, channels, and/or paths allowing light beams to travel from light sources <b>1106</b> to edge lip <b>1111</b> via one or more medium with minimal optical degradation. Each light guide, in one embodiment, is designated or corresponded to one light source and one status indicator. Alternatively, a light guide is responsible for guiding multiple light beams generated by several LEDs such as UV light sources to illuminate one or more status indicators. In one example, one end of light guide couples to a light source while another end of light guide couples to light diffuser <b>508</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). While optically coupled to a light source, a light guide conveys light beam(s) emitted from light source <b>1106</b> to light diffuser <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At light diffuser <b>508</b>, a portion of light beam <b>1160</b>, for example, exits from light diffuser <b>508</b> with an angle and subsequently travels through air before it hits the top surface of base plate <b>1110</b>. Another portion of light beam <b>1166</b> travels from a light source to light diffuser <b>508</b> and then from light diffuser <b>508</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>) to the bottom surface of base plate <b>1110</b> via a prism <b>1152</b>. To minimize optical loss or degradation, the size and/or configuration of each light guide can be adjusted to provide proper internal optical reflections to maximize optical transmission with minimal optical loss.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one operation, upon detecting a performance condition associated with network device <b>1002</b>, a light source corresponding to the performance condition is selected to emit a light beam traveling through a corresponding light guide <b>1108</b> to illuminate a corresponding status indicator <b>1104</b> on edge lip <b>1111</b>. For example, when network device <b>1002</b> is transmitting data at a rate of 2.4 GHz (Gigahertz), a corresponding status indicator labeling &#x201c;2.4 GHz&#x201d; may be illuminated. Illumination of a status indicator can be achieved by projecting or shining a light beam onto an inscribed symbol or word(s). For an UV application, an UV light beam is selected to illuminate an UV inked icon representing the status indicator such as 2.4 GHz.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Overlaying graphics <b>1158</b>, in one example, is a plane having various status symbols, indicators, or icons showing real-time status of network device <b>1002</b>. The status symbols indicate similar information as status indicators on edge lip <b>1111</b>. Each symbol or icon represents a corresponding performance status of network device <b>1002</b>. Vertical viewing surface <b>504</b>, which for example can be a clear plane, is placed outside of overlaying graphics <b>1158</b> as front plate of network device <b>1002</b>. In one aspect, status symbols printed on overlaying graphics <b>1158</b> become visible when they are illuminated by one or more light sources. Since the information or status displayed on overlaying graphics <b>1158</b> is similar to status indicators <b>1104</b> printed or inked on base plate <b>1110</b>, both overlaying graphics <b>1158</b> and status indicator <b>1104</b>, for example, may be illuminated and/or displayed simultaneously to increase viewing angle.</p>

One side of prism <b>1152</b> touches light diffuser <b>508</b> and another side of prism <b>1152</b> contacts base plate <b>1110</b>. A function of prism <b>1152</b> is to transmit a light beam from light diffuser <b>508</b> to base plate <b>1110</b> or edge lip <b>1111</b>. Prism <b>1152</b>, in one embodiment, is fabricated by optical transparent material similar to light diffuser <b>508</b> and/or base plate <b>1110</b>. In one embodiment, prism <b>1152</b>, light diffuser <b>508</b>, and base plate <b>1110</b> are fabricated as one piece structure.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Depending on the applications, light guide <b>1108</b> can be configured to guide the light beam(s) to a specific area of edge lip <b>1111</b>. For example, if status indicators <b>1104</b> are located at the bottom surface of edge lip <b>1111</b>, light guide <b>1108</b> is configured to guide a light beam such as light beam <b>1166</b> to pass through light diffuser <b>508</b> and prism <b>1152</b> before it reaches to the bottom surface of edge lip <b>1111</b>. Note that when light beam <b>1166</b> passes through the bottom surface of edge lip <b>1111</b>, status indicators <b>1104</b> are illuminated. Alternatively, if the status indicators are located on the top surface of edge lip <b>1111</b>, light guide <b>1108</b> is adjusted to guide a light beam <b>1160</b> to pass through diffuser <b>508</b> and medium of air before light beam <b>1160</b> hits the top surface of edge lip <b>1111</b>. When light beam <b>1160</b> arrives at the top surface of edge lip <b>1111</b>, status indicators located on the top surface of edge lip <b>1111</b> are illuminated.</p>

For example, light beam <b>1202</b> travels to prism <b>1152</b> via conduit <b>1108</b> and subsequently, is deflected onto inscribed indicator <b>1104</b> via a surface of prism <b>1152</b>. Light beam <b>1204</b> arrives at back surface <b>1220</b> after it is reflected from conduit <b>1108</b>.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">It should be noted that, besides UV ink and light source, other types of electromagnetic-wave-sensitive inks and sources can be used for displaying performance status using similar approach as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, illustrates a status display using UV light with multiple sub-layers of UV inked icons in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Diagram <b>1600</b> is a cross-section diagram illustrating a network device having a multi-layered base plate with a wide viewing angle for displaying performance status. Diagram <b>1600</b> include a light source <b>1106</b>, a light guide <b>1108</b> a light diffuser <b>508</b> with optical prism <b>1152</b> and a multi-layered base plate <b>1610</b>. Base plate <b>1610</b> includes multiple sub-layers <b>1610</b><i>a</i>-<b>1610</b><i>c </i>wherein each sub-layer may include one or more status indicators inked by one type of UV ink.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In one embodiment, each sub-layer is printed with multiple UV inked icons indicating system status wherein different UV inks are used for different sub-layers. Each type of UV ink is configured to response to one type of UV light. As such, different UV light illuminates different groups of UV inked icons situated in different sub-layers. For example, UV inked icons <b>1604</b><i>a </i>are configured to be illuminated by a first type of UV light, and UV inked icons <b>1604</b><i>b </i>are configured to be illuminated by a second type of UV light. Since one type of UV light affects one type of UV inked icons situated in one sub-layer, UV inked icons can be printed one on top of another in different sub-layers to conserve the space. Depending on the status, appropriate UV light is selected to illuminate a specific set of UV inked icons.</p>
