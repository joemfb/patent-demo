<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An imaging apparatus, including an optical system forming an image of an optical image of an object; an imaging element imaging the optical image and producing image data at a frame frequency Ffs out of a frame frequency Ffr of NTSC system; a frame memory storing the image data; and a controller progressively writing the image data in the frame memory and interlacedly reading out the image data from the frame memory at the frame frequency Ffr of NTSC system. The frame memory is divided into at least three areas comprising a writing-in area and a read-out area, wherein the controller sequentially switches the areas of the frame memory and progressively writes one frame of image data in each area and interlacedly reads out one frame of image data from each area in sequence.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an imaging apparatus such as a car-mounted camera, and more particularly to an imaging apparatus using the NTSC system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To accommodate display devices using the NTSC system, car-mounted cameras typically take images at 30 fps with an imaging element such as a CMOS sensor. However, when a car-mounted camera takes an image of a display device such as an on-street LED traffic signal, the following problem occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The LED traffic signal is driven by a drive voltage coming from a full-wave rectified commercial AC source. Therefore, the signal blinks on and off in an extremely short time cycle that is not visually recognizable. Thus, in a frame, when a charge accumulation time of the imaging element and a light-out period of the signal overlap, the signal appears to be out in the frame even though a red, blue or green light is actually on. When multiple such frames continue, dozens of image frames in each of which a signal in a light-out state is imaged are produced. This is a particularly serious problem for a drive recorder. The drive recorder records images taken by the car-mounted camera, and is widely used to analyze accidents. The true state of the signal when an accident occurs is important in determining liability for the accident.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the problem, Japanese published unexamined application No. 2009-181339 (JP-2009-181339-A) discloses a method of offsetting a frame frequency of the imaging element by a predetermined frequency relative to a frame frequency of the NTSC system to set a frame frequency (offset frame frequency). When an LED signal is imaged, dozens of image frames in each of which a signal in a light-up or a light-out state is imaged are not produced. However, the frame frequency of an image signal is out of the frame frequency of the NTSC system, and cannot be displayed in a display device of the NTSC system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve this problem, it is conceivable that image data taken from the imaging element be stored in a frame memory at a frame frequency (offset frame frequency) taken out of the frame frequency of the NTSC system, and read out from the frame memory at the frame frequency of the NTSC system to be produced in the display device. However, the following fresh problem then occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The image data is typically read out from the imaging element by a progressive method, whereas the display device of the NTSC system uses an interlace method. Therefore, a time for writing one frame of image data in the frame memory and a time for reading out one frame of image data from the frame memory differ from each other, and a comb noise specific to the interlace method is made even when the frame memory is a double buffer. The comb noise is a pectinate image shift generated in a frame image formed of an odd-number field and an even-number field of a different frame.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For these reasons, a need exists for an imaging apparatus less susceptible to a blink cycle of lighting devices such as LED traffic signals, is capable of using display devices using the NTSC system, and can prevent occurrence of comb noise.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an imaging apparatus less susceptible to a blink cycle of lighting devices such as LED traffic signals, capable of using display devices using the NTSC system, and preventing occurrence of comb noise.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to provide a low-cost imaging apparatus capable of reading out image data from an imaging element at a frame frequency out of a frame frequency of the NTSC system using a simple configuration.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention provides an imaging apparatus less susceptible to a blink cycle of lighting devices such as LED traffic signals, capable of using display devices using the NTSC system, and preventing occurrence of comb noise. In addition, the present invention provides a low-cost imaging apparatus capable of reading out image data from an imaging element at a frame frequency out of a frame frequency of the NTSC system using a simple configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Particularly, the present invention relates to an imaging apparatus, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">an optical system configured to form an optical image of an object;</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">an imaging element configured to image the optical image and produce image data at a frame frequency Ffs out of a frame frequency Ffr of NTSC system;</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">a frame memory configured to store the image data; and</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">a controller configured to progressively write the image data in the frame memory and interlacedly read out the image data from the frame memory at the frame frequency Ffr of NTSC system,</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">wherein the frame memory is divided into at least three areas comprising a writing-in area and a read-out area, and</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">wherein the controller sequentially switches the areas of the frame memory and progressively writes one frame of image data in each area and interlacedly reads out one frame of image data from each area in sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be explained, referring to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a whole configuration diagram of an embodiment (Embodiment 1) of the imaging apparatus of the present invention. The imaging apparatus includes an optical system <b>101</b>, an imaging element <b>102</b>, a processor <b>103</b>, an NTSC encoder <b>104</b>, a CPU <b>108</b> controlling the all operations, etc. The processor <b>103</b> includes a frame memory <b>105</b>, a controller <b>106</b> and an oscillator <b>107</b>. The NTSC encoder <b>104</b> is connected with a display device and an image recorder of the NTSC system, but they are omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The oscillator <b>107</b> is a crystal element generating a clock signal having a frequency of 13.5 MHz for the NTSC system. The oscillator <b>107</b> gives a clock (CK) to the controller <b>106</b>, the NTSC encoder <b>104</b>, and further to the imaging element <b>102</b> as well in the processor <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The imaging element <b>102</b> receives a clock having a frequency of 13.5 MHz for the NTSC system from the oscillator <b>107</b>, progressively reads out image data imaged through the optical system <b>101</b> at a frame frequency Ffs, e.g., 27 FPS which is offset by a predetermined off set frequency relative to a frame frequency Ffr (about 30 FPS) of the NTSC system, and transmits the image data to the processor <b>103</b>. Specifically, the imaging element <b>102</b> has a register (sensor register) and changes a blanking period in a vertical direction or a blanking period in a horizontal direction according to a parameter value set by the CPU <b>108</b> in the register such that the frame frequency of image data becomes Ffs, e.g., 27 FPS. The imaging element <b>102</b> transmits a frame synchronizing signal Sv of the frame frequency Ffs to the processor <b>103</b> as well as the image data.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The image data produced from the imaging element <b>102</b> is progressively written in the frame memory <b>105</b> in the processor <b>103</b> in sequence at a timing of the frame frequency Ffs, e.g., 27 FPS. The image data written in the frame memory <b>105</b> is interlacedly read out in sequence at a timing of the frame frequency Ffr (about 30 FPS) of the NTSC system under control of the controller <b>106</b>. The controller <b>106</b> designates a read-out address relative to the frame memory <b>105</b> and controls the read-out timing of the frame memory <b>105</b> based on the frame synchronizing signal Sv from the imaging element <b>102</b>. In addition, the controller <b>106</b> receives a clock having a frequency of 13.5 MHz for the NTSC system from the oscillator <b>107</b> and controls the interlaced read-out at a timing of the frame frequency Ffr of THE NTSC system. The configuration of the controller <b>106</b> will be mentioned later.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The image data read out from the frame memory <b>105</b> is subjected to a digital-analog conversion by the NTSC encoder <b>104</b> to be converted into an image signal of the NTSC system, and which is transmitted to a display device or a recorder (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, image data are taken from the imaging element <b>102</b> at a frame frequency which is offset by a predetermined offset frequency relative to a frame frequency Ffr of the NTSC system, written in the frame memory <b>105</b> (progressive), and read out at the frame frequency Ffr of the NTSC system (interleave) from the frame memory. Therefore, an imaging apparatus less susceptible to a blink cycle of lighting devices such as LED traffic signals, capable of using display devices using the NTSC system can be provided. Methods of preventing comb noise will be mentioned later.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The imaging element <b>102</b> receives a clock (CK) having a frequency for the NTSC system from the oscillator <b>107</b> mounted in the processor <b>103</b>, and produces image data having a frame frequency Ffs out of a frame frequency Ffr of the NTSC system. Therefore, an additional oscillator for the frame frequency Ffs is not needed, and a low-cost imaging apparatus can be provided. Hereinafter, this will be explained in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are diagrams showing a conventional relation between an output signal from an imaging element and a read-out signal from a frame memory. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is an output signal (progressive) from an imaging element, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a read-out signal (interlace) from a frame memory. Namely, conventionally, an output signal from an imaging element and a read-out signal from a frame memory have the same blanking period in a vertical direction in accordance with the NTSC system. Therefore, in order to make image data produced from the imaging element have a frame frequency Ffs which is out of a frame frequency Ffr of the NTSC system, besides an oscillator (13.5 MHz) generating a clock signal for the NTSC system to read out image data from a frame memory, an oscillator having a different clock frequency (such as 12.2 MHz) is needed to read out image data from an imaging element. The present invention does not need such an oscillator.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are diagrams showing a relation between an output signal from an imaging element and a read-out signal from a frame memory of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is an output signal (progressive) from an imaging element, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a read-out signal (interlace) from a frame memory. The read-out signal from the frame memory is the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Meanwhile, a blanking period in a vertical direction of the output signal from the imaging element is changed. Namely, image data from an imaging element <b>102</b> and a frame memory <b>105</b> are read out with a same clock (13.5 MHz) from an oscillator <b>107</b> generating a clock signal for the NTSC system. Then, a blanking period in a vertical direction of reading out image data l from the imaging element <b>102</b> is changed to make the image data produced from the imaging element <b>102</b> have a frame frequency Ffs which is out of a frame frequency Ffr of the NTSC system. As mentioned before, the imaging element <b>102</b> has a register (sensor register) and changes the blanking period in a vertical direction in accordance with a parameter value set in the register by a CPU <b>108</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, Ffs is smaller than Ffr, but Ffs may be larger than Ffr by changing the parameter value in the register. The CPU <b>108</b> sequentially changes the parameter value in the register to make frame frequencies adjacent to each other inconstant and average them so that the frame frequency Ffr of the NTSC system can drive an imaging element as mentioned later.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a blanking period in a vertical direction of reading out of image data from the imaging element <b>102</b> is changed. A blanking period in a horizontal direction or blanking periods in both of the vertical direction and the horizontal direction may be changed such that the image data from the imaging element <b>102</b> has a frame frequency Ffs which is out of a frame frequency Ffr of the NTSC system.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, the structural operation of the controller <b>106</b> will be explained. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a detailed configuration of the controller <b>106</b>. The controller <b>106</b> includes a trigger creator <b>201</b> initiating reading out frame memory, a vertical and horizontal synchronizing signal creator <b>202</b> for output and an address creator <b>203</b>. The address creator <b>203</b> may include a coordinate calculator <b>204</b> for distortion correction and viewpoint conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The trigger creator <b>201</b> initiating reading out frame memory receives a vertical synchronizing signal Sv from the imaging element <b>102</b>, and operates as follows right after power-on of the imaging apparatus. The imaging element <b>102</b> is supposed to progressively readout. One Sv is passed on right after power-on of the imaging apparatus, and the second Sv asserts (effects) a trigger (Tr) initiating reading out frame memory.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Thus, when the frame memory <b>105</b> has no image data, image data cannot be read out from the frame memory <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The vertical and horizontal synchronizing signal creator <b>202</b> for output creates a vertical synchronizing signal and a horizontal synchronizing signal such that image read-out from the frame memory <b>105</b> has a frame frequency Ffr (about 30 FPS) with a clock having a clock frequency (13.5 MHz) of the NTSC system from the oscillator <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The address creator <b>203</b> sequentially designates read-out address of the frame memory <b>105</b> based on a clock (CK) from the oscillator <b>107</b> and the vertical synchronizing signal and the horizontal synchronizing signal from the vertical and horizontal synchronizing signal creator <b>202</b> for output, and reads out image data written in the frame memory <b>105</b> at a timing of a frame frequency Ffr (about 30 FPS) of the NTSC system. The address creator <b>203</b> does not sequentially designate read-out address of the frame memory <b>105</b>, and may include a coordinate calculator <b>204</b> designating in accordance with a coordinate conversion rule, e.g., distortion correction, viewpoint conversion such as bird's-eye view, center cutout conversion, side cutout conversion and triple mirror conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are diagrams showing a process image of the coordinate calculator <b>204</b>. This shows an example producing a rotationally-deformed image at an angle of 90&#xb0; of image data (input image) from the imaging element. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a positional relation between two pixels on the coordinate before and after converted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a positional relation between the correspondent pixels on an input image and an output image memorized in the frame memory <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The coordinate calculator <b>204</b> calculates a read-out address such that pixel data of a coordinate (x1, y1) on the input image are readout as pixel data of a coordinate (X1, Y1) on the output image when reading out image data from the frame memory <b>105</b>. In addition, the coordinate calculator <b>204</b> calculates a read-out address such that pixel data of a coordinate (x2, y2) on the input image are read out as pixel data of a coordinate (X2, Y2) on the output image. Based on this read-out address, image data are read out from a correspondent address of the frame memory <b>105</b> to form a rotationally-deformed image at an angle of 90&#xb0; of input image as an output image.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Similarly, a fisheye view is deformed to correct image distortion thereof, and image deformation based on viewpoint conversion can form an image seen from directly above. In back monitor monitoring back of a car, an easily viewable image for a driver can be displayed. Various configurations and process algorisms of the coordinate calculator <b>204</b> are conventionally known, and detailed explanations thereof are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, improvement of a blink cycle of an illuminator such as LED traffic signals when image data are read out from the imaging element <b>102</b> at a frame frequency which is offset by a predetermined offset frequency (offset frame frequency) Ffs relative to a frame frequency Ffr of the NTSC system will be specifically explained.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, a frame sampling cycle is a constant cycle out of the NTSC system.

The address creator <b>203</b> has a state machine <b>1100</b>, an address calculator <b>1101</b> and RAM/IF<b>1102</b>. The address calculator <b>1101</b> combines the coordinate calculator <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Sv is a frame synchronizing signal in accordance with the frame frequency Ffs from the imaging element <b>102</b>. Vv is a frame synchronizing signal in accordance with the frame frequency Ffr of the NYSC system, and is created by the horizontal synchronizing signal creator <b>202</b> for output.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Receiving Sv, RAM/IF<b>1102</b> sequentially designates a writing address o_calram_a and produces a o_calram_xwe=00. Receiving Vv, RAM/IF<b>1102</b> sequentially designates a writing address o_calram<sub>13 </sub>a and produces a=01. o_calram_xwe is a write enable signal (negative logic).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The state machine <b>1100</b> operates (transits) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, (<i>a</i>) is a transition when writing in and (<i>b</i>) is a transition when reading out. In (<i>b</i>), a continuous line represents a write-in completion of the next read-out area (hereinafter referred to as a write-in completion signal 1), and a dotted line represents a write-in completion of the next next read-out area (hereinafter referred to as a write-in completion signal 2).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">WRITE transits to the following status with a rise of Sv. Otherwise, it writes data in the following address. For example, in a status B (writing in the area B), it transits to a status A (writing in the area A) with a rise of Sv. An output o_write becomes 00 to 01. Without a rise of Sv, in the status B, it writes data in an address following the area B.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">READ transits to the following status if a write-in completion signal asserts when Vv rises. Otherwise, it reads out data from the following address. Having read out all the data, it returns to the first address in the area to sequentially read out data. For example, in a status B (reading out from the area B), it transits to a status A (reading out from the area A) if a write-in completion signal 1 asserts and a write-in completion signal 2 negates when Vv rises. An output o_read becomes 00 to 01. When Vv rises or does not rise, if the write-in completion signal negates, for example, in the status B, it reads out data from an address following the area B. Having read out all the data in the area B, it returns to the first address in the area B to sequentially read out data. In addition, for example, in a status B (reading out from the area B), if the write-in completion signal 1 asserts and the write-in completion signal 2 negates as well when Vv rises, it transits to a status C (reading out from the area C). An output o_read becomes 00 to 10.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The address calculator <b>1101</b> operates according to the Table of Truth Value in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. It receives i_write and i_read from the state machine <b>1100</b>, and i_addr and i_xwe from the RAM/IF<b>1102</b>. i_write shows which area to write in, i_read shows which area to read out from, i_addr is an address of memory, and i_xwe designates write-in/read-out to the memory. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows, according to an area i_write and i_read designate, i_addr is arranged to designate an address of the frame memory <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a whole configuration diagram of another embodiment (Embodiment 2) of the imaging apparatus of the present invention. The imaging apparatus includes an optical system <b>101</b>, an imaging element <b>102</b>, a processor <b>103</b>, an NTSC encoder <b>104</b>, a CPU <b>108</b> controlling the all operations, etc. The processor <b>103</b> includes a frame memory <b>105</b>, a controller <b>106</b>, an oscillator <b>107</b> and a PLL <b>109</b>. The NTSC encoder <b>104</b> is connected with a display device and an image recorder of the NTSC system, but they are omitted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The oscillator <b>107</b> is a crystal element generating a clock signal for the NTSC system. The PLL <b>109</b> produces a clock frequency CK (13.5 MHz) for the NTSC system as it is when receiving it from the oscillator <b>107</b>, and at the same time, and forms a clock frequency CK&#x2032; out of the clock frequency CK (13.5 MHz) for the NTSC system. A chip including the controller includes the PLL <b>109</b> as well, and new components are not needed and the configuration if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> can be realized without consideration of the cost and a space for a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The clock frequency CK (13.5 MHz) for the NTSC system from the PLL <b>109</b> is given to the controller <b>106</b> in the processor <b>103</b> and the NTSC encoder as well. The clock frequency CK&#x2032; out of the clock frequency CK for the NTSC system is given to the imaging element <b>102</b>. The smaller the clock frequency, the more effective to EMC. Therefore, the clock frequency CK&#x2032; is preferably lower than the clock frequency CK. For example, CK&#x2032; has a frequency of 12.65625 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The imaging element <b>102</b> receives the clock frequency CK&#x2032; out of the clock frequency CK for the NTSC system from the PLL <b>109</b> and converts it into an n-times frequency with a PLL (not shown) in the imaging element <b>102</b>. Hereinafter, the frequency after converted is a sensor output clock frequency. For example, when n is 2, the sensor output clock frequency is 25.3125 MHz. Compared the sensor output clock frequency 25.3125 MHz of this embodiment with an ordinary sensor output clock frequency 27 MHz of the NTSC, the sensor output clock frequency 25.3125 MHz of this embodiment is lower and effective to EMC. In addition, the sensor output clock frequency not having a common divisor or a common multiple of the ordinary sensor output clock frequency 27 MHz of the NTSC is effective to EMC as well. The imaging element <b>102</b> progressively reads out image data imaged through the optical system <b>101</b> at the frame frequency Ffs, e.g., 27 FPS which is offset by a predetermined offset frequency relative to the frame frequency Ffr (about 30 FPS) of the NTSC system, and transmits the image data to the processor <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As mentioned in Embodiment 1, the imaging element <b>102</b> has a register (sensor register) and changes a blanking period in a vertical direction or a blanking period in a horizontal direction according to a parameter value set by the CPU <b>108</b> in the register such that the frame frequency of image data becomes Ffs, e.g., 27 FPS. The imaging element <b>102</b> transmits a frame synchronizing signal Sv of the frame frequency Ffs to the processor <b>103</b> as well as the image data. The operation of the processor <b>103</b> is same as that of Embodiment 1 and an explanation thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">This application claims priority and contains subject matter related to Japanese Patent Applications Nos. 2009-282989, 2010-203581 and 2009-273776 filed on Dec. 14, 2009, Sep. 10, 2010 and Dec. 1, 2009, respectively, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
