<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No.2010-276838, filed on Dec. 13, 2010; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments described herein relate generally to a liquid ejection apparatus, a drive circuit thereof, and a drive method thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A liquid ejection apparatus used in an inkjet printer or, namely, an inkjet head includes: a plurality of pressure chambers to which ink as a liquid is introduced; a plurality of electrostatic capacitive loads such as piezoelectric elements which apply pressures for introducing and ejecting the ink; a plurality of electrodes for applying a drive voltage to the piezoelectric elements; a nozzle plate (also referred to as an orifice plate) comprising nozzles for ejecting the ink, at positions respectively corresponding to the pressure chambers; and a mask plate which protects the nozzle plate. Electrostatic capacitive actuators are respectively constructed by the piezoelectric elements and the electrodes. The mask plate is grounded in order to release static electricity generated by contact with recording media.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the mask plate is connected to the ground, a great potential difference appears between the electrodes in the pressure chambers and the mask plate. When aqueous ink is used, the potential difference causes electrolysis of moisture in the ink in the pressure chambers, and produces foreign substances such as air bubbles and condensate in the ink or dissolves or corrodes the electrodes. When foreign substances are produced, flow of ink from the pressure chambers to the nozzles is hindered, and at worst, the nozzles clog due to the foreign substances and disable ejection of ink. Further, the potential difference may change the quality of the ink.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In general, according to one embodiment, a liquid ejection apparatus includes: a pressure chamber; an actuator which is operated by electric charging/discharging and applies pressures for introducing and ejecting a liquid to the pressure chamber; and a drive circuit which outputs a direct current voltage having positive and negative potentials relative to a ground potential interposed therebetween, as a drive voltage for charging/discharging to/from the actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Description of First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Hereinafter, the first embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an overall configuration of an inkjet head as a liquid ejection apparatus, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a state in which a nozzle plate of the inkjet head is detached.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A plate-type piezoelectric material <b>2</b> is provided, embedded in an end edge of an upper surface of a base <b>1</b> made of a piezoelectric material. Side surfaces of the piezoelectric material <b>2</b> respectively form the same planes as side surfaces of the base <b>1</b>. Another plate-type piezoelectric material <b>2</b> is provided, embedded in an end edge of a lower surface of the base <b>1</b>. Side surfaces of the latter piezoelectric material <b>2</b> also respectively form the same planes as the side surfaces of the base <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A nozzle plate (also referred to as an orifice plate) <b>3</b> is provided on end surfaces of the piezoelectric materials <b>2</b> and a side surface of the base <b>1</b>. The nozzle plate <b>3</b> comprises a plurality of nozzles <b>4</b> for ejecting ink (or for ejecting a liquid), which are arranged along the piezoelectric material <b>2</b> in the upper surface side of the base <b>1</b>, and a plurality of nozzles <b>4</b> for ejecting ink, which are arranged along the piezoelectric material <b>2</b> in the lower surface side of the base <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A plurality of notches <b>11</b> are formed at positions corresponding to the nozzles <b>4</b> in a part where one side surface of the piezoelectric material <b>2</b> in the upper surface side of the base <b>1</b> and one side surface of the base <b>1</b> overlap each other. From the notches <b>11</b> to the upper surface of the piezoelectric material <b>2</b>, groove-type pressure chambers <b>12</b> are formed.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The discharging causes the actuators C<b>01</b> and C<b>12</b> to recover the stationary state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, the direct current voltage &#xb1;Vaa (=2&#xb7;Vaa=20 V) is supplied as a drive voltage for charging/discharging to/from the actuators C<b>01</b> and C<b>12</b>. In this manner, a potential difference caused between each electrode <b>14</b> and the mask plate <b>10</b> can be reduced to half of the drive voltage &#xb1;Vaa. That is, a potential difference which is caused when the drive voltage is a positive potential is Vaa (=10 V) which is half the drive voltage &#xb1;Vaa (=10 V). A potential difference which is caused when the drive voltage is a negative potential is also Vaa (=10 V) which is half the drive voltage &#xb1;Vaa.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Since the potential difference caused between each electrode <b>14</b> and the mask plate <b>10</b> can be reduced to half the drive voltage &#xb1;Vaa, problems of causing electrolysis of moisture in ink in the pressure chambers <b>12</b> can be prevented. Since electrolysis can thus be prevented, problems of producing foreign substances such as air bubbles and condensate and of dissolving or corroding the electrodes <b>14</b> can be prevented. The potential difference described above which is not large can prevent the ink from changing in quality. Accordingly, the problem of the nozzles <b>4</b> clogging with foreign substances can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Although only the potential difference is reduced, the amplitude of the drive voltage &#xb1;Vaa is not reduced. Therefore, the actuators C<b>01</b> and C<b>12</b> can be driven at a sufficient speed. Accordingly, an ink ejection speed can be sufficiently increased, and highly viscous ink can be steadily ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Even if a pin hole should appear in the insulating film <b>15</b> formed to cover the electrodes <b>14</b>, the potential difference between each electrode <b>14</b> and the mask plate <b>10</b> is not so large, and current leakage from the pin hole can be therefore suppressed to a minimum. This suppression hinders the occurrence of electrolysis as described above and problems associated with the electrolysis. Accordingly, a lifetime of the inkjet head improves.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, an average value of the drive voltage between when ink is ejected and when the ink is waiting (in the stationary state) can be substantially 0 V.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In Act <b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the MOS transistors P<b>00</b>, P<b>02</b>, and N<b>21</b> turn on.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">This charging in Acts <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> causes the actuators C<b>01</b> and C<b>12</b> to deform in a direction to be away from each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.
