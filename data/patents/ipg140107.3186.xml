<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from an application earlier filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on the 5 Apr. 2010 and there duly assigned Serial No. 10-2010-0030921.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An aspect of the present invention relates to a display device including a thin film transistor and a capacitor where ions can be implanted without requiring a separate mask, and a method of manufacturing the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As demands on various types of display devices have recently been increased with the development of information society, studies on flat panel display devices such as a liquid crystal display device (LCD), a plasma display panel (PDP), a field emission display device (FED), an electrophoretic display device (EPD) and an organic light emitting display device (OLED) have been actively conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The LCD is a flat panel display device using electrical-optical properties of liquid crystals, and is classified into a passive matrix type and an active matrix type. The active matrix type has a superior resolution and ability of implementing moving images over that of the passive matrix type. Hence, the active matrix type is frequently used.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An active matrix type LCD includes a transistor for driving a unit pixel and a capacitor, and the transistor and the capacitor are provided with an active layer and a lower electrode, respectively. Ions are implanted into the active layer of the transistor and the lower electrode of the capacitor, and an ion implanting process is separately performed with respect to the transistor and the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since the ion implantation process is performed with respect to only the lower electrode of the capacitor separately from the ion implantation process of the transistor, the number of masks and processes needed for ion implantation are significant. This increase in masks and process steps due to ion implantation results in an increase in the cost to manufacture the display device and a decrease in manufacturing yield.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In embodiments, there is provided a display device capable of reducing manufacturing cost and simplifying processes.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In embodiments, there is provided a method of manufacturing the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a display device including a substrate having a pixel region, a transistor region and a capacitor region, a transistor arranged within the transistor region of the substrate and a capacitor arranged within the capacitor region of the substrate, wherein the capacitor includes a lower electrode arranged on the substrate, a gate insulating layer arranged on the lower electrode and an upper electrode arranged on the gate insulating layer and overlapping the lower electrode, the upper electrode includes a first conductive layer and a second conductive layer arranged on the first conductive layer, wherein the first conductive layer is opaque.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The lower electrode of the capacitor may include of a silicon layer doped with impurity ions, the silicon layer being one of amorphous silicon or poly-silicon. The first conductive layer of the upper electrode may include an impurity. The transistor may include a gate electrode that includes a second conductive layer arranged on a first conductive layer, the first conductive layer comprising an impurity and a concentration of the impurity within the first conductive layer of the gate electrode may be lower than that of the concentration of the impurity within the first conductive layer of the lower electrode. The first conductive layer of the upper electrode may have a thickness of about 200 to 700 &#x212b;. The first conductive layer of the upper electrode may include one of chrome and molybdenum. The second conductive layer of the upper electrode may be arranged on at least a portion of the first conductive layer. The one portion may be an edge portion.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Display Device</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view of a display device according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a display device of a twisted nematic (TN) mode, a vertical alignment (VA) mode or the like is implemented as an example. For convenience of illustration, a substrate on which one sub-pixel including a transistor and a capacitor is defined will be shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, embodiments of the present invention may be used for all kinds of display devices including an organic light emitting display device and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the display device according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a substrate <b>10</b> defined by a pixel region P, a transistor region T and a capacitor region C, and a thin film transistor (TFT) and a capacitor Cst positioned on the substrate <b>10</b> in the transistor region T and the capacitor region Cst respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The TFT includes an active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>formed on the substrate <b>10</b>, a gate insulating layer <b>16</b> formed on the active layer <b>14</b><i>a</i>, a gate electrode <b>19</b>, a source electrode <b>24</b><i>a </i>and a drain electrode <b>24</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>forms a conductive channel between the source and drain electrodes <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>and applies a voltage supplied to the source electrode <b>24</b><i>a </i>to the drain electrode <b>24</b><i>b </i>when a gate signal is supplied to the gate electrode <b>19</b>. To this end, the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>includes a source region <b>15</b><i>a </i>doped with impurities and connected to the source electrode <b>24</b><i>a </i>and a drain region <b>15</b><i>b </i>doped with impurities and connected to the drain electrode <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>includes amorphous silicon or poly-silicon, and is positioned on the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The gate electrode <b>19</b> is positioned on the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>with the gate insulating layer <b>16</b> interposed therebetween. The gate electrode <b>19</b> is electrically connected to a gate line (not shown), and receives a gate signal from the gate line. The gate electrode <b>19</b> has a stacked structure of first and second conductive layers <b>18</b><i>t </i>and <b>20</b><i>t</i>. The gate electrode <b>19</b> is made out of the same material and resides on a same layer as an upper electrode <b>21</b> of the capacitor Cst.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The source and drain electrodes <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>are positioned on an interlayer insulating layer <b>22</b> formed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b> having the gate electrode <b>19</b> formed thereon. The source electrode <b>24</b><i>a </i>is connected to the source region <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>exposed through one opening of the interlayer insulating layer <b>22</b>, and the drain electrode <b>24</b><i>b </i>is connected to the drain region <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>exposed through another opening of the interlayer insulating layer <b>22</b>. One of the drain electrode <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the source electrode <b>24</b><i>a </i>are electrically connected to an electrode <b>28</b> formed in the pixel region P.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the display device according to the embodiment of the present invention is a liquid crystal display device, the electrode <b>28</b> is used as an electrode to apply a voltage to liquid crystals (not shown). On the other hand, when the display device according to the embodiment of the present invention is an organic light emitting display device, the electrode <b>28</b> is used as an anode or cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The capacitor Cst is formed so that a lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>and the upper electrode <b>21</b> overlap each other with the gate insulating layer <b>16</b> interposed therebetween. At this time, the gate insulating layer <b>16</b> is used as a dielectric. The lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the capacitor Cst is formed by implanting impurity ions into a semiconductor such as amorphous silicon or poly-silicon, allowing the display device to be driven at a low voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The upper electrode <b>21</b> of the capacitor Cst has a stacked structure of first and second conductive layers <b>18</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>is made out of an opaque conductive material. For example, the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>may be made out of chrome (Cr) or molybdenum (Mo).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, when the upper electrode <b>21</b> of the capacitor Cst is formed, an opaque conductive layer with low resistance rather than a transparent conductive layer with high resistance is used, allowing the upper electrode <b>21</b> of the capacitor Cst to be simultaneously formed with the gate line (not shown). Also, the opaque conductive material with low resistance of the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>provides a lower entire resistance of the upper electrode <b>21</b>. Thus, the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>formed on the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>is below about 200 &#x212b;, the resistance of the upper electrode <b>21</b> is not sufficiently lowered. When the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>is over about 700 &#x212b;, it is not easy to perform impurity ion implantation through the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c</i>. Therefore, in this embodiment, the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>is formed to a thickness of about 200 to 700 &#x212b; so that impurity ions can be easily implanted into the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>through the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Here, the impurity ion implantation is performed by passing ions through the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>of upper electrode <b>21</b>, and as a result, some of these impurities may remain in the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>of upper electrode <b>21</b>. In contrast, very few impurities contained within impurity doping region <b>15</b><i>c </i>of lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>are present in the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>t </i>of gate electrode <b>19</b> of transistor region T. This is because the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>t </i>included in the gate electrode <b>19</b> serves as an ion implantation mask.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">On the other hand, a greater portion of impurities contained within impurity doping region <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>exists within the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>of the upper electrode <b>21</b>. This is because the impurities are implanted into the impurity doping region <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>by passing through the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">That is, if the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>t </i>of the gate electrode <b>19</b> has impurities with a first concentration, the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>of the upper electrode <b>21</b> may contain impurities with a second and greater concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>of the upper electrode <b>21</b> is positioned on at least a portion of the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c</i>. As an example, the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>of the upper electrode <b>21</b> may be positioned on one edge of the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c</i>. As another example, the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>of the upper electrode <b>21</b> may be positioned on opposite edges of the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c</i>. Unlike the transistor region T, the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>of the upper electrode <b>21</b> of capacitor region C is not positioned above the impurity doping region <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>of the upper electrode <b>21</b> is made out of the same metal or alloy as the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>t </i>of the gate electrode <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Meanwhile, the display device according to the embodiment of the present invention may further include a buffer layer <b>12</b> formed on the substrate <b>10</b> so as to prevent etching damage, and a passivation layer <b>26</b> for protecting the TFT and the capacitor Cst.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Method of Manufacturing Display Device</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, a method of manufacturing a display device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2I</figref>. Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2I</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2I</figref> are sectional views illustrating a method of manufacturing the display device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a substrate <b>10</b> is provided and having a transistor region T, a capacitor region C and a pixel region P. An active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>is formed in a transistor region T of a substrate <b>10</b> and a material for lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>is formed in the capacitor region C. Before the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>are completed, a buffer layer <b>12</b> for etching prevention may be further formed on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>in the transistor region T and the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>in the capacitor region C are formed by depositing amorphous silicon or poly-silicon on the entire surface of the substrate <b>10</b> and then patterning it through a photolithography process using a first mask. If necessary, a crystallization process may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a gate insulating layer <b>16</b> is formed on the entire surface including the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Subsequently, first and second conductive layers <b>18</b><i>t</i>/<b>18</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>t</i>/<b>20</b><i>c </i>are sequentially formed on the gate insulating layer <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The gate insulating layer <b>16</b> may be made out of silicon oxide, silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride. The first conductive layers <b>18</b><i>t</i>/<b>18</b><i>c </i>are made out of an opaque conductive layer with low resistance so as to be used in a gate line (not shown). The second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>t</i>/<b>20</b><i>c </i>are made out of a metal such as tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), Molybdenum (Mo), silver (Ag), tantalum (Ta), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), gold (Au), chrome (Cr), niobium (Nb), or an alloy thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the first and second conductive layers <b>18</b><i>t</i>/<b>18</b><i>c </i>and <b>20</b><i>t</i>/<b>20</b><i>c </i>are patterned through a photolithography process using a second mask to produce gate electrode <b>19</b> in the transistor region T and upper electrode <b>21</b> in the capacitor region C.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment, when the upper electrode <b>21</b> of a capacitor Cst is formed, an opaque conductive layer with low resistance is used rather than a transparent conductive layer such as ITO for the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c</i>, so that the upper electrode of the capacitor Cst can be produced simultaneously with the gate line (not shown). That is, it is possible to fundamentally solve the problem of signal delay generated when ITO is used. Also, the opaque conductive layer with low resistance is used as the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c</i>, so that the entire resistance of the upper electrode <b>21</b> can be lowered. Thus, the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>formed on the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>can be decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>is below about 200 &#x212b;, the resistance of the upper electrode <b>21</b> is not sufficiently lowered. When the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>is over about 700 &#x212b;, it is not possible to perform impurity ion implantation in a subsequent process through the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c</i>. Therefore the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>is formed to a thickness of about 200 to 700 &#x212b; so that the impurity ion implantation can be easily performed into the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>through the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The gate electrode <b>19</b> is formed to overlap with a center region of the active layer <b>14</b><i>a</i>. At this time, first impurity ions are implanted into opposite edges of the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>using the gate electrode <b>19</b> as a mask, thereby forming source and drain regions <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, an interlayer insulating layer <b>22</b> is formed on the substrate <b>10</b> on which the gate electrode <b>19</b> and the upper electrode <b>21</b> are formed. Subsequently, the interlayer insulating layer <b>22</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>16</b> are patterned through a photolithography process using a third mask, thereby forming first openings <b>22</b><i>a </i>through which the source and drain regions <b>15</b><i>a </i>and <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>are exposed, respectively. Simultaneously, the interlayer insulating layer <b>22</b> in the capacitor region C is patterned through the photolithography process using the third mask, thereby forming a second opening <b>22</b><i>b </i>through which the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, a third conductive layer <b>24</b> is formed on the patterned interlayer insulating layer <b>22</b> to fill the first and second openings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>. A metal or a metal alloy may be used as the third conductive layer <b>24</b>, such as molybdenum (Mo) or molybdenum tungsten (MoW).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, third conductive layer <b>24</b> is patterned to produce source and drain electrodes <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>in transistor region T simultaneous with third opening <b>22</b><i>c </i>in capacitor region C. Third opening <b>22</b><i>c </i>is formed to expose the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>of the upper electrode <b>21</b> by etching away not only third conductive layer <b>24</b> in capacitor region C, but also etching second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Specifically, the third conductive layer <b>24</b> is patterned through a photolithography process using a fourth mask, thereby forming the source electrode <b>24</b><i>a </i>connected to the source region <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>through one of the first openings <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>24</b><i>b </i>connected to the drain region <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the active layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>through another of the first openings <b>22</b><i>a</i>. At this time, a portion of the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>in the capacitor region C is removed using the fourth mask, thereby forming the third opening <b>22</b><i>c </i>through which the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>of the upper electrode <b>21</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, second impurity ions are implanted into the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>through the exposed first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>in the capacitor region C, thereby forming an impurity doping region <b>15</b><i>c</i>. The impurity ions are implanted into the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>by passing through the exposed first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>and the gate insulating layer <b>16</b>. Hence, ion implantation energy is necessarily controlled to have sufficient conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The impurity ions are implanted into the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>through the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>made out of an opaque conductive material. However, since the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>is formed to a thickness of about 200 to 700 &#x212b;, there is no difficulty in the impurity implantation process. In this embodiment, the ion-implanted amorphous silicon or poly-silicon is used as the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the capacitor Cst, so that the display device can be driven at a low voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, a passivation layer <b>26</b> is formed on the substrate <b>10</b> on which the source and drain electrodes <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>are formed, and a fourth opening <b>26</b><i>a </i>is then formed through a photolithography process using a fifth mask. The source electrode <b>24</b><i>a </i>is exposed through the fourth opening <b>26</b><i>a</i>. The passivation layer <b>26</b> may be made out of an inorganic insulating layer such as the gate insulating layer <b>16</b> or an organic insulating layer such as acryl by a technique such as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), spin coating, spinless coating and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>, a fourth conductive layer is formed, and an electrode <b>28</b> is then produced in the pixel region P through a photolithography process using a sixth mask. The electrode <b>28</b> is electrically connected to one of the source and drain electrodes <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>. When the display device according to the embodiment of the present invention is a liquid crystal display, the electrode <b>28</b> is used as a pixel electrode. On the other hand, when the display device according to the embodiment of the present invention is an organic light emitting display device, the electrode <b>28</b> is used as an anode or cathode.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described above, according to this embodiment, a portion of the second conductive layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>in the capacitor region C is removed to allow for ion implantation of lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>using the same mask that is used to pattern the source and drain electrodes <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b</i>. Thus, impurity ions can be implanted into the lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>without using a separate implantation mask, enabling the silicon lower electrode <b>14</b><i>b </i>to have conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Accordingly, in this embodiment, the number of masks and the number of processes are decreased as compared with those in the related art, thereby reducing manufacturing cost and simplifying processes. Also, the ion-implanted poly-silicon or amorphous silicon is used as the lower electrode of the capacitor, so that the display device can be driven at a low voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, the first conductive layer <b>18</b><i>c </i>included in the upper electrode <b>21</b> of the capacitor Cst is made out of an opaque conductive layer, so that the upper electrode <b>21</b> of the capacitor Cst can be simultaneously formed with the gate line without a separate additional process. Also, the first conductive layers <b>18</b><i>t </i>and <b>18</b><i>c </i>included in the gate electrode <b>19</b> and the upper electrode <b>21</b> of the capacitor respectively are made out of an opaque conductive layer, thereby lowering the resistance of the gate electrode <b>19</b> and the upper electrode <b>21</b> and allowing for a reduced thickness of the second conductive layers <b>20</b><i>t </i>and <b>20</b><i>c </i>formed on the first conductive layers <b>18</b><i>t </i>and <b>20</b><i>t </i>respectively.</p>
