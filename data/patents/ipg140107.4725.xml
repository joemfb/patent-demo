No. 12/834,472, entitled &#x201c;No Pop Switch&#x201d;, filed Jul. 12, 2010, which claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C &#xa7;119(e) of Rodriquez. U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/225,064, entitled &#x201c;No Pop Switch&#x201d;, filed Jul. 13, 2009, the benefit of priority of each of which is claimed hereby, and each of which are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, switching between two or more signals at different potentials can result in a sudden change that can be harmful or undesirable. For example, switching between different audio or video signals at different potentials can result in an audio pop, a visual distortion, or one or more other undesirable effects. In other examples, switching between two signals at different potentials (e.g., first and second voltage signals having different values) can lead to a sudden current spike, or one or more other harmful or undesirable effects.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In certain examples, a switch can be configured to receive a first signal at a first input and provide an output signal at an output, the output depending on a state of the switch. The present inventors have recognized that switching signals at or near the same potential can reduce sudden output changes. In an example, a switch state change can be delayed until an indication of a requested switch state different than a current switch state is received and the first signal reaches a threshold, to eliminate or reduce harmful or undesirable effects, such as audio pop, electric shock, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first example, Example 1, an apparatus includes a switch. The switch can include a first input configured to receive a first signal, a second input configured to receive a second signal, a control input configured to receive a control signal and in response to the control signal, to couple one of the first or the second input signals to an output to control a state of the switch, and the output configured to provide an output signal using the first signal, the second signal, and the control signal. The apparatus can further include a control circuit configured to receive the first signal, the second signal, and an indication of a requested switch state, to provide the control signal to the switch, and to delay a switch state change until the indication of the requested switch state is different than a current switch state and a comparison of information indicative of the first signal and information indicative of the second signal satisfies a threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In Example 2, the control circuit of Example 1 optionally includes a first shift circuit configured to provide an offset version of the first signal within a specified voltage range above a specified reference voltage when the requested switch state is different than the current switch state, wherein the information indicative of the first signal includes the offset version of the first signal. The control circuit of Example 1 optionally includes a second shift circuit configured to provide an offset version of the second signal within a specified voltage range above a specified reference voltage when the requested switch state is different than the current switch state, and wherein the information indicative of the second signal includes the offset version of the second signal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In Example 3, the first and second shift circuits of any one or more of Examples 1-2 are optionally configured to be enabled when the indication of the requested switch state is different than a current switch state, and are optionally configured to be disabled when the indication of the requested switch state is the same as the current switch state to conserve power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In Example 4, at least one of the first or second shift circuits of any one or more of Examples 1-3 optionally includes a current source, a resistive network coupled to the current source, and a transistor. The transistor of Example 4 optionally includes a source terminal coupled to the resistive network in series with the current source, a drain terminal coupled to ground, and a gate terminal configured to receive a signal. The offset version of the signal of Example 4 is optionally provided at a junction of the resistive network and the current source.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In Example 5, the control circuit of any one or more of Examples 1-4 optionally includes a comparator configured to compare the offset version of the first signal to the offset version of the second signal and to provide a comparator output indicative of the difference between the offset version of the first signal and the offset version of the second signal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In Example 6, the control circuit of any one or more of Examples 1-5 optionally includes a first attenuator configured to attenuate the magnitude of the first signal and to provide the attenuated first signal to the first shift circuit, and a second attenuator to attenuate the magnitude of the second signal and to provide the attenuated first signal to the first shift circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In Example 7, each of the first attenuator and the second attenuator of any one or more of Examples 1-6 optionally includes a voltage divider to attenuate the first signal and the second signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In Example 8, each of the first attenuator and the second attenuator of any one or more of Examples 1-7 optionally includes an enable circuit configured to receive an enable signal, to provide an attenuated version of a received signal when the enable signal is in a first state, and to reduce power consumption of the attenuator when the enable signal is in a second state.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In Example 9, each of the first attenuator and the second attenuator of any one or more of Examples 1-8 optionally includes respective isolated transistor coupled to the voltage divider, the isolated transistor configured to allow the attenuated signal to oscillate about ground using a single voltage source when the enable signal is in the first state, wherein a reference voltage of the isolated transistor is responsive to a negative swing of the received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In Example 10, the enable circuit of any one or more of Examples 1-9 is optionally configured to disable the isolated NMOS transistor when the enable signal is in the second state.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In Example 11, the switch of any one or more of Examples 1-10 optionally includes an audio switch, the first signal of any one or more of Examples 1-10 optionally includes a first audio signal, the second signal of any one or more of Examples 1-10 optionally includes a second audio signal, and the output of the audio switch of any one or more of Examples 1-10 is optionally configured to be coupled to a speaker.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In Example 12, the switch of any one or more of Examples 1-11 optionally includes a video switch, the first signal any one or more of Examples 1-11 optionally includes a first video signal, the second signal any one or more of Examples 1-11 optionally includes a second video signal, and the output of the video switch any one or more of Examples 1-11 optionally is configured to be coupled to a display.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present inventor has recognized, among other things, that switching one or more inputs can be controlled to eliminate or reduce harmful or undesirable effects, such as audio pop, electric shock, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an example, a switch (e.g., an analog switch) can be used to switch an audio input (e.g., turn on, turn off, mute, etc.), or to switch between multiple audio inputs. In certain examples, a fast transition in an audio output can result in an audio pop or one or more other audio distortions (e.g., caused by a sudden increase in current through a speaker). The present inventor has recognized, among other things, that an audio switch can be configured to change between the first and second audio signals when the signals are similar (e.g., similar in amplitude, similar in phase, etc.) to eliminate or reduce the audio pop or other audio distortion. In other examples, the present inventor has recognized that, when switching an audio input on or off, the audio switch can be configured to change states (e.g., between open and closed) when a first audio input reaches a threshold, or is similar to an output of the switch (e.g., prior to closing the switch, after opening the switch, etc.) to eliminate or reduce the audio pop or other audio distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an example, the switch can be controlled by adjusted or controlling a timing of the switch (e.g., introducing delay) to minimize the difference between the input and the output of the switch, such as between first and second audio signals, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates generally an example of a system <b>100</b> including a switch <b>105</b> having a first input <b>110</b> configured to receive a first signal, a control input <b>115</b> configured to receive a control signal to control a state of the switch, and an output <b>120</b> configured to provide an output signal using the first signal and the control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an example, the first input <b>110</b> can configured to receive the first signal, such as an audio signal, a video signal, or one or more other signals. The output <b>120</b> can be coupled to a speaker, a video display, or one or more other output devices, and the switch <b>105</b> can be configured to turn on, turn off, mute, or otherwise enable, disable, or interrupt the first input <b>110</b> and the output <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an example, the control input <b>115</b> can be configured to receive a control signal to control the switch <b>105</b> to eliminate or reduce audio pop or one or more other distortion associated with switching between an input signal and an output signal having different potentials. In certain examples, the difference in potential can be filtered to reduce the effect. However, doing so can require additional components or circuitry, and the resulting output signal can be changed from the original input. The present inventors have recognized that, if the first signal includes amplitude variation in time that overlaps or approaches a threshold (e.g., ground, a resting potential of an input of a device coupled to the output <b>120</b>, or one or more other input signals), then the control input <b>115</b> can control the switch <b>105</b> to minimize potential adverse effects of the switching (e.g., audio pop, distortions, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In typical switching applications, the control signal controls a state of the switch <b>105</b> (e.g., open, closed, etc.) when a request to alter the state of the switch <b>105</b> is received (e.g., a power-on request, a power-off request, a mute request, a request to switch between multiple audio signals, etc.). In these examples, if the first input <b>110</b> and the output <b>120</b> are at different potentials, an audio pop or other distortion can result.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In certain examples, typical vocal frequencies can range from approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. The present inventor has recognized, among other things, that the control signal can be configured to delay a change of state of the switch <b>105</b> until the first input <b>110</b> and the output <b>120</b> (in certain examples, the potential future output, should the change of state of the switch <b>105</b> be to open) are approximately equal, or until the difference between the first input <b>110</b> and the output <b>120</b> can be minimized. In audio switching applications, even at low vocal frequencies, assuming that the first signal overlaps the output signal or one or more other thresholds, a maximum delay to the change of state of the switch <b>105</b> can be merely 0.0125 seconds (typically much less), representing one full period of the first signal at the first input <b>110</b> at low vocal frequencies. In other examples, if the first signal does not overlap the output signal or one or more other thresholds, the control signal can be configured to find a minimum difference between the first signal and the output signal or the one or more other thresholds in a first period, and then delay the change of state of the switch <b>105</b> until the minimum difference is reached in the second period. In certain examples, the control signal can be configured to provide a delay to account for a phase difference between the first input <b>110</b> and the output <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other examples, the first input <b>110</b> can be configured to receive one or more signals other than audio or video signals, and the output <b>120</b> can be configured to provide the one or more signals to a device configured to receive the one or more signals. In these examples, the state of the switch <b>105</b> can be changed when the first input <b>110</b> is similar to the output <b>120</b> (or similar to an expected output), such as to minimize adverse effects associated with switching signals at different potentials (e.g., a sudden rise in current, etc.). In certain examples, when switching between multiple inputs, the state of the switch <b>105</b> can be changed when the first input <b>110</b> is similar to one or more other inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates generally an example of a system <b>200</b> including a switch module <b>130</b>, the switch module <b>130</b> including a switch <b>105</b> and a controller <b>125</b>. In certain examples, the controller <b>125</b> can include a digital controller (e.g., a processor, etc.), analog or digital circuitry, or one or more other controllers configured to receive a first signal from a first input <b>110</b> and to provide a control signal to a control input <b>115</b> of the switch <b>105</b>. In an example, the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to delay a switch state change until an indication of a requested state change is different than a current switch state and until the first signal reaches or approaches a threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an example, the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to receive an indication of a requested switch state (e.g., from a user, from a processor, etc.). If the indication of the requested switch state is different than a current switch state and the first signal reaches a threshold, then the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to provide the control signal to the control input <b>115</b> to change the state of the switch <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In certain examples, the first signal at the first input <b>110</b> can be indicative of a requested switch state. For example, a user can select a signal (e.g., an audio signal, a video signal, etc.) to be provided to the output <b>120</b>, and a processor can be configured to provide the signal to the switch <b>105</b>. In other examples, such as without the switch <b>105</b>, the first signal would be provided directly to the output <b>120</b>. In this example, the presence of the first signal is indicative of a request from a user or processor to provide the first signal. In other examples, the controller <b>125</b> can receive a separate request from the user (e.g., a mute request, etc.). Once the request, or the signal indicative of the request, is received, the controller <b>125</b> can monitor the first signal at the first input <b>110</b> and control the switch to open or close at a specified amplitude, phase, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In certain examples, the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to provide the control signal change the state of the switch <b>105</b> when the first signal at the first input <b>110</b> approaches or reaches a threshold. In an example, the threshold can include ground or one or more other levels, depending on the application. In an example, the threshold can include a value of an input of a device coupled to the output <b>120</b> of the switch <b>105</b>, such as a speaker, a display, or one or more other devices configured to receive the output signal from the switch <b>105</b>. In certain examples, the controller <b>125</b> can take into account the phase of the first signal at the first input <b>110</b>, and can change the state of the switch <b>105</b> using the phase information.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates generally an example of a system <b>300</b> including a switch module <b>130</b>, the switch module <b>130</b> including a switch <b>105</b> and a controller <b>125</b>. In this example, the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to receive a first signal from a first input <b>110</b> and an output signal from an output <b>120</b>. In an example, the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to delay a switch state change until an indication of a requested switch state (e.g., open, closed, etc.) is different than a current switch state and the first signal from the first input <b>110</b> reaches or approaches the output signal from the output <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In other examples, if the first signal doesn't reach the output signal, then the switch state change can be delayed until the difference between the first signal and the output signal is minimized. In other examples, the switch state change can be delayed until the difference between the first signal and one or more other thresholds or other signals can be minimized (e.g., to eliminate or reduce harmful or undesirable effects).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates generally an example of a system <b>400</b> including a switch <b>105</b> having a first input <b>110</b> configured to receive a first signal, a second input <b>111</b> configured to receive a second signal, the second signal different than the first signal, a control input <b>115</b> configured to receive a control signal to control a state of the switch, and an output <b>120</b> configured to provide an output signal using the control signal and at least one of the first signal or the second signal.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an example, the control input <b>115</b> can be configured to receive a control signal to control the switch <b>105</b> to eliminate or reduce audio pop or one or more other distortion associated with switching between the first and second signals having different potentials, or with switching between the first or second signals and the output signal having different potentials.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In typical switching applications between multiple input signals, the control signal controls a state of the switch <b>105</b> (e.g., open, closed, etc.) when a request to alter the state of the switch <b>105</b> is received (e.g., a power-on request, a power-off request, a mute request, a request to switch between multiple audio signals, etc.). In these examples, if the first input <b>110</b> and the second input <b>111</b> are at different potentials, or if the first input <b>110</b> or the second input <b>111</b> are at different potentials with respect to the output <b>120</b>, an audio pop or other distortion can result.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In certain examples, switching between first and second input signals can be similar to switching between a first signal and an output, or between a first signal and a threshold. In this example, the switch state includes a first position configured to couple the first input <b>110</b> to the output <b>120</b> and a second position configured to couple the second input <b>111</b> to the output <b>120</b>. In other examples, one or more other switch configurations can be used having one or more other inputs or input configurations. For example, the switch <b>105</b> can include a first input <b>110</b> and a second input <b>111</b>, each having separate switches having an open state and a closed state, configured to couple or de-couple each of the first input <b>110</b> and the second input <b>111</b> to the output <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the switch <b>105</b> is in the first position, and the first input <b>110</b> is coupled to the output <b>120</b>. In an example, when an indication of a requested switch state is received, the control signal can be configured to delay the switch state change until the indication of the requested switch state is different than a current switch state (e.g., until the indication of the requested switch state includes the second position), and until the second signal at the second input <b>111</b> reaches a threshold. In an example, the threshold can include a value (e.g., amplitude) of the first signal, such that the difference between the first and second signals is minimized when the state of the switch is changed. In other examples, the threshold can include a value of the output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates generally an example of a system <b>500</b> including a switch module <b>130</b>, the switch module <b>130</b> including a switch <b>105</b> and a controller <b>125</b>. In an example, the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to receive a first signal from the first input <b>110</b> and a second signal from the second input <b>11</b>. In an example, the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to delay a switch state change until an indication of a requested state change is different than a current switch state and until the first signal or the second signal reaches or approaches a threshold. In an example, the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to delay a switch state change until the first signal reaches or approaches the second signal. In other examples, one or more other thresholds can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an example, if the switch <b>105</b> is in a first position (coupling the first input <b>110</b> to the output <b>120</b>) and an indication of a requested switch state to a second position (coupling the second input <b>111</b> to the output <b>120</b>) is received, then the controller <b>125</b> can be configured to delay the switch state change from the first position to the second position until the second signal (e.g., the amplitude of the second signal) at the second input <b>111</b> reaches or approaches the first signal (e.g., the amplitude of the first signal) at the first input <b>110</b>.</p>

In this example, the control signal delays the switch state change until the first signal reaches or approaches the second signal. Because there is no little or no difference in potential between the first and second audio signals at time <b>145</b>, no audio pop or other distortion results at the output signal.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates generally an example of a multi-input switch circuit such as included as a portion of a system such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In an example, the circuit <b>900</b> can use a single-ended power supply, such as operating using a single supply voltage (e.g., V<sub>cc</sub>), as opposed to requiring a bipolar power supply providing both a positive voltage and a negative voltage, with respect to a common reference (e.g., GND). The present inventors have recognized, among other things, that the single-supply operating capability of circuit <b>900</b> can reduce circuit size (e.g., footprint or complexity) or save costs as compared to a circuit requiring a bipolar supply. Such costs can include design and manufacturing costs, or costs associated with systems using the circuit <b>900</b>. The circuit <b>900</b> can include a first input <b>901</b>, such as configured to receive a first signal <b>921</b> and a second input <b>902</b>, such as configured to receive a second signal <b>922</b>. The circuit <b>900</b> can include a control input <b>903</b>, such as configured to receive a request that either the first input <b>901</b> or the second input <b>902</b> be switched to the output <b>904</b> of the circuit <b>900</b>. The circuit <b>900</b> can include a switch <b>905</b>, such as configured to receive the first <b>921</b> and second <b>922</b> signal and configured to couple the requested signal to the output <b>904</b> of the switch, such as in response to the control input <b>903</b>. The circuit <b>900</b> can include a controller <b>906</b>. The controller <b>906</b> can respond to one or more received requests, and, in response, coordinate a switching action of the switch <b>905</b> such that a disruption of the output signal is substantially avoided or reduced. Such disruptions can include, but are not limited to, audio clicks, audio pops and visual distortions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an example, the controller <b>906</b> can monitor the first and second signals and switch the switch <b>905</b> when the signals are at approximately the same level, such as discussed above with respect to the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>. In some examples, the controller <b>906</b> can switch the switch <b>905</b> when the first and second signals are at approximately the same level and in phase, or ramping in the same direction. In an example, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the circuit <b>900</b> can include a comparator <b>907</b>, such as configured to receive information about the first and second signals, such as to provide switch transition information to the controller <b>906</b>. In an example, such switch transition information can include information about an amplitude relationship of the first and second signals, a phase relationship of the first and second signals or both, among other information. For example, if the switch transition information satisfies one or more criteria indicative of a disturbance-free (or a reduced disturbance) switching opportunity, the controller <b>906</b>, in response to a signal from the comparator <b>907</b>, can trigger the switch <b>905</b> to change states between coupling the first and second signals to the output <b>904</b> of the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The use of a single polarity voltage supply may limit the ability of the controller <b>906</b> to track the full swing of various input signals that can be applied to the circuit <b>900</b>. In an example, the circuit <b>900</b> can include a single polarity voltage supply, such as a single positive voltage supply V<sub>cc</sub>, along with one or more level shifting circuits such as a first shift circuit <b>931</b> or a second shift circuit <b>932</b>. The respective shift circuits <b>931</b>-<b>932</b> can be used to translate or otherwise provide a signal-conditioned representation the first and second signals <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>, such that such that the peak-to-peak range of the translated or conditioned versions of the signals are within the dynamic range of the comparator <b>907</b> or other circuitry of the circuit <b>900</b>. For example, such translation or condition can be used to provide versions of the first and second signals that are constrained to voltage swings within range just above a GND voltage and just below the positive rail voltage V<sub>cc </sub>of the power supply. Such translated or conditioned versions of the first <b>921</b> or second <b>922</b> signals can be used by the comparator <b>907</b>, as discussed above, such as to provide switch transition information satisfying one or more criteria indicative of a disturbance-free (or a reduced disturbance) switching opportunity.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an example, the circuit <b>900</b> can include one or more respective attenuators or limiters to attenuate or limit the respective first or second signals <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>. For example, the circuit <b>900</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> can include a first attenuator <b>933</b> or a second attenuator <b>934</b>. One or more of the respective attenuators <b>933</b>, <b>934</b> can be used to limit the peak-to-peak voltage swing of the first or second signals <b>921</b> to a range corresponding to the voltage range (e.g., a specified voltage) of the single-ended supply. The present inventors have also recognized that such attenuation or limitation can allow a single-ended supply having a lower operating voltage to be used, as compared to a circuit <b>900</b> lacking such front-end limiting or attenuation circuitry. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, attenuated representations <b>943</b>, <b>944</b> of the respective first and second signals <b>921</b>, <b>922</b> can be received by the respective shift circuits <b>931</b>, <b>932</b> and can be processed into attenuated and shifted versions <b>941</b>, <b>942</b> of the first and second signals <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>. The attenuated and shifted versions <b>941</b>. <b>942</b> of the first and second input signals <b>921</b>, <b>922</b> can be received by the comparator <b>907</b>, which, in response, can provide switch transition information used to switch the output <b>904</b> of the circuit <b>900</b> such as to avoid substantial disruption at the output <b>904</b>. In an example, a multi-input switch circuit <b>900</b> can be implemented as a single integrated circuit device, or as a portion of an integrated circuit device.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates generally an example of an offset circuit. The offset circuit <b>1030</b> can include one or more resistors, such as a resistor <b>1033</b>, such as coupled to one or more transistors, such as a transistor <b>1034</b>. In an example, the transistor <b>1034</b> can be coupled between a reference (e.g., GND), and one side of the resistor network. The circuit <b>1030</b> can include a current source <b>1036</b> coupled between the series of resistors <b>1033</b> and the supply voltage V<sub>cc</sub>, such as including an output node <b>1035</b> between the resistor network and the current source <b>1036</b>. A control input <b>1037</b> of the transistor <b>1034</b> can receive an incoming signal. An offset (e.g., a level-translated) version of the received signal can be provided at the output <b>1035</b> of the circuit <b>1030</b>. In various examples, the amount of offset can be controlled by specifying one or more resistor values, by specifying a setpoint of the current source, or a combination thereof. In an example, the current source <b>1036</b> can be controlled by an enable input to switch the current source &#x201c;on&#x201d; only when needed (e.g., to reduce noise or to save on power consumption). For example, the current source can be turned &#x201c;on&#x201d; when a request to change the state of the switch is received (such as discussed above in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and can be turned &#x201c;off&#x201d; after the state of the switch is changed in conformance with the request, or after an opportunity for changing the switch state is identified. In such examples, the offset circuit can include or can operate in response to a controller, such as to enable and disable the current source <b>1036</b>. In an example, the offset circuit <b>1030</b> can receive an enable signal from control input <b>903</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates generally an example of an attenuator circuit. The attenuator circuit <b>1140</b> can include an input <b>1145</b>, such as configured to receive an input signal to be switched, and an output <b>1146</b>, such as to provide an attenuated version of the received input signal. The attenuator circuit <b>1140</b> can include a power supply terminal, V<sub>cc</sub>, configured to be coupled to a single polarity supply voltage, and a ground node GND. The attenuator circuit <b>1140</b> can include a resistor network <b>1147</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>coupled to the signal input <b>1145</b> and the output <b>1146</b> for providing the attenuated signal. In an example, an attenuator circuit <b>1140</b> can include resistors <b>1147</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>of substantially equal resistance such that the attenuated version of the signal includes a peak-to-peak voltage swing that is approximately 25% of the un-attenuated peak-to-peak voltage swing. In an example, one or more other resistor values can be used, such as to provide one or more other attenuation factors.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The resistor network <b>1147</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>can be coupled to a reference voltage, such as via an attenuator switch <b>1160</b>. The attenuator switch <b>1160</b> can assist in conserving energy, such as by enabling the attenuation circuit <b>1140</b> when attenuation of an incoming signals is needed, such as when a request to change the state of the switch circuit <b>900</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is received, and by disabling the circuit <b>900</b> during other specified times. The attenuator switch <b>1160</b> can enable attenuation of the received signal, such as in response to a request to change the state of the switch circuit. The attenuation switch <b>1160</b> can disable the attenuation circuit <b>1140</b> when the state of the switch circuit <b>900</b> has changed in conformance with the request, or after an opportunity for changing the state of the switch <b>905</b> has been identified. In such examples, the attenuator circuit <b>1140</b> can include or can be coupled to a controller, and, in response to a signal from the controller, the attenuator can be enabled or disabled. In some examples, the attenuator circuit can include an enable circuit <b>1150</b> and can receive an enable signal from the control input <b>903</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an example, the attenuator circuit <b>1140</b> can be disabled when an enable input <b>1149</b> is at a low logic level. When the enable input <b>1149</b> is at a high logic level, a NMOS transistor <b>1163</b> can turn &#x201c;on&#x201d; pulling the control gate of transistor <b>1165</b> low. Transistor <b>1165</b> can turn &#x201c;on&#x201d; with a low logic level at the control gate and can pull the control gate of the isolated NMOS transistor <b>1160</b> high. A high logic level on the control gate of transistor <b>1160</b> can turn transistor <b>1160</b> &#x201c;on&#x201d;, thus, coupling the resistor network <b>1147</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>to a reference and enabling signal attenuation using the attenuation circuit <b>1140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the illustrated example <b>1140</b>, the enable circuit <b>1150</b> can include reference translator <b>1151</b> to allow the attenuated version of the received signal to swing in opposite polarity of the voltage supply V<sub>cc </sub>with respect to ground. For example, if the switch circuit <b>900</b> uses a positive polarity supply voltage, the reference translator <b>1151</b> can receive the un-attenuated signal and the voltage supply reference GND, or ground. The reference translator <b>1151</b> can provide a pseudo ground rail <b>1152</b> that is maintained at substantially the more negative of either the voltage supply reference GND or the un-attenuated signal value, thus, allowing the output of attenuator <b>1146</b> to swing below the voltage supply reference GND using the isolated NMOS transistor <b>1148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The illustrated enable circuit <b>1150</b> of the attenuator <b>1140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> can also include a down translator <b>1153</b> and second isolated NMOS transistor <b>1161</b> to keep the first isolated NMOS transistor <b>1160</b> &#x201c;off&#x201d; when the enable input <b>1149</b> is at a logic low value. The down translator <b>1153</b> can receive complementary versions of the enable signal using transistors <b>1163</b> and <b>1166</b>. The down translator <b>1153</b> can also receive the voltage supply reference GND and the pseudo ground rail <b>1152</b>. When the enable signal is low, the down translator <b>1153</b> can provide a corresponding high logic level output <b>1154</b> to the second isolated NMOS transistor <b>1161</b>, enabling the second isolated NMOS transistor <b>1161</b> such that the gate of the first NMOS transistor <b>1160</b> can be pulled low. As the pseudo rail <b>1152</b> is pulled low by the reference translator <b>1151</b> in response to the received signal, the second isolated NMOS transistor <b>1161</b> can maintain a low logic level on the gate of the first isolated NMOS transistor <b>1160</b> to assure that the first NMOS transistor <b>1160</b> remains &#x201c;off&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> illustrates generally an example of a reference translator <b>1251</b> including a power supply reference input <b>1280</b>, a first reference input <b>1281</b>, a second reference input <b>1282</b>, and a pseudo reference output <b>1252</b>. The reference translator <b>1251</b> can maintain the pseudo reference output <b>1252</b> at the lower potential of either the first reference input <b>1281</b> or the second reference input <b>1282</b>. In the illustrated example, the more positive reference input can turn &#x201c;on&#x201d; the the corresponding transistor network <b>1284</b>, <b>1285</b> to couple the pseudo output <b>1252</b> to the more negative reference input of the first reference input <b>1281</b>, the second reference input <b>1282</b> and the power supply reference input <b>1280</b>. In an example, a diode <b>1286</b> can assure that the pseudo reference output <b>1252</b> is no higher than a junction potential above the power supply reference input <b>1280</b>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> illustrates generally an example of a down translator <b>1253</b> including a first input <b>1271</b> and second input <b>1272</b>, an output <b>1273</b>, a first input transistor <b>1274</b>, a second input transistor <b>1275</b>, a first isolated transistor <b>1276</b> cross coupled with a second isolated transistor <b>1277</b>, a first reference input <b>1270</b> and a second reference input <b>1252</b>.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Other Examples</heading>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The present inventor has recognized, among other things, that the systems or methods described above can be used in a variety of switching applications (e.g., outside of audio or video switching) where an input signal and an output signal, or multiple input signals, can have different potentials. Further, one or more of the systems or methods described herein can be referred to as mixing technology.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In an example, mixing technology can be used to prevent the in-rush of current when switching between different potentials (e.g., switching between an input at a first potential and an output at a second different potential), potentially avoiding a short circuit condition or a shock. In certain examples, if at least one of the input or the output is variable, the switch can wait, after receiving a request to switch, until the potential at the input is at or near the potential at the output. In other examples, the switch can wait until the potential at the input is within a threshold amount from the potential at the output before switching. In an example, the threshold can be set by a user, or can vary with time. Initially, the threshold can be set at a first amount, and then, as time passes without the potential at the input being within the threshold amount from the potential at the output, the threshold can increase. In other examples, if the threshold is not reached within a period of time, an alert can be provided (e.g., similar to blowing a fuse, etc.), or a waiting period can expire and the switching can commence regardless of the difference.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In an example, the threshold can be programmable, and a user can set the threshold amount, or an actual voltage at which the switch will switch based on at least one of the input, the output, or the difference between the two.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In other examples, the difference in potential between the input and the output, or between multiple outputs, can be used determine a signal type and to switch to a signal having higher priority (e.g., giving priority to a first signal type, such as an audio signal, over a second signal type, such as USB data).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In an example, the mixing technology can be used for power-up stabilization, such as between power sources having different potentials (e.g., between a 5V source and a 3V source). In an example, when a power source is turned on, the output of the power source can gradually increase (or sometimes fluctuate) until it reaches a steady-state. In an example, when switching from a first power source to a second power source having a higher output, the switching can be delayed until the potential of the second power source is at or near the potential of the first power source. In contrast, when switching from a first power source to a second power source having a lower potential, the switching can be delayed until the difference between the potentials of the first and second power sources is minimized or otherwise meets a threshold amount.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an example, a switch (e.g., having one or more inputs, one or more outputs, one or more channels, etc.) can self-isolate using a difference between an input and an output, or using a difference between or comparison of at least one of an input or an output and a predetermined electrical condition. In certain examples, the predetermined electrical condition can include a voltage or current threshold, a phase, a slew rate, or one or more other electrical conditions. The switching can be delayed until one or more of the conditions are met, or if the condition is met, the switch can be opened or closed, depending on the desired result. In certain examples, a closed switch can be opened, an opened switch can be closed, or a different input can be selected if at least one of the input or the output exceeds a voltage or current threshold, a slew rate, or one or more other electrical conditions.</p>
