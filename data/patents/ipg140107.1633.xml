The handheld device may incorporate the same features as the gaming terminal <b>10</b> or variations thereof. A more detailed description of a handheld device that may be utilized with the present invention can be found in PCT Patent Application No. PCT/US2007/000792 filed Jan. 26, 2007, entitled &#x201c;Handheld Device for Wagering Games,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the various components of the gaming terminal <b>10</b> are controlled by a central processing unit (CPU) <b>42</b>, also referred to herein as a controller or processor (such as a microcontroller or microprocessor). The CPU <b>42</b> can include any suitable processor, such as an Intel&#xae; Pentium processor, Intel&#xae; Core 2 Duo processor, AMD Opteron&#x2122; processor, or UltraSPARC&#xae; processor. To provide gaming functions, the controller <b>42</b> executes one or more game programs stored in one or more computer readable storage media in the form of memory <b>44</b> or other suitable storage device. The controller <b>42</b> uses a random number generator (RNG) to randomly generate a wagering game outcome from a plurality of possible outcomes. Alternatively, the outcome may be centrally determined using either an RNG or pooling scheme at a remote controller included, for example, within the external system <b>46</b>. It should be appreciated that the controller <b>42</b> may include one or more microprocessors, including but not limited to a master processor, a slave processor, and a secondary or parallel processor.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The controller <b>42</b> is coupled to the system memory <b>44</b> and also to a money/credit detector <b>48</b>. The system memory <b>44</b> may comprise a volatile memory (e.g., a random-access memory (RAM)) and a non-volatile memory (e.g., an EEPROM). The system memory <b>44</b> may include multiple RAM and multiple program memories. The money/credit detector <b>48</b> signals the processor that money and/or credits have been input via a value-input device, such as the bill validator <b>20</b>, coin acceptor <b>22</b>, or via other sources, such as a cashless gaming account, etc. These components may be located internal or external to the housing <b>12</b> of the gaming terminal <b>10</b> and connected to the remainder of the components of the gaming terminal <b>10</b> via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods. The money/credit detector <b>48</b> detects the input of funds into the gaming terminal <b>10</b> (e.g., via currency, electronic funds, ticket, card, etc.) that are generally converted into a credit balance available to the player for wagering on the gaming terminal <b>10</b>. The credit detector <b>48</b> detects when a player places a wager (e.g., via a player-input device <b>26</b>) to play the wagering game, the wager then generally being deducted from the credit balance. The money/credit detector <b>48</b> sends a communication to the controller <b>42</b> that a wager has been detected and also communicates the amount of the wager.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the controller <b>42</b> is also connected to, and controls, the primary display area <b>14</b>, the player-input device <b>26</b>, and a payoff mechanism <b>50</b>. The payoff mechanism <b>50</b> is operable in response to instructions from the controller <b>42</b> to award a payoff to the player in response to certain winning outcomes that might occur in the base game, the bonus game(s), or via an external game or event. The payoff may be provided in the form of money, redeemable points, services or any combination thereof. Such payoff may be associated with a ticket (from a ticket printer <b>52</b>), portable data unit (e.g., a card), coins, currency bills, accounts, and the like. The payoff amounts distributed by the payoff mechanism <b>50</b> are determined by one or more pay tables stored in the system memory <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Communications between the controller <b>42</b> and both the peripheral components of the gaming terminal <b>10</b> and the external system <b>46</b> occur through input/output (I/O) circuit <b>56</b>, which can include any suitable bus technologies, such as an AGTL+ frontside bus and a PCI backside bus. Although the I/O circuit <b>56</b> is shown as a single block, it should be appreciated that the I/O circuit <b>56</b> may include a number of different types of I/O circuits. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the components of the gaming terminal <b>10</b> can be interconnected according to any suitable interconnection architecture (e.g., directly connected, hypercube, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The I/O circuit <b>56</b> is connected to an external system interface <b>58</b>, which is connected to the external system <b>46</b>. The controller <b>42</b> communicates with the external system <b>46</b> via the external system interface <b>58</b> and a communication path (e.g., serial, parallel, IR, RC, 10bT, etc.). The external system <b>46</b> may include a gaming network, other gaming terminals, a gaming server, a remote controller, communications hardware, or a variety of other interfaced systems or components.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Controller <b>42</b>, as used herein, comprises any combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware that may be disposed or resident inside and/or outside of the gaming terminal <b>10</b> and may communicate with and/or control the transfer of data between the gaming terminal <b>10</b> and a bus, another computer, processor, or device and/or a service and/or a network. The controller <b>42</b> may comprise one or more controllers or processors. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the controller <b>42</b> in the gaming terminal <b>10</b> is depicted as comprising a CPU, but the controller <b>42</b> may alternatively comprise a CPU in combination with other components, such as the I/O circuit <b>56</b> and the system memory <b>44</b>. The controller <b>42</b> is operable to execute all of the various gaming methods and other processes disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The gaming terminal <b>10</b> may communicate with external system <b>46</b> (in a wired or wireless manner) such that each terminal operates as a &#x201c;thin client&#x201d; having relatively less functionality, a &#x201c;thick client&#x201d; having relatively more functionality, or with any range of functionality therebetween (e.g., a &#x201c;rich client&#x201d;). In general, a wagering game includes an RNG for generating a random number, game logic for determining the outcome based on the randomly generated number, and game assets (e.g., art, sound, etc.) for presenting the determined outcome to a player in an audio-visual manner. The RNG, game logic, and game assets may be contained within the gaming terminal <b>10</b> (&#x201c;thick client&#x201d; gaming terminal), the external systems <b>46</b> (&#x201c;thin client&#x201d; gaming terminal), or distributed therebetween in any suitable manner (&#x201c;rich client&#x201d; gaming terminal).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an image of a basic-game screen <b>60</b> adapted to be displayed on the primary display area <b>14</b> is illustrated, according to one embodiment of the present invention. A player begins play of a basic wagering game by providing a wager. A player can operate or interact with the wagering game using the one or more player-input devices <b>26</b>. The controller <b>42</b>, the external system <b>46</b>, or both, in alternative embodiments, operate(s) to execute a wagering game program causing the primary display area <b>14</b> to display the wagering game that includes a plurality of visual elements.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The basic-game screen <b>60</b> may be displayed on the primary display area <b>14</b> or a portion thereof. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the basic-game screen <b>60</b> portrays a plurality of simulated movable reels <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>. Alternatively or additionally, the basic-game screen <b>60</b> may portray a plurality of mechanical reels. The basic-game screen <b>60</b> may also display a plurality of game-session meters and various buttons adapted to be actuated by a player.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the illustrated embodiment, the game-session meters include a &#x201c;credit&#x201d; meter <b>64</b> for displaying a number of credits available for play on the terminal; a &#x201c;lines&#x201d; meter <b>66</b> for displaying a number of paylines to be played by a player on the terminal; a &#x201c;line bet&#x201d; meter <b>68</b> for displaying a number of credits wagered (e.g., from 1 to 5 or more credits) for each of the number of paylines played; a &#x201c;total bet&#x201d; meter <b>70</b> for displaying a total number of credits wagered for the particular round of wagering; and a &#x201c;paid&#x201d; meter <b>72</b> for displaying an amount to be awarded based on the results of the particular round's wager. The user-selectable buttons may include a &#x201c;collect&#x201d; button <b>74</b> to collect the credits remaining in the credits meter <b>64</b>; a &#x201c;help&#x201d; button <b>76</b> for viewing instructions on how to play the wagering game; a &#x201c;pay table&#x201d; button <b>78</b> for viewing a pay table associated with the basic wagering game; a &#x201c;select lines&#x201d; button <b>80</b> for changing the number of paylines (displayed in the lines meter <b>66</b>) a player wishes to play; a &#x201c;bet per line&#x201d; button <b>82</b> for changing the amount of the wager which is displayed in the line-bet meter <b>68</b>; a &#x201c;spin reels&#x201d; button <b>84</b> for moving the reels <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>; and a &#x201c;max bet spin&#x201d; button <b>86</b> for wagering a maximum number of credits and moving the reels <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>of the basic wagering game. While the gaming terminal <b>10</b> allows for these types of player inputs, the present invention does not require them and can be used on gaming terminals having more, less, or different player inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Paylines <b>30</b> may extend from one of the payline indicators <b>88</b><i>a</i>-<i>i </i>on the left side of the basic-game screen <b>60</b> to a corresponding one of the payline indicators <b>88</b><i>a</i>-<i>i </i>on the right side of the screen <b>60</b>. A plurality of symbols <b>90</b> is displayed on the plurality of reels <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>to indicate possible outcomes of the basic wagering game. A winning combination occurs when the displayed symbols <b>90</b> correspond to one of the winning symbol combinations listed in a pay table stored in the memory <b>44</b> of the terminal <b>10</b> or in the external system <b>46</b>. The symbols <b>90</b> may include any appropriate graphical representation or animation, and may further include a &#x201c;blank&#x201d; symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Symbol combinations may be evaluated as line pays or scatter pays. Line pays may be evaluated left to right, right to left, top to bottom, bottom to top, or any combination thereof by evaluating the number, type, or order of symbols <b>90</b> appearing along an activated payline <b>30</b>. Scatter pays are evaluated without regard to position or paylines and only require that such combination appears anywhere on the reels <b>62</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>. While an embodiment with nine paylines is shown, a wagering game with no paylines, a single payline, or any plurality of paylines will also work with the present invention. Additionally, though an embodiment with five reels is shown, a gaming terminal with any plurality of reels may also be used in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a bonus game that may be included with a basic wagering game is illustrated, according to one embodiment. A bonus-game screen <b>92</b> includes an array of markers <b>94</b> located in a plurality of columns and rows. The bonus game may be entered upon the occurrence of a special start-bonus game outcome (e.g., symbol trigger, mystery trigger, time-based trigger, etc.) in or during the basic wagering game. Alternatively, the illustrated game may be a stand-alone wagering game.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the illustrated bonus game, a player selects, one at a time, from the array of markers <b>94</b> to reveal an associated bonus-game outcome. According to one embodiment, each marker <b>94</b> in the array is associated with an award outcome <b>96</b> (e.g., credits or other non-negative outcomes) or an end-game outcome <b>98</b>. In the illustrated example, a player has selected an award outcome <b>96</b> with the player's first two selections (25 credits and 100 credits, respectively). When one or more end-game outcome <b>98</b> is selected (as illustrated by the player's third pick), the bonus game is terminated and the accumulated award outcomes <b>96</b> are provided to the player.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a gaming system <b>500</b> including system wide tournament play features is displayed. The system <b>500</b> includes a plurality of gaming devices <b>510</b><i>a,b,c</i>, each of which include at least a primary display <b>514</b><i>a,b,c </i>for displaying game events thereon. Each of the primary displays <b>514</b><i>a,b,c </i>may be any form of display such as those described herein with reference to the free standing and handheld gaming devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>. The primary displays <b>514</b><i>a,b,c </i>may include a display of a primary wagering game <b>560</b><i>a,b,c</i>, which in this embodiment are slot games as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The primary wagering games <b>560</b><i>a,b,c </i>may include a plurality of reels, which may be either electro-mechanical reels or simulations thereof on the primary display <b>514</b><i>a,b,c</i>. The reels may include a plurality of symbols thereon which vary as the reels are spun and stopped. The symbols may include any variety of graphical symbols, elements, or representations, including symbols which are associated with one or more themes of the gaming machine <b>510</b><i>a,b,c </i>or system <b>500</b>. The symbols may also include a blank symbol, or empty space. The primary wagering games <b>560</b><i>a,b,c </i>shown on the various primary displays <b>514</b><i>a,b,c </i>of the system <b>500</b> may be the same, similar, or different in nature, game play, theme, denomination, formation, eligibility, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described herein, in some embodiments, symbols landing on the active pay lines (the pay lines for which a wager has been received) are evaluated for winning combinations. A combination of symbols that lands on an active pay line is a winning outcome for which an award may be paid in accordance with a payable of the gaming device <b>510</b><i>a,b,c </i>or system <b>500</b>. The symbols on the reels form an array or matrix of symbols, having a number of rows and columns, which in the embodiment shown is three rows and five columns. In alternate embodiments, the array may have greater or fewer symbols, and may take on a variety of different forms having greater or fewer rows and/or columns. The array may even comprise other non-rectangular forms or arrangements of symbols. In alternative embodiments, other criteria may be used for winning combinations, such as symbol arrangement or configuration without regard to paylines.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The system <b>500</b> further includes a community display <b>580</b>, which in this embodiment is an LCD, plasma, or other flat-screen display mounted and positioned above the plurality of gaming devices <b>510</b><i>a,b,c</i>. The community display <b>580</b> displays a tournament event <b>582</b> which includes prize and award information related to the tournament event <b>582</b> and may optionally include progress and results of one or more players participating in the tournament event <b>582</b>. In the embodiment shown, the tournament event <b>582</b> comprises a plurality of players participating in an hour-long slot tournament with the three highest finishing players receiving various awards. In alternative embodiments, the tournament event <b>582</b> may be based on other time periods, such as weekly, monthly, and daily tournaments. In some embodiments, players can choose to play the gaming terminals in a cash payout mode (in which they do not participate in the tournament event <b>582</b>) or in a tournament mode (in which they do compete in one or more tournament events <b>582</b>). Other configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The display <b>580</b>, in this example, communicates information concerning results of one or more tournaments. In an embodiment, the community display <b>580</b> displays a tournament number <b>584</b>, final positions <b>586</b>, player names <b>588</b>, and tournament award <b>590</b>. In some embodiments, the tournament number <b>584</b> uniquely identifies a tournament so that a player is informed as to which tournament results are being displayed on the community display <b>580</b>. The final position <b>586</b> identifies the finishing position of a player, while the player name <b>588</b> field identifies the associated player by name (or other identifier). The display <b>580</b> may display a portion of the finishing order <b>586</b>, or the entire finishing order of all participating players. The tournament award <b>590</b> field displays the number of tournament points or other awards accumulated or earned by a player in the respective tournament. The display <b>580</b> may be configured to display information about any facet of a tournament that is ongoing, has occurred or is going to occur. For example, the prize pool and the number of participants in an ongoing tournament may be displayed. Winning and results histories may also be displayed on the community display <b>580</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The community display <b>580</b> may be placed in any appropriate place within a casino or operator's facility, for example, a gaming room in a casino, the entry area of a casino, elevators of a casino, or any other public place inside or outside of a casino. Publicly displaying tournament information creates a community environment for tournament participants so as to incentive players to play in such available tournaments. Players may discuss their results or the results of others. Seeing and discussing the results of others may create an environment of friendly competition. This competition may spur some players to compete in more tournaments and new players to try tournament play. This environment of community and competition may also create player loyalty. It should be noted that the information provided on the community display may be limited or delayed as desired by a casino or tournament provider. For example, the high scores for a particular tournament may not be posted until after a tournament has been completed (as opposed to real-time tracking) to prevent players from &#x201c;tournament shopping&#x201d; and completing their final spins only for tournaments with relatively low top scores.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, depicted is a player inserting his player's card <b>602</b> into a card or information reader <b>624</b> of a gaming machine <b>610</b> of a gaming system <b>600</b>. In an embodiment, the gaming system <b>600</b> having system wide tournament features administers tournament participation and results by identifying various players desirous of participating in one or more tournaments. When a player inserts his player's card <b>602</b>, the gaming system <b>600</b> identifies the player (for example by recalling a player account associated with a number stored on the card) and then tracks the player's game play, storing information related to the player's results in primary wagering games and progress in the tournament(s) in which the player has chosen to participate. In one embodiment, a player must have a player's card (or other player identifier as described herein) in order to participate in one or more tournaments and tournament features offered by the system <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this embodiment, the player's card <b>602</b> may contain a player identifier, and may also contain or be associated with player preferences and tournament status information. The player identifier may be a player name, or some type of player number, symbol, or alphanumeric string that uniquely identifies the player. Once a player is identified via his identifier, associated player preferences and tournament status information may be recalled or downloaded by the system to the local gaming terminal <b>610</b> on which the player is playing. Player preferences may include machine settings a player may prefer when playing a game, such as, for example, whether buttons should be arranged for a left-handed player or a right-handed player. Many other player preferences may be stored and recalled as well, such as color schemes, themes, graphics, animations, sounds, wager information, pay line configurations, etc. Tournament status information may include an identifier that identifies tournaments a player may be registered for or currently playing. In an embodiment, tournament status information may also include the number of spins a player has already expended in a tournament, accumulated credits, and other information that may be needed to determine a player's tournament standing. A variety of other player preferences and/or tournament status information may be associated with the player identifier and recalled or downloaded when the player card (or other identifier) is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, depicted is a primary display <b>714</b> of a gaming terminal <b>710</b> of a gaming system <b>700</b> having system wide tournament features, such as the system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The primary display <b>714</b> is configured to display a primary wagering game, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, after a player inserts his player card (or other identifier), or otherwise logs in to a gaming terminal <b>700</b>, the primary display <b>714</b> changes to display a pop up window <b>770</b> having a plurality of game configuration selections <b>772</b>, <b>774</b>. A first game configuration selection <b>772</b> is entitled &#x201c;Cash Play&#x201d; and corresponds with a cash play mode, as described further herein. A second game configuration selection <b>774</b> is entitled &#x201c;Tournament Play&#x201d; and corresponds with a tournament play mode, as described further herein. Thus, one or more gaming devices or terminals <b>710</b> in the gaming system <b>700</b> is configured to operate in either a cash play mode or a tournament play mode. In some embodiments, the choice of which mode is left to the player, and made via player selection as described. In other embodiments, the selection of which mode to operate in may be random, or dependent upon operator selection, criteria, or rule sets.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the Cash Play button <b>772</b> is selected, the gaming terminal <b>710</b> operates in a cash play mode, which is a normal or non-tournament mode. In the cash play mode, the player inputs wagers into a primary wagering game (such as a slot game). The results of the primary wagering game are randomly selected and displayed via the primary display <b>714</b>. For example, in a slot game, the symbol bearing reels are spun and stopped to reveal outcomes which are evaluated for winning combinations of symbols (or winning outcomes). If one or more winning combinations of symbols occur in the randomly selected outcome, the player is awarded credits (or other prizes) in accordance with a pay table of the gaming terminal <b>710</b>. When playing in cash play mode, the wagering game is configured to operate with a predetermined return or expected value. For example, in one embodiment, the wagering game return is 90%. Thus, for every $1.00 of wagers input into the wagering game, the game returns, on average, $0.90, or 90%. Thus, in this embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the base game return is configured to be 90%.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In tournament mode, the player again inputs wagers into a primary wagering game (such as a slot game). The appearance of the wagering game is the same as in cash mode, that is, the reels are spun and stopped to reveal randomly selected outcomes of symbols which are evaluated for winning combinations. However, mathematically the tournament mode differs from the cash mode. In tournament mode, the wagering game includes a base game return percentage, a tournament return percentage, and optionally, a tournament fee percentage. Thus, for each wager input into the wagering game in tournament mode, a portion of the wager funds the base game return, a portion of the wager funds the tournament return, and a portion of the wager funds a tournament fee. In one embodiment, the base game return is 80%, the tournament return is 9%, and the tournament fee is 1%. In tournament mode, the net return is the sum of the base game return and the tournament return. In this embodiment, the net return is 89% (80%+9%=89%). In another embodiment, the tournament return is 10%, and the net return is 90% (80%+10%=90%). Thus, as can be seen, in this latter embodiment, the net return in tournament mode would be the same as the base game return in base mode. The tournament fee may is optional and may be a fee charged by the operator or manufacturer to offset the administrative, hardware, and software costs associated with equipment and personnel necessary to operate the tournaments available.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Thus, it should be understood that in an embodiment, regardless of the player's choice of cash play or tournament play mode, their net expected return is the same. The difference between the two modes is that in the tournament mode, the base game return is reduced to allow a portion of each wager (the tournament return) to fund a prize pool for the various available tournaments. A significant different between the modes is that in tournament mode, each spin or play of the underlying wagering game has the potential for contributing to a tournament score which comprises a tournament entry for the player in an activated tournament.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, tournaments are based on a predetermined number of games or plays of the primary wagering game&#x2014;rather than traditional tournaments which are time based. Thus, for example, a tournament entry may comprise a series of 100 spins of a wagering game, and the player's results therein based upon the tournament points collected therein. When a player selects to play the wagering game in tournament mode, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, he or she must then decide which tournament they will compete in (i.e. make a selection from available tournaments). Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the primary display <b>814</b> of the gaming terminal <b>810</b> of the system <b>800</b> may change to display the available tournaments <b>880</b>,<b>882</b>,<b>884</b>,<b>886</b> which are currently &#x201c;open,&#x201d; active, or running. That is, the player may select from the available tournaments in which they would like to compete. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example, the tournaments <b>880</b>,<b>882</b>,<b>884</b>,<b>886</b> include an Hourly tournament <b>880</b>, a Daily tournament <b>882</b>, a Monthly tournament <b>884</b>, and a Yearly tournament <b>886</b>. Each tournament is open or active for the period of time associated with the tournament. One or more information displays <b>888</b> may display the dates and/or times during which the tournament <b>880</b>,<b>882</b>,<b>884</b>,<b>886</b> remains open, as well as tournament status information such as number of entries and accumulated prize pool. In this example, the player selects the &#x201c;Hourly&#x201d; tournament which runs until the top of the hour. This means that the player has the remainder of the hour in which to complete his entry into the tournament (i.e. to play the requisite number of plays of the wagering game to form an entry into the tournament).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another embodiment, the player is entered into the appropriate tournament once his entry is completed. For example, a player selecting an HOURLY tournament begins his play of 100 spins of the primary wagering game. As explained, the total tournament score he achieves after completion of 100 spins comprises his tournament entry. Assume the player commences play at 10:45 a.m. If he completes his entry (100 spins) prior to 11:00 a.m. (e.g. 10:52 a.m.), his tournament score is entered into the 10 AM-11 AM HOURLY tournament. If he takes a bit longer and completed his entry after 11:00 a.m. (e.g. 11:10 a.m.), his tournament score is entered into the 11 AM-12 Noon HOURLY tournament. Thus, in an embodiment, the player's completion time determines which tournament his score is entered into, and thus, which tournament(s) he participates in.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, depicted is the primary display <b>914</b> of a gaming terminal <b>910</b> of the gaming system <b>900</b> during play of the wagering game <b>960</b> in tournament mode. In tournament mode, in addition to the wagering game <b>960</b>, the primary display <b>914</b> includes a tournament information bar <b>980</b>. The tournament information bar <b>980</b> displays tournament related information, and includes a game counter <b>982</b>, a tournament score meter <b>984</b>, a tournament identifier <b>986</b>, a player identifier <b>988</b>, and optionally, a tournament multiplier <b>990</b> as described herein. As seen, the selected &#x201c;Hourly&#x201d; tournament is displayed as the tournament identifier <b>986</b>, which reads &#x201c;Hourly Entry.&#x201d; Additionally displayed is the player's name (or other identifier) of &#x201c;J. Smith&#x201d; in the player identifier <b>988</b> field. In this embodiment, a tournament entry comprises a total number of points accumulated in 100 consecutive plays of the wagering game <b>960</b>. Thus, the game counter <b>982</b> reflects that 96 games are remaining, meaning that the player has played 4 out of the 100 games or plays required to form a tournament score. The player's current tournament score is 800, as displayed in the tournament score meter <b>984</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">While in tournament mode, the player plays the wagering game <b>960</b> in typical fashion&#x2014;by entering wagers and pressing a spin button, for example, to initiate a play of the wagering game. A winning combination of symbols in a randomly selected outcome comprises a winning outcome for which credits are paid in accordance with a pay table. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a winning outcome has occurred and the player has won 100 credits. The bottom of the primary display <b>914</b> informs the player &#x201c;100 Credits Won!&#x201d; Because the base game return is reduced in tournament mode, the player's return from the base games will be less, on average, however, his overall return will not be affected as he will be participating in tournaments and thus will have an opportunity to win additional credits. In the base game, to effectuate the lower base game return, the game can be configured to play with either reduced frequency with which winning combinations occur, by reducing the awards associated with winning combinations, or both. In some embodiments, to keep the game's appearance consistent, the pay table is not altered, however, the frequency of wins is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">However, in addition to earning credits for winning outcomes in the base game <b>960</b>, each winning spin or play of the wagering game <b>960</b> also contributes tournament points to the player's tournament score <b>984</b>, forming the player's entry into the current tournament (in this case the Hourly tournament). For the winning combination shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the player has received twenty (20) tournament points which are added to the tournament score <b>984</b> (bringing the tournament score balance from 780 up to 800 as displayed). The tournament points awarded for each win may vary amongst different wagering games <b>960</b>, but can be equalized in accordance with a tournament score handicapping method described further herein. In an embodiment, each credit award in the pay table of the wagering game <b>960</b> is associated with a corresponding tournament point award which is provided to the player and added to their cumulative tournament score <b>984</b>. The player continues playing the primary wagering game <b>960</b> until all 100 spins of the tournament are completed. At such time, the game counter <b>982</b> will reflect zero (0) games remaining and the player's tournament score <b>984</b> will be complete as a tournament entry and uploaded to the gaming system <b>900</b>, where it is logged into a tournament server, for example, which collects player's scores, analyzes results and finishing orders, and provides awards accordingly. Thus, a player playing in tournament mode simultaneously accumulates traditional credit awards for winning combinations in the wagering game and also accumulates tournament points forming the player's tournament score or entry for an active tournament in which he is participating.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">At least some of the gaming machines <b>1050</b> and some of the wireless gaming machines <b>1054</b> support the play of wagering games in which the user's gaming machine functions in the client/server communication model with the user's gaming machine being a client of server <b>1040</b>. The user's gaming machine contains software which is responsible for the ongoing play of the wagering game. However, some information or data associated with the play of the game may be obtained during the ongoing play of the game from server <b>1040</b>.

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a tournament score derivation table <b>1104</b> is depicted. The derivation table <b>1104</b> may be used to handicap or normalize the tournament points awarded during play of two different wagering games. Because different wagering games have different pay tables, pay line configurations, and awarding schemes, one or more tournament score derivation tables may be used to equalize the number of tournament points earned for a winning outcome in each such primary wagering game. Thus, for example, shown in the table <b>1104</b> are two primary wagering games: &#x201c;Zeus&#x201d; and &#x201c;Count Money.&#x201d; The Zeus game has credit awards ranging from zero to 1500 credits, and includes thirty pay lines. The Count Money game has credit awards ranging from zero to 1200 credits, and has twenty five pay lines. Therefore, the table <b>1104</b> breaks up the two games into a plurality of ranges and associates each such range with a distinct tournament points score.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The derivation table <b>1104</b> contains tournament points awarded for a win that occurs when one betting unit is wagered on all possible pay lines. The top row <b>1106</b> of the table <b>1104</b> contains the heading title for each of the three columns <b>1108</b>, <b>1110</b>, <b>1112</b> of the table. A first heading title, &#x201c;Tournament Points,&#x201d; heads the first column <b>1108</b>. The entries contained in each row of the first column are the number of tournament points awarded for a particular game outcome. A second heading title, &#x201c;Zeus,&#x201d; heads the second column <b>1110</b> of the table <b>1104</b>. Entries contained in the second column <b>1110</b> are credit award ranges in the Zeus game which have been configured to correspond to and be associated with the tournament points contained in the first column <b>1108</b>. A third heading title, &#x201c;Count Money,&#x201d; heads the third column <b>1112</b> of the table <b>1104</b>. Entries contained in the third column <b>1112</b> are credit award ranges in the Count Money game which have been configured to correspond to and be associated with the tournament points contained in the first column <b>1108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the Count Money game generally is a less volatile game than the Zeus game. Wagering games can have many different types of probability distributions that determine the size and frequency of wins. Equalization is desirable to ensure that a player playing the Zeus game is not unfairly competing in tournaments offered by the gaming system, vis-&#xe0;-vis the player playing the Count Money game, and vice versa. Therefore, the entire credit award range of each game is broken down into ranges which correspond with a distinct set of tournament points <b>1108</b> available. For example, a player playing the Count Money game and achieving a one hundred thirty five (135) credit win is awarded twenty (20) tournament points on that play of the game, in accordance with the table <b>1104</b>. However, a player playing the Zeus game and achieving a one hundred thirty five (135) credit win is awarded thirty (30) tournament points on that play of the game, in accordance with the table <b>1104</b>. Thus, because the games have different ranges of credit awards available, each of the games' ranges are broken down differently in the table <b>1104</b> to ensure fairness and uniformity to players earning tournament points.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the example, the less volatile Count Money game earns more tournament points for the lower and higher credit amounts that the more volatile Zeus game. However, the Zeus game earns more tournament points for the middle credit amounts than the Count Money game In this way, the tournament derivation table <b>1104</b> operates as a handicapping system to generate earned tournament points based upon a credit win's relative position in the range of available credit wins for a particular game. This creates a substantially equal chance for all players in winning a tournament based upon their entry collected regardless of which primary wagering game they played. In one embodiment, the tournament derivation table <b>1104</b> contains a column for each primary wagering game offered in the casino or operator's facility such that all such games can be equalized and cross referenced for generation of corresponding tournament points on winning spins or outcomes.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The tournament points to credit value association can be further understood with respect to Tables 1, 2, and 3 below.

</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Table 1 illustrates a cumulative distribution for a hypothetical volatile wagering game while Table 2 illustrates a cumulative distribution for a hypothetical non-volatile wagering game. As can be seen in both Tables, the Y axis represents the likelihood of a win occurring and the X axis represents the win size. Thus, as can be seen, the higher the win size, the less the likelihood of such a win occurring. For example, with respect to Table 2, a winning outcome should occur 50% of the time, but only 5% of the time will an outcome exceed 106 credits. By analyzing and sub-dividing the cumulative distributions for various games, a tournament scoring system can be implemented that equalizes various wagering games and does not provide an advantage to any player no matter what wagering game the player chooses to play.</p>

Each of the cumulative distributions in Tables 1 and 2 are divided into quartiles (though any distribution could be divided into any number of sections), and each quartile is then associated with a number of tournament points. For example, in both the non-volatile and volatile game, a player receives a single tournament point for 80% of the handle pulls. However, the credit values associated with that one point varies. In the volatile game, a win of 19 credits or less occurs 80% of the time whereas in the non-volatile game, a win of 64 credits or less occurs 80% of the time. Thus, even though the players are winning different credit amounts with respect to the game they are playing, their tournament points and scoring has been equalized across various games. The method for equalizing various wagering games is more fully detailed below.
</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in looking at the mathematics behind constructing the Tournament Score Derivation Table <b>1104</b> it is worth noting that the possible outcomes of a slot spin form a discrete probability distribution. For each integer k&#x2267;0, p<sub>k </sub>is defined as the probability that a spin wins k credits, where:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>p</i><sub>0</sub><i>+p</i><sub>1</sub><i>+p</i><sub>2</sub>+ . . . =1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The cumulative distribution function F(n) may be defined as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F</i>(<i>n</i>)=<i>p</i><sub>0</sub><i>+p</i><sub>1</sub><i>+ . . . +p</i><sub>n</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In other words, F(n) is the probability that a slot spin pays less than or equal to n credits. We also define F(&#x2212;1)=&#x2212;1.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Suppose we wish set up a tournament such that each spin awards N distinct levels of points A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, . . . , A<sub>N </sub>and the corresponding probabilities of being awarded these point levels are given by q<sub>1</sub>, q<sub>2</sub>, . . . , q<sub>N</sub>, respectively. We assume that q<sub>k</sub>&#x3e;0 for each 1&#x2266;k&#x2266;N and q<sub>1</sub>+ . . . +q<sub>N</sub>=1. What follows is an algorithm using the cumulative distribution function to obtain a slot tournament with the desired properties.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Define the cumulative distribution function for the q<sub>i</sub>'s:

</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the previous two formulas F(n<sub>k</sub>) is the probability that a given slot spin pays less than or equal to n credits. A q<sub>k </sub>of Q(k) is the probability of being awarded tournament points at less than or equal to the k<sup>th </sup>point level, where a point level corresponds to a row in the Tournament Score Derivation Table <b>1104</b>. In other words, we are looking for an n such that the probability that a slot spin pays less than or equal to n credits is greater than or equal to the probability of being awarded a tournament point level k [F(n<sub>k</sub>)&#x2267;Q(k)]. And the probability that a slot spin pays less than or equal to n&#x2212;1 credits is less than the probability of being awarded a tournament point level k. In looking at the Zeus column <b>1110</b> of the Tournament Score Derivation Table <b>1104</b>, n<sub>1 </sub>is 44, n<sub>2 </sub>is 94, n<sub>3 </sub>is 129, n<sub>4 </sub>is 361, etc. As to tournament point levels associated with the Zeus game, q<sub>1 </sub>is 0, q<sub>2 </sub>is 10, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">If F(n<sub>k</sub>)=Q(k) for each k, then the following award schedule has the desired properties. Let S be the number of credits won during a slot spin. Award tournament points according to the following formula:

</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In relating the previous formulas to the Tournament Score Derivation Table <b>1104</b>, A<sub>1 </sub>corresponds to an award of 0 tournament points, A<sub>2 </sub>corresponds to an award of ten tournament points, etc. Thus a player playing the Zeus game in a tournament is awarded point level A<sub>1</sub>, which corresponds to zero points, if the number of credits won during a spin (S) is less than or equal to 44 (n<b>1</b>). A player is awarded point level A<sub>2 </sub>if the number credits won during a spin (S) is greater than 44 (n<sub>1</sub>) and less than or equal to 45 (n<sub>2</sub>) where k is always greater or equal to 2.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The discrete nature of a slot distribution means that the condition F(n<sub>k</sub>)=Q(k) will not always be satisfied. This can be handled by means of a &#x201c;tournament booster.&#x201d; The player is awarded tournament points according to the above formula. On random spins additional tournament points will be awarded. This is to assure that the probability a player is awarded A<sub>k </sub>tournament points is exactly q<sub>k</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The gaming system(s) described herein may utilize a Player</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Return Formula to calculate the amount of a player's win based upon their finishing order in a particular tournament. In one embodiment, the player return formula comprises:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Payout=<i>PP&#xd7;N&#xd7;</i>(<i>G&#xd7;AB</i>)&#xd7;<i>T </i>%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the Player Return Formula, PP is the proportion of prize that the player wins, N is the number of players competing in the tournament, G is the number of games required for an entry into the tournament, AB is the average bet for the spins for such entry, and T is the tournament percentage return. Thus, in an example, assume a player named Larry is involved in a seventy two (72) player tournament. The tournament required an entry to be 100 games (or plays) of the base game, as described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Larry's average bet is $1.50. The tournament return percentage is 9%, as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Assume Larry comes in second place in the tournament, which awards 20.5%. Thus, using the player return formula, we can calculate Larry's win:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Payout=<i>PP&#xd7;N&#xd7;</i>(<i>G&#xd7;AB</i>)&#xd7;<i>T </i>%=20.5%&#xd7;72&#xd7;(100&#xd7;$1.50)&#xd7;9%=$199.26<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Thus, Larry is awarded $199.26 for finishing second place in such a tournament. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is shown an example prize proportion table <b>1202</b> that may be used in an embodiment, in conjunction with the player return formula to calculate an award that is awarded to a tournament participant. In an embodiment, the table <b>1202</b> contains prize proportion (PP) values that may be used in the player return formula <b>1202</b> to calculate a player's return. A prize proportion may be determined from the prize proportion table <b>1202</b> based on the finishing position of a tournament participant (left hand column) and the number of players in the tournament (top row). Thus, in the example above, Larry finished second in a seventy two person tournament. By cross-referencing the second finishing position (second row) with the seventy two person tournament (last column), it is seen that 20.5% is the appropriate payout percentage (PP) to be used in the player return formula.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the gaming system(s) described, all tournament awards won by the various entrants into the tournaments available are provided via the player return formula. However, even though the prizes or awards are actually calculated using the player return formula, players may be more familiar with a &#x201c;prize pool&#x201d; concept. Thus, an alternative presentation technique may be employed which utilizes a Prize Pool and a Tournament Multiplier, as referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In such an embodiment, a prize pool formula is used, albeit for presentation purposes only.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In such embodiments, the following prize pool formula may be used:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Prize Pool=<i>N&#xd7;</i>(<i>G&#xd7;BB</i>)&#xd7;<i>T </i>%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the prize pool formula, N equals the number of players involved in the tournament, G is the number of games required for an entry into the tournament, BB equals the base bet, or minimum bet permitted on a play of a wagering game for eligibility into the tournament, and T is the tournament percentage return. Thus, using the example above for the tournament in which Larry is competing in, the tournament is a 72 person tournament for 100 games. Assume that the eligibility requirements call for a player to make a minimum wager of at least $0.30 on each spin or play of the wagering game in order to earn tournament points and create a tournament entry. Therefore, the prize pool can be calculated using the prize pool formula above:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Prize Pool=<i>N&#xd7;</i>(<i>G&#xd7;BB</i>)&#xd7;<i>T </i>%=72&#xd7;(100&#xd7;$0.30)&#xd7;9%=$194.40<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">This creates a &#x201c;prize pool&#x201d; based upon the minimum wager amount, since the operator can be assured that all players will be betting at least the minimum required amount. This prize pool amount can be used to promote the tournament, and can be displayed to players competing in the tournament. In addition to the prize pool amount, however, players participating in the tournament and making wagers greater than the minimum wager will be creating and enhancing a Tournament Multiplier, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The tournament multiplier will increase as more higher (non-minimum) wagers are made, and will be utilized in increasing the player's ultimate payout in a tournament.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is an example Tournament Multiplier tracking table <b>1302</b>. In such example, assume that the minimum wager is one credit per line. Thus, some embodiments may have a requirement that all pay lines be wagered upon. When a player is playing in tournament mode, a tournament multiplier tracking table may be activated in memory of the gaming system to track the player's tournament multiplier which is presented to them on the display, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Upon commencement of play in tournament mode, the player's tournament multiplier begins at one (1&#xd7;). On the first spin, in this example, the player makes only the minimum wager on the wagering game, one credit per line, as seen in the second column of the table. Thus, the player's tournament multiplier remains at one. On the second spin, the player doubles his wager to two credits per line. Thus, the tournament multiplier increases to 1.5&#xd7;. The tournament multiplier is cumulative of all spins, and is a function of how much the player's wager exceeds the minimum bet.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">On the third spin, the player has made a minimum wager again, and his net tournament multiplier has dropped to 1.33&#xd7;. On the fourth spin the player increases his wager to five times the minimum bet, and his tournament multiplier increased to 2.25&#xd7;. At the conclusion of all ten spins, the player's tournament multiplier is 3.20&#xd7; This tracking continues until the player has completed all of the games required for an entry into the tournament, for example, the 100 games required in the examples herein. At the conclusion of all 100 games, the player's tournament score is complete, and his net tournament multiplier tracked by the table is displayed to him on the display, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In an embodiment, the tournament multiplier is a function of the player's average bet per line for all spins executed in a tournament by a player. Thus, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, over the course of ten spins, the player has wagered thirty two (32) credits per line (summing up the Bet Per Line column of the table). Dividing this number by the number of spins (10), yields the net tournament multiplier of 3.20&#xd7;.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The prize pool formula and tournament multiplier may be used to calculate an individual player's award in the tournament. For example, in Larry's example tournament herein, Larry finished second place in a 72 person tournament, which pays out 20.5% for such a finish (in accordance with the prize proportion table <b>1202</b>). Larry's average bet (AB) was $1.50 which is five times larger than the minimum or base bet (BB) of $0.30. Thus, at the conclusion of 100 games, Larry's tournament multiplier is 5&#xd7;, as tracked in his tournament multiplier tracking table.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Recall that the prize pool was calculated above to be $194.40 using the prize pool formula. Larry's second place finish out of 72 players entitles him to 20.5% of the prize pool, which is $39.85. However, this individual win is further multiplied by Larry's tournament multiplier to compensate Larry for making bets in excess of the minimum wager. Thus, Larry's portion of the prize pool ($39.85) is multiplied by his tournament multiplier (5&#xd7;) to arrive at Larry's award, which is $199.26. As can be seen this award of $199.26 is the same as that arrived at by using the player return formula above. Thus, the prize pool formula, based upon a minimum wager or base bet (BB), arrives at the same result as the player return formula, based upon an average bet (AB), because of the application of the player's tournament multiplier. This is because the tournament multiplier is dependent upon tracking of how much the player's actual wagers exceed the base bet.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, displayed is a chart <b>1402</b> of an example accounting of a tournament conducted by the gaming system(s) described herein. In one embodiment, the information displayed in the example accounting chart <b>1402</b> is the information that is tracked for one tournament. The chart <b>1402</b> and information contained therein, are stored in a central computer, for example the tournament server of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, that is part of the gaming system. In this embodiment, the information tracked includes a tournament number <b>1404</b>, a number of entries in a tournament <b>1406</b>, a number of games comprising an entry into the tournament <b>1408</b>, base denomination wagered <b>1410</b>, a base bet or wager <b>1412</b>, the tournament return <b>1414</b>, a tournament fee <b>1416</b>, a prize pool <b>1418</b>, finishing positions <b>1420</b>, payout percentages <b>1422</b>, tournament multipliers <b>1424</b> for each finisher, a total payout <b>1426</b> for each finisher, a total outlay <b>1428</b>, a total income <b>1430</b>, a net revenue <b>1432</b>, and an average player multiplier <b>1434</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, the tournament number <b>1404</b> is a number that uniquely identifies a tournament. The number of entries <b>1406</b> is the number of players entered into the tournament (e.g., 72). The number of games <b>1408</b> in the tournament is the number of spins a player performs to create an entry into the tournament (e.g., 100). The tournament return <b>1414</b> is 9% and the tournament fee is 1%, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The Prize Pool <b>1418</b> is the Prize Pool calculated by using the prize pool formula herein (e.g., $194.40). The payout percentage <b>1422</b> is taken from the appropriate prize proportion table (e.g., the table <b>1202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), which indicates the percentage awarded to each player based upon number of players and finishing order. The number of finishing positions <b>1420</b> is also taken from such table. The tournament multiplier <b>1424</b> is collected from the various tournament multipliers calculated for the players in the finishing positions <b>1420</b>, as discussed herein. The total payout <b>1426</b> for each player is the award awarded to each player in one of the finishing positions <b>1420</b>. As discussed before, it can be derived from the player return formula or the prize pool formula as described.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The average player multiplier <b>1434</b> is the average multiplier for all players participating in a tournament, and is tracked so that an operator may see how players as a whole are wagering in comparison to the minimum wager or base bet. The total outlay <b>1428</b> is the sum of all of the payouts <b>1426</b> paid to the finishing players in the tournament, and thus comprises a total amount awarded for a tournament. The total income <b>1430</b> is the total amount of money wagered by players participating in a tournament in creating their tournament entries. The net revenue <b>1432</b> is the total income <b>1430</b> minus the total outlay <b>1428</b>. Thus, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in some tournaments, the net income is negative, meaning the casino or operator paid out more awards to the players than collected from the participants in the tournament. This may occur from time to time. However, over time, the net income will on average be positive. This is because the net expected value (the base game return 80%, plus the tournament return 9%, plus the tournament fee 1%) of 90%, for example, will on average yield a profit over time.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">When only a few players are involved in a tournament, player collusion could affect the tournament outcome. To ensure collusion does not affect a tournament outcome, a minimum number of participants may be required for a tournament to begin or run. In one embodiment, the minimum number of players is ten. If a tournament does not proceed due to insufficient number of entries, players that entered the cancelled tournament are refunded the expected value of their tournament entry. It should be understood that a player's completion of his or her entries into a tournament need not be accomplished at once, or even in one gaming session. In an embodiment, players may leave play of a gaming device and return at a later time to complete the remainder of their tournament entry. In some embodiments, it may be required that all spins or plays of the wagering game comprising the tournament entry be completed during an active period for the tournament, for example, during the hour for an hourly tournament or by the end of the day for a daily tournament.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Using the gaming system(s) described herein, players may access tournament results. For example, using any of the remote computing devices in the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, players can gain access to information stored on the tournament server therein. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, depicted is an example results table <b>1502</b> of a completed tournament stored in memory of the gaming system, for example on such a tournament server. In the embodiment depicted, the results table <b>1502</b> is comprised of a tournament number <b>1504</b>, a column displaying players images <b>1506</b> (which could a photograph, avatar, or any other graphic selected), a column displaying players finishing positions <b>1508</b>, a column displaying players names <b>1510</b> (or perhaps other identifiers, such as screen names) and a column displaying a number of tournament points achieved <b>1512</b>. Additional information, such as payouts and awards may be displayed in alternative embodiments. In some embodiments, when registering for a tournament a player may select custom options such as a screen name and an avatar. In the embodiment depicted, the screen name and avatar are displayed in the result tables. As shown in the example display, a player's avatar, finishing position, player name and points awarded are displayed in the same row.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the player named Joe Batalucca has logged in to check his performance in tournament number <b>10292</b>. As a result, the logged in player's name and results are highlighted by a box around the row containing his information. As seen, Joe Batalucca has finished in 533<sup>rd </sup>place for his entry in which he accumulated 9,241 tournament points. Also displayed are Joe Batalucca's name <b>1510</b> and image <b>1506</b>. The results table <b>1502</b> may be displayed in many places. One aspect of the gaming system(s) described herein is that a player may be able to check tournament scores in any number of places regardless of where the tournament is played. Thus the table may be displayed on a primary gaming screen, a secondary gaming screen or on a public display inside a casino. Alternatively, the display may be accessible via the Internet or downloadable to a communication device such as an personal digital assistant. The gaming system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example, permits such remote and varied access to such information.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Other information may also be accessible by such players. For example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, another example tournament information display <b>1602</b> is shown. In some embodiments, the information display <b>1602</b> displays information concerning tournament information, such as number of players and prize pool, which may be of interest to a player contemplating joining or entering a tournament, or seeing past results of a completed tournament. In an embodiment, the display displays a number of players field <b>1604</b> and a Prize Pool field <b>1606</b>. In the example depicted, the number of players involved in the tournament is two thousand three hundred and sixty-eight and the prize pool is nine thousand two hundred and sixty-three dollars. The prize pool <b>1606</b> is calculated in accordance with the prize pool formula described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In accordance with one embodiment, gaming systems offering system wide tournament features keep player's entries, progress, and results private from other players until a tournament is completed. Keeping scores private while a tournament is in play ensures that others will not be discouraged from entering the tournament because a player participating in the tournament has posted a high score. Furthermore, it ensures the fairest outcome for all players. Thus, in an embodiment, while a tournament is ongoing, the only information displayed in a tournament information display <b>1602</b> is the number of players participating in the tournament and the prize pool. This may incentivize others to join the tournament due to the perceived popularity of the tournament.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Yet other information accessible by players may include a Wall of Champions, such as that displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Because tournaments conducted on such gaming systems described herein are not conducted in real time (simultaneous play of all players), it is vital that players be able to access tournament results as easily and conveniently as possible. One way a player may access tournament results is by viewing the Wall of Champions display <b>1714</b>. In an embodiment the Wall of Champions display <b>1714</b> contains screens which communicate information such as a championship winner <b>1716</b>, the a list of the best tournament players <b>1718</b>, the results of a particular tournament <b>1720</b> and a &#x201c;Big Winner&#x201d; winner of a tournament <b>1722</b>. In an embodiment, the &#x201c;Big Winner&#x201d; of a tournament is a player who is awarded the largest award in the tournament, even if that player did not finish in first place. This may occur, for example, if a lower finishing player had a larger tournament multiplier so as to achieve a larger individual payout, in accordance with the prize pool and player return formulas.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The Wall of Champions display <b>1714</b> may be displayed publicly in a casino or on gaming devices therein, so as to allow a players to view such information. Players listed on the Wall of Champions may be able to experience a sense of pride by &#x201c;seeing their name in lights&#x201d; or otherwise enjoy bragging rights associated with their accomplishments. Additionally, or alternatively, the Wall of Champions may be accessible over the Internet, or downloaded to a personal communication device, in accordance with the abilities of the gaming system. Alternatively, the Wall of Champions display <b>1714</b> may be displayed in a primary or secondary display of a gaming machine when a player logs into the system, or the display <b>1714</b> may be displayed in a primary or secondary display of a gaming machine if a tournament finishes while a player is still playing (for example as a pop up screen upon tournament completion). Regardless of how the Wall of Champions is displayed, it provides players with easy access to the results of a tournament.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Yet another information display utilized by the gaming system(s) herein may include a results display, such as the results display depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. This example results display <b>1814</b> contains the results of an individual player's performance while participating in a tournament on the gaming system. In response to a triggering event, the results display <b>1814</b> may be provided to the player. For example, upon the conclusion of the relevant tournament, the results display <b>1814</b> may pop up on a gaming device in which the player is logged in or registered so as to automatically communicate the results thereof to the player. In other embodiments, the results display <b>1814</b> may be retrieved by the player in any of the number of ways described herein with reference to other tournament information. In the embodiment depicted, the results communicated to the player in the results display <b>1814</b> include a tournament number <b>1802</b>, the player's finishing position <b>1804</b>, the portion of the prize pool awarded to the player <b>1806</b>, a tournament multiplier <b>1808</b> and a total award awarded to the player <b>1810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, yet another information display accessible to players includes a player profile display <b>1914</b> that displays a player's performance information. The player profile display <b>1914</b> may be used to notify a player about the player's tournament performance, a player's default settings, and leader board positions. In an embodiment, a portion of a player profile display <b>1914</b> may display a player image <b>1902</b>. The image <b>1902</b> may be a picture, photograph, avatar, or any other graphic or design chosen by the player or assigned by the operator. In some embodiments, the player profile display <b>1914</b> displays a player's screen name <b>1904</b> along with past tournament information, such as, a &#x201c;Big Win&#x201d; <b>1906</b> (the player's biggest win to date) and &#x201c;Tournaments Won&#x201d; <b>1908</b>. In the example depicted, the displayed screen name is &#x201c;Joe &#x2018;Bruiser&#x2019; Batalucca.&#x201d; The &#x201c;Big Win&#x201d; <b>1906</b> may be a largest number of credits the player was awarded in a tournament. In this example, the largest previous award awarded to the player is a ten thousand credit award. Further, the tournaments won field <b>1908</b> shows that the player in this example previously won a &#x201c;Jackpot Party&#x201d; tournament and a &#x201c;Clint Eastwood&#x201d; tournament.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the embodiment depicted, a portion of the display <b>1914</b> displays default settings <b>1910</b> the player may adjust for tournament play. In an embodiment, the player may be able to set an autoplay setting <b>1912</b> and an anonymity setting <b>1916</b>. If the autoplay setting <b>1912</b> is enabled, a player may permit the system to autoplay a tournament for him. This, for example, may cause any gaming terminal in which the player is logged in to default to &#x201c;Tournament Mode&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;Cash Mode&#x201d; when available. The player may then check the results remotely. The anonymity setting <b>1916</b> may allow a player to keep portions of his profile anonymous. For example, a player may want to keep his avatar and/or screen name anonymous. If a player chooses to remain anonymous, a generic marker may be displayed in place of a player's avatar or name.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, a portion of the display displays the player's Leaderboard Positions <b>1918</b>. In the embodiment depicted, whenever a tournament in which the player was competing is completed, the tournament information (such as finishing position and tournament points earned in his entry) are logged in the players' Leaderboard <b>1918</b>. This way a player may track his performance in a plurality of tournaments at one time. A major factor behind maintaining a Leaderboard is player prestige. Players with the greatest skill levels are recognized with higher Leaderboard standings. Furthermore, Leaderboards help build a community experience and a sense of loyalty with Winners Network Tournaments.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In some embodiments prizes are offered for Leaderboard achievements. For example, yearly, monthly and weekly prizes may be offered for placing high on a Leaderboard. Also, prizes may be awarded for reaching a set number of Leaderboard points for a year. For example, a prize may be awarded for reaching one thousand, five thousand, and ten thousand Leaderboard points. Furthermore, a Lifetime Achievement award may be awarded when a player reaches one million Leaderboard points.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some embodiments, Leaderboard points may be awarded based on the following formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P=</i>8*SQRT(<i>N/R</i>)*(Log(<i>C+</i>3))<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In such formula, &#x201c;P&#x201d; is the number of Leaderboard points awarded. The players rank in the relevant tournament is represented by &#x201c;R.&#x201d; The number of players in the tournament field is represented by &#x201c;N.&#x201d; The base bet wagered in the tournament is represented by &#x201c;C.&#x201d; &#x2018;SQRT(N/R)&#x2019; weighs a player's performance by how well the player finished. The SQRT flattens the effect on the size of the field. Thus, finishing first in a one hundred player field is not ten times better than finishing first in a field of ten. Flattening the effect of the size of the field also flattens the volatility of results and keeps Leaderboard standings close. Log(C+3) weighs a player's performance by the cost of the event. The Log function flattens the effect of the cost. Thus, a one hundred dollar event does not result in a ten times better relative leader board position than a ten dollar event. The logarithmic function makes the one hundred dollar event two times better than the ten dollar event. Adding three to the variable C ensures that the result of Log(C+3) is always greater than one, even for a free event.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In an alternative embodiment, a tournament may have autoplay capabilities. A player may set up autoplay capabilities from a kiosk. Once autoplay capabilities have been set up, the tournaments may be automatically played by the system, for example, even while the player is not at a casino. The player can remotely follow autoplay results on the Internet, or by accessing information through other gaming devices.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In still another embodiment, the tournament is played over an entire jurisdiction, with entries being made jurisdiction wide. This may entail players entering a tournament from different casinos. Alternatively, players may enter a tournament at a KIOSK or other remote locations and either autoplay the tournament, or play the tournament at a casino at a later time. A player may additionally enter a tournament on-line. Regardless of the method a player chooses to enter a tournament, scores are maintained on a computer of the gaming system, for example the tournament server of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The player may monitor tournament results remotely using the Internet or other means of remote communication. The capabilities of the system may vary based upon the components and configurations of the hardware and software therein.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In yet another alternative embodiment, the methods and systems of the tournament may be applied to video poker tournaments. Thus a video poker player may compete against other video poker players with scores maintained on a computer or network of computers. The system may be configured such that a portion of the return of each participating video poker terminal is used to fund the tournament, as described herein with reference to slot games. Thus, each video poker terminal may yield a lower cash return (80% for example instead of 90%) in order to create a source from which to fund the tournament. The player may monitor tournament results remotely using the Internet or through other means of remote communication.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention, which is set forth in the following claims.</p>
