<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Patent Application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-014394. The disclosure of the Japanese Patent Application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device. In particular, the present invention relates to an electrostatic discharge protection circuit for a semiconductor device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In semiconductor devices, an electrostatic discharge protection circuit for protecting an internal circuit from the ESD (electrostatic discharge) surge applied to Input/Output pads is mounted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a circuit diagram of a general configuration of a semiconductor device mounting an electrostatic discharge protection circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a VDD pad <b>101</b>, a signal input pad <b>102</b>, a GND pad <b>103</b>, a high potential power source line <b>104</b>, a signal line <b>105</b>, a low potential power source line (ground line) <b>106</b>, an output circuit <b>107</b>, and an ESD protection elements <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>. The output circuit <b>107</b> is a circuit used for outputting a signal to an outside of the semiconductor device, and includes a final stage output driver <b>108</b> and a predriver <b>109</b>. The final stage output driver includes a PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> and an NMON transistor N<b>1</b>. The predriver <b>109</b> includes a PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> and an NMOS transistor N<b>2</b>. The final stage output driver <b>108</b> drives the signal output pad <b>102</b> in a range from the GND potential to the VDD potential correspondingly to the value of a signal to be outputted to an outside. The predriver <b>109</b> drives a gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> in response to a control signal supplied from an internal circuit (not shown). Though not shown, a predriver having a similar configuration as the predriver <b>109</b> is connected to a gate of the PMOS transistor P<b>1</b>. The ESD protection elements <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> have a function to discharge an ESD surge inputted to the signal output pad <b>102</b> to the high potential power source line <b>104</b> or a low potential power source line <b>106</b> to protect the output circuit <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The off transistor is a typical element used for the ESD protection circuits <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>. The off transistor is a MOS transistor whose gate potential is fixed such that the transistor becomes an off-state under a normal operation, and discharges the ESD surge by a parasitic bipolar operation. Generally, when an NMOS transistor is used as the off transistor, the drain of the NMOS transistor is connected to a signal line, and the source and the drain thereof are connected to the low potential power source line (ground line). On the other hand, when a PMOS transistor is used as the off transistor, the drain of the PMOS transistor is connected to a signal line, and the gate and the source thereof are connected to the high potential power source line. The off transistor discharges the ESD surge by a parasitic bipolar operation when the ESD surge is applied to the drain thereof. By this principle, the off transistor functions effectively as an ESD protection element.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in a circuit configuration using an ESD protection element utilizing a parasitic bipolar operation, the design window becomes smaller in accordance with the downsizing of transistors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph showing a relationship between the breakdown voltage V<sub>BD </sub>of the gate insulating film and the clamp voltage V<sub>clamp </sub>(the voltage during a discharge by a parasitic bipolar operation) when an NMOS transistor is operated by a parasitic bipolar operation. Whereas the breakdown voltage V<sub>BD </sub>rapidly decreases with the decrease of the film thickness of the gate insulating film, the claim voltage V<sub>clamp </sub>does not decrease. As a result, the design window of an ESD protection circuit becomes smaller in association with the decrease of the film thickness of a gate insulating film.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a means for solving such a problem, a circuit configuration is known in which a thyristor is used as an ESD protection element and a trigger current is supplied by a trigger element which operates at a low voltage (referring patent document 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication JP-P2008-218886A, and non-patent document 1: EOS/ESD Symposium 07-376, &#x201c;A Low-Leakage SCR Design Using Trigger-PMOS Modulations for ESD Protection&#x201d;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a circuit diagram of an electrostatic discharge protection circuit of such a circuit configuration. The electrostatic discharge protection circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes: a VDD pad <b>201</b>; a signal pad <b>202</b>; a GND pad <b>203</b>; a high potential power source line <b>204</b>; a signal line <b>205</b>; a low potential power source line (ground line) <b>206</b>; a thyristor <b>207</b>; a diode for ESD protection D<b>1</b>; and a PMOS transistor P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the electrostatic discharge protection circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> functions as a trigger element which supplies a trigger current to the thyristor <b>2047</b>.

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, according to an investigation of the present inventor, another problem exists in the circuit configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Specifically, in the circuit configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the ESD surge voltage V<sub>ESD </sub>when an ESD surge is applied is directly applied to the element of a protection target so that there is a possibility that the element of a protection target is broken. More specifically, under a condition that a power source voltage is not supplied to the semiconductor device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> in the predriver <b>109</b> is floating, so that there is a case that the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> turns into the ON state. In this case, when an ESD surge being positive to the GND pad <b>103</b> is applied to the signal output pad <b>102</b>, the voltage V<sub>ESD</sub>, at which the main ESD protection element clamps an ESD surge, is applied between the drain and the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b>. At this timing, if the ESD protection element <b>112</b> is not able to perform the clamping to become a low voltage at which the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is not broken, a large stress voltage V<sub>stress </sub>is applied to the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> in the output circuit <b>107</b>, so that the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> becomes broken.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above explained problem is not solved even in the circuit configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the circuit configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in a case where the performance of the thyristor <b>207</b> is dropped off by taking an advantage of the area or a parasitic region, or in a case where the surge is large, the clamp voltage becomes high, the ESD surge voltage V<sub>ESD </sub>is applied to an internal circuit, so that the internal circuit may be broken.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For solving such a problem, according to an aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor device includes: a high potential power source line; a first power source line pad connected to the high potential power source line; a low potential power source line; a second power source line pad connected to the low potential power source line; a signal line; a signal pad connected to the signal line; a main protection circuit part which discharges an ESD surge applied to a first pad which is any of the first power source line pad, the second power source line pad, and the signal pad to a second pad which is any of the first power source line pad, the second power source line pad, and the signal pad and other than the first pad; and a sub protection circuit part; and a protection target circuit. The protection target circuit includes: an output MOS transistor whose drain is connected to the signal line, and whose source is connected to one power source line being one of the high potential power source line and the low potential power source line; and a circuit element connected between a gate of the output MOS transistor and the one power source line and configured to function as a resistive element. The sub protection circuit includes a first PMOS transistor being connected between the signal line and the gate of the output MOS transistor and whose gate and back gate are connected to the high potential power source line.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to this configuration, when an ESD surge is applied to a signal output pad, the first PMOS transistor in the sub protection circuit part operates at a relatively low voltage (around the threshold voltage of the MOS transistor), so that a discharge path through the first PMOS transistor and a circuit element functions as a resistive element is formed. When a discharge current flows through this discharge path, the potential difference between the drain and the gate of the output MOS transistor decreases caused by the voltage drop in the circuit element functions as a resistive element, so that a circuit of the protection target is effectively protected.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, it is possible to use an NMOS transistor for the sub protection circuit part. In such a case, according to another aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor device includes: a high potential power source line; a first power source line pad connected to the high potential power source line; a low potential power source line; a second power source line pad connected to the low potential power source line; a signal line; a signal pad connected to the signal line; a main protection circuit part which discharges an ESD surge applied to a first pad which is any of the first power source line pad, the second power source line pad, and the signal pad to a second pad which is any of the first power source line pad, the second power source line pad, and the signal pad and other than the first pad; and a sub protection circuit part; and a protection target circuit. The protection target circuit includes: an output MOS transistor whose drain is connected to the signal line, and whose source is connected to one power source line being one of the high potential power source line and the low potential power source line; and a circuit element connected between a gate of the output MOS transistor and the one power source line and configured to function as a resistive element. The sub protection circuit includes a first NMOS transistor being connected between the signal line and the gate of the output MOS transistor and whose gate and back gate are connected to the low potential power source line.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present invention, it is possible to effectively suppress the breaking of a circuit of the protection target caused by the ESD surge voltage directly applied to the circuit of the protection target.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">First Embodiment:</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a configuration of a configuration of a semiconductor device according to a first embodiment of the present invention, specifically, a configuration of an electrostatic discharge protection circuit integrated on the semiconductor device. In the present embodiment, the semiconductor device includes: a VDD pad <b>1</b>; a signal output pad <b>2</b>; a GND pad <b>3</b>; a high potential power source line <b>4</b>; a signal line <b>5</b>; a low potential power source line (ground line) <b>6</b>; and an output circuit <b>7</b>. The VDD pad <b>1</b>, the signal output pad <b>2</b>, and the GND pad <b>3</b> are respectively connected to the high potential power source line <b>4</b>, the signal line <b>5</b>, and the low potential power source line <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The output circuit <b>7</b> is a circuit used for outputting a signal to an outside, and includes a final stage output driver <b>8</b> and a predriver <b>9</b><i>a</i>. The final stage output driver <b>8</b> includes a PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> and an NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> as output transistors, and drives the signal output pad <b>2</b> from a GND potential to the VDD potential in accordance with a signal value to be outputted to the outside. In detail, the PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> is formed between the signal line <b>5</b> and the high potential power source line <b>4</b>, whose source is connected to the high potential power source line <b>4</b>, and whose drain is connected to the node A of the signal line <b>5</b>. The PMOS transistor P<b>1</b> has a function to pull up the signal output pad <b>2</b> to the VDD potential. On the other hand, the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is formed between the signal line <b>5</b> and the low potential power source line <b>6</b>, whose source is connected to the low voltage power source line <b>6</b>, and whose drain is connected to the node A of the signal line <b>5</b>. The NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> has a function to pull down the signal output pad <b>2</b> to the VDD potential.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The predriver <b>9</b><i>a </i>drives a gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> of the final stage output driver <b>8</b> in accordance with a control signal supplied from an internal circuit (not shown). The predriver <b>9</b><i>a </i>includes a PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> and an NMOS transistor N<b>2</b>. The source of the PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> is connected to a power source line, and the drain thereof is connected to the node B connected to the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b>. The PMOS transistor P<b>2</b> has a function to pull up the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> to the VDD potential. On the other hand, the source of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> is connected to the low potential power source line <b>6</b>, and the drain thereof is connected to the node B. The NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> has a function to pull down the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> to the GND potential. Though not shown, a predriver having a similar configuration to the predriver <b>9</b><i>a </i>is connected to the gate of the PMOS transistor P<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> are formed to protect the output circuit <b>7</b>, especially to protect the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> of the output circuit <b>7</b>. The main ESD protection element <b>11</b> is inserted between the signal line <b>5</b> and the high potential power source line <b>4</b>, and the main ESD protection element p<b>12</b> is inserted between the signal line <b>5</b> and the low potential power source line <b>6</b>. The source of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> is connected to the node A of the signal line <b>5</b>, and the drain thereof is connected to the node B connected to the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b>, and the gate and the back gate thereof are connected to the high potential power source line <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The main ESD elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> form a main protection circuit part having a function to flow a discharge current mainly to the high potential power source line <b>4</b> or a low potential power source line <b>6</b> when an ESD surge is applied to the signal output pad <b>2</b>. The main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> are formed to be able to flow a large current.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the other hand, the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> is a sub ESD protection element inserted for the purpose of relaxing a stress voltage applied to the output circuit <b>7</b>. The PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> forms a sub protection circuit part which additionally performs discharge when an ESD surge is applied to the signal output pad <b>2</b>. The PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> is formed so that a relatively small current flows compared with the main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>. As described later, the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> provides a path for flowing a tiny current to the low potential power source line <b>6</b> via the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> when an ESD surge is applied to the signal output pad <b>2</b>. As a result, the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> has a function to relax the stress voltage V<sub>stress </sub>applied to elements forming the output circuit <b>7</b>, especially to the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As for the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> which functions as a sub ESD protection element, depending on the operation, there is a case in which the node A is higher than the node B in voltage and also a case in which the node B is higher than the node A. Therefore, even a terminal of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> is described as the &#x201c;source&#x201d;, it merely means that it is one of the &#x201c;source&#x201d; and the &#x201c;drain&#x201d;. It is same for the &#x201c;drain&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the followings, operations of the semiconductor device according to the present embodiment, specifically, operations of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> forming a sub protection circuit part is explained in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At first, operations in a normal operation period are explained. In the normal operation period, requirements for the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> is that it is turned off and its off leakage current is small. As explained below in detail, the circuit configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> satisfies such requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in the normal operation period, the high potential power source line <b>4</b> is fixed to the VDD potential, the low potential power source line <b>6</b> is fixed to the GND potential, and a signal of the amplitude between the maximum value of the VDD potential and the minimum value of the GND potential is outputted from the signal output pad <b>2</b>. In this time, because the source potential of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> (the potential of the node A) is same to or less than the gate potential thereof (the VDD potential), the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Note that the back gate potential of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> (the VDD potential) is higher than its source potential (the potential of the signal line <b>5</b>) in the normal operation period. As a result, by the back-gate effect, the absolute value of the threshold voltage of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> becomes larger, and the off-leakage current of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> becomes smaller. The decrease of the leakage current caused by the back-gate effect is especially effective for a case where the semiconductor device according to the present embodiment is used as an output interface of a low voltage differential signaling. When a low voltage differential signal is outputted, a bias voltage (the common mode voltage) is fixed to an intermediate point of the VDD voltage and the GND voltage, and the external output signal is supplied as a signal of a smaller amplitude than the bias voltage. Therefore, the back gate effect is high, and the merits of the decrease of the off-leakage voltage can be further enjoyed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">On the other hand, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows operations in a case where an ESD surge positive to the GND pad <b>3</b> is applied to the signal output pad <b>2</b>. In this case, note that the high potential power source line <b>4</b> is floating and not supplied with a power source voltage. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, Cx is a power source capacitance formed between a high potential power source line <b>4</b> and the low potential power source line <b>6</b> as a parasitic capacitor or an intentionally formed capacitor. The potential of the high potential power source line does not increase until the power source capacitance Cx is fully charged.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, note that the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> in the predriver <b>9</b><i>a </i>is floating. When the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> is floating, there is a case that the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> turns on. As described above, when the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> is turned on when an ESD surge is applied to the signal output pad <b>2</b>, a stress voltage is applied to the gate-drain of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> of the final stage output driver <b>8</b>. The semiconductor device according to the present invention performs an operation to protect the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> from this stress voltage. Therefore, in the following description, NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> is assumed to be turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When an ESD surge is applied, the voltage V<sub>ESD </sub>between the signal line <b>5</b> and the low potential power source line <b>6</b> starts increasing while discharge is performed at the main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>. While the voltage V<sub>ESD </sub>increasing, the high potential power source line <b>4</b> is pulled to the GND potential by the power source capacitance Cx. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the potential of the signal line <b>5</b> becomes higher than the potential of the high potential power source line <b>4</b>. When the potential difference between the signal line <b>5</b> and the high potential power source line <b>4</b> exceeds the threshold voltage Vt of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>, the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> turns on and performs a MOS operation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the PMOS transistor turns on, a discharge path from the signal output pad <b>2</b>, via signal line <b>5</b>, the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>, and the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> to the low potential power source line <b>6</b> is formed. When a discharge current I<sub>2nd </sub>flows through this discharge path, the potential of the node B becomes higher than the potential of the low potential power source line <b>6</b> caused by the channel resistance Rn of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b>, and the stress voltage V<sub>stress </sub>applied between the source-drain of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is decreased. As a result, the breaking of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is effectively prevented. Note that, only a small discharge current flows through the discharge path passing through the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>, and almost all of the discharge current generated by the application of the ESD surge flows through the discharge pass passing through the main ESD protection element <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this operation, it is important that the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> provides a discharge path based on a normal MOS operation (not based on a parasitic bipolar operation). Because the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> operates based on the MOS operation, the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> operates at a low voltage, so that the protection effect of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is high. If a discharge path is provided based on the parasitic bipolar operation as a case of the off transistor, the operation voltage becomes high to a value about 4V, and the relaxation effect of the stress voltage V<sub>stress </sub>applied to the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is not enough. On the other hand, according to the configuration of the present embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> performs a MOS operation and the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> operates at a low voltage, so that the relaxation effect of the stress voltage V<sub>stress </sub>is high.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the circuit configuration according to the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, there is a possibility that the following problem occurs. If the claim voltage of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> which functions as a sub ESD protection element is too small compared with the clamp voltage of the main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, most of a discharge current flows into the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>. As a result, the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> is broken down before the main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> starts to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">However, this problem is not important in actual. In association with the progress of miniaturization and adopting of lower power source voltage, thyristor type protection elements have become available, and it has become possible for the voltage increase at a discharge to be lower than about 7V. In addition, in association with further miniaturization and lower power source voltage, further decrease of the operation voltage of the main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> can be expected. When the main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> having a low clamp voltage of about 7V, even a PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> in the present embodiment whose operation start voltage is about the threshold voltage is adopted, the difference between the claim voltages of the main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> and the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> becomes small value about 6V, so that the problem of breaking of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The protection of an output NMOS transistor using the MOS operation of a PMOS transistor as described in the present embodiment can be applied to output circuits having other circuit configuration, for example, in a case where an output NMOS transistor is connected between a signal line and a low potential power source line. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the present invention can be applied for a protection of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> of the final stage stacked output driver <b>8</b><i>a </i>which includes NMOS transistors N<b>1</b>, N<b>4</b> connected between the signal line <b>5</b> and the low potential power source line <b>6</b> in cascade and the resistive element R<b>1</b> connected between the high potential power source line <b>4</b> and the signal line <b>5</b>. In this configuration, the NMOS transistor N<b>4</b> functions as a current source, and the resistive element R<b>1</b> functions as a load. Also in such a configuration, when an ESD surge positive to the GND pad <b>3</b> is applied to the signal output pad <b>2</b>, the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> performs the MOS operation, and a discharge path from the signal output pad <b>2</b> via the signal line <b>5</b>, the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>, and the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> to the low potential power source line <b>6</b> is formed. When a discharge current I<sub>2nd </sub>flows through this discharge path, the potential of the node B (the gate of the NMOS transistor) increases caused by the channel resistance Rn of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> so that the stress voltage V<sub>stress </sub>applied between the drain-gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is relaxed. As a result, the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is protected.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, though a circuit configuration in which a discharge current I<sub>2nd </sub>flows via the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> is demonstrated in the first embodiment, other kind of element which can functions as a resistive element can be used instead of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b>. In the operation of the present embodiment, the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> functions merely as a resistive element. For example, in the predriver <b>9</b><i>a</i>, a resistive element or a NMOS transistor in a diode connection may be used instead of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b>. However, for decreasing the power consumption by adopting a CMOS circuit configuration to the predriver <b>9</b><i>a</i>, the configurations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> which use the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> are preferred.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Second Embodiment:</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor device according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In the circuit configuration according to the first embodiment, when further higher speed, for example 10 GHz, is considered, it is required to drastically decrease parasitic capacitances of the main ESD protection element, and in association with that, it is also required to decrease the size of the main ESD protection element. In this case, the discharge capability of the main ESD protection element drops down, so that there is a possibility that an excessive discharge current flows into the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>. When an excessive discharge current flows into the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>, there is a possibility that the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> itself which functions as a sub ESD protection element is broken down. To cope with this problem, in the second embodiment, a means is adopted to prevent an excessive discharge current from flowing into the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">More specifically, the resistive element R<b>2</b> is inserted between the back gate of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> and the high potential power source line <b>4</b>, and the resistive element R<b>3</b> is inserted between the node A of the signal line <b>5</b> and the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> (the node B) in series with the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the resistive element R<b>3</b> is inserted between the source of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> and the node A. However, the resistive element R<b>3</b> may be inserted between the drain of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> and the node B. The amount of the discharge current flows through the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> can be intentionally restricted by the resistive elements R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b>, so that the breaking of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> can be prevented.

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Third Embodiment:</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a circuit diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor device according to a third embodiment of the present invention. In the third embodiment, the diode D<b>2</b> is inserted between the node A of the signal <b>5</b> and the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> (the node B) in series with the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>. The diode D<b>2</b> is inserted so that its forward direction is from the node A to the node B.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The diode D<b>2</b> has a function to prevent the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> from erroneous operations when the potential of the signal output pad <b>2</b> becomes higher than the VDD potential during a normal operation period caused by, for example, a noise. During the normal operation period, the potential of the signal output pad <b>2</b> is the VDD potential at the highest. However, there may be a case where it exceeds the VDD potential caused by a noise or the like. In the configuration of the first embodiment, when a noise level is high and the potential of the node A of the signal line <b>5</b> exceeds the sum of the VDD potential and the threshold voltage Vt of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>, an erroneous operation by which the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> turns on even in the normal operation mode can occur.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The diode D<b>2</b> has a function to prevent the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> from such an erroneous operation effectively. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> where the diode D<b>2</b> is inserted, the operation voltage of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> increases by the forward voltage Vf of the diode D<b>2</b>, and an occurrence of the erroneous operation is suppressed. Though only one diode D<b>2</b> is inserted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, by inserting N number of diodes instead, it is possible to increase the operation voltage of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b> by N&#xd7;Vf. The number of inserted diodes D<b>2</b> is appropriately adjusted in accordance with a desirable operation voltage of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Instead of the diode D<b>2</b>, one or a plurality of PMOS transistors may be inserted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows a configuration in which one PMOS transistor P<b>5</b><i>b </i>is inserted between the node A and the node B in series with the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>. In general, by inserting N number of PMOS transistors P<b>5</b><i>b</i>, the potential of the node A at which the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>, P<b>5</b><i>b </i>operates becomes VDD+(N+1)&#xb7;Vt, and an erroneous operation can be effectively suppressed.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Fourth Embodiment:</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a circuit diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor circuit according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In the fourth embodiment, instead of the PMOS transistor P<b>5</b>, an NMOS transistor N<b>5</b> is connected between the node A of the signal line <b>5</b> and the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> (the node B). The drain of the NMOS transistor N<b>5</b> is connected to the node A, the source thereof is connected to the node B, and the gate and the back gate thereof are connected to the low potential power source line <b>6</b>. The NMOS transistor N<b>5</b> is a sub ESD protection element additionally inserted for the purpose of relaxing a stress voltage applied to the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b>. The NMOS transistor N<b>5</b> is formed so that a relatively smaller current flows compared with the main ESD protection elements <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As for the NMOS transistor N<b>5</b> which functions as a sub ESD protection element, depending on the operation, there is a case where a higher voltage is applied to the node A than the node B, and also a case where a high voltage is applied to the node B than the node A. Therefore, even a terminal of the NMOS transistor N<b>5</b> is described as the &#x201c;source&#x201d;, it merely means that it is one of the &#x201c;source&#x201d; and the &#x201c;drain&#x201d;. It is same for the &#x201c;drain&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A purpose of the configuration of the present embodiment is to prevent the breaking of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> when an ESD surge between the VDD pad <b>1</b> and the signal output pad <b>2</b> being positive to the signal output pad <b>2</b> is applied to the VDD pad <b>1</b>. When an ESD surge positive to the signal output pad <b>2</b> is applied to the VDD pad <b>1</b> and the potential of the high potential power source line <b>4</b>, caused by the power source capacitance Cx between the high potential power source line <b>4</b> and the low potential power source line <b>6</b>, the potential of the low potential power source line <b>6</b> also increases. In this timing, the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> in the predriver <b>9</b><i>a </i>is floating, so that there is a case where the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> turns on. If the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b> turns on, caused by the increase of the potential of the low potential power source line <b>6</b>, a large voltage is applied between the drain-gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b>, and there is a possibility that the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is broken down.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a configuration of the present embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the NMOS transistor N<b>5</b> provides a discharge path between the node A of the signal line <b>5</b> and the gate of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> so that the breaking down of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is prevented. More specifically, when an ESD surge positive to the signal output pad <b>2</b> is applied to the VDD pad <b>1</b>, during a discharge occurs through the path through the main ESD protection element <b>11</b> or the power source/ground ESD protection element <b>13</b> formed between the high potential power source line <b>4</b> and the low potential power source line <b>6</b> and the main ESD protection element <b>12</b>, the voltage V<sub>ESD </sub>between the high potential power source line <b>4</b> and the signal line <b>5</b> increases. While the voltage V<sub>ESD </sub>increases, the low potential power source line <b>6</b> is pulled to a potential same to the high potential power source line <b>4</b> by the power source capacitance Cx. As a result, the potential of the low potential power source line becomes higher than the potential of the signal line <b>5</b>. When the potential difference between the low potential power source line <b>6</b> and the signal line <b>5</b> exceeds the threshold voltage Vt of the NMOS transistor N<b>5</b>, the NMOS transistor N<b>5</b> is turned on and performs the MOS operation.</p>

During the discharge current I<sub>2nd </sub>flows through this discharge path, the potential of the node B drops caused by the channel resistance Rn of the NMOS transistor N<b>2</b>, and the stress voltage V<sub>stress </sub>applied between the source-drain of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> decreases. As a result, the breaking down of the NMOS transistor N<b>1</b> is effectively prevented.</p>
