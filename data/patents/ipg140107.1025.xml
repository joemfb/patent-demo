<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Peel-to-open packages including, but not limited to, sachets, pouches, and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Difficult to open packages can be of concern to consumers, particularly those with limited manual dexterity and/or eyesight. Although a product may be excellent, if it is in a package that is hard to open, a consumer may settle for another product that is in an easier to open package.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Products, especially those that are small and/or intended for a single use, are traditionally packaged in sachets and the like. Sachets generally comprise two layers that are releasably held together with a seal or seals to form an interior cavity. The interior cavity may contain products such as towelettes, creams, medicaments, adhesive strips, ointments, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The layers of a sachet may be peeled apart in order to access the product within. This is typically accomplished by gripping a sachet at one end by each of its layers and exerting a pulling force. As the peel force(s) of the sachet's seal(s) are overcome by the pulling force, the sachet's layers are separated, and the product is ideally exposed to the consumer for removal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Sachets that are currently used for packaging products typically have a seal or seals with constant peel forces located along the longitudinal side edges of the sachet. If a constant pulling force is exerted to peel apart the layers of this type of sachet, momentum may be gained such that the rate of peeling increases as the sachet progressively opens. A momentum gain can have several negative consequences. For example, when the other end of the sachet is reached, the layers may unintentionally be peeled completely apart. As a result, the product may simply fall out of the sachet. If the pulling force is great enough, the product may be ejected some distance from the sachet. In either case, the consumer is relegated to searching for, finding and picking up the product before it may be used. This can be particularly difficult in an environment with low lighting, high moisture and/or if the product has landed in a hard to reach area such as a sink drain. The difficulty may be compounded by a consumer's limited vision and/or manual dexterity.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There remains a need for packages including sachets and the like that may be peeled open in a controlled fashion to expose the product within for removal by the consumer. There remains a need for such packages to have an easily identifiable means of opening. There remains a need for such packages to have grip tabs that provide a means of peeling the packages open in moist environments such as bathrooms.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides improvements in the packaging of products, particularly small ones, including, but not limited to, oral care substances such as denture adhesives. The present packages include peel-to-open sachets, pouches, and the like and are hereinafter collectively referred to as &#x201c;packages&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present packages are made of a first layer and a second layer removably attached together using an adhesive pattern of seal(s) that are characterized by peel forces. The adhesive pattern is designed to provide for controlled opening of the packages. In some embodiments, the adhesive pattern provides for controlled opening of the packages to a predetermined stopping point, such that at least a portion of any product(s) optionally contained therein are presented to the consumer for removal. Further design features include, but are not limited to, offset tabs, textures, color variations, text or combinations thereof, which may further provide for easy, intuitive opening.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a package comprising a first layer and a second layer that are disposed in a face to face relationship such that a cavity is defined between the layers. The package is shaped such that it has a first end and a second end distal therefrom, with first and second opposing longitudinal side edges extending between the first and second ends. The two layers of the package are connected at the second end of the package, and are removably attached by an adhesive pattern comprising: a first seal disposed proximate to the first end of the package; a second seal disposed proximate to the first opposing longitudinal side edge; and a third seal disposed proximate to the second opposing longitudinal side edge. Each seal is characterized by a peel force. At least one of the second and third seals has a variable peel force, meaning that the peel force increases between the first and second ends of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the packages further comprise grip tabs, which are located at the first end of the package. The grip tabs may be present in a variety of configurations. For example, the grip tabs may be provided in a variety of shapes, textures, colors, degrees of transparency and spatial orientations relative to each another.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the packages may contain oral care substances including, but not limited to denture adhesives.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In further embodiments, the invention is directed to a secondary package comprising a plurality of primary packages such as those described above. The primary packages may contain oral care substances, including but not limited to, denture adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other embodiments, aspects and advantages are encompassed within the present invention, and will become better understood with regard to the following description, figures and appended claims.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">All numerical ranges disclosed herein, are meant to encompass each individual number within the range and to encompass any combination of the disclosed upper and lower limits of the ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, various embodiments of the packages <b>1000</b> of the present invention are shown. Each package <b>1000</b> comprises a first layer <b>10</b> and a second layer <b>20</b> that are disposed in a face to face relationship. A cavity <b>30</b> is defined between the first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> such that a product or products <b>600</b> (shown in phantom) may optionally be contained therein. Each package <b>1000</b> is shaped such that it has a first end <b>100</b> and a second end <b>200</b> distal therefrom, with first and second opposing longitudinal side edges <b>300</b>A, <b>300</b>B extending between the first and second ends. The two layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> of each package <b>1000</b> are connected in a face to face relationship at the second end <b>200</b> of the package and are removably attached by an adhesive pattern comprising: a first seal <b>510</b> disposed proximate to the first end of the package <b>1000</b>; a second seal <b>520</b> disposed proximate to the first opposing longitudinal side edge <b>300</b>A of the package; and a third seal <b>530</b> disposed proximate to the second opposing longitudinal side edge <b>300</b>B of the package (each seal is shown in phantom). Each seal is characterized by a peel force. The peel force of at least one of the second and third seals <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> is variable, meaning that the peel force increases between the first end <b>100</b> and second end <b>200</b> of each package <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the packages <b>1000</b> of the present invention comprise a first layer <b>10</b> and a second layer <b>20</b>. The layers of the packages may be formed and connected in any appropriate way as determined by one of skill in the art. For example, in one embodiment two separate pieces of substrate form the first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> which are connected together at the second end <b>200</b> of the package <b>1000</b> using what is termed herein as the &#x201c;fifth seal&#x201d; <b>550</b>, as shown for example from a side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The two separate pieces of substrate may be identical or different in composition. In another embodiment, a single piece of substrate is folded onto itself forming the first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> which are connected together at the second end <b>200</b> of the package <b>1000</b> by virtue of the resulting fold <b>560</b>, as shown for example from a side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Any suitable substrate is of use as the first and second layers of the present packages and may be chosen by one of skill in the art based upon one or a combination of factors. Non-limiting examples of factors include the product(s) to be contained in the package, storage conditions, shipping conditions, conditions under use, aesthetics, visual differentiation between the layers, and the like. For example, if the product is sensitive to light, opaque substrates are of use. If, for example, the package is to be stored or shipped at high temperatures, substrates that will withstand heat are desirable. If for example, the product is sensitive to moisture, substrates that are moisture impervious are desirable. Non-limiting examples of moisture impervious substrates of use in the present invention include foil laminates, foil/polymer laminates or co-extrusions, metals, polymers, metalized films, clear plastics or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, the packages <b>1000</b> of the present invention may take any suitable planar shape. The planar shape of the package <b>1000</b> may be determined by the planar shape of its first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, as well the layers' respective orientation when they are placed in a face to face relation and connected/removably attached. In some embodiments of the invention, the first and second layers are oriented such that when they are placed in a face to face relationship, they overlap. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a plan view of one embodiment in which the package <b>1000</b> comprises two overlapping, rectangular first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> having the same size and shape (the second layer is not visible from this view). In other embodiments, the first and second layers are spatially staggered in a face to face relationship such that when they are connected/removably attached, they do not completely overlap. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a plan view of one embodiment in which the package <b>1000</b> comprises rectangular first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> having the same size and shape that are connected/removably attached such that they do not overlap at the first end <b>100</b> of the resulting package <b>1000</b>. In further embodiments, first and second layers having similar or identical shapes are placed in a face to face relationship with the second layer flipped in relation to the first layer. When the layers are connected/removably attached, they do not completely overlap at the first end of the resulting package. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <b>5</b> show plan views of embodiments in which the first end <b>100</b> of the packages <b>1000</b> comprise first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> that do not completely overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> and <b>10</b>-<b>12</b>A, the first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> are removably attached in a face to face relationship by an adhesive pattern. The adhesive pattern may comprise: one seal with a variable peel strength, as shown for example in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> as seal <b>510</b>; a series of adjoining seals, as shown for example in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> as seals: <b>510</b>; <b>520</b>; <b>530</b>; and <b>550</b>; or a series of discrete seals, as shown for example in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> as seals: <b>510</b>A-C; <b>520</b>A-D; <b>530</b>A-D; and <b>550</b> A and B. In some embodiments, a fourth seal is disposed such that it will intersect the cavity formed between the second and third seals, as shown for example in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> as seal <b>540</b>. In embodiments in which the package comprises a first layer and a second layer that are made from two separate pieces of substrate (rather than a single piece of substrate folded onto itself), a fifth seal may connect the two layers together at the second end of the package, as shown for example in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref> as seal <b>550</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-20</figref>, the packages of the present invention may be opened by peeling apart the first and second layers. To peel the layers apart, sufficient force is exerted to overcome the peel force of the seals removably attaching the layers together to form the package. Each seal is characterized by a peel force, which is constant or variable throughout the seal. Peel force is measured as described in the Methods section infra.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To provide for the controlled opening of the presently invented packages, adhesive patterns and the seals comprising them are chosen so as to regulate the amount of force necessary to peel the first and second layers of the packages apart, without ejecting any product(s) optionally contained therein from the package. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a single piece of substrate is folded onto itself forming the first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> of a package <b>1000</b>, which are connected together at the second end <b>200</b> of the package by virtue of the resulting fold <b>560</b>. The first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> are removably attached at the first end <b>100</b> of the package <b>1000</b> and along the first and second opposing longitudinal side edges <b>300</b>A, <b>300</b>B to the second end <b>200</b> of the package by an adhesive pattern. The adhesive pattern comprises <b>3</b> seals shown in phantom: a first seal <b>510</b> having a peel force &#x201c;A&#x201d; disposed proximate to the first end of the package <b>1000</b>; a second seal <b>520</b> with a variable peel force that ranges from &#x201c;B<sub>1</sub>&#x201d; to &#x201c;B<sub>3</sub>&#x201d; disposed proximate to the first opposing longitudinal side edge <b>300</b>A of the package; and a third seal <b>530</b> with a variable peel force that ranges from &#x201c;C<sub>1</sub>&#x201d; to &#x201c;C<sub>3</sub>&#x201d; disposed proximate to the second opposing longitudinal side edge <b>300</b>B of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Proximate to the first end <b>100</b> of the package <b>1000</b>, the relative peel forces of the three seals may be represented by the formula:

</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this embodiment, the peeling apart of the first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> of the package <b>1000</b> may be initiated by gripping each layer at the first end <b>100</b> of the package between the fingers <b>900</b> as shown in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and from a side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. A first pulling force &#x201c;F<sub>1</sub>&#x201d; that is greater than A and B<sub>1</sub>+C, is exerted such that the first seal <b>510</b> disposed proximate to the first end <b>100</b> of the package <b>1000</b>, and portions of the second and third seals <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> disposed proximate to the first end of the package <b>1000</b>, &#x201c;fail&#x201d;. The seals, <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, fail in that the portions of the first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> that had been fastened together by the seals are allowed to separate as shown in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and from a side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">To further peel apart the layers, a second pulling force &#x201c;F<sub>2</sub>&#x201d; that is greater than B<sub>2</sub>+C<sub>2</sub>, is exerted such that the portions of the second and third seals <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> with these peel forces fail as shown in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, and from a side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The peel forces B<sub>3 </sub>and C<sub>3 </sub>are chosen such that a pulling force in great excess to that of F<sub>2 </sub>would be necessary to cause those portions of the second and third seals <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> with these peel forces to fail. Thus the separation of the first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> is checked at a point at which the peel forces are about equal to B<sub>3</sub>+C<sub>3</sub>. Optional products <b>600</b> are still partially contained by the unopened portion of the package <b>1000</b> and are presented for removal as shown in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, and from a side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">One of skill in the art is able to achieve the separation of the two layers and provide for presentation and removal of any product(s) optionally contained therein by choosing any suitable combination of adhesive patterns of seals, and their relative peel forces. In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-20</figref>, a first seal <b>510</b> is disposed proximate to the first end <b>100</b> of the package <b>1000</b> and second and third seals <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> are respectively disposed proximate to the first and second opposing longitudinal side edges <b>300</b>A, <b>300</b>B of the package. The peel forces of the portions of the second and third seals <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> disposed proximate to the first end <b>100</b> of the package <b>1000</b>, are about equal to the peel force of the first seal <b>510</b>. Moving from the first end <b>100</b> of the package <b>1000</b> toward its second end <b>200</b>, the peel forces of the second and third seals <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> increase incrementally (from B<sub>1</sub>,C<sub>1 </sub>to B<sub>2</sub>,C<sub>2 </sub>to B<sub>3</sub>,C<sub>3</sub>). Alternatively, in some embodiments the increase in the peel strength of the second seal and third seal is continuous over the length of the seal(s). Alternatively, in some embodiments the increase in peel strength of the second seal and third seal is a combination of continuous and incremental over the length of the seal(s). Alternatively, in some embodiments the peel strength of only one of the second and third seals is variable over the length of the seal, either incrementally, continuously or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the peel force of the first seal may be greater than the peel force of the portions of the second and/or third seals disposed proximate to the first end of the package. In these embodiments, a stronger first seal may prevent accidental or premature opening of the package. In embodiments in which a fifth seal connects two separate pieces of substrate together, the peel force of the fifth seal may also be appropriately chosen such that excessive force would be necessary to break it.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The point at which the peel force of a seal increases such that excessive force is required to separate the first and second layers of a package is referred to herein as the &#x201c;stopping point&#x201d;. At the stopping point, at least a portion of the product(s) optionally contained in the package is exposed for removal therefrom. For example, the stopping point <b>590</b> of one embodiment is shown in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> and from a side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The amount of force required to peel apart the layers of a package may be affected by the geometry of the seal(s), and if there is more than one seal, their relative placement. The relative placement of the portions of a single seal, and/or the relative placement of more than one seal, may be described by their &#x201c;angular relation&#x201d;, meaning the angle at which they intersect in a given plane. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the angular relation between the first and third seals <b>510</b>, <b>530</b> is described by the angle <b>580</b>. If the seals do not intersect (as in the case of discrete seals), a straight line may be drawn through each seal, and their angular relation is described by the angle at which the lines ultimately intersect in a given plane. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> (which is an expanded view of two of the discrete seals of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>), a straight line <b>720</b>A is drawn through seal <b>550</b>A and a straight line <b>720</b>B is draw through <b>530</b>D. The angular relation between the seals <b>550</b>A and <b>530</b>D is described by the angle <b>519</b> at which the lines <b>720</b> A and <b>720</b>B intersect.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Portions of a single seal and/or more than one seal may be arranged such that they have any suitable angular relation. Angular relations may be defined by obtuse angles, acute angles, right angles or combinations thereof. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the desired peel force of the first seal <b>510</b> is achieved by making it chevron-shaped such that it may be described by the angle <b>511</b> of about 120&#xb0;. The first seal <b>510</b> adjoins each of the second and third seals <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> such that their relative placement is described by the obtuse angles <b>515</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Seals may be made using any suitable means. Non-limiting examples of sealing means include mechanical sealing and chemical sealing. Without wishing to be bound by theory, mechanical sealing is believed to involve topographical interference between the layers to be sealed. Non-limiting examples of mechanical sealing include crimping, stamping, interlocking mechanisms and combinations thereof. Interlocking mechanisms may comprise any interlocking shape. Non-limiting examples of interlocking mechanisms include protruding tabs, interlocking tabs, interlocking slots, hook and eye-type systems and combinations thereof. Without wishing to be bound by theory, chemical sealing is believed to involve chemical interaction between the layers. Non-limiting examples of chemical means of sealing include the use of: heat sealing; induction sealing; sonic welding; pressure welding; hot melt adhesives; solvent adhesives; solvent welding; glues; resins; rosins; cross-linking agents; and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In embodiments in which the layers of a package comprise thermoplastic materials, heat sealing may be achieved by melting a material or mixture of materials between the layers. The material or mixture of materials may have a melt temperature lower than that of the thermoplastic materials comprising the layers to avoid compromising the integrity of the layers by melting them during the sealing process.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The packages of the present invention may optionally comprise grip tabs at the first end of the package. Grip tabs may aid in the opening of a package by providing appendages with which to grip each of its first and second layers. The packages of the present invention may comprise grip tabs that are the same or different.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Grip tabs are provided using any suitable means. In some embodiments of the present invention, the grip tabs comprise unattached portions of the first and second layers at the first end of the packages. For example, in the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, grip tabs <b>700</b>A and <b>700</b>B respectively comprise the unattached portions of the first and second layers <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> at the first end <b>100</b> of the packages <b>1000</b>. In some embodiments, grip tabs are provided by attaching separate substrates by any suitable means to both the first and second layers of the package. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the grip tabs <b>700</b>A and <b>700</b>B are respectively attached to the first layer <b>10</b> and second layer (not visible from this view). In further embodiments, a grip tab comprising an unattached portion of a first or second layer and a grip tab comprising a separate substrate attached to the other layer are provided. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the grip tab <b>700</b>A is a separate substrate attached to the first layer <b>10</b>, and the grip tab <b>700</b>B is an unattached portion of the second layer <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Grip tabs may have any suitable shape. The shape of a grip tab may be described by a line traced along the edges of the tab that are not connected to the package; the line is referred to herein as the &#x201c;edge line&#x201d;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the tab <b>700</b>A has an edge line <b>710</b>. Grip tabs of use in the present invention may have edge lines selected from the group consisting of curvilinear lines, linear lines or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Grip tabs may comprise texture. If texture is not already present on the substrates comprising the grip tabs, it may be added using any means known in the art including, but not limited to, coating. Any suitable type of texture is of use in the present invention including, but not limited to, bumps, ridges, knurls, indentations, punctures or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of grip tabs with texture are shown as: grip tab <b>700</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; grip tab <b>700</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>; and grip tab <b>700</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. Texture may help to prevent fingers from slipping from the grip tabs, particularly in moist environments such as bathrooms and kitchens. Texture may additionally or alternatively, provide a tactile means of determining from which end the package is designed to be opened, and/or may aid in distinguishing between the grip tabs. In this way, texture can aid the vision impaired in opening the packages of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Grip tabs may have any suitable appearance. Grip tabs may comprise any color or patterns of color. Grip tabs may be opaque, translucent, transparent or combinations thereof. The grip tabs comprising the packages of the present invention may be the same or different in appearance. Grip tabs that differ in appearance may aid in distinguishing between the grip tabs, particularly for the vision impaired who would otherwise have a difficult time seeing where the tabs can be separated from each another.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Grip tabs may or may not overlap each other. Grip tabs can overlap as shown for example in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in which only one tab, <b>700</b>A is visible. Non-limiting examples of grip tabs that do not overlap are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> and <b>21</b>-<b>23</b>. Non-overlapping grip tabs may aid in distinguishing between the grip tabs. Non-overlapping grip tabs may also aid in the gripping of each tab, particularly for those who have limited manual dexterity (such as individuals with arthritis).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The packages of the present invention are designed such that they may contain products. Non-limiting examples of products that may be contained in the present packages include: compositions, creams, formulations, towelettes, toothpicks, powders, adhesives, medicaments, and the like.</p>
