<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an inductive load driving device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-213096, filed Sep. 24, 2010, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2008-85046 discloses an inductive load driving device including: a first switching element coupled between one end of an inductive load and an external power supply; a second switching element coupled between the other end of the inductive load and a ground terminal; a looping circuit configured to supply to the ground terminal, a counter current output from the inductive load when the first switching element is in off-state and the second switching element is in on-state; a counter current regeneration circuit configured to supply to the external power supply, a counter current output from the inductive load when the first and second switching elements are in off-state.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inductive load driving device having the above configuration controls a ratio between durations of the on-state and the off-state of the first switching element (i.e., duty cycle), and thereby can control the rise characteristics. Additionally, the inductive load driving device controls the duty cycle of the second switching element while keeping the first switching element in off-state, and thereby can supply a counter current output from the inductive load to the external power source while controlling the fall characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Regarding the above inductive load driving device, when a power is supplied from a power circuit, such as a booster circuit, a counter current, which is output from the inductive load when the first and second switching elements are in off-state, flows to the output terminal of the power circuit through the counter current regeneration circuit. Generally, the power circuit includes a capacitor coupled between the output terminal of the power circuit and the ground terminal. When the counter current flows to the output terminal of the power circuit, a voltage, which is obtained by subtracting the amount of voltage drop caused by the counter current regeneration circuit from the counter voltage, is applied to the capacitor. When the applied voltage exceeds the rated voltage, the capacitor might be broken down.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Hereinafter, operations of the inductive load driving device <b>1</b> are explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a timing chart illustrating the time relationship between the on/off states of the IG-SW (ignition switch) and the first to fourth switching elements <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and <b>24</b><i>a</i>, and a current flowing through the inductive load <b>4</b> (i.e., load current).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the IG-SW is a switch configured to turn on and off supply of a power voltage to the control device that outputs PWM signals S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b> to the inductive load driving device <b>1</b>. In other words, only while the IG-SW is in on-state, the control device outputs the PWM signals S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b> to the inductive load driving device <b>1</b>. The reference voltage output circuit is configured to output the reference voltage Vref, which is a predetermined voltage, to the inductive load driving device <b>1</b> regardless of the on/off state of the IG-SW.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the IG-SW turns on at a time t<b>1</b>, the control device initiates outputting PWM signals S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b> to the inductive load driving device <b>1</b>. During a period of time t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>, it is assumed that the second switching element <b>19</b> maintains on-state and that the first and third switching elements <b>18</b> and <b>20</b><i>a </i>are on/off-controlled with a predetermined duty cycle. It is noted that the on/off state of the third switching element <b>20</b><i>a </i>is inverse to that of the first switching element <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the first switching element <b>18</b> is in on-state and the third switching element <b>20</b><i>a </i>is in off-state during the period of time t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>, the one end of the inductive load <b>4</b> is electrically coupled to the output terminal <b>32</b> of the booster circuit <b>3</b>, and the other end of the inductive load <b>4</b> is electrically coupled to the ground terminal. At this time, the output voltage Vout (=VB) of the booster circuit <b>3</b> is applied to the inductive load <b>4</b>. For this reason, the load current increases as indicated by an increasing slope at a predetermine angle.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the other hand, when the first switching element <b>18</b> is in off-state and the third switching element <b>20</b><i>a </i>is in on-state during the period of time t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>, the one end of the inductive load <b>4</b> is electrically disconnected from the output terminal <b>32</b> of the booster circuit <b>3</b>, and is electrically coupled to the ground terminal (while the other end of the inductive load <b>4</b> is still electrically coupled to the ground terminal). At this time, the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b> is not applied to the inductive load <b>4</b>, a counter voltage is generated by the inductive load <b>4</b>, and thus a counter current is output from the other end of the inductive load <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The counter current flows to the ground terminal through the second switching element <b>19</b>, and thereby flows back to the one end of the inductive load <b>4</b> through the third switching element <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Thus, even when the first switching element <b>18</b> turns off, the load current of the inductive load <b>4</b> is kept at a given level (actually, the load current decreases a bit, but the decreased amount thereof is negligible).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Thus, the first and third switching elements <b>18</b> and <b>20</b><i>a </i>are PWM-controlled during the period of time t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b> while the second switching element <b>19</b> maintains on-state, and thereby the rise characteristics of the load current can be controlled. Since a value of the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b> does not become equal to or more than the threshold value during the period of time t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>, the fourth switching element <b>24</b><i>a </i>maintains off-state.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">During a period of time t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b>, it is assumed that the second switching element <b>19</b> is on/off-controlled with a predetermined duty cycle while the first switching element <b>18</b> maintains off-state.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the second switching element <b>19</b> is in off-state during the period of time t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b> (while the first switching element <b>18</b> maintains off-state and the third switching element <b>20</b><i>a </i>maintains on-state), the one end of the inductive load <b>4</b> is electrically disconnected from the output terminal <b>32</b> of the booster circuit <b>3</b> (and is electrically coupled to the ground terminal), and the other end of the inductive load <b>4</b> is electrically disconnected from the ground terminal. At this time, the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b> is not applied to the inductive load <b>4</b>, a counter voltage is generated by the inductive load <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the counter voltage becomes larger than the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b>, a counter current flows from the other end of the inductive load <b>4</b> to the output terminal <b>32</b> of the booster circuit <b>3</b> through the first diode <b>21</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the counter current is stored as electric charge in the booster capacitor <b>38</b>. For this reason, the counter current of the inductive load <b>4</b> decreases as indicated by a decreasing slope at a predetermined angel. At this time, a voltage, which is obtained by subtracting the amount of voltage drop caused by the first diode <b>21</b><i>a </i>from the counter voltage generated by the inductive load <b>4</b>, is applied to the booster capacitor <b>38</b>. However, it is assumed at this time that a value of the voltage applied to the booster capacitor <b>38</b> (i.e., the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b>) does not become equal to or more than the threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">On the other hand, when the second switching element <b>19</b> is in on-state during the period of time t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b>, the other end of the inductive load <b>4</b> is electrically coupled to the ground terminal (while the one end of the inductive load <b>4</b> is still electrically coupled to the ground terminal).

Further, the counter current flows back to the one end of the inductive load <b>4</b> through the third switching element <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the load current of the inductive load <b>4</b> maintains at a given level (actually decreases a bit, but the decreased amount thereof is negligible).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, the second switching element <b>19</b> is PWM-controlled during the period of time t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b> while the first switching element <b>18</b> maintains off-state and the third switching element <b>20</b><i>a </i>maintains on-state, and thereby the fall characteristics of the load current can be controlled. Since a value of the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b> does not becomes equal to or more than the threshold value during the period of time t<b>2</b> to t<b>3</b>, the fourth switching element <b>24</b><i>a </i>maintains off-state.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The operations during a period of time t<b>3</b> to t<b>4</b> is the same as those during the period of time t<b>1</b> to t<b>2</b>, and therefore explanations thereof are omitted here. When the IG-SW turns off at a time t<b>4</b>, the control device terminates outputting the PWM signals S<b>1</b> to S<b>3</b> to the inductive load driving device <b>1</b>. Accordingly, after the time t<b>4</b>, the first to third switching elements <b>18</b>, <b>19</b>, and <b>20</b><i>a </i>become in off-state (while the fourth switching element <b>24</b><i>a </i>maintains off-state from the beginning).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As explained above, when both the first and second switching elements <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> become in off-state, a counter voltage is generated by the inductive load <b>4</b>, and a counter current flows from the other end of the inductive load <b>4</b> to the output terminal of the booster circuit <b>3</b>. In other words, a voltage, which is obtained by subtracting the amount of voltage drop caused by the first diode <b>21</b><i>a </i>from the counter voltage generated by the inductive load <b>4</b>, is applied to the booster capacitor <b>38</b>. However, it is assumed that a value of the voltage applied to the booster capacitor <b>38</b> (i.e., the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b>) becomes equal to or more than the threshold value at a time t<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, when a value of the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b> becomes equal to or more than the threshold value at the time t<b>5</b>, the fourth switching element <b>24</b><i>a </i>turns on. Additionally, the output terminal <b>32</b> of the booster circuit <b>3</b> is electrically coupled to the gate terminal of the second switching element <b>19</b>, and the second switching element <b>19</b> turns on. As a result, the other end of the inductive load <b>4</b> is electrically coupled to the ground terminal. Accordingly, the counter current output from the inductive load <b>4</b> flows into the ground terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Thus, when a value of the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b> (i.e., the voltage applied to the booster capacitor <b>38</b>) becomes equal to or more than the threshold value, the second switching element <b>19</b> turns on, and thereby the counter current flows into the ground terminal. Thereby, an increase in the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b> (i.e., an increase in the voltage applied to the booster capacitor <b>38</b>) can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In other words, according to the inductive load driving device <b>1</b> of the first embodiment, the booster capacitor <b>38</b> of the booster circuit <b>3</b> can be prevented from being broken down.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is apparent that the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, and may be modified and changed without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, it has been explained in the first embodiment that the booster circuit <b>3</b> exemplifies a power circuit supplying a power voltage to the inductive load driving device <b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additionally, it has been explained in the first embodiment that the looping circuit <b>20</b> includes the third switching element <b>20</b><i>a</i>.

For example, the looping circuit as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2008-85046 may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, it has been explained in the first embodiment that the counter current regeneration circuit <b>21</b> includes the first diode <b>21</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Moreover, regarding the circuit configuration of the circuit element protection circuit <b>22</b>, any circuit configuration may be used as long as the second switching element <b>19</b> turns on when a value of the output voltage Vout of the booster circuit <b>3</b> becomes equal to or more than the threshold value.</p>
