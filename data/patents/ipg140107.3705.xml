<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Wireless and other external connectivity technology is used in various ways to enhance or improve upon existing radar detector and police activity detection systems. External memory interfaces, such as SD cards or USB, provide external storage. Wireless interfaces such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, 802.11, and wireless personal area network communication protocols, allow a detector processor to interact wirelessly with external devices, such as a Bluetooth headset, a cellular network device providing a server connection, or toggle buttons used to indicate the presence of police activity at a current position. Further, radar detectors are upgraded to provide GPS capabilities, using the existing power/data connector of the radar detector.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to radar detectors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Radar detectors warn drivers of the use of police radar, and the potential for traffic law citations if the driver exceeds the speed limit. The FCC has allocated several regions of the electromagnetic spectrum for police radar use. The bands used by police radar are generally known as the X, K and Ka bands. Each relates to a different part of the spectrum. The X and K bands are relatively narrow frequency ranges, whereas the Ka band is a relatively wide range of frequencies. By the early 1990's, police radar evolved to the point that it could operate almost anywhere in the 1600-megahertz wide Ka band. During that time radar detectors kept pace with models that included descriptive names like &#x201c;Ultra Wide&#x201d; and &#x201c;Super Wide.&#x201d; More recently, police have begun to use laser (optical) systems for detecting speed. This technology was termed LIDAR for &#x201c;LIght Detection And Ranging.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Radar detectors typically comprise a microwave receiver and detection circuitry that is typically realized with a microprocessor or digital signal processor (DSP). Microwave receivers are generally capable of detecting microwave components in the X, K, and very broad Ka band. In various solutions, either a microprocessor or DSP is used to make decisions about the signal content from the microwave receiver. Systems including a digital signal processor have been shown to provide superior performance over solutions based on conventional microprocessors due to the DSP's ability to find and distinguish signals that are buried in noise. Various methods of applying DSP's were disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,954,828, 5,079,553, 5,049,885, and 5,134,406, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Police use of laser has also been countered with laser detectors, such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,206,500, 5,347,120 and 5,365,055, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Products are now available that combined laser detection into a single product with a microwave receiver, to provide comprehensive protection.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The DSP or microprocessor in a modern radar detector is programmable. Accordingly, it can be instructed to manage all of the user interface features such as input switches, lights, sounds, as well as generate control and timing signals for the microwave receiver and/or laser detector. Early in the evolution of the radar detector, consumers sought products that offered a better way to manage the audible volume and duration of warning signals. Good examples of these solutions are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,631,542, 5,164,729, 5,250,951, and 5,300,932, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference, which provide methods for conditioning the response generated by the radar detector.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Methods for conditioning detector response are gaining importance, because there are an increasing number of signals present in the X, K, and Ka bands from products that are completely unrelated to police radar. These products share the same regions of the spectrum and are also licensed by the FCC. The growing number of such signals is rapidly undermining the credibility of radar detector performance. Radar detectors cannot tell the difference between emissions from many of these devices and true police radar systems. As a result, radar detectors are increasingly generating false alarms, effectively &#x201c;crying wolf&#x201d;, reducing the significance of warnings from radar detectors. Among the possible sources of false alarms are microwave door openers, public safety systems such as ARTEMIS, and other radar detectors. At this time, there are very few signal sources that can cause false laser detections in comparison to the substantial list of false microwave signals just described. However certain locations near airports have been demonstrated to cause such problems for various laser detector products. The issue of false signals and ways of addressing geographically fixed false sources, is addressed in the above-referenced U.S. Pat. No. 6,670,905, in which the characteristics of false sources are stored with reference to the GPS-based location of the source, so that in subsequent encounters the false source may be ignored or the response to that source conditioned.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Vehicle electronics continue to increase in sophistication; GPS receivers and satellite receivers are now commonplace. Furthermore, wireless (typically Bluetooth) connectivity to cellular telephones and cellular networks has become commonplace, permitting hands free operation and in some circumstances, Internet or text messaging (SMS) connectivity within the vehicle electronic systems. As these vehicle electronic systems continue to propagate and increase in complexity, increasingly sophisticated functionality will be available to drivers from their vehicle electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, a common problem with navigation devices with GPS capability is that data on the device may not updated. As such, when a user inputs into his or her navigation device the location that he or she wishes to go to, the navigation device will typically calculate the route or routes to the location using the data that is not updated stored on the device. The data may have been input into the navigation device when the navigation device was first purchased, sometimes months or years beforehand, and as such, the route or routes are calculated with data that is not updated. But to improve the calculation of routes, some navigation devices may request that a server calculate the route or routes. For instance, the server may include traffic data and therefore the route(s) the server calculates may take into account the traffic data. The server then may transmit back to the navigation device a route that does not appear to have any traffic jams. Thus, some navigation devices with GPS capability have modems built into the devices to receive the route or routes from the server.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, some navigation devices download traffic data from servers. The device typically needs to initiate the contact with the server by requesting the traffic data, otherwise, the server does not communicate with the device. Thus, some navigation devices with GPS capability have modems built into the devices to receive updated traffic data.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Data may also be transmitted, typically one way, from a sub-carrier or stations to a navigation device to display the name of the song and artist for a song playing in the vehicle. This data may be transmitted by FM broadcast and/or received by a modem of the navigation device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, an application from Trapster is available for iPhone devices, BlackBerry devices, some Android devices, some Nokia devices, and other devices, which follows a driver's location as a dot on a map via GPS capability, and when the driver passes a police officer lurking by the side of the road with a radar gun, the driver may tap on his or her iPhone, for example, to mark the location as a speed trap point. That data point may then be sent to a server so that other drivers using Trapster can then be alerted of that speed trap when they approach that point on the map. The driver may report the location of live police traps (e.g. police with radar or laser guns set up), red light cameras, speed cameras, or usual police hiding spots, using the shortcut keys or menu items on the mobile phone. Thus, via the application, the iPhone may transmit to and receive data from Trapster's server.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In particular, the driver may view on his or her iPhone screen a list of the traps near the driver and the distance to each one, with the data received from the server. The application gives the driver data about when the trap was reported, the confidence level, and who reported it, and allows the driver to rate traps that were reported by other users based on whether the driver agrees or disagrees with a trap. Colors are used to indicate the &#x201c;confidence&#x201d; of the trap, and the confidence is incremented when different users report the same trap at the same location from their mobile device or when users rate traps via the Trapster website. Further, if a driver reports a trap, and others corroborate that report, then that driver's Karma score goes up as well.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Besides viewing the traps, the driver may be alerted (e.g., audio alerts) when he or she approaches previously reported traps, and may also get alerts for new live police reports in his or her area via text message. Indeed, some versions support viewing traps on a map, while in others, the alerts are shown as a textual description in the main application window.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Although the enhancements described have aided drivers, nonetheless, further enhancements may be made to reduce inaccuracies and improve a driver's experience.</p>

The device has a housing that incorporates a cigarette lighter plug for obtaining 12 volt power from a cigarette lighter connector, and a position indicating circuit for detecting a current position and storage for storing information regarding particular positions. The upgrade device couples power obtained from the cigarette lighter connector to the radar detector, and receives indications of alerts from the connected radar detector. The upgrade device also references the current position and stored data to determine whether to mute the alert in the event the current location correlates to a location at which an alert is to be muted.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The upgrade device may also learn locations of police activity or false alarms thereof by storing a current location as identified by said position indicating circuit when an alert is indicated by the radar detector.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the radar detector <b>20</b> in accordance with principles of the present invention includes a processor <b>22</b> for controlling all functions of the unit. Processor <b>22</b> receives information on radar signals from a conventional X/K/KA band microwave receiver <b>24</b>, coupled to processor <b>22</b> via a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>26</b>. Microwave receiver <b>24</b> and DSP <b>26</b> may utilize any of the techniques described above and in the above-referenced patents, for rejecting noise and increasing discrimination between actual and spurious police radar signals. Further, receiver <b>24</b> and DSP <b>26</b> may be controlled by an optional second CPU <b>25</b>, which can enable additional signal evaluation beyond that which is possible using a DSP.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Processor <b>22</b> is further connected to a laser detector <b>30</b> for detecting police LIDAR signals. Processor <b>22</b> is further connected to a GPS receiver <b>32</b> and a separate differential GPS (DGPS) receiver <b>34</b>, such that differential GPS methodologies may be used where beacon signals are available. Since the radar detector application described in this patent is not a candidate for military class service, it is not able to access the more accurate PPS. However it is considered a &#x201c;civil user&#x201d; and can use the SPS without restriction.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Processor <b>22</b> executes a stored program, found in an electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) <b>36</b>, flash memory, or masked read only memory (ROM). The processor is programmed to manage and report detected signals in various ways depending on its stored program. This programming includes functions for detector response conditioning, as elaborated below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The radar detector further incorporates a user input keypad or switches <b>38</b>. Operational commands are conveyed by the user to processor <b>22</b> via the keypad. Processor <b>22</b> is further connected to a display <b>40</b>, which may comprise one or more light emitting diodes for indicating various status conditions, or in a more feature-rich device, may include an alphanumeric or graphical display for providing detailed information to a user. A speaker <b>42</b> is also provided to enable processor <b>22</b> to deliver audible feedback to a user under various alert conditions, as is elaborated below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Processor <b>22</b> may further include an interface <b>44</b>, such as an ODB II compliant interface, for connection to vehicle electronic systems <b>46</b> that are built into the vehicle. Modern vehicles are being equipped with standardized information systems using the so-called OBD II standard interface. This standard interface is described in an article entitled ODB II Diagnostics, by Larry Carley, from Import Car, January 1997, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Processor <b>22</b>, using the OBD II standard interface <b>44</b>, can obtain vehicle speed and other vehicle status information directly from the vehicle, and then may use this information appropriately as described in more detail below. Additional and more detailed information and functionality may be obtained by Intelligent Vehicle Data Bus (IVDB) systems that may in the future be incorporated into vehicles in addition to or in place of OBD II.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Processor <b>22</b> is further coupled to a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface <b>48</b> (which may be of the series &#x201c;mini-B&#x201d; variety) that provides a means for uploading and downloading information to and from processor <b>22</b>. It should be noted that there are three types of USB connection, Series &#x201c;A&#x201d;,&#x201c;B&#x201d;, and &#x201c;mini-B&#x201d;. The series &#x201c;mini-B&#x201d; receptacle has the dimensions 6.9 mm by 3.1 mm, whereas series &#x201c;A&#x201d; has the dimensions 12.5 mm by 5.12 mm. The standard USB is of the series &#x201c;A&#x201d; variety. In one embodiment the present invention contemplates the use of the series &#x201c;mini-B&#x201d; receptacle. The &#x201c;mini-B&#x201d; would utilize less space on the detector than the standard series &#x201c;A&#x201d; USB. USB interface <b>48</b> may be used to automate the assimilation of coordinate information into data structures in EEPROM <b>34</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Processor <b>22</b> may serve as a host on USB interface <b>48</b>, or may serve as a slave on that same interface. In the former case, USB interface <b>48</b> may also be used to interface the detector to a USB storage device such as a flash memory. In the latter case, the USB interface <b>48</b> may permit the processor to communicate with a separate host computer or product application for the purposes of updating or monitoring the activity of the detector.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">External storage devices coupled via USB interface <b>48</b> may have a larger storage capacity than available from internal memory. Remote storage devices may include any form of dynamically allocatable storage device (DASD) such as a flash memory, hard disk drive, removable or fixed magnetic, optical or magneto-optical disk drive, or removable or fixed memory card, or any device including a dynamic directory structure or table of contents included in the storage format to permit dynamic storage allocation. The storage device, or host computer or other connected device need not be visible to the driver and may be in any convenient location, such as under the vehicle dash.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">USB interface <b>48</b> may also be used for the purposes of firmware upgrade. From time to time updates and bug fixes may become available, e.g. through a manufacturer website. USB interface <b>48</b> will enable the user to apply the appropriate firmware upgrade or bug fix, whereas in a prior embodiment the manufacturer would have conducted such an upgrade.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">USB interface <b>48</b> could also be used to add other user waypoints. The Internet provides a convenient means for storing and accessing repositories of information. Web sites may be established and devoted to this task, and provide several convenient types of training information. One could be a training file containing the coordinate information from the online &#x201c;Speed Trap Registry&#x201d; at the Internet site www.speedtrap.com. This information would be usable to set &#x201c;always warn&#x201d; bits at the locales of known speed traps. A second type of training information would be training files submitted by individuals for use in particular areas, and the third type of information would be aggregate training files created by integrating individually-submitted information into single files organized by region. Aggregate training files would be managed and updated by the web site administrator.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Where a host computer is used in conjunction with the radar detector <b>20</b>, coordinate information can be stored, e.g., on a hard drive organized with an indexed database structure to facilitate rapid retrieval, and the hard drive may include a special purpose processor to facilitate rapid retrieval of this information. Where a general purpose host computer is connected via the USB interface, it will likely be based on a higher scale CPU chip and thus be able to efficiently carry out complex coordinate comparison tasks such as are described below, and such tasks may be delegated to the host CPU rather than carried out in processor <b>22</b>. The host CPU can also anticipate the need for information about particular coordinates based upon vehicle movements, and respond by retrieving records within proximity of the current location for ready delivery to fusion processor <b>22</b>. The host computer can also provide navigational functions to the driver, potentially using stored signal information and flag bits to provide the user with location-specific information about driving hazards and potential police stakeout locations.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As an alternative to a USB interface, radar detector <b>20</b> may include wired or wireless functionality for exchange of data. For example, in a wired embodiment, a flash memory slot <b>50</b> such as a secure digital (SD) or micro secure digital (uSD) slot could be used to provide data to and obtain data from the radar detector <b>20</b>. Flash memory may provide a larger memory space available for databases, as an augmentation to the EEPROM memory <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Flash memory is non-volatile computer memory that can be electrically erased and reprogrammed. The non-volatile designation means that no power is needed to maintain the information stored on the card. In addition, flash memory offers fast read access times and better kinetic shock resistance than a hard disk. Another feature of flash memory is that when packaged in a memory card (or a USB device), it is enormously durable, being able to withstand intense pressure, extremes of temperature, and even immersion in water. These features make a flash memory card an ideal candidate for the harsh environment inside a vehicle. Some flash memory card formats include Secure Digital (SD), micro Secure Digital (uSD), Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC), and Secure Digital Input Output (SIDO).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">It will be appreciated, as noted above, that flash memory functions described above may be achieved by a USB connectable flash memory device. In this implementation the radar detector <b>20</b> USB connector <b>48</b> hosts a mass storage device rather than or in addition to being usable as a USB slave device.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Processor <b>22</b> is further coupled to a Safety Warning System (SWS) radio <b>52</b> capable of signals from Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) beacons transmitting on the 5.9 GHz frequency band and designated for vehicle use. The SWS/DSRC is an infrastructure capable of transmitting warning information to surrounding vehicles in the vicinity of travel of various, possibly hazardous, situations. Some transmitted warnings include freezing bridge warnings, fog zone warnings, rest area alerts, rail road crossing warnings, and construction zone alerts. In accordance with principles of the present invention, SWS information may be received and alerted to a driver through numerous possible user interfaces as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Processor <b>22</b> further incorporates an IEEE 802.X radio <b>54</b> that provides a means for sending data packets across local area networks or metropolitan area networks. Specifically, the IEEE 802.X interface <b>54</b> may be used to transmit data packets via the 802.11 family, also known as wireless local area network computer communication (Wi-Fi), developed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee in the 5 Ghz and 2.4 Ghz public spectrum bands. The IEEE 802.X interface <b>54</b> may also be used to transmit data packets via the 802.15 family, also known as wireless personal area network (WPAN) communication. This specific family can be further divided into two subgroups designated 802.15.1, known as Bluetooth, and 802.15.4, known as Zigbee.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Bluetooth is a wireless protocol utilizing short-range communications technology facilitating both voice and data transmissions over short distances from fixed and/or mobile devices, creating the aforementioned WPANs. The intent behind the development of Bluetooth was the creation of a single digital wireless protocol, capable of connecting multiple devices and overcoming issues arising from synchronization of these devices. Bluetooth provides a way to connect and exchange information between devices such as GPS receivers, radar detectors, personal headsets, and mobile phones over a secure, globally unlicensed 2.4 GHz short-range radio frequency bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Zigbee is a wireless protocol utilizing low-rate WPANs, and focuses on low-cost, low-speed ubiquitous communication between devices. The emphasis is on very low cost communication of nearby devices with little to no underlying infrastructure, intending to lower power consumption. The touted feature of Zigbee is the ability to achieve extremely low operational costs, due to reduced power consumption, and its technological simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although Bluetooth and Zigbee are not expressly intended for this use, in accordance with principles of the present invention, the radar detector 802.x radio could pair with a cellular telephone using a headset or other handsfree device profile, to enable the radar detector to dial telephone numbers and exchange DTMF signals, or alternatively to use text messaging/SMS to communicate information to and from a remote server and/or database.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Bluetooth or other 802.x technology may also be used to connect a conventional headset profile to the radar detector 802.x radio, so as to provide remote audio alerting to the conventional headset. This implementation may find particular utility in motorcycles or convertibles where a speaker integrated into the radar detector may be difficult to hear.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As an example, signal information may also be downloaded from various hosts, for example, a connection may be established directly via the USB interface or a wireless interface to an Internet site carrying signal information, as is now done in a text form at the Internet site www.speedtrap.com. An indirect Internet connection may also be established via a cellular telephone, WiFi hot spot, or host computer. Connections may be used to obtain speed trap information, as discussed above, or to obtain other speed monitoring information such as speed camera locations. Furthermore, a connection may be used to check for available firmware updates or other system changes that need to be announced to all enabled devices. Furthermore, peer-to-peer connections may be established between two receivers, e.g. a trained receiver having extensive signal information, and a receiver having less extensive information, to transfer signal information between the receivers so that either or both has a more complete set of signal information. Speed camera locations and firmware may also be transferred in this peer-to-peer mode. Finally, it will be appreciated that peer-to-peer connections may be made directly over an 802.x ad-hoc network, or may be made through a LAN or Internet infrastructure utilizing a peer locating server as is now commonly used in file sharing and gaming networks.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, a database of locations is incorporated within the radar detector <b>20</b>, and processor <b>22</b> is a multithreading processor, such that the multithreading processor <b>22</b> manages the location database without involvement of external processors or hosts. The multithreading processor <b>22</b> may be programmed to allow rapid continuous processing of records in the location database using parallel threads. Generally speaking, processor <b>22</b> compares the radar detector's immediate coordinates with a stored list of the coordinates of unwanted stationary sources. If the radar detector receives a microwave/laser signal within a certain distance of one of these pre-designated sources, processor <b>22</b> applies additional constraints to the detection criterion before alerting the user. Since stationary radar sources make up the bulk of the unwanted sources, there is a significant benefit resulting from these functions.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It will be appreciated that processor <b>22</b> may execute a program on EEPROM <b>36</b> or may execute a stored program found in flash memory in slot <b>50</b>, in addition to or instead of the programming found in EEPROM <b>36</b>. Furthermore, firmware upgrades from flash memory may include, for example, voice files used by the radar detector to provide voiced alerts as is now a common feature. This functionality provides a ready upgrade path to language extension of the device to different markets, and allows updating and upgrading of functions to include voiced feedback as well as on-screen displays. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the flash memory slot may be incorporated into a device in wireless communication with the processor <b>22</b> via, for example, the 802.x radio <b>54</b>, so that flash memory in a connected cellular telephone, power source attachment, vehicle navigation system, or dashboard GPS receiver or radar detector display, may conveniently include a flash memory card reader slot that is accessible to processor <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a block diagram of the present invention in operation in a particular vehicle environment. The embodiment includes a radar detector <b>20</b>, power supply <b>60</b>, mobile telephone <b>62</b>, location sensing satellite <b>64</b>, SWS communication network <b>66</b>, telephone communication network <b>68</b>, Internet communication network <b>70</b>, and a remote database <b>72</b>. In this embodiment the detector <b>20</b> obtains operational power through a power supply <b>60</b> connected by an operable means, such as the SmartPlug which is used by the assignee of the present invention. However, operational power may be provided through on board means, such as a rechargeable battery. Operational power is described as the power required to allow the detector to execute all described functions.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the detector <b>20</b> has an operable connection with a mobile telephone <b>62</b>. In this embodiment the mobile telephone <b>62</b> is enabled with IEEE 802.15.1 technology, also known as Bluetooth. While the operable connection between the detector <b>20</b> and the mobile telephone <b>62</b> may be in the form of a serial or USB cord, many cellular telephones presently available permit communication through the IEEE 802.X radio <b>54</b> of the detector <b>20</b>. The detector <b>20</b> also incorporates a Safety Warning System radio <b>52</b> that allows the detector <b>20</b> to receive informative messages regarding upcoming or ongoing road conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">During a radar detection alert in this embodiment, the detector <b>20</b> is able to obtain the GPS coordinates of the detection, accomplished by communications between satellites <b>64</b>, beacons (not shown), the DGPS receiver <b>34</b> and GPS receiver <b>32</b> of the detector <b>20</b>. With the coordinates obtained by the receivers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, the detector <b>20</b> is able to determine whether the detected signal can be correlated with a signal detected in a previous radar detection encounter. To correlate the present signal detection with a previous detection encounter, the detector <b>20</b> compares various parameters of the current detection with the stored parameters of the previous detection. Parameters that may be evaluated are the signal signature of the present detected signal versus the signal signature of a previously detected signal within a predetermined area of the received coordinates, the detector's rate of travel at the time of the present detection versus the rate of travel at the time of a previous detection within a predetermined area of the received coordinates, the direction of travel at the time of the present detection versus the direction of travel at the time of a previous detection within a predetermined area of the received coordinates. These parameters are stored on a detection look up table <b>74</b> located on the EEPROM <b>36</b> of the detector <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Once a detection has been matched with a previous detection the detector <b>20</b>, evaluates past user input during the previous detection when deciding whether and how to alert driver of the present detection. If the user has designated the matched detection as a false alert, then the detector <b>20</b> may mute the speaker <b>42</b> and/or forego a visual alert. Alternatively, if the user has designated the matched detection as an authentic detection, then the detector <b>20</b> may alert through the speaker <b>42</b> and/or create a visual alert. Additionally, the detector may send an audible alert to a Bluetooth headset <b>76</b> through the IEEE 802.X radio <b>54</b>. This feature is especially useful in environments where the user may have difficulty hearing an alert tone from the detector's speaker <b>42</b> or would prefer a more personal in ear alert.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The operable connection with the mobile telephone <b>62</b> allows the detector <b>20</b> to communicate with a remote database <b>72</b>. The remote database <b>72</b> stores transmitted GPS coordinates of an observed radar encounter or a detected radar encounter. An observed radar encounter is a situation when the user notices a speed trap, traffic camera, or other mechanism designed for purposes of ticket revenue or traffic deterrence instead of safety that may or may not be emitting radar. A speed trap may be defined as a location where the police strictly enforce the speed limit. Alternatively, a speed trap may be defined as a road section where police are known to have a reputation for writing an unusually high number of traffic tickets, the posted speed limits are not easily seen, or the speed limits are set much lower than a road engineering survey may suggest.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The communication with the remote database <b>72</b> of the present invention involves the user operatively indicating to the detector <b>20</b> that the present detection (observed or detected) is a speed trap. This may be done with a switch, remote button, or by a button located on the detector <b>20</b>. Once a user operatively characterizes a detection as a speed trap, the detector <b>20</b> communicates with the mobile telephone <b>62</b>, which communicates particular parameters to the remote database <b>72</b>. The communication between the mobile telephone <b>62</b> and the remote database <b>72</b> may be accomplished through a telephone communication network <b>68</b> such as a GSM or CDMA2000 protocol. Communication through a telephone communication network <b>68</b> may be in the form of a short message through the short message service (SMS). The communication through the telephone communication network <b>68</b> may also be in the form of dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF), also known as touchtone. Where the mobile telephone <b>62</b> is capable of Internet connectivity, the communication between the mobile telephone <b>62</b> and the remote database <b>72</b> may be accomplished through an Internet communication <b>70</b>. The mobile telephone <b>62</b> may obtain Internet connectivity to the remote database <b>72</b> through Internet communication <b>70</b> protocols such as WiFi, Zigbee, EDGE, or 3G.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The detector <b>20</b> may also receive notifications from the remote database <b>72</b>. These notifications may communicate the location of speed traps that other detector users have observed and reported. By broadcasting the GPS coordinates through Internet communication means <b>70</b> or telephone communication means <b>68</b> in operable communication with the mobile telephone <b>62</b> that is in operable communication with the detector <b>20</b>, the remote database <b>72</b> is able to send information to the detector <b>20</b>. This information include the GPS coordinates of speed traps indicated by other detector users. This feature can provide real time speed trap notification to detector users and alert them to proceed with caution when a speed trap is approached.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The present invention also contemplates the use of non-GPS enabled detectors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention where the detector is an non-GPS enabled detector <b>20</b>. In this embodiment the power source attachment <b>78</b> houses a DGPS receiver <b>80</b>, a GPS receiver <b>82</b>, a status display <b>84</b>, and a detection look up table <b>86</b>. In this embodiment the detector <b>20</b> may obtain operational power through the power source attachment <b>78</b>, and operatively communicate with the power source attachment <b>78</b> regarding previous and present detections through a USB or serial cord connection or through IEEE 802.X radio <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Optionally, radar detector <b>20</b> may itself include an 802.x radio permitting wireless communication with power source attachment <b>78</b>, in which case radar detector <b>20</b> may be battery powered, or may be remotely located such as in the vehicle's grille area, requiring only a 12 volt power connection for complete installation.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As is done by circuits within the detector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the power source attachment <b>78</b> correlates stored data parameters of a present detection to the parameters of a previous detection and mutes the speaker <b>42</b> of the detector <b>20</b> and/or the visual alert accordingly. The power source attachment <b>78</b> is also equipped with a means of designating speed trap locations. This may take the form of a button or switch located on a keypad <b>89</b> of the power source attachment <b>78</b>. In this embodiment, the power source attachment <b>78</b> is in operable communication with the mobile telephone <b>62</b>, and with this configuration the user is still able to designate speed traps and communicate with the remote database <b>72</b> with similar communication means described above. The power source attachment <b>78</b> may also receive updated information regarding speed trap locations from the remote database <b>72</b> with similar communication means described above. Also as noted above, the power source attachment <b>78</b>, or the detector <b>20</b> itself, can transmit warnings to a Bluetooth headset <b>76</b> through the IEEE 802.X radio <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention where there is no radar detector present.

The button assembly <b>90</b> is in operative communication with a power supply <b>60</b>, and a mobile telephone <b>62</b>. The communication between the button assembly <b>90</b> and the mobile telephone <b>62</b> may be made either by a serial or USB connection or through the IEEE 802.X radio <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the toggle button assembly <b>90</b> includes a GPS receiver <b>94</b> and DGPS receiver <b>92</b> for detecting a current location, and interacts via an IEEE 802.x radio with a cellular telephone <b>62</b> or other communication device to retrieve speed trap locations from a remote database <b>72</b>. This communication may be by the telephone communication network <b>68</b>, or the Internet communication network <b>70</b> by the means described above. Nearby speed traps which have been identified in the database are acquired and if the vehicle approaches one of those speed traps, a warning is delivered via the cellular telephone <b>62</b> or via a display and/or speaker which may be included in the toggle button assembly <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Furthermore, when a user of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> visually detects a speed trap, the user may activate the button assembly <b>90</b>, by toggling a button, switch, or knob.

The mobile telephone <b>62</b> may then transmit the coordinates of the detection to the remote database <b>72</b>.

Subsequently, the application on the GPS enabled mobile telephone may retrieve locations of speed traps stored in remote database <b>72</b> and deliver responsive alerts to the user of the phone. This embodiment requires the use of a GPS enabled mobile telephone, a customized application on that telephone, and the constant operation of that application on the telephone, none of which are required in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, making <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> more usable for many environments which are not available in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of the present invention where the detector <b>20</b> is in operable communication with a power supply <b>60</b> and a navigation unit <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, in an alternative embodiment the invention may be implemented as a substitute power cord assembly for a radar detector. In this embodiment the power cord assembly includes a GPS receiver, DGPS receiver and marked detection lookup table or map. The power cord assembly is coupled to a conventional radar detector to provide power to the detector and to provide a mute signal to the detector. It will be appreciated that the power cord used with many conventional radar detectors includes a signal line for a mute signal, which is activated by a pushbutton on the power cord assembly. The power cord assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> connects to this mute signal line and provides a mute signal to the detector in the event that the location of the detector, as determined by the GPS receiver in the power cord assembly, correlates to a rejectible signal as identified in the lookup table in the power cord assembly. The database in the power cord assembly may be updated in the event that the user mutes an alert of a radar signal being generated by the radar detector, e.g., the power cord assembly may provide the user the option to store the location where the mute was engaged, to prevent future alerts at the same or a similar location.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> may be further implemented through a firmware upgrade to a conventional radar detector. New firmware in the detector may cause the detector to differently condition its alerts upon responses from the power connector, so that the GPS receiver in the power cord is more tightly coupled to the radar detector and more tightly controls the alerts from the GPS receiver in a manner more directly akin to an integrated unit.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">FIGS. <b>8</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>8</b>B<b>2</b> illustrate an embodiment of the invention in which an integrated vehicle navigation unit that includes GPS receivers, a display and a map function, communicates with a radar detector. The connection to the radar detector may be wired as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>B<b>1</b> or wireless via a Bluetooth or other 802.x radio as shown in <b>8</b>B<b>2</b>. In either case, an application in the navigation unit operates to generate alerts of radar when detected by the attached radar detector, and further communicates with a stored lookup table or map to suppress radar warnings in the event that a detected signal correlates to a rejectable signal, and to store false signal locations when identified by the user via the user interface of the navigation unit.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">FIGS. <b>8</b>C<b>1</b> and <b>8</b>C<b>2</b> illustrates an embodiment similar to FIGS. <b>8</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>8</b>B<b>2</b> in which a dashboard GPS receiver, which includes GPS receivers, a display and a map function, communicates with a radar detector. Here again, the connection to the radar detector may be wired as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>C<b>1</b> or wireless via a Bluetooth or other 802.x radio as shown in <b>8</b>C<b>2</b>. In either case, an application in the GPS unit generate alerts of radar when detected by the attached radar detector, and further communicates with a stored lookup table or map to suppress radar warnings in the event that a detected signal correlates to a rejectable signal, and to store false signal locations when identified by the user via the user interface of the GPS unit.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention in which a 12 volt power source attachment including GPS and DGPS receivers and a display, is coupled via a Bluetooth or other 802.x radio to a remote radar detector that includes Bluetooth functionality but does not include GPS functionality. One example of such a device is the radar detection unit sold by K40 Electronics under the brand name Calibre. In this embodiment, the power cord assembly communicates via Bluetooth or another 802.x wireless communication standard with the remote radar detector to acquire information about radar warnings, and the power cord assembly generates warnings on the display of the power source attachment. Further, the power source attachment communicates with a stored lookup table or map to suppress radar warnings in the event that a detected signal correlates to a rejectable signal, and may include a user interface such as a mute button, usable to store false signal locations when identified by the user via that user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-15</figref>, as many of these figures include items already discussed hereinabove in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8D</figref>, these discussions will not be repeated but are applicable to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-15</figref> as well. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the detector <b>20</b> includes a GSM cellular data modem <b>200</b> embedded within the detector <b>20</b> for both receiving and transmitting data, instead of an operable connection with an external mobile telephone (e.g., mobile <b>62</b> discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for receiving and transmitting data.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Those of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate that by embedding the modem <b>200</b> in the detector <b>20</b>, data may be continuously transmitted from the radar detector to a server, analyzed at the server, and pooled into a master remote database on the server. In turn, the radar detector may receive pertinent updated data on coordinates, designations of coordinates (e.g., as a threat or false alert), software updates, among other data, from the remote database on the server, all in real-time, and potentially without any human interaction after the initial installation of the radar detector in the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Indeed, the detector <b>20</b> may be able to receive real-time data about false alerts and threats without having to utilize the mobile <b>62</b> to connect the detector <b>20</b> to the server, without having to physically connect the mobile <b>62</b> to the detector <b>20</b>, without having to ensure the mobile <b>62</b> is charged and operational, without having to deal with cables to connect the mobile <b>62</b> to the detector <b>20</b>, without connecting the detector <b>20</b> (or part thereof) to any other device for data (e.g., software updates, data on false alert, data on threats), etc. For example, in Europe, users generally have to plug their detectors to a computer via USB to find retrieve data on the threats (e.g., data on the cameras that are on for that day), but such user intervention may be avoided or greatly reduced by the embodiments discussed herein. Furthermore, a large database at the detector <b>20</b>, with data that is not updated (i.e., stale), may be avoided or at least minimized as a much smaller database and/or storage may be maintained at detector <b>20</b> with the updated data received in real-time. Moreover, the detector <b>20</b> may be updated with data that is more pertinent to the driver such as data about speed traps or false alarms or alerts within a certain radius of the detector <b>20</b> as these are positions the user is more likely to encounter then speed traps or false alerts five states away. Indeed, it may not be productive to store data for every door opener in the country as the driver will likely not be encountering such distant openers.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Turning first to the GSM cellular data modem <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, although a GSM type of cellular data modem is utilized as the modem <b>200</b>, such need not be the case in other embodiments. For example, a different type modem may be utilized such as a different type of cellular data modem or bi-directional paging or any other bi-directional communications device. However, it may be beneficial to use a GSM type of cellular data modem because GSM, which stands for Global System for Mobile communications, is an international standard and a GSM cellular data modem will typically work anywhere where the GSM standard is supported (e.g., with minor adjustments such as switching a Subscriber Identity Module (hereinafter &#x201c;SIM&#x201d;) card). However, as will be discussed further below in connection with the Jasper Wireless list, not all GSM cellular data modems in the United States function outside of the United States (e.g., due to GSM operating at different MHz in different countries). Thus, the GSM cellular data modem <b>200</b> in the detector <b>20</b> should be selected so as to function in the country where the radar detector <b>20</b> will be utilized (e.g., in the United States). Further, the detector <b>20</b> may have more than one GSM cellular data modem in some embodiments, for example, to account for these differences.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the GSM cellular data modem <b>200</b> is coupled to the processor <b>22</b>. The processor <b>22</b> generally controls all functions of the detector <b>20</b>, including controlling all the functions of the modem <b>200</b> such as controlling the modem <b>200</b> to receive and/or transmit data. Under control of the processor <b>22</b>, the modem <b>200</b> receives and transmits data, and the processor <b>22</b> may process the data received by the modem <b>200</b> and the processor <b>22</b> may provide data to the modem <b>200</b> for transmission. Indeed, incoming and outgoing arrows are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> between the modem <b>200</b> and the processor <b>22</b> to emphasize that the detector <b>20</b> is capable of two way communication such that the detector <b>20</b> may receive data through the modem <b>200</b> for the processor <b>22</b> (e.g., to store the data in the flash memory of the flash memory slot <b>50</b> or even in the EEPROM <b>36</b>) and/or may transmit data of the processor <b>22</b> through the modem <b>200</b> (e.g., to the remote database <b>72</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>). The two way communication capability will be discussed further in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The processor <b>22</b> may be implemented in hardware using circuit logic disposed on one or more physical integrated circuit devices (e.g., one or more circuit boards), or chips. Although the processor <b>22</b> is illustrated as a single processor, the processor <b>22</b> may be a plurality of processors. If the fusion processor <b>22</b> is a plurality of processors, the modem <b>200</b> may be coupled, for example, to each of the processors in the plurality of processors.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Like a mobile telephone, the modem <b>200</b> may include a SIM card (not shown) with the user's subscription information and may even have a cellular phone number associated with it. The SIM card is a small removable disk that slips in and out of the GSM cellular data modem <b>200</b> and may include all the connection data and identification numbers for accessing a particular wireless service provider, such as AT&#x26;T Inc.

Those of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate that use of a certified module and/or certified device from the Jasper Wireless list, for example, may lead to speedier implementation of the detector <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Specifically, for deployment in the United States, Jasper Wireless requires that modules be AT&#x26;T certified, and the Jasper Wireless list includes a variety of AT&#x26;T certified modules for deployment on the Jasper Wireless Platform, including Enfora GSM0104, GSM0108, GSM0113, GSM0204, GSM0208, GSM0304, GSM0308, and GSM0404.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Thus, the modem <b>200</b> of the detector <b>20</b> of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may be a certified module (or modification thereof) from the Jasper Wireless list that is added to the circuit board or chip of the processor <b>22</b> for deployment on the Jasper Wireless Platform, or the hardware may be obtained from u-blox, and AT&#x26;T or Juniper may serve as the wireless service provider for the transmitting and providing data to the GSM system using GSM technology. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there may be other ways of implementing the detector <b>20</b> with the embedded modem <b>200</b>. Indeed, u-blox also has a portfolio of GPS modules, cards, chips, and software solutions together with wireless modules and solutions, thus, those of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate that a module of u-blox (or modification thereof) or a module (or modification thereof) of some other provider, for example, may be utilized for the modem <b>200</b> instead of the certified modules from the Jasper Wireless list.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, this figure illustrates a block diagram of the detector <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in a vehicle environment. Although only a single radar detector <b>20</b> is shown for simplicity in these and other figures, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that multiple radar detectors <b>20</b> will generally be present in the environment. Specifically, the detector <b>20</b> includes the GSM cellular data modem <b>200</b> embedded within the detector <b>20</b> for both receiving and/or transmitting data to the remote database <b>72</b> through a communication network such as the telephone communication network <b>68</b> (e.g., GSM or CDMA2000 protocol) and/or the Internet communication network <b>70</b> (e.g., WiFi, Zigbee, EDGE, or 3G). EDGE refers to Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution technology, providing enhancements to GSM networks, and may use the same structure as GSM networks. As such, this may allow EDGE to be overlaid directly onto an existing GSM network (e.g., via a software-upgrade). The remote database <b>72</b> may be located at a server such as server <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The detector <b>20</b> via the modem <b>200</b> is capable of direct real-time two way communication through the telephone communication network <b>68</b> and/or Internet communication network <b>70</b> with server <b>300</b>, which contains the remote database <b>72</b>. The detector <b>20</b> or various detectors <b>20</b> and the server <b>300</b> may be considered a system, and will be discussed further in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Specifically, the detector <b>20</b> includes the modem <b>200</b> embedded within the detector <b>20</b> for directly receiving and transmitting data, instead of an operable connection with an external mobile telephone <b>68</b> for receiving and transmitting the data (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The modem <b>200</b> is capable of direct two way communication in a real-time manner through the telephone communication network <b>68</b> and/or Internet communication network <b>70</b> with the remote database <b>72</b> at the server <b>300</b>. Although the term real-time is being utilized for simplicity, real-time also may include near real time, which refers to the slight delay that may be introduced by automated data processing and/or network transmission between when an event occurs and use of the processed data for display and control purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As the modem <b>200</b> embedded within the detector <b>20</b> is replacing the external mobile telephone <b>68</b> that was connected to the detector <b>20</b>, the modem <b>200</b> performs some or all of the functions of the mobile telephone <b>68</b>. For example, the modem <b>200</b> may be responsible for converting digital data into radio signals for outgoing communication and/or converting radio signals to digital signals for incoming communication. Thus, receiving and transmitting data by the modem <b>200</b> may require conversions. To that end, the modem <b>200</b> may include a DSP (not shown) such as DSP <b>26</b>, discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, to carry out the conversions. Alternatively, the conversions may be performed elsewhere in the detector <b>20</b>, for example, the modern <b>200</b>, under control of the processor <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) may relay radio signals it receives to the DSP <b>26</b> to carry out the conversions. The modem <b>200</b> may also include an antenna (not shown) for receiving and transmitting data.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The remote database <b>72</b> at the server <b>300</b> may store transmitted GPS coordinates of an observed radar encounter or a detected radar encounter such as a speed trap transmitted by the detector <b>20</b> or other detector. As discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an observed radar encounter is a situation when the user notices a speed trap, traffic camera, or other mechanism designed for purposes of ticket revenue or traffic deterrence instead of safety that may or may not be emitting radar. A speed trap may be defined as a location where the police enforce the speed limit. Alternatively, a speed trap may be defined as a road section where police have a reputation for writing an unusually high number of traffic tickets, the posted speed limits are not easily seen, or the speed limits are set much lower than a road engineering survey may suggest. For simplicity, these will be referred to as threats or threat designations if a user designates them as threats. On the other hand, door openers or other sources that might falsely trigger an alert will be referred to a false alerts or false alert designations if the user designates them as false alerts.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be thought of as illustrative of a client-server system or environment. The client-server system or environment may include at least one client (e.g., the detector <b>20</b> may be considered a client as well as any other detectors that communicate with the server computer <b>300</b>) and at least one server (e.g., the server computer <b>300</b>). The system includes at least one apparatus, e.g., one or more clients in the form of the detector <b>20</b> and one or more servers in the form of the server computer <b>300</b>. The computer <b>300</b> may represent practically any type of computer, computer system or other programmable electronic device capable of functioning as a server in a client-server environment. For example, in specific embodiments, the computer <b>300</b> may be a computer, computer system, computing device, disk array, or programmable device such as a multi-user computer, a single-user computer, a handheld device, a networked device (including a computer in a cluster configuration), a mobile phone, a video game console (or other gaming system), etc. Moreover, the computer <b>300</b> may be implemented using one or more networked computers, e.g., in a cluster or other distributed computing system. Further, as is common in many client-server systems, typically multiple clients (i.e., multiple detectors <b>20</b>) will be interfaced with the server computer <b>300</b>. However, given the nature of computer <b>300</b> as a server, in many instances computer <b>300</b> may be implemented using a multi-user computer such as a server computer, a midrange computer, a mainframe, etc. As a result, the specifications of the CPU's, memories, mass storage, user interfaces and network interfaces may vary between the computer <b>300</b> and the detector <b>20</b> to accommodate the possibly higher demands on the computer <b>300</b>. Other hardware environments are contemplated within the context of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Computer <b>300</b> typically includes a central processing unit (CPU) <b>326</b> including at least one microprocessor coupled to a memory <b>328</b>, which may represent the random access memory (RAM) devices comprising the main storage of computer <b>300</b>, as well as any supplemental levels of memory, e.g., cache memories, non-volatile or backup memories (e.g., programmable or flash memories), read-only memories, etc. The remote database <b>72</b> may be resident in the memory <b>328</b>. The CPU <b>326</b> is typically implemented in hardware using circuit logic disposed on one or more physical integrated circuit devices, or chips. Thus, the computer <b>300</b> may include at least one hardware-based processor. The CPU <b>326</b> may be one or more microprocessors, micro-controllers, field programmable gate arrays, or ASICs, while memory <b>328</b> may include random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static random access memory (SRAM), flash memory, and/or another digital storage medium, typically implemented using circuit logic disposed on one or more physical integrated circuit devices, or chips. As such, the memory <b>328</b> may be considered to include memory storage physically located elsewhere in the computer <b>300</b>, e.g., any cache memory in a processor in the CPU <b>326</b>, as well as any storage capacity used as a virtual memory, e.g., as stored on a mass storage device <b>330</b> or on another computer coupled to the computer <b>300</b>. The computer <b>300</b> also typically receives a number of inputs and outputs for communicating information externally. For interface with a user or operator, computer <b>300</b> typically includes a user interface <b>332</b> incorporating one or more user input devices (e.g., a keyboard, a mouse, a trackball, a joystick, a touchpad, and/or a microphone, among others) and a display (e.g., a CRT monitor, an LCD display panel, and/or a speaker, among others). Otherwise, user input may be received via another computer or terminal or from the modem <b>200</b> of the detector <b>20</b>. Likewise, the computer <b>300</b> may output data and transmit it to the modem <b>200</b> of the detector <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">For additional storage, the computer <b>300</b> may also include one or more mass storage devices <b>330</b>, e.g., a floppy or other removable disk drive, a hard disk drive, a direct access storage device (DASD), an optical drive (e.g., a CD drive, a DVD drive, etc.), and/or a tape drive, among others. Furthermore, the computer <b>300</b> may include an interface <b>334</b> with one or more networks (e.g., a LAN, a WAN, a wireless network, the Internet (e.g., the Internet communication network <b>70</b>), WiFi, Zigbee, EDGE, or 3G, a cellular or telephone network (e.g., the telephone communication network <b>68</b>), GSM and/or CDMA2000 protocol, among others) to permit the communication of information with other computers, electronic devices, the radar detector <b>20</b>, multiple radar detectors <b>20</b>, etc. Communication through the telephone communication network <b>68</b> may be in the form of a short message through the short message service (SMS). The communication through the telephone communication network <b>68</b> may also be in the form of dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF), also known as touchtone. Indeed, the interface <b>334</b> may interface with a network that may be public and/or private, wireless and/or wired in some aspect, local and/or wide-area, represent multiple interconnected networks, etc. It should be appreciated that the computer <b>300</b> typically includes suitable analog and/or digital interfaces between the CPU <b>326</b> and each of the components <b>328</b>, <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> and <b>334</b> as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The computer <b>300</b> operates under the control of an operating system <b>340</b>, and executes or otherwise relies upon various computer software applications, components, programs, objects, modules, data structures, etc. (e.g. server <b>344</b>). Moreover, various applications, components, programs, objects, modules, etc. may also execute on one or more processors in another computer coupled to computer <b>300</b> via a network, e.g., in a distributed or client-server computing environment, whereby the processing required to implement the functions of a computer program may be allocated to multiple computers over a network.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In general, the routines executed to implement the embodiments of the invention, whether implemented as part of an operating system or a specific application, component, program, object, module or sequence of instructions, or even a subset thereof, will be referred to herein as &#x201c;computer program code,&#x201d; or simply &#x201c;program code.&#x201d; Program code typically comprises one or more instructions that are resident at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer, and that, when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer, cause that computer to perform the steps necessary to execute steps or elements embodying the various aspects of the invention. Moreover, while the invention has and hereinafter will be described in the context of fully functioning computers and computer systems, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the various embodiments of the invention are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that the invention applies equally regardless of the particular type of computer readable signal bearing media used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of computer readable signal bearing media include but are not limited to physical and tangible recordable type media such as volatile and non-volatile memory devices, floppy and other removable disks, hard disk drives, magnetic tape, optical disks (e.g., CD-ROMs, DVDs, etc.), among others, and transmission type media such as digital and analog communication links.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, various program code described hereinafter may be identified based upon the application within which it is implemented in a specific embodiment of the invention. However, it should be appreciated that any particular program nomenclature that is used herein is merely for convenience, and thus the invention should not be limited to use solely in any specific application identified and/or implied by such nomenclature. Furthermore, given the typically endless number of manners in which computer programs may be organized into routines, procedures, methods, modules, objects, and the like, as well as the various manners in which program functionality may be allocated among various software layers that are resident within a typical computer (e.g., operating systems, libraries, API's, applications, applets, etc.), it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the specific organization and allocation of program functionality described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, the server computer <b>300</b> may be a web server computer, such as the web server computer <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, or some other type of server computer. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in a similar manner to the computer <b>300</b>, the web server computer <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> may include CPU <b>326</b>, memory <b>328</b>, mass storage <b>330</b>, user interface <b>332</b>, network interface <b>334</b>, operating system <b>340</b>, and the remote database <b>72</b> as discussed in connection with the computer <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. For example, the CPU <b>326</b> of the web server computer <b>400</b> may likewise include at least one hardware-based processor, with the CPU <b>326</b> is implemented in hardware using circuit logic disposed on one or more physical integrated circuit devices, or chips. Indeed, the CPU <b>326</b> of the web server computer <b>400</b> may be one or more microprocessors, micro-controllers, field programmable gate arrays, or ASICs, while the memory <b>328</b> of the web server computer <b>400</b> may include random access memory (RAM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static random access memory (SRAM), flash memory, and/or another digital storage medium, typically implemented using circuit logic disposed on one or more physical integrated circuit devices, or chips. Similarly, the remote database <b>72</b> may be resident in the memory <b>328</b> of the web server computer <b>400</b>. Furthermore, the web server computer <b>400</b> operates under the control of the operating system <b>340</b>, and executes or otherwise relies upon various computer software applications, components, programs, objects, modules, data structures, etc. (e.g. web server <b>444</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In general, the discussion hereinabove for computer <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) is applicable to the discussion of the web server computer <b>400</b>, with the main difference being that the web server <b>444</b> replaces the server computer <b>400</b> to provide web-based connections. The server <b>344</b> and the web server <b>444</b> may generally be considered to include any program code resident on a computer or other programmable electronic device that is capable of servicing requests and/or analysis in a distributed computer system. Additionally, the server <b>344</b> and web server <b>444</b> may be considered to include the hardware associated with each (e.g., the computer <b>300</b> and the server computer <b>400</b>, respectively) as well as the software (e.g., program code).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Additionally, with the web server computer <b>400</b>, the network interface <b>334</b> of the web server computer <b>400</b> may be more likely to interface with the Internet communication network <b>70</b> instead of the telephone communication network <b>68</b>. As such, the telephone communication network <b>68</b> is illustrated in phantom. However, there may be some embodiments where the network interface <b>334</b> of the web server computer <b>400</b> may still interface with both the Internet communication network <b>70</b> and the telephone communication network <b>68</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, or simply interface with the telephone communication network <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Those skilled in the art will recognize that the exemplary environments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref> are not intended to limit the present invention. Indeed, those skilled in the art will recognize that other alternative hardware and/or software environments may be used without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, although a web server <b>44</b> is utilized herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that another server and/or server computer may be utilized. Furthermore, although only a single radar detector <b>20</b> is shown for simplicity in these figures, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that multiple radar detectors <b>20</b> may communicate with the server <b>300</b> and/or the web server <b>400</b>, and that the server <b>300</b> and/or the web server <b>400</b> may communicate with multiple radar detectors <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the context of the embodiments discussed hereinabove, the communication between the detector <b>20</b>, with the embedded modem <b>200</b>, and the remote database <b>72</b> of the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> involves the user operatively indicating to the detector <b>20</b> that the present detection (observed or detected) should be designated as a false alert or as a threat. This may be done with a switch, remote button, or by a button located on the detector <b>20</b>. Once the user operatively designates a detection as a false alert, for example, under control of the processor <b>22</b>, the modem <b>200</b> of the detector <b>20</b> may communicate in real-time the particular parameters of the false alert, such as the coordinates of the false alert and data related to the coordinates such as an indication of the false alert designation, to the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> to the remote database <b>72</b>. The detector <b>20</b> is able to obtain the GPS coordinates of the detection by communications between satellites <b>64</b>, beacons (not shown), the DGPS receiver <b>34</b> and GPS receiver <b>32</b> of the detector <b>20</b>. The communication between the modem <b>200</b> and the remote database <b>72</b> may be accomplished through the telephone communication network <b>68</b> such as a GSM or CDMA2000 protocol <b>72</b> and/or accomplished through the Internet communication <b>70</b> through WiFi, Zigbee, EDGE, or 3G.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> may analyze the received parameters from the detector <b>20</b> (and other detectors) in real-time (e.g., at the CPU <b>326</b>), for example, to determine if the false alert designation at the coordinates received from the detector <b>20</b> has been received a sufficient number of times (e.g., via a counter saved in the remote database <b>72</b>) from different radar detectors <b>20</b>. If so, the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> transmits a notification (e.g., transmitting the coordinates and perhaps an indication of the false alert designation and/or data that would mute and/or forgo alerting at the coordinates of the false alert designation) to all the radar detectors within a radius, where the coordinates of the false alert fall within that radius. Alternatively, it may transmit to those that have not designated these coordinates as a false alert within the radius. Likewise, a threat designation may be performed in a similar manner, with the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> transmitting the coordinates and may also data related to the coordinates such as an indication of the threat designation. Furthermore, an indication about whether the coordinates of the location of the detector <b>20</b>, the heading, and/or the speed may also be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Regarding the radius, each radar detector may continuously transmit to the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> its location (e.g., GPS coordinates), heading, and/or speed data for storage in the remote database <b>72</b>, and the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> may determine which radar detectors are within the radius based on the continuously received data. Regarding the remote database <b>72</b>, it may serve as a master database or repository for aggregating data received from multiple radar detectors, and may include, for example, false alert designations, coordinates of false alert designations, threat designations, coordinates of threat designations, location data, including GPS coordinates, of the radar detector, heading data of the radar detector, speed data of the radar detector, counters, etc. for analysis by the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> such as by the CPU <b>326</b> thereof, for example, for comparing counters to a threshold, determining radar detectors within in a radius, etc. The indications of the designations may be transmitted by either the detector <b>20</b> and/or the server <b>300</b> and/or computer <b>400</b> to reduce inaccuracies and confusion regarding why specific coordinates are being transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Thus, the detector <b>20</b> may not only transmit information to the server <b>300</b> and/or the web server <b>400</b>, but it may also receive data at the embedded modem <b>200</b> from the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> from the remote database <b>72</b>. This data may communicate the location of false alerts or speed traps and/or threats that other detector users have observed and reported. By broadcasting the GPS coordinates through Internet communication network <b>70</b> and/or telephone communication network <b>68</b> to the modem <b>200</b> of the detector <b>20</b>, the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> containing the remote database <b>72</b> is able to send information to the detector <b>20</b> and others within the radius. This information may include the GPS coordinates of false alert designations and/or threat designations indicated by other detector users such that the information that is more pertinent to a driver is received at their corresponding detector. This feature can provide real time data to detector users and alert them to proceed with ease or proceed with caution. Similarly, the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b> may transmit software updates to the radar detectors.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">All of the receive information by the modem of the radar detector <b>20</b> may be stored in the flash memory of slot <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) or even in the EEPROM <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) of the detector. Furthermore, those of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate that as real-time pertinent data will be received from the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b>, the storage of the detector <b>20</b> may be smaller, instead of a larger storage that has out of date or stale data, and smaller storage may lead to reduction in cost and/or allow for faster searches of the storage and improve the reaction time of the detector <b>20</b>. Although the inclusion of an embedded modem <b>200</b> within the detector <b>20</b> may increase the cost of the detector <b>20</b>, the modem <b>200</b> may in turn lead to smaller data storage requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Furthermore, it is worth noting that the radar detector <b>20</b> may also perform other tasks discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8D</figref> such as using the coordinates of a detected signal obtained by the receivers <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, the detector <b>20</b> is able to determine whether the detected signal can be correlated with a signal detected in a previous radar detection encounter. But as described herein, the radar detector <b>20</b> may further determine if data was received from the server <b>300</b> and/or the web server <b>400</b> regarding the coordinates of this detected signal and the whether a warning or alert should or should not be issued by the detector <b>20</b> via the processor <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). As such, the detector <b>20</b> and the server <b>300</b> and/or the web server <b>400</b> may be in real-time communication with each other receiving and transmitting information, without human intervention (e.g., except for the potential intervention by a user designating a false alert or a threat), that may improve accuracy and improve the experience of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, this figure illustrates an exemplary false alert designation routine <b>501</b> with a plurality of radar detectors <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, with each similar to the radar detector <b>20</b>, and with each having an embedded modem such as the modem <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>. These detectors may be in real-time two communication with server computer <b>514</b>, which is similar to the server computer <b>300</b> and/or the web server computer <b>400</b>. For ease of understanding, a step of the routine <b>501</b> (or a step of the other routines <b>601</b> and <b>701</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-15</figref>) illustrated in the radar detectors <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> or in the server computer <b>514</b> is meant to indicate that the step may be performed in that item. Although only four radar detectors are illustrated for simplicity, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many more detectors may be in real-time two way communication with the server computer <b>514</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Starting with block <b>508</b> in the detector <b>500</b>, the detector <b>500</b> may alert the user of a detected signal. For example, the detector <b>500</b> may not have any other information on the coordinates of the detected signal or this may be the first time any of the detectors in communication with the server computer <b>514</b>, including detector <b>500</b>, have detected a signal at these coordinates, and as such, the detector <b>500</b> alerts the user of the detected signal. If the user learns that the detected signal is a false alert, the user may give it a false alert designation by muting the alert at block <b>510</b>, and an indication of the false alert designation and the coordinates may be transmitted automatically to the server computer <b>514</b> at block <b>512</b>. It is worth noting that it may be advantageous to transmit both the coordinates of the false alert designation as well as the false alert designation indication to reduce inaccuracies among all the coordinates that will be transmitted from the various detectors at various times to the server computer <b>514</b>. However, in some embodiments, the false alert designation indication may be omitted and only the coordinates may be transmitted. Returning to block <b>510</b>, if the user does not designate the detected signal as a false alert, then the detector <b>500</b> may simply continue to operate as usual.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Next, the server computer <b>514</b> receives the indication of the false alert designation and the coordinates at block <b>516</b>, and control passes to block <b>518</b> to determine whether a false alert designation, or more specifically an indication of the false alert designation, has been previously received for the received coordinates. The terms false alert designation, an indication of the false alert designation, and false alert designation indication in the context of the server should be treated synonymously. Returning to the block <b>518</b>, if not, and this is the first false alert designation indication for the coordinates, then a counter of false alerts may be started for the coordinates at block <b>520</b>. As such, the server computer <b>514</b> may begin to keep track of the number of false alerts received for these coordinates. The higher the counter, the more likely it may be that the coordinates truly reflect a false alert. The counter may be stored in the remote database <b>72</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref>) in block <b>522</b>, and control then may pass to block <b>516</b> to receive more false alert designations indications and coordinates. Other information may also be stored in the database <b>72</b> besides the counter, such as the coordinates, the false alert designation indication, as well as an identifier of the radar detector that transmitted the coordinates and the false alert designation indication. However, no data may need to be issued by the server computer <b>514</b> as a single false alert designation for the coordinates may not be very accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Turning back to block <b>518</b>, if a false alert designation indication has been previously received for the received coordinates, then block <b>524</b> determines whether the radar detector that transmitted the false alert designation indication just received by the server computer <b>514</b> has previously transmitted any false alert designations for these coordinates. If so, then the false alert designation just received may be ignored at block <b>526</b> as multiple false designations for the same coordinates from the same radar detector may be indicative of a user that is trying to manipulate the accuracy of the data. For example, this check is performed to reduce the chances that a single user (e.g., a police officer) or group of users will misuse their respective radar detectors to manipulate the server computer <b>514</b> into transmitting data that certain coordinates and perhaps the indication of the false alert designation which in turn would cause the detectors receiving the coordinates and false alert designation indication to not issue a warning. If the false alert data received by the detectors is a fake, it may cause users receiving those alerts at their radar detectors to receive speeding tickets at those coordinates. Further, once a user designates a detected signal as a false alert in his or her radar detector, then the radar detector will subsequently not issue a warning and mute or forgo an alert at the location, thus, there is generally no reason for the user to keep designating the same coordinates as a false alert.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Returning to block <b>524</b>, if the false alert designation that was just received was not previously received from the same radar detector, then control may pass to block <b>528</b> to increment the counter of false alerts associated with these coordinates. Next, the counter is updated and stored in the database at block <b>530</b>, and as another check, the updated counter is compared to a threshold at block <b>532</b>. The updated counter is compared to a threshold to ensure that a sufficient number of false alert designations have been received by the server computer <b>514</b> before transmitting data to the detectors, as a low quantity of false alert designations received from radar detectors may not be as accurate. Further, use of the threshold may also help reduce the chances of a group of users, for example, using different radar detectors, from manipulation the notifications of the server computer <b>514</b>. The threshold may set using statistics. For example, the selected threshold may be selected based on analysis and statistics that indicate that the selected threshold is associated with high accuracy in terms of the warnings given or not given by the radar detectors based upon the received data from the server <b>514</b>. Alternatively, the selected threshold may be associated with low chances of manipulation. The threshold may be set and revised as deemed necessary (e.g., to increase accuracy and/or avoid manipulation) automatically by the server computer <b>514</b> and/or by an administrator in charge of the server computer <b>514</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In general, radar detectors and their users will not be able to alter the threshold so as to avoid errors and reduce the chances of manipulation. Although the checks are meant to improve accuracy and reduce the chances of manipulation, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there may still be some inaccuracies, but overall, the routine <b>501</b> (and others described herein) may improve accuracy by reducing the number of false alerts at coordinates that users are likely to encounter.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Returning to block <b>532</b>, if the counter is not more than the threshold, then control may pass to block <b>516</b>, without issuing a notification, for the server computer <b>514</b> to continue to receive false alert designations and coordinates. On the other hand, if the updated counter is more than the threshold, then control may pass to block <b>534</b> to determine which radar detectors are within a radius of the coordinates of the false alert designation, in other words, whether the coordinates fall within the radius of which detectors. The determination of which radar detectors are within the radius may be based on the location, heading, and/or speed data transmitted to the server computer <b>514</b> from block <b>536</b> of detector <b>500</b>, block <b>538</b> of detector <b>502</b>, block <b>540</b> of detector <b>504</b>, and block <b>542</b> of detector <b>506</b>. This information is received by the server computer <b>514</b> and utilized at block <b>534</b>. This data may be continuously received from the various detectors, transmitted at specific intervals such as every ten seconds, dependant on network traffic or network speed, etc. This data may also be transmitted and received with an identifier of the corresponding radar detector to reduce inaccuracies, for example, by not attributing the data of detector <b>502</b> to detector <b>504</b>. However, it may not be necessary to transmit an identifier of the corresponding radar detector, for example, if that radar detector is the only one in a certain area, then the location, heading, and/or speed data received by the server computer <b>514</b> is likely being transmitted by that detector and not another detector. Similarly, new data received that is consistent or in the same vicinity as a location, heading, and/or speed data previously received for a detector likely may mean that the new data is from that radar detector. Further, if a certain detector uniquely transmits location, heading, and/or speed data every eight seconds, for example, then location, heading, and/or speed data received every eight seconds is likely to belong to that radar detector. However, those of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate that the more radar detectors transmitting to the server computer <b>514</b>, then precautions should likely be put in place (e.g., transmitting the location, heading, and/or speed and an identifier of the associated radar detector) to the server computer <b>514</b> to reduce inaccuracies.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Regarding the radius, the radius may be a couple of miles (e.g., ten miles) around the radar detectors <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, with the radar detector in the center of the radius. As the user drives, the radius moves with the moving vehicle and the radar detector within the vehicle, and the server computer <b>514</b> transmits data regarding the coordinates of false alerts falling within that radius. The radius may be, for example, forty miles around a radar detector such that data regarding the next fifty coordinates in the forty mile radius are transmitted to the radar detector. In general, the radius may be selected such as to provide the user with enough data regarding coordinates he or she is likely to encounter so that the radar detector has up to date pertinent information, and as such, the radar detector may use smaller data storage as it is only receiving and storing data from the server computer <b>514</b> that is pertinent. Thus, receiving and storing local data regarding coordinates in the radius around the radar detector, and not wasting space and resources on data outside the radius that is likely not pertinent to the user at that time. Indeed, real-time data from the sever computer <b>514</b> may be continuously transmitted to the detectors <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> for coordinates within the radius. However, it is worth noting that network traffic or other issues may affect how far a user drives without receiving data. Furthermore, if the server computer <b>514</b> does not need to make any notifications regarding coordinates in the radius, there may be no need for the server computer <b>514</b> to transmit data to that detector.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The exact radius may be selected based on statistics, may be dependent on network traffic or network speed or constraints, dependent on a user's particular average driving distance, dependent on the average driving distance of multiple users, dependent on the number of coordinates with data in the area, etc. For example, the radius may be an average distance driven by users based on the location, heading, and/or speed data transmitted to and received by the server computer <b>514</b>. The same radius may be applied across all the radar detectors (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, block <b>534</b>) or different radiuses may be utilized (e.g., the radius for the detector <b>504</b> may be different than the radius utilized for detector <b>506</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Next, control passes to block <b>544</b> to send the false alert designation and the coordinates to the radar detectors within the radius of the coordinates. In this example, all of detectors <b>506</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>500</b> are within the radius, and as such, each of them may be receive data from the server computer <b>514</b> at their respective embedded modem. Each modem is under control of the corresponding processor to receive the data, and the corresponding processor may not issue a warning and mute and/or forgo alerting at the coordinates of the false alert designation at blocks <b>546</b>, <b>548</b>, <b>550</b>, <b>552</b>. The received data may be stored in the flash memory of slot <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) or even the EEPROM <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) of each detector by the corresponding processor. However, as the detector <b>500</b> has already designated these coordinates as a false alert, it may not be necessary to notify detector <b>500</b> (or other detectors that also designated these coordinates as false alert based upon the data in the server <b>514</b>) as the user of detector <b>500</b> is already aware of the false alert, especially since the server computer <b>514</b> may already keep track of the radar detectors for which it has received false alert designations for these coordinates. But it may be more simple to transmit data to all detectors in the radius that are in communication with the server computer <b>514</b>. As such, the block <b>552</b> indicates that it is optional.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Turning to the exemplary threat designation routine <b>601</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, this routine is similar to routine <b>501</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and illustrates the same four radar detectors labeled as detectors <b>600</b>, <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, akin to the detectors <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, respectively, and the same server computer labeled as server computer <b>614</b>, akin to the server computer <b>514</b>. Starting with block <b>610</b>, the user may give a specific position a threat designation to indicate a speed trap, camera, etc. by a switch, remote button, or by a button located on the detector, and the threat designation indication and the coordinates may be transmitted automatically to the server computer <b>614</b> at block <b>612</b>. It is worth noting that it may be advantageous to transmit both the coordinates of the threat designation as well as the threat designation indication to reduce inaccuracies among all the coordinates that will be transmitted from the various detectors and received by the server computer <b>614</b>. However, in some embodiments, the threat designation indication may be omitted and only the coordinates may be transmitted. Returning to block <b>610</b>, if the user does not designate the detected signal as a threat, then the detector <b>600</b> may simply continue to operate as usual.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Next, the server computer <b>614</b> receives the threat designation indication and the coordinates at block <b>616</b>, and control passes to block <b>618</b> to determine whether a threat designation has been previously received for the received coordinates. If not, and this is the first threat designation for the coordinates, then a counter of threats may be started for the coordinates at block <b>620</b>. As such, the server computer <b>614</b> may begin to keep track of the number of threats received for these coordinates. The higher the counter, the more likely it may be that the coordinates truly reflect a threat. The counter may be stored in the remote database <b>72</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref>) in block <b>622</b>, and control then may pass to bock <b>516</b> to receive more threat designations and coordinates. Other information may also be stored in the database <b>72</b> including the coordinates, the threat designation indication, as well as an identifier of the radar detector that transmitted the coordinates and the threat designation indication. However, no data may need to be issued by the server computer <b>614</b> to any of the detectors as a single threat designation for the coordinates may not be very accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Returning back to block <b>618</b>, if a threat designation has been previously received for the received coordinates, then block <b>624</b> determines whether the radar detector that transmitted the threat designation just received by the server computer <b>614</b> has previously transmitted any threat designations for these coordinates. If so, then the threat designations just received may be ignored at block <b>626</b> as multiple threat designations for the same coordinates from the same radar detector may be indicative of a user that is trying to manipulate the accuracy of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Returning to block <b>624</b>, if the threat designation that was just received was not previously received from the same radar detector, then control may pass to block <b>628</b> to increment the counter of threats associated with these coordinates. Next, the counter is updated and stored in the database at block <b>630</b>, and as another check, the updated counter is compared to a threshold at block <b>632</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Returning to block <b>632</b>, if the counter is not more than the threshold, then control may pass to block <b>616</b>, without issuing a notification, for the server computer <b>614</b> to continue to receive threat designations and coordinates. On the other hand, if the updated counter is more than the threshold, then control may pass to block <b>634</b> to determine which radar detectors are within a radius of the coordinates of the threat designation. The determination of which radar detectors are within the radius is based on the location, heading, and/or speed data transmitted to the server computer <b>614</b> from block <b>636</b> of detector <b>600</b>, block <b>638</b> of detector <b>602</b>, block <b>640</b> of detector <b>604</b>, and block <b>642</b> of detector <b>606</b>. This information is received by the server computer <b>614</b> and utilized at block <b>634</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Next, control passes to block <b>644</b> to send the threat designation and the coordinates to the radar detectors within the radius of the coordinates. In this example, all of detectors <b>606</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>602</b>, <b>600</b> are within the radius, and as such, each of them may be receive at their respective embedded modems data from the server computer <b>614</b>. Each modem is under control of the processor to receive the data, and each processor may issue a warning to alert the user at the coordinates of the threat designation at blocks <b>646</b>, <b>648</b>, <b>650</b>, <b>652</b>, respectively. The received data may be stored in the flash memory of slot <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) or even the EEPROM <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) of each detector. However, as the detector <b>600</b> has already designated these coordinates as a threat, it may not be necessary to notify detector <b>600</b> (or other detectors that also designated these coordinates as threat) as the user of detector <b>600</b> is already aware of the threat, especially since the server computer <b>614</b> may already keep track of the radar detectors for which it has received threat designations for these coordinates. But it may be more simple to transmit the data to all detectors in the radius that are in communication with the server computer <b>614</b>. As such, the block <b>652</b> indicates that it is optional.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Furthermore, in each of the transmission between from a detector to the server or from the server to the detector it may be advantageous to also transmit some data related to the coordinates and not just simply the coordinates to reduce inaccuracies, but the coordinates alone may be transmitted. Indeed, as the server computer <b>514</b>, <b>614</b> may be receiving coordinates associated with different events such as false designations, threat designations, and the continuous location data of each detector, it may be advantageous for the detectors, and specifically the modems embedded therein, to transmit data related to the coordinates, for example, such as an indication of the type of the event associated with the transmitted coordinates to reduce inaccuracies. Likewise, it may be advantageous for the server computer <b>514</b>, <b>614</b> to transmit its data with at least an indication of the type of the event (e.g., threat designation or false alert designation) associated with the transmitted coordinates to reduce inaccuracies. For example, it may be beneficial to also transmit an identifier of the detector with the heading data or the speed data, for example, However, transmitting an indication of the event connected with the transmitted coordinates may not be necessary in some embodiments, for example, if the event can be deduced.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Further, it is worth noting that although various checks are included in routine <b>601</b> and <b>501</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) to reduce inaccuracies and limit manipulation, some or all the checks may be omitted in some embodiments. In such cases, the detectors, with their embedded modems, may be in real-time two way communication with the server computer and simply receive and transmit data without the checks.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Turning to the exemplary update routine <b>701</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, this routine illustrates the same four radar detectors labeled as detectors <b>700</b>, <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, akin to the radar detectors <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and the radar detectors <b>600</b>, <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, respectively, and the same server computer labeled as server computer <b>708</b>, akin to the server computer <b>514</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and the server computer <b>614</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Specifically, the server computer <b>708</b> may transmit a software update to the radar detectors <b>700</b>, <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> at block <b>710</b>. In particular, the software update may be transmitted from the remote database of the server, under control of the processor of the server <b>614</b>, to each radar detector in communication with the server computer <b>708</b>, and if a radar detector is turned off, for example, the update may be transmitted once that radar detector is turned on and communicating with the server computer <b>708</b>. Next, the software update is received from the server computer <b>710</b> by the embedded modem within each of detected <b>700</b>, <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, specifically, received at block <b>712</b> of detector <b>700</b>, block <b>714</b> of detector <b>702</b>, block <b>716</b> of detector <b>704</b>, and block <b>718</b> of detector <b>706</b>. The updates may be stored in the flash memory of slot <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) or even the EEPROM <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) of each detector. Each modem is under control of the processor of the detector to receive the software updates, and the processors implement the updates.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">As such, software updates or other types of updates (e.g., firmware upgrades) may be automatically transmitted, in real-time, from the server computer <b>708</b> to each of detectors <b>700</b>, <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> without any user intervention. For example, the user may have his or her detector automatically updated without having to manually remove the radar detector from the vehicle and manually connect it to a computer (e.g., via USB), which may be cumbersome and/or impractical for some users (e.g., elderly users), and without having to manually insert software updates in any manner. Thus, instead of forgoing software updates due to the inconvenience or difficulties that may arise with manual updates, the routine <b>701</b> may be utilized to automatically update the radar detectors in real-time as often as needed without user intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Additionally, it is worth noting that the routines <b>501</b>, <b>601</b>, and/or <b>701</b> may be utilized in conjunction with each other. For example, the radar detector <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> may be utilized to both transmit false alert designations and threat designations, along with the coordinates of these. Indeed, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that often times the status of some coordinates may constantly change, for example, if the police officer is at a position, then users may designate it as a threat, and after exceeding the threshold, the server computer may transmit the notification of the threat designation with the coordinates. However, if the police officer leaves those coordinates, then users may designate it as a false alert, and after exceeding the threshold, the server computer may transmit the notification of the false alert designation with the coordinates. Furthermore, at about the same time, a software update may be transmitted to the detector <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>. Alternatively, the opposite may occur with the false alert designation first and then the threat designation second. Thus, although the routines <b>501</b>, <b>601</b>, <b>701</b> are illustrated as separate routines for simplicity, the routines may be utilized cooperatively on the four detectors and the server.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">It will be appreciated that the embodiments illustrated above are exemplary and not limiting, and that other embodiments of the present invention fall within the scope of the appended claims. For example, the features shown in the power cord assembly may be integrated into an under-dash unit rather than a housing coupled to the power plug. The vehicle's built-in electronics may also incorporate any or all of the functions described. In some embodiments, for example, the detector <b>20</b> may have both the embedded GSM cellular data modem <b>200</b> and also be in operable connection with the external mobile telephone <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
