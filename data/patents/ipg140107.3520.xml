<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a proximity sensor using a magnetic field to detect the presence or absence of a metal body as an object to be detected or to detect the position of the metal body.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A proximity sensor using a magnetic field is known as one of sensors detecting the presence or absence of a metal body as an object to be detected or detecting the position of the metal body. This proximity sensor is widely utilized mainly for various production facilities, industrial robots and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The proximity sensor mainly includes a cylindrical housing, a coil assembly having a core and a detecting coil, and a circuit board provided with a processing circuit electrically connected to the detecting coil. The coil assembly is disposed at the front end within the housing. In addition, at least a part of the circuit board provided with the processing circuit is disposed behind the coil assembly within the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, the proximity sensor is often provided with a light emitting device as an indicator light. This light emitting device as an indicator light includes, for example, a device turning on/off the light in accordance with turning on/off of the power supply, a device turning on/off the light in accordance with the detection state of the metal body, a device turning on/off the light in order to inform the user of the information used for making various settings when the proximity sensor is installed, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When used in any of the above-described cases, the light emitting device as an indicator light is generally mounted on one of the main surfaces of the circuit board provided with the processing circuit as described above. For example, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 11-312446, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 2007-35583 and the like disclose a proximity sensor in which a light emitting device as an indicator light is mounted on one of the main surfaces of the circuit board.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the sensor serves to detect presence or absence of a metal body or a position of the metal body using a magnetic field. The proximity sensor includes a housing, a detecting coil, a circuit board, a light emitting device, and a cylindrical light guide. The housing is made of a light-blocking member having an elongated cylindrical shape and including a frond end and a rear end in an axial direction. The detecting coil is located at the front end within the housing. The circuit board is made of a member in a shape of a flat plate and disposed behind the detecting coil so as to extend along the axial direction of the housing. The circuit board is provided with a processing circuit electrically connected to the detecting coil. The light emitting device is mounted on one of main surfaces of the circuit board and emits light in accordance with an operation state of the proximity sensor. The cylindrical light guide is a light-transmitting member surrounding, along a circumferential direction of the housing, a portion of the circuit board having the light emitting device mounted thereon and guiding outgoing light from the light emitting device to be emitted to outside. The cylindrical light guide includes a first light outgoing region causing the light emitted from the light emitting device to pass therethrough and directly emitting the light to outside, a reflective surface reflecting the light emitted from the light emitting device to guide the light through the cylindrical light guide in the circumferential direction, and a second light outgoing region emitting, to outside, the light reflected on the reflective surface and propagated through the cylindrical light guide.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment of the proximity sensor according to the present invention, it is preferable that the first light outgoing region is provided in a portion of an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical light guide covering the one of the main surfaces of the circuit board on which the light emitting device is mounted. In this case, it is preferable that the second light outgoing region is provided in a portion of the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical light guide blocked by the circuit board as seen from the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment of the proximity sensor according to the present invention, the reflective surface may be formed by providing a flat region in an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical light guide or may be formed by providing a V-shaped groove in cross section in an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical light guide. Furthermore, in the proximity sensor according to the present invention, the reflective surface may be formed by providing a hollow within the cylindrical light guide.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment of the proximity sensor according to the present invention, the cylindrical light guide may further include a refractive surface refracting the light emitted from the light emitting device to guide the light through the cylindrical light guide in the circumferential direction. In this case, the refractive surface may be formed by providing a flat region in an inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical light guide or may be formed by providing a V-shaped groove in cross section in an inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical light guide.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment of the proximity sensor according to the present invention, the first light outgoing region and the second light outgoing region each may be formed by providing a flat region in an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical light guide or each may be formed by providing a V-shaped groove in cross section in an outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical light guide.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment of the proximity sensor according to the present invention, the cylindrical light guide may be exposed at a position rearwardly of the rear end of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment of the proximity sensor according to the present invention, the cylindrical light guide may be covered by the housing. In this case, a window for exposing each of the first light outgoing region and the second light outgoing region is provided in a portion of the housing corresponding to each of the first light outgoing region and the second light outgoing region provided in the cylindrical light guide.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The embodiments of the present invention will be hereinafter described in detail with reference to drawings. It is to be noted that the proximity sensor in the first embodiment described below has a connection to the outside made by cords, and the proximity sensor in the second embodiment described below has a connection to the outside made by terminal pins.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross sectional view showing the internal structure of the proximity sensor in the first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view showing the assembly structure of the proximity sensor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. First, referring to these <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the structure of the proximity sensor in the present embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a proximity sensor <b>1</b>A according to the present embodiment has an approximately cylindrical outer shape and mainly includes a case body <b>10</b> as a housing, a coil assembly <b>20</b>, a circuit board <b>30</b>, a holder <b>40</b>A as a fixing member, and a cord <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Case body <b>10</b> is formed of an elongated cylindrical member which is made of metal and has both ends opened. Case body <b>10</b> has a front end and a rear end in the axial direction. Coil assembly <b>20</b> is attached to the front end of case body <b>10</b>, and holder <b>40</b>A is attached to the rear end of case body <b>10</b>. In addition, case body <b>10</b> has a light blocking effect which prevents light from passing therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Coil assembly <b>20</b> includes a core <b>21</b> and a detecting coil <b>22</b>. Core <b>21</b> is formed of a short cylindrical member made of magnetic materials. Detecting coil <b>22</b> is formed in an approximately cylindrical shape, for example, by winding the lead wire therearound and housed in the annular recess provided in core <b>21</b>. It is to be noted that core <b>21</b> has a rear face provided with a support groove <b>21</b><i>a </i>for supporting the edge of circuit board <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Coil assembly <b>20</b> is housed within a coil case <b>14</b> made of a cylindrical insulating member having a bottom in such a manner that the front face of core <b>21</b> is in contact with the bottom of coil case <b>14</b>. Coil case <b>14</b> is fixedly press-fitted into case body <b>10</b> such that the bottom of coil case <b>14</b> is located at the front end of case body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Circuit board <b>30</b> is made of a rigid wiring board in the shape of a flat plate and disposed behind coil assembly <b>20</b> so as to extend along the axial direction of case body <b>10</b>. Circuit board <b>30</b> has a surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>corresponding to one main surface and a rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the other main surface. Each of surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>and rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>is provided with a conductor pattern. It is to be noted that a rigid wiring board is a circuit board having high rigidity which is represented by a glass-epoxy board and particularly suitable for mounting electronic components thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Circuit board <b>30</b> has various processing circuits formed thereon. The processing circuit includes an oscillation circuit having detecting coil <b>22</b> as a resonant circuit element, and a discrimination circuit comparing the oscillation amplitude of the oscillation circuit with a threshold value for binarization. Furthermore, circuit board <b>30</b> is also provided with an output circuit converting the output of the discrimination circuit into a voltage output or a current output in a predetermined form, and a power supply circuit converting the electric power introduced from outside into power in a predetermined power supply form for outputting the electric power. In addition, circuit board <b>30</b> is also provided with a light emitting device driving circuit which controls driving of a light emitting device <b>32</b> which will be described later. These various types of circuits each are formed of the above-described conductor pattern provided in circuit board <b>30</b> and the electronic components mounted on surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Light emitting device <b>32</b> is mounted on a portion of surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> located outside of case body <b>10</b>. Light emitting device <b>32</b> is driven by the above-described light emitting device driving circuit and emits light in accordance with the operation state of proximity sensor <b>1</b>A. Light emitting device <b>32</b> is formed of an LED (Light Emitting Diode), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, a core wire <b>51</b> of cord <b>50</b> is bonded by solder (not shown) to a portion of rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> located outside of case body <b>10</b>. Cord <b>50</b> serves as a connection for electrically connecting the above-described output circuit and power supply circuit to the outside. An adapter <b>52</b> for preventing disengagement is attached in the vicinity of the end of cord <b>50</b>. Adapter <b>52</b> is brought into contact with the stop face provided in a cord retainer <b>44</b> of holder <b>40</b>A which will be described later, so that cord <b>50</b> is prevented from falling off.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Holder <b>40</b>A having an approximately cylindrical shape is formed by injection molding of a light-transmitting resin material. Holder <b>40</b>A serves as a member for fixing circuit board <b>30</b> to case body <b>10</b> and includes a fixed portion <b>41</b>, a closing portion <b>42</b>, a cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>, and cord retainer <b>44</b>. Fixed portion <b>41</b> having a cylindrical shape is fixed to the rear end of case body <b>10</b>. Closing portion <b>42</b> is in the shape of a flat plate and serves to close the opening located at the rear end of case body <b>10</b>. Cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> having an approximately cylindrical shape surrounds, along the circumferential direction of case body <b>10</b>, a portion of circuit board <b>30</b> having light emitting device <b>32</b> mounted thereon. Cord retainer <b>44</b> having an approximately cylindrical shape serves to retain inserted cord <b>50</b>. In addition, cord retainer <b>44</b> has an inner circumferential surface which is provided in its predetermined position with a stop face for preventing cord <b>50</b> from falling off.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Fixed portion <b>41</b> which is a part of holder <b>40</b>A is press-fitted into the opening located at the rear end of case body <b>10</b>, so that holder <b>40</b>A is fixed to case body <b>10</b>. Accordingly, closing portion <b>42</b>, cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> and cord retainer <b>44</b> of holder <b>40</b>A each are exposed to the outside at the position behind the rear end of case body <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this case, in the predetermined position of the inner circumferential surface of each of fixed portion <b>41</b> and cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>A, a support groove <b>48</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the like) is provided for supporting both side ends located in the short-side direction of circuit board <b>30</b>. Accordingly, circuit board <b>30</b> is fixed to case body <b>10</b> by the configuration in which the front end of circuit board <b>30</b> is supported by support groove <b>21</b><i>a </i>provided in the rear face of the above-described core <b>21</b> and both side ends at the rear end of circuit board <b>30</b> are supported by the above-described support groove <b>48</b> provided in holder <b>40</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is to be noted that the space within each of case body <b>10</b> and holder <b>40</b>A is sealed by filling the space with a resin sealing layer <b>70</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the like). Resin sealing layer <b>70</b> serves to air-tightly and water-tightly seal the space within each of case body <b>10</b> and holder <b>40</b>A against the outside while protecting various components (circuit board <b>30</b>, and various electronic components, wiring members and the like mounted on circuit board <b>30</b>) incorporated into case body <b>10</b> and holder <b>40</b>A. In addition, resin sealing layer <b>70</b> is formed by injecting and curing liquid resin. While resin materials such as an epoxy resin, for example, are suitably used for this resin sealing layer <b>70</b>, at least a portion of the resin sealing layer located within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>A should be formed by a light-transmitting resin material or a thin-film sealing resin layer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross sectional view of the proximity sensor taken along a line III-III shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and also is a schematic cross sectional view showing the shape of the cylindrical light guide of the holder as a fixing member. Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, described in detail will be the shape of the cylindrical light guide and a light path of the outgoing light of the light emitting device guided in the cylindrical light guide. Although only a part of the outgoing light from the light emitting device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for ease of understanding, light is actually radially emitted from the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>A has an approximately cylindrical shape and includes an outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>and an inner circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>b</i>. In the predetermined position of inner circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>b </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>, a pair of support grooves <b>48</b> for supporting the above-described circuit board <b>30</b> is provided. The pair of support grooves <b>48</b> supports both side ends of circuit board <b>30</b> to support circuit board <b>30</b> with holder <b>40</b>A. Light emitting device <b>32</b> is mounted on a portion of surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> surrounded by cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>A. Furthermore, the space within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> is filled with light-transmitting resin sealing layer <b>70</b>, so that light emitting device <b>32</b> is sealed in resin sealing layer <b>70</b>. In this case, it is preferably that resin sealing layer <b>70</b> is lower in refractive index than the material forming cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>. When resin sealing layer <b>70</b> is lower in refractive index than the material forming cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>, the effect of confining the light within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> is remarkably improved, which causes an increase in the amount of the light emitted from the second light emitting surface as the second light outgoing region which will be described later. Consequently, the indication state of light emitting device <b>32</b> can be observed from outside with good visibility.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a portion of inner circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>b </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located above a light outgoing surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of light emitting device <b>32</b>, a flat region is provided, to thereby form a refractive surface <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>. Furthermore, in a portion of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located above light emitting device <b>32</b>, a V-shaped groove in cross section is formed, so that a pair of flat regions is provided which is arranged at an angle with respect to each other. This leads to formation of a pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. Refractive surface <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and the pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> serve to refract and reflect a part of the light emitted from light outgoing surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of light emitting device <b>32</b> in the circumferential direction within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>. These surfaces each are provided in a portion of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> covering surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> having light emitting device <b>32</b> mounted thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, the portion of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> covering surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> having light emitting device <b>32</b> mounted thereon entirely serves as the first light emitting surface as the first light outgoing region. This first light emitting surface serves to emit the light to the outside when a part of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> passes through cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>. In this case, the portion of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> provided with the above-described reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is also included in the first light emitting surface. This is because a part of the light applied to reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> passes also through reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> without reflection. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the irradiation range of the above-described first light emitting surface is shown by a pair of thin lines extending from outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>in the upward direction in the figure and each having an upper portion of a broken line. In other words, a portion of the surface of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located between the above-described pair of thin lines roughly shows a portion serving as the first light emitting surface, which will be similarly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, in the predetermined position of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located in the portion blocked by circuit board <b>30</b> as seen from light emitting device <b>32</b>, a V-shaped groove in cross section is formed, so that a pair of flat regions is provided which is arranged at an angle with respect to each other. One of the pair of flat regions provides a second light emitting surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> as the second light outgoing region. The above-described groove is formed below circuit board <b>30</b> and in the vicinity of each of both side ends of circuit board <b>30</b>, so that two second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> are provided which face in the opposite direction to the above-described first light emitting surface. These two second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> emit light to the outside when a part of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is guided by cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> and passed through these two second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the irradiation range of second light emitting surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> is shown by a pair of thin lines extending from each of the pair of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> in the downward direction in the figure and each having a lower portion of a broken line, which will be similarly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>8</b>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In proximity sensor <b>1</b>A according to the present embodiment, a part of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is refracted and reflected on refractive surface <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and the pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> to cause the light to be guided through cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> in the circumferential direction. In some cases, the light is further reflected on outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> and thereby collected at the pair of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. Consequently, most of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is efficiently collected at each of the pair of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, with the result that second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> sufficiently emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As described above, according to proximity sensor <b>1</b>A in the present embodiment, even in the case where only a single light emitting device <b>32</b> is mounted on surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b>, the light emitted from this single light emitting device <b>32</b> can be sufficiently emitted omnidirectionally in the simplified configuration in which only a flat region is provided in each of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>and inner circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>b </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>A. The above-described flat region can be readily formed during the injection molding of holder <b>40</b>A, which prevents an increase in the manufacturing cost. Therefore, when the above-described configuration is applied, a proximity sensor manufactured at low cost can be achieved that allows the indication state of light emitting device <b>32</b> to be observed from outside with good visibility without the need to mount any light emitting device on rear surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of circuit board <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref> each show a schematic cross sectional view of the shape of the cylindrical light guide of the proximity sensor according to the first to the fifth modifications, respectively, based on the present embodiment. Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref>, described will be the shape of the cylindrical light guide of the proximity sensor according to the first to fifth modifications based on the present embodiment and a light path of the outgoing light of the light emitting device which is guided in the cylindrical light guide. Although only a part of the outgoing light from the light emitting device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref> for ease of understanding, the light is actually radially emitted from the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the proximity sensor according to the first modification, the shape of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of a holder <b>40</b>B is different from that of proximity sensor <b>1</b>A in the above-described present embodiment. Specifically, the shapes of the reflective surface, the refractive surface and the first light emitting surface provided in cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> are different while other components are identical in shape. Furthermore, in the proximity sensor according to the first modification, the space within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> is not sealed in the resin sealing layer, but light emitting device <b>32</b> mounted on surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> is exposed within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>. Particularly, the differences of the shape of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> will be hereinafter described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a portion of inner circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>b </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located above light outgoing surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of light emitting device <b>32</b>, a V-shaped groove in cross section is formed, so that a pair of flat regions is provided which is arranged at an angle with respect to each other. This leads to formation of a pair of refractive surfaces <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>. Furthermore, in a portion of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located above light emitting device <b>32</b>, a flat region is provided, thereby forming reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>. The pair of refractive surfaces <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> serve to refract and reflect a part of the light emitted from light outgoing surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of light emitting device <b>32</b> in the circumferential direction within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>. These surfaces each are provided in a portion of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> covering surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> having light emitting device <b>32</b> mounted thereon. It is to be noted that the portion of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> covering surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> having light emitting device <b>32</b> mounted thereon entirely serves as the first light emitting surface. In addition, the portion of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> provided with the above-described reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is also included in the first light emitting surface.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also in the configuration as described above, a part of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is refracted and reflected on the pair of refractive surfaces <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> and reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b>, to cause the light to be guided through cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> in the circumferential direction. In some cases, the light is further reflected on outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> and thereby collected at each of the pair of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. Consequently, most of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is efficiently collected at each of the pair of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, with the result that second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> sufficiently emit light. Therefore, also in the case where the configuration as in the first modification is applied, the effects can be achieved which are similar to those achieved in the case where proximity sensor <b>1</b>A in the above-described present embodiment is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the first modification employs the configuration in which no resin sealing layer is provided in the space within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>, resin sealing layer <b>70</b> may be provided within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) as in the case of proximity sensor <b>1</b>A in the above-described present embodiment. In that case, the amount of light reflected on reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> can be adjusted by adjusting the refractive index difference between cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> and resin sealing layer <b>70</b>, and thus, the amount of the light emitted from the first light emitting surface and the second light emitting surface can also be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the proximity sensor according to the second modification is different in the shape of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of a holder <b>40</b>C from proximity sensor <b>1</b>A in the above-described present embodiment. Specifically, the shapes of the reflective surface and the first light emitting surface provided in cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> are different while other components are identical in shape. Particularly, the differences of the shape of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> will be hereinafter described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a portion of inner circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>b </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located above light outgoing surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of light emitting device <b>32</b>, a flat region is provided to thereby form refractive surface <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>. Furthermore, in the predetermined position of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located above light emitting device <b>32</b>, a V-shaped groove in cross section is formed, so that a pair of flat regions is provided which is arranged at an angle with respect to each other.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, a proximity sensor <b>1</b>B in the present embodiment having an approximately cylindrical outer shape mainly includes a case body <b>10</b> and a holder case <b>12</b> each as a housing, a coil assembly <b>20</b>, a circuit board <b>30</b>, a holder <b>40</b>H as a fixing member, a receptacle <b>60</b>, a terminal pin <b>62</b>, and a flexible wiring board <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Case body <b>10</b> forming a housing is similar to case body <b>10</b> in the above-described first embodiment and has a light blocking effect.

Holder case <b>12</b> also has a front end and a rear end in the axial direction. The front end of holder case <b>12</b> is inserted into the rear end of case body <b>10</b> and fixedly press-fitted therein.

It is to be noted that flexible wiring board <b>63</b> corresponds to a wiring board that is excellent in flexibility as compared with the above-described rigid wiring board and that is formed by attaching a conductor pattern with an adhesive and the like onto the main surface of the base material made of polyimide resin, for example. Since this flexible wiring board <b>63</b> has moderate flexibility, it can be freely bent or folded and can also be used as a wiring board for relaying between electric contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In contrast to proximity sensor <b>1</b>A in the above-described first embodiment, in proximity sensor <b>1</b>B in the present embodiment, cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>H is covered by light-blocking holder case <b>12</b>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a portion of holder case <b>12</b> covering cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> is provided with a plurality of windows <b>13</b> so as to allow the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> to be emitted to outside.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a cross sectional view of the proximity sensor taken along a line XII-XII shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and is a schematic cross sectional view showing the shape of the holder case as a housing and the shape of the cylindrical light guide of the holder as a fixing member. Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, described in detail will be the shape of the holder case, the shape of the cylindrical light guide and the light path of the outgoing light of the light emitting device that is guided in the cylindrical light guide. Although only a part of the light emitted from the light emitting device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for ease of understanding, the light is actually radially emitted from the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, holder case <b>12</b> having an approximately cylindrical shape has an inner space into which holder <b>40</b>H is fixedly press-fitted. Cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>H having an approximately cylindrical shape includes outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>and inner circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>b</i>. Most part of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> is in contact with the inner circumferential surface of holder case <b>12</b>. In the predetermined position of inner circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>b </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>, a pair of support grooves <b>48</b> is provided for supporting circuit board <b>30</b>. The pair of support grooves <b>48</b> supports both side ends of circuit board <b>30</b> for supporting circuit board <b>30</b> with holder <b>40</b>H. Light emitting device <b>32</b> is mounted on a portion of surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> surrounded by cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>H. Furthermore, the space within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> is filled with light-transmitting resin sealing layer <b>70</b>, so that light emitting device <b>32</b> is sealed in resin sealing layer <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It is to be noted that holder <b>40</b>H can be attached to holder case <b>12</b> by integral molding using a molding machine in addition to press-fitting fixation as described above. In other words, when a molding machine is used for molding holder <b>40</b>H integrally with holder case <b>12</b>, holder case <b>12</b> is fixed in the molding die which is then placed in the molding machine to perform injection-molding of holder <b>40</b>H. This results in formation of holder <b>40</b>H integrally with holder case <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Furthermore, it is preferable that resin sealing layer <b>70</b> is configured to have a thin film. This is because the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is propagated through cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>, and also because resin sealing layer <b>70</b> made of a thick film causes an increase in the reflection number and re-incident of the light on resin sealing layer <b>70</b>, which leads to an increase in light propagation loss, with the result that the amount of light emitted to outside is decreased. Accordingly, resin sealing layer <b>70</b> is formed to have a thin film while sufficiently ensuring the thickness of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>, which allows stabilized light propagation. Consequently, the amount of light emitted to the outside can be satisfactorily ensured. In this case, it is preferable that resin sealing layer <b>70</b> formed as a thin film is configured to have a thickness enough to prevent any influence from being exerted on the performance of light emitting device <b>32</b> and to allow light emitting device <b>32</b> to be provided with an appropriate environment resistance (for example, oil resistance, water resistance, moisture resistance or the like). Specifically, it is preferable that the thickness is 5 &#x3bc;m or more and 20 &#x3bc;m or less.</p>

Refractive surface <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>, the pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and the pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> serve to refract and reflect a part of the light emitted from light outgoing surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of light emitting device <b>32</b> within cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> in the circumferential direction. These surfaces each are provided in a portion of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> covering surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> on which light emitting device <b>32</b> is mounted. In addition, in a portion of the inner circumferential surface of holder case <b>12</b> corresponding to the portion where the above-described pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is provided, a V-shaped protrusion <b>12</b><i>a </i>in cross section is provided so as to fit into the V-shaped groove in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The above-described reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> and the portions of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located on both sides of reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> function as the first light emitting surface. This first light emitting surface serves to emit the light to the outside when a part of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> passes through cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>. Two first light emitting surfaces are provided based on the number of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>. In this case, the planes of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located on both sides of reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> include a plane located adjacent to reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> which corresponds to one flat region of the pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>. Furthermore, holder case <b>12</b> is provided with a window <b>13</b> in a portion where the first light emitting surface including this reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> is located, in which case two windows <b>13</b> are provided based on the number of the first light emitting surfaces. This causes the light passing through the first light emitting surface to be emitted through these two windows <b>13</b> to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Furthermore, in the predetermined position of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located in the portion blocked by circuit board <b>30</b> as seen from light emitting device <b>32</b>, a V-shaped groove in cross section is formed, so that a pair of flat regions is provided which is arranged at an angle with respect to each other. One of the pair of flat regions provides a second light emitting surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. The above-described groove is formed below circuit board <b>30</b> and in the vicinity of each of both side ends of circuit board <b>30</b>, to thereby provide two second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. Each second light emitting surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> faces in the direction different from that of the above-described first light emitting surface. These two second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> serve to emit the light to the outside when a part of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is guided through cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> and passed through these two second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. Also, holder case <b>12</b> is provided with a window <b>13</b> located in the position where each second light emitting surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> is provided, in which case two windows <b>13</b> are provided based on the number of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. This causes the light passing through the second light emitting surface to be emitted through these two windows <b>13</b> to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In proximity sensor <b>1</b>B according to the present embodiment, a part of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is refracted and reflected on refractive surface <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>, the pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and the pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> described above to cause the light to be guided through cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> in the circumferential direction. The light is further reflected on outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> and thereby collected at the pair of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. Consequently, most of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is efficiently collected at each of the pair of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, with the result that second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> sufficiently emit light.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As described above, according to proximity sensor <b>1</b>B in the present embodiment, even in the case where only a single light emitting device <b>32</b> is mounted on surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b>, the light emitted from this single light emitting device <b>32</b> can be sufficiently emitted omnidirectionally in the simplified configuration in which only a flat region is provided in each of outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>and inner circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>b </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>H and only window <b>13</b> is provided in a portion of holder case <b>12</b> corresponding to cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>. Since the above-described flat region can be readily formed during the injection molding of holder <b>40</b>H and the above-described window <b>13</b> can be readily formed during formation of holder case <b>12</b>, an increase in the manufacturing cost can be suppressed. Therefore, by applying the above-described configuration, a proximity sensor manufactured at low cost can be achieved which allows the indication state of light emitting device <b>32</b> to be observed from outside with good visibility.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In addition, proximity sensor <b>1</b>B in the present embodiment is configured such that protrusion <b>12</b><i>a </i>is provided in the inner circumferential surface of holder case <b>12</b> so as to fit into the V-shaped groove in cross section formed in order to provide a pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> in outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of holder <b>40</b>H. The above-described configuration allows the groove and protrusion <b>12</b><i>a </i>to perform a positioning function when holder <b>40</b>H is fixedly press-fitted into holder case <b>12</b>. Therefore, positioning by the groove and protrusion <b>12</b><i>a </i>allows positioning of the first light emitting surface, second light emitting surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> and window <b>13</b> in the circumferential direction with considerable ease.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Furthermore, by applying the configuration similar to that of proximity sensor <b>1</b>B in the present embodiment, even in the case where the distance between circuit board <b>30</b> and outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>is relatively short (that is, the portion of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> facing light emitting device <b>32</b> is thin in thickness), the amount of light emitted from the first light emitting surface and the second light emitting surface can be adjusted by adjusting the angle of each of reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> and reflective surface <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b>. Consequently, the proximity sensor can be configured in a relatively small size.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic cross sectional view showing the shape of the cylindrical light guide of the proximity sensor according to the modification based on the present embodiment. Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, described will be the shape of the holder case of the proximity sensor according to the modification of the present embodiment, the shape of the cylindrical light guide and the light path of the outgoing light from the light emitting device that is guided in the cylindrical light guide. Although only a part of the outgoing light from the light emitting device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> for ease of understanding, the light is actually radially emitted from the light emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, in the proximity sensor according to the present modification, the shape of holder case <b>12</b> and the shape of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> of a holder <b>40</b>I are different from those of proximity sensor <b>1</b>B in the above-described present embodiment in that, specifically, protrusion <b>12</b><i>a </i>as described above is not provided in the inner circumferential surface of holder case <b>12</b> and also in the configuration of a part of the reflective surface provided in cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>. Other components are identical in shape. In particular, the differences of the configuration of the reflective surface will be hereinafter described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In proximity sensor <b>1</b>B according to the above-described present embodiment, a pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> is formed by providing a V-shaped groove in cross section in outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b>. In contrast, in the proximity sensor according to the present modification, a pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> is formed by providing hollow <b>43</b><i>c </i>in a portion of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> located above light emitting device <b>32</b>. More specifically, cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> has planes defining hollow <b>43</b><i>c</i>, one of which is located adjacent to light emitting device <b>32</b> and has a V-shaped groove in cross section formed therein, so that a pair of flat regions is provided which is arranged at an angle with respect to each other. This leads to formation of a pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>c</i><b>1</b>. The pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> serves to reflect the light emitted from light outgoing surface <b>32</b><i>a </i>of light emitting device <b>32</b> through cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> in the circumferential direction. The pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> is provided in a portion of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> covering surface <b>30</b><i>a </i>of circuit board <b>30</b> having light emitting device <b>32</b> mounted thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Also in the configuration as described above, a part of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is refracted and reflected on refractive surface <b>43</b><i>b</i><b>1</b>, the pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>c</i><b>1</b> and the pair of reflective surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> described above, to cause the light to be guided through cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> in the circumferential direction. The light is further reflected on outer circumferential surface <b>43</b><i>a </i>of cylindrical light guide <b>43</b> and thereby collected at the pair of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>. Consequently, most of the light emitted from light emitting device <b>32</b> is efficiently collected at each of the pair of second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, with the result that second light emitting surfaces <b>43</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> sufficiently emit light. Therefore, also in the case where the configuration as in the present modification is applied, the effects can be achieved which are similar to those achieved in the case where proximity sensor <b>1</b>B in the above-described present embodiment is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Although the first and second embodiments according to the present invention and their modifications as explained above have been described by illustrating the case where a cylindrical light guide is formed of a part of the holder as a fixing member, the configuration is not necessarily limited thereto, but a cylindrical light guide may be formed separately from a fixing member.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Furthermore, the first and second embodiments according to the present invention and their modifications as explained above have been described by illustrating the case where a flat region is formed by providing a V-shaped groove in cross section in the outer circumferential surface and/or inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical light guide and this flat region provides each of a reflective surface and a refractive surface. However, the reflective surface and refractive surface are not necessarily a flat plane but may be formed so as to have a curved surface.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Furthermore, the first and second embodiments according to the present invention and their modifications as explained above have been described by illustrating the case where a reflective surface, a refractive surface and a light emitting surface are formed simultaneously with the injection molding of the cylindrical light guide. However, the reflective surface, the refractive surface and the light emitting surface are not necessarily formed simultaneously with the injection molding of the cylindrical light guide, but may be formed by injection-molding of a cylindrical member serving as a cylindrical light guide which is then subjected to cutting processing.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Furthermore, the first and second embodiments according to the present invention and their modifications as explained above have been described by illustrating the case where the space within the cylindrical light guide is completely filled with the resin sealing layer.
