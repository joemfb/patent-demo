<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A display device comprises a pixel structure. The pixel structure includes a first transistor having a gate and circuitry to initially set the first transistor gate at a first voltage. In response to a data signal received over a data line of the display device, the first transistor gate is set at a second voltage. The first transistor gate voltage transitions from the second voltage to a third voltage that is higher than the second voltage by a reference voltage. A light element is coupled to the first transistor and configured to emit light in response to a current through the light element.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This claims priority under 35 U.S.C.&#xa7;119 of Taiwan application Serial No. 95102124, filed Jan. 19, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates in general to a display apparatus and pixel driving method thereof, and more particularly to a display apparatus capable of reducing period time of a scan signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various types of display devices are either available or being proposed. One such type of display device is an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display device. An OLED is a special type of light emitting diode (LED) in which the light emissive layer is formed of a thin film of organic compounds. An OLED display device has a matrix of pixels, where each pixel includes an OLED and other circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a circuit diagram of a conventional pixel <b>10</b> is shown, which includes an organic light emitting diode (OLED) D<b>1</b>, capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> and transistors Q<b>1</b>-Q<b>4</b>. The transistors Q<b>1</b> Q<b>4</b> are p-type thin film transistors (TFTs). The transistor Q<b>2</b> is for outputting an operational current I<b>1</b> to the OLED D<b>1</b>. The OLED D<b>1</b> has a negative end coupled to a source voltage Vss<b>1</b> and a positive end coupled to a drain of the transistor Q<b>1</b>. The transistor Q<b>1</b> has a gate for receiving an activation/deactivation signal (MRG) and a source coupled to a drain of the transistor Q<b>2</b> and a source of the transistor Q<b>4</b>. A gate of the transistor Q<b>4</b> is for receiving a reset signal RST.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The transistor Q<b>2</b> has a source coupled to a source voltage Vdd<b>1</b> and one end of the capacitor C<b>2</b>, and a gate coupled to the other end of the capacitor C<b>2</b>, a drain of the transistor Q<b>4</b> and one end of the capacitor C<b>1</b>. The capacitor C<b>1</b> has the other end coupled to a source of the transistor Q<b>3</b>. The transistor Q<b>3</b> has a gate for receiving a scan signal SCT(n) and a drain for receiving a DAT signal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a timing diagram of a conventional pixel is shown. In order to compensate for the effect of a transistor threshold voltage on the operational current, the above MRG signal, reset signal RST, scan signal SCT(n) and DAT signal operate according to a timing sequence as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The sequence of signals is used for successively enabling the transistors Q<b>1</b>&#x2dc;Q<b>4</b> and resetting a gate voltage Vg<b>2</b> of the transistor Q<b>2</b> to be (Vdd<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth) in a period T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the gate voltage Vg<b>2</b> of the transistor Q<b>2</b> is reset to be (Vdd<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth), the drain of the transistor Q<b>3</b> receives a DAT signal, which is a to-be-written pixel data voltage Vdata, in a period T<b>2</b>. After the period T<b>2</b>, the transistor Q<b>2</b> outputs an operational current I<b>1</b> to the OLED D<b>1</b>. Because the gate voltage Vg<b>2</b> of the transistor Q<b>2</b> is reset beforehand to be (Vdd&#x2212;Vth), the operational current I<b>1</b> will not be affected by the threshold voltage when outputted by the transistor Q<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The period length of the pixel data voltage Vdata is equal to the period T<b>2</b>, but the period length of the scan signal SCT(n) is equal to the period T<b>1</b> plus the period T<b>2</b>. As the period of the scan signal SCT(n) becomes longer, the frame response speed will become lower. Frame response speed refers to the response speed of a display device in displaying successive video frames. As a result of the low frame response speed, the pixel <b>10</b> cannot be applied to a display of high resolution or large size.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a circuit diagram of a first pixel structure according to a first embodiment of the invention is shown. The first pixel structure <b>210</b>(<b>1</b>) includes a reset circuit <b>212</b>, first transistor MP<b>1</b>, second transistor MP<b>2</b>, third transistor MP<b>3</b>, light element D<b>2</b> (e.g., organic light emitting diode), and capacitor C<b>3</b>. The reset circuit <b>212</b>, which includes a fifth transistor MP<b>5</b> in the embodiment, is for compensating a threshold voltage Vth of the first transistor MP<b>1</b>. The transistors MP<b>1</b>&#x2dc;MP<b>5</b> can be p-type TFTs (thin-film transistors) in one example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The light element D<b>2</b> has a negative end coupled to a source voltage Vss<b>2</b> (e.g., a low power supply voltage such as ground) and a positive end coupled to a drain of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> and a source of the fifth transistor MP<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used here, the term &#x201c;drain&#x201d; can refer to either a drain or source of a transistor; similarly, a &#x201c;source&#x201d; can refer to either a drain or source of a transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The fifth transistor MP<b>5</b> has a gate for receiving a reset signal RST. The fifth transistor MP<b>5</b> is for resetting a gate voltage Vg<b>1</b> of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> to be (Vdata&#x2212;Vth) in cooperation with other transistors, wherein (Vdata&#x2212;Vth) is a reset voltage, and Vth is a threshold voltage of the first transistor MP<b>1</b>. The fifth transistor MP<b>5</b> has a drain coupled to one end of the capacitor C<b>3</b> and a gate of the first transistor MP<b>1</b>. The capacitor C<b>3</b> has its other end for receiving a reference voltage signal Vref.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first transistor MP<b>1</b> has a source coupled to a source of the third transistor MP<b>3</b> and a drain of the second transistor MP<b>2</b>. The third transistor MP<b>3</b> has a gate coupled to the corresponding scan line <b>410</b> for receiving a respective scan signal SCT(n). For example, when the pixel structure <b>210</b>(<b>1</b>) is positioned in the first row of the organic light emitting display <b>50</b>, the pixel structure receives the present scan signal SCT(<b>1</b>), and when the first pixel structure <b>210</b>(<b>1</b>) is positioned at the second row of the organic light emitting display <b>50</b>, the pixel structure receives the respective scan signal SCT(<b>2</b>). Generally, a pixel structure <b>210</b>(<b>1</b>) positioned in row n receives scan signal SCT(n). The transistor MP<b>3</b> has a drain coupled to the corresponding data line <b>310</b> for receiving the pixel data voltage Vdata.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The second transistor MP<b>2</b> has a source coupled to a source voltage Vdd<b>2</b> and a gate for receiving a power switch signal VSW to couple the gate of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> to the source voltage Vdd<b>2</b> (e.g., a high power supply voltage). The RST and VSW signals are provided by circuitry that can be part of the display panel or circuitry outside the display panel. Note also that Vdd<b>2</b> and Vss<b>2</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be power supply voltages, where Vdd<b>2</b> is higher than Vss<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a timing diagram relating to operation of the first pixel structure <b>210</b>(<b>1</b>) is shown. The timing device includes periods T<b>11</b>, T<b>12</b>, T<b>13</b>, T<b>14</b> and T<b>15</b> in sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In period T<b>11</b>, the power switch signal VSW has a high voltage level (inactive voltage) to turn off the second transistor MP<b>2</b>. The scan signal SCT(n) is also at a high voltage level to turn off the third transistor MP<b>3</b>. The reset signal RST has a low voltage level (active voltage) to turn on the fifth transistor MP<b>5</b>. The reference voltage signal Vref is set equal to the second reference voltage Vref<b>2</b> such that the voltage at the negative end of the capacitor C<b>3</b> is set at the second reference voltage Vref<b>2</b>. Moreover, the transistor MP<b>1</b> has a gate voltage Vg<b>1</b> that is equal to Vth due to the threshold voltage drop from the drain to gate of transistor MP<b>1</b>. As a result, the capacitor C<b>3</b> has a storage voltage Vc<b>3</b>=Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In period T<b>12</b>, the power switch signal VSW and scan signal SCT(n) remain at a high voltage level such that the second transistor MP<b>2</b> and third transistor MP<b>3</b> continue to be turned off. The reset signal RST remains at a low level such that the fifth transistor MP<b>5</b> continues to be turned on. The reference voltage signal Vref is changed to the first reference voltage Vref<b>1</b> (Vref<b>2</b>&#x3e;Vref<b>1</b>) such that the voltage of the capacitor C<b>3</b> at the negative end is changed to the first reference voltage Vref<b>1</b>. Note that the reference voltage Vref<b>1</b> can be a negative voltage (but it can be positive or at zero in other implementations). Because the capacitor C<b>3</b> has a storage voltage Vc<b>3</b>=Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>2</b> in the period T<b>11</b>, the gate voltage Vg<b>1</b> of the transistor MP<b>1</b> is set as follows in period T<b>12</b> due to transition of signal Vref from Vref<b>2</b> to Vref<b>1</b>: Vg<b>1</b>=Vref<b>1</b>+Vc<b>3</b>=Vref<b>1</b>+Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>2</b>=Vth&#x2212;&#x394;Vref, wherein &#x394;Vref=Vref<b>2</b>&#x2212;Vref<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In other words, as a result of transition of Vref from Vref<b>1</b> to Vref<b>2</b>, Vg<b>1</b> drops by &#x394;Vref, as depicted in period T<b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In period T<b>13</b>, the power switch signal VSW is still at a high level such that the second transistor MP<b>2</b> continues to be turned off. The reset signal RST is still at a low level such that the fifth transistor MP<b>5</b> continues to be turned on. The scan signal SCT(n) is transitioned to a low voltage level such that the third transistor MP<b>3</b> is turned on. The pixel data voltage Vdata (provided over a data line <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is inputted to the source of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> via the third transistor MP<b>3</b> such that Vs<b>1</b>=Vdata. The reference voltage signal Vref is still set at the first reference voltage Vref<b>1</b> and thus the capacitor C<b>3</b> still has a negative voltage equal to the first reference voltage Vref<b>1</b>. The transistor MP<b>1</b> then has a reset gate voltage Vg<b>1</b>=Vdata&#x2212;Vth such that the capacitor C<b>3</b> has a storage voltage Vc<b>3</b>=Vg<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vref<b>1</b>=Vdata&#x2212;Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Since the scan signal SCT(n) needs only to be set at a low voltage (active voltage) for a period length equal to that of the pixel data voltage Vdata, the display device <b>50</b> can have a higher frame response speed to provide better image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In period T<b>14</b>, the power switch signal VSW is still at a high level such that the second transistor MP<b>2</b> continues to be turned off. The scan signal SCT(n) and reset signal RST transition to a high voltage level such that the third transistor MP<b>3</b> and fifth transistor MP<b>5</b> are turned off. The reference voltage signal Vref is switched from the first reference voltage Vref<b>1</b> to the second reference voltage Vref<b>2</b> which causes the negative end of the capacitor C<b>3</b> to be changed to the second reference voltage Vref<b>2</b>. Since the capacitor C<b>3</b> has a storage voltage Vc<b>3</b>=Vdata&#x2212;Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>1</b> in the period T<b>13</b>, the gate voltage Vg<b>1</b> of transistor MP<b>1</b> is set to Vg<b>1</b>=Vref<b>2</b>+Vc<b>3</b>=Vref<b>2</b>+Vdata&#x2212;Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>1</b>=Vdata&#x2212;Vth+&#x394;Vref, where the Vdata&#x2212;Vth+&#x394;Vref is a set voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, in period T<b>15</b>, the scan signal SCT(n) and reset signal RST are still at a high level such that the third transistor MP<b>3</b> and fifth transistor MP<b>5</b> continue to be turned off. The power switch signal VSW transitions to a low voltage level such that the second transistor MP<b>2</b> is turned on. As a result, the source of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> is coupled to a source voltage Vdd such that Vs<b>1</b>=Vdd<b>2</b>. As noted above, the gate voltage Vg<b>1</b> of the transistor MP<b>1</b> was set to Vdata&#x2212;Vth+&#x394;Vref in period T<b>14</b>, and thus the voltage Vsg<b>1</b> across the source and drain of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> is equal to Vdd<b>2</b>&#x2212;Vg<b>1</b>=Vdd<b>2</b>&#x2212;(Vref<b>2</b>+Vdata&#x2212;Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>1</b>)=Vdd<b>2</b>&#x2212;Vdata&#x2212;&#x394;Vref+Vth. As a result, the current I<b>2</b> of the light element D<b>2</b> is K&#xd7;(Vsg<b>1</b>&#x2212;Vth)<sup>2</sup>=K&#xd7;(Vdd<b>2</b>&#x2212;Vdata&#x2212;&#x394;Vref+Vth&#x2212;Vth)<sup>2</sup>=K&#xd7;(Vdd<b>2</b>&#x2212;Vdata&#x2212;&#x394;Vref)<sup>2</sup>, wherein K is a process transconductance parameter of the first transistor MP<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As indicated above, the sequence of signals depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> allows the current I<b>2</b> through the light element D<b>2</b> to be based on the values of K, Vdd<b>2</b>, Vdata, and &#x394;Vref. The current I<b>2</b> does not depend on the threshold voltage Vth of transistor MP<b>1</b>. Stated differently, techniques according to some embodiments allow compensation for the threshold voltage Vth of MP<b>1</b> such that the light element currents in the various pixels of the display device are not affected by variations in Vth of respective transistors MP<b>1</b>. Note that such variations in Vth can cause brightness of light produced by the light elements to vary, if the compensation technique according to some embodiments is not used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Moreover, the value &#x394;Vref is adjustable, and thus when the characteristics of the light element D<b>2</b> differ, the value &#x394;Vref can be adjusted so that the transistor MP<b>1</b> can be adjusted to operate in a saturation region to prevent the current I<b>2</b> from being changed along with the light element D<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, because the value &#x394;Vref can control the amount of the current I<b>2</b>, the pixel data voltage Vdata, and source voltages Vss<b>2</b> and Vdd<b>2</b> outputted by the data driver <b>30</b> have a larger adjustable range such that the driving integrated circuits of the display device <b>50</b> has more options during design for reducing production cost.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a schematic diagram of a second display device <b>60</b> (which can be an OLED display device) is depicted. The difference between the second display device <b>60</b> and the display device <b>50</b> is that in the second display device <b>60</b>, a single row of pixels <b>210</b> receives both a present scan signal SCT(n) and a previous scan signal SCT(n&#x2212;1). The present scan signal SCT(n) is a signal of the n-th scan line for row n, and the previous scan signal SCT(n&#x2212;1) is a signal of the (n&#x2212;1)-th scan line.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the previous scan signal SCT(n&#x2212;1) is generated, the pixel <b>210</b> has changed the gate voltage of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> beforehand. When the present scan SCT(n) is generated, the pixel <b>210</b> can quickly complete the compensation for the threshold voltage Vth of the first transistor MP<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, when the scan driver <b>40</b> outputs the scan signal SCT(<b>1</b>) to drive the first row of pixels <b>210</b>, the scan signal SCT(<b>1</b>) is also outputted to the second row of the pixels <b>210</b>. The second row of pixels <b>210</b> changes the gate voltage of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> beforehand according to the scan signal SCT(<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the scan driver <b>40</b> outputs the scan signal SCT(<b>2</b>) to drive the second row of pixels <b>210</b>, the pixels <b>210</b> can be reset much more quickly to set the second row of pixels <b>210</b> in order to speed up the frame response of the display device <b>60</b>, which results in a better image quality accordingly.</p>

Because the capacitor C<b>3</b> has a storage voltage Vc<b>3</b>=Vdata&#x2212;Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>1</b> in period T<b>8</b>, the first transistor MP<b>1</b> has a gate voltage Vg<b>1</b> set to be Vg<b>1</b>=Vref<b>2</b>+Vc<b>3</b>=Vref<b>2</b>+Vdata&#x2212;Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>1</b>=Vdata&#x2212;Vth+&#x394;Vref.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In period T<b>10</b>, the present scan signal SCT(n), previous scan signal SCT(n&#x2212;1) and reset signal RST remain at a high level such that the third transistor MP<b>3</b>, fourth transistor MP<b>4</b> and fifth transistor MP<b>5</b> continue to be off.

The first transistor MP<b>1</b> has a source coupled to the source voltage Vdd<b>2</b> such that Vs<b>1</b>=Vdd<b>2</b>. Since the gate voltage Vg<b>1</b> of the transistor MP<b>1</b> was set to be Vdata&#x2212;Vth+&#x394;Vref in period T<b>9</b>, the voltage Vsg<b>1</b> across the source and drain of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> is set, in period T<b>10</b>, equal to Vdd<b>2</b>&#x2212;Vg<b>1</b>=Vdd<b>2</b>&#x2212;(Vref<b>2</b>+Vdata&#x2212;Vth&#x2212;Vref<b>1</b>)=Vdd<b>2</b>&#x2212;Vdata&#x2212;&#x394;Vref+Vth.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a flow chart of a method for driving a pixel of a display device is shown. The driving method is applied to the above pixel structures <b>210</b>(<b>1</b>)&#x2dc;<b>210</b>(<b>7</b>), each of which includes the first transistor MP<b>1</b> and the light element D<b>2</b>. The first transistor MP<b>1</b> is for controlling the operational current I<b>2</b> through the light element D<b>2</b>. The driving method includes the following steps. First, in step <b>910</b>, preset the gate voltage of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> to be substantially equal to a preset voltage&#x2014;(Vth&#x2212;&#x394;Vref) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first reference voltage Vref<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and Vset in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Following that, in step <b>920</b>, input the pixel data voltage Vdata to the source or drain of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> via the transistor MP<b>3</b> such that the preset voltage is changed to a reset voltage. The reset voltage is obtained according to the pixel data voltage Vdata and threshold voltage Vth. Next, in step <b>930</b>, set the gate voltage of the first transistor MP<b>1</b> to be a set voltage. The set voltage is obtained according to the reset voltage and reference voltage signal Vref. Finally, in step <b>940</b>, the first transistor outputs the operational current I<b>2</b> to the light element D<b>2</b> according to the set voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As mentioned above, although the transistors are exemplified to be p-type TFTs for illustration, n-type TFTs can also be used to achieve the purpose of the invention instead of the p-type TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The display apparatus and pixel driving method thereof disclosed by the above embodiments of the invention may have the following advantages by changing the gate voltage of the first transistor beforehand:</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">First, the drawback of uneven (brightness) frame display of OLED display devices, such as Mura, is avoided. Because the reset circuit of a pixel structure provides a mechanism for compensating for the threshold voltage of the transistor that provides current to the light element, the current I<b>2</b> flowing through the light element in the end is K&#xd7;(Vdd<b>2</b>&#x2212;Vdata&#x2212;&#x394;Vref)<sup>2</sup>, and thus the current I<b>2</b> will not be affected by variation of the threshold voltage and the OLED display device can display a better quality frame.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Moreover, the response speed of the OLED display device is increased. Because each scan signal needs to only have the same period length as that of the to-be-written pixel data voltage, operation time for the scan driver to drive each row of pixels can be reduced to speed up the frame response of the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition, the operational range of the pixel data voltage outputted by the data driver and source voltages coupled to the pixels can be increased. Because the value &#x394;Vref is adjustable, the pixel data voltage and source voltages can have a larger adjustable range.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements and procedures, and the scope of the appended claims therefore should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements and procedures.</p>
