<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A condition of an engine is diagnosed based on information provided by signals from speed sensors associated with the engine or other signals associated with a generator operationally connected to the engine. Different types of degradation are distinguished based on discerning characteristics within the information. Thus, a degraded engine component can be identified in a manner that reduces service induced delay.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Engine components may degrade during operation in various ways. For example, an engine cylinder in an engine may start mis-firing due to a worn out ignition plug. One approach to detect engine degradation is to monitor engine speed. Diagnostic routines can monitor whether components of the engine speed rise above a threshold level and generate diagnostic codes or other indications requesting service, de-rating engine power, or shutting down the engine. However, the inventors herein have recognized that traditional analysis of engine speed is often inadequate to thoroughly diagnose an engine problem.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein relate to systems and a methods for diagnosing an engine. Test kits for performing the methods are provided, also. The engine may be included in a vehicle, such as a locomotive system. Other suitable types of vehicles may include on-highway vehicles, off-highway vehicles, mining equipment, aircraft, and marine vessels. Other embodiments of the invention may be used for stationary engines such as wind turbines or power generators. The engine may be a diesel engine, or may combust another fuel or combination of fuels. Such alternative fuels may include gasoline, kerosene, biodiesel, natural gas, and ethanol&#x2014;as well as combinations of the foregoing. Suitable engines may use compression ignition and/or spark ignition. These vehicles may include an engine with components that degrade with use.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, embodiments of the subject matter disclosed herein may use generator data, such as measured generator electrical parameters or generator data (e.g., a derived torque profile) derived from measured generator electrical parameters and/or engine parameters (e.g., speed), to diagnose conditions of an engine and to distinguish between conditions and associated engine components.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">An engine may be put in a particular operating condition or mode when looking for particular types of engine degradation. For example, the engine may be diagnosed during a self-loaded condition as part of a test procedure, a dynamic brake (db) setup condition, or a steady state motoring condition. The diagnostic and prognostic methods discussed herein can be used for trending, comparing cylinder-to-cylinder variation, performing test procedures, repair confirmation, and aid in repair. Alternatively, generator and/or engine data may be sampled and analyzed when the engine reaches a particular operating condition or state during normal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of an example embodiment of a vehicle system <b>100</b> (e.g., a locomotive system) herein depicted as a rail vehicle <b>106</b> configured to run on a rail <b>102</b> via a plurality of wheels <b>108</b>. As depicted, the rail vehicle <b>106</b> includes an engine <b>110</b> operatively connected to a generator (alternator) <b>120</b>. The vehicle <b>106</b> also includes traction motors <b>130</b> operatively connected to the generator <b>120</b> for driving the wheels <b>108</b>. The vehicle <b>106</b> further includes various auxiliary systems or equipment <b>140</b> operatively connected to the generator <b>120</b> or the engine <b>110</b> (e.g., the rotatable engine shaft <b>111</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for performing various functions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The vehicle <b>106</b> further includes a controller <b>150</b> to control various components related to the vehicle system <b>100</b>. In one example, controller <b>150</b> includes a computer control system. In one embodiment, the computer control system is largely software based and includes a processor, such as processor <b>152</b>, configured to execute computer operable instructions. The controller <b>150</b> may include multiple engine control units (ECU) and the control system may be distributed among each of the ECUs. The controller <b>150</b> further includes computer readable storage media, such as memory <b>154</b>, including instructions (e.g., computer executable instructions) for enabling on-board monitoring and control of rail vehicle operation. Memory <b>154</b> may include volatile and non-volatile memory storage. In accordance with another embodiment, the controller may be hardware based using, for example, digital signal processors (DSPs) or other hardware logic circuitry to perform the various functions described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The controller may oversee control and management of the vehicle system <b>100</b>. The controller may receive a signal from a speed sensor <b>160</b> of the engine or from various generator sensors <b>170</b> to determine operating parameters and operating conditions, and correspondingly adjust various engine actuators <b>162</b> to control operation of the rail vehicle <b>106</b>. In accordance with an embodiment, the speed sensor includes a multi-tooth pick-up wheel connected to the engine shaft <b>111</b>, and a reluctance sensor for sensing when a tooth of the pick-up wheel passes by the reluctance sensor. For example, the controller may receive signals representing various generator parameters from various generator sensors. The generator parameters can include a dc-link voltage, a dc-link current, a generator field voltage, a generator field current, a generator output voltage, and a generator output current. Other generator parameters may be possible as well, in accordance with various embodiments. Correspondingly, the controller may control the vehicle system by sending commands to various components such as traction motors, alternator, cylinder valves, throttle, etc. Signals from generator sensors <b>170</b> may be bundled together into one or more wiring harnesses to reduce space in vehicle system <b>100</b> devoted to wiring and to protect the signal wires from abrasion and vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The controller may include onboard electronic diagnostics for recording operational characteristics of the engine. Operational characteristics may include measurements from sensors <b>160</b> and <b>170</b>, for example. In one embodiment, the operational characteristics may be stored in a database in memory <b>154</b>. In one embodiment, current operational characteristics may be compared to past operational characteristics to determine trends of engine and/or auxiliary equipment performance.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The controller may include onboard electronic diagnostics for identifying and recording potential degradation and failures of components of vehicle system <b>100</b>. For example, when a potentially degraded component is identified, a diagnostic code may be stored in memory <b>154</b>. In one embodiment, a unique diagnostic code may correspond to each type of degradation that may be identified by the controller. For example, a first diagnostic code may indicate a problem with cylinder 1 of the engine and a second diagnostic code may indicate a problem with cylinder 2 of the engine, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The controller may be further linked to display <b>180</b>, such as a diagnostic interface display, providing a user interface to the locomotive operating crew and a maintenance crew. The controller may control the engine, in response to operator input via user input controls <b>182</b>, by sending a command to correspondingly adjust various engine actuators <b>162</b>. Non-limiting examples of user input controls <b>182</b> may include a throttle control, a braking control, a keyboard, and a power switch. Further, operational characteristics of the engine, such as diagnostic codes corresponding to degraded components, may be reported via display <b>180</b> to the operator and/or the maintenance crew.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The vehicle system may include a communications system <b>190</b> linked to the controller. In one embodiment, communications system <b>190</b> may include a radio and an antenna for transmitting and receiving voice and data messages. For example, data communications may be between vehicle system and a control center of a railroad, another locomotive, a satellite, and/or a wayside device, such as a railroad switch. For example, the controller may estimate geographic coordinates of vehicle system using signals from a GPS receiver. As another example, the controller may transmit operational characteristics of the engine to the control center via a message transmitted from communications system <b>190</b>. In one embodiment, a message may be transmitted to the command center by communications system <b>190</b> when a degraded component of the engine is detected and the vehicle system may be scheduled for maintenance.</p>

Various mechanical auxiliary equipment <b>144</b> may be operatively coupled to and driven by the rotating engine shaft <b>111</b>. Other auxiliary equipment <b>140</b> are driven by the generator <b>120</b> through a rectifier <b>210</b> that produces a dc-link voltage to power regulators <b>230</b>. Examples of such auxiliary equipment include a blower <b>141</b>, a compressor <b>142</b>, and a radiator fan <b>143</b>. The traction motors <b>130</b> are driven by the generator <b>120</b> through the rectifier <b>210</b> that produces a dc-link voltage to an inverter <b>220</b>. Such auxiliary equipment <b>140</b>, traction motors <b>130</b>, and their implementations are well known in the art. In accordance with certain embodiments, the generator <b>120</b> may actually be one or more generators such as, for example, a main generator to drive the traction motors <b>130</b> and an auxiliary generator to drive a portion of the auxiliary equipment <b>140</b>. Further examples of auxiliary equipment include turbochargers, pumps, and engine cooling systems.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The speed sensor <b>160</b> measures the speed of the rotating shaft <b>111</b> of the engine during operation. The dc-link sensor <b>171</b> is a generator sensor and can measure dc-link voltage, dc-link current, or both, in accordance with various embodiments. The field sensor <b>172</b> is a generator sensor and can measure field current of the generator, field voltage of the generator, or both, in accordance with various embodiments. In accordance with certain embodiments, generator sensors <b>173</b> and <b>174</b> are provided for measuring the armature output voltage and current of the generator, respectively. Suitable commercially available sensors may be selected based on application specific parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An engine may have a plurality of cylinders that fire in a predefined sequence, where each cylinder fires once during a four stroke or a two stroke cycle. For example, a four cylinder, four stroke engine may have a firing sequence of 1-3-4-2, where each cylinder fires once for every two revolutions of the engine. Thus, the firing frequency of a given cylinder is one half the frequency of revolution of the engine and the firing frequency of any cylinder is twice the frequency of revolution of the engine. The frequency of revolution of the engine may be described as the first engine order. Such a first order frequency component can show up in the frequency content of a measured generator parameter or engine speed signal. The firing frequency of a given cylinder of a four stroke engine may be described as the half engine order, where the half engine order is one half the frequency of revolution of the engine. Such a half order frequency component can also show up in the frequency content of a measured generator parameter or engine speed signal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As another example of a four stroke engine, a twelve cylinder engine may have a firing sequence of 1-7-5-11-3-9-6-12-2-8-4-10, where each cylinder fires once for every two revolutions of the engine. Thus, the firing frequency of a given cylinder is one half the frequency of revolution of the engine and the firing frequency of any cylinder is six times the frequency of revolution of the engine. As an example of a two stroke engine, a twelve cylinder engine may have a firing sequence of 1-7-5-11-3-9-6-12-2-8-4-10, where each cylinder fires once for every revolution of the engine. Thus, the firing frequency of a given cylinder is the frequency of revolution of the engine and the firing frequency of any cylinder is twelve times the frequency of revolution of the engine. Again, these frequency components can show up in the frequency content of measured generator parameters or an engine speed signal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the engine may be a four stroke engine operating at 1050 RPM. Thus, the first engine order is at 17.5 Hz and the half engine order is at 8.75 Hz. The dc-link voltage may vary with a periodic frequency as the engine shaft <b>111</b> rotates during operation. For example, the frequency content of the dc-link voltage may include a frequency component at the frequency of the first engine order. In other words, the peak magnitude of the frequency content may occur at the first-order frequency component. The dc-link voltage may also include frequency content at other harmonics of the first-order frequency, such as at a second-order frequency (twice the engine frequency), a third-order frequency (three times the engine frequency), etc. Similarly, the dc-link voltage may include frequency content at frequencies less than the first-order frequency, such as at a half-order frequency (half the engine frequency).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For an engine that is &#x201c;healthy&#x201d; and is operating properly, the frequency content of the measured parameters can have a particular healthy signature. Deviations from such a healthy signature can indicate a problem with the engine. For example, in accordance with an embodiment, a condition of an engine may be diagnosed by analyzing a half order magnitude and/or phase of the frequency content.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In general, in accordance with various embodiments, a condition of an engine can be diagnosed based on a combination of measured parameters from the engine (e.g., speed or pressure) and the generator (e.g., dc-link voltage, etc.). Frequency content of the various parameters can be determined and compared to diagnose a particular engine condition. Furthermore, other parameter profiles (e.g., torque) can be estimated from the measured parameter profiles and, subsequently, the frequency content of those profiles can be analyzed to diagnose a particular engine condition.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the frequency content of the rotational speed of the engine (e.g., where speed is measured by the speed sensor <b>160</b>) is used to diagnose a condition of an engine. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is an illustration of example embodiments of how to generate frequency content from time domain rotational speed of the engine. A Fourier transform process <b>310</b> (e.g., a Fast Fourier Transform, FFT, process) or a bandpass filtering process <b>320</b> can be used to extract the harmonic content. The frequency analysis process transforms the sampled time domain parameter into frequency content in the frequency domain. The various frequency components of the frequency content can include dc (zero order), fundamental (first order) and harmonic (second order, half order, third order, etc.) frequency components. In accordance with an embodiment, the Fourier Transform process and the bandpass filter process include computer executable instructions that are executed by the processor <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an illustration showing example embodiments of &#x201c;healthy&#x201d; and &#x201c;unhealthy&#x201d; frequency content. The frequency content <b>410</b> of the healthy engine (i.e., an engine that is operating properly) has three frequency components of absolute and relative magnitudes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment. The frequency content <b>420</b> of the unhealthy engine (i.e., an engine that is not operating properly due to some degradation or failure) has three frequency components at the same locations as in the frequency content <b>410</b> for the healthy engine. However, the amplitude of one frequency component <b>421</b> (e.g., a half order component) is distorted (e.g., increased in amplitude), and the amplitude of another frequency component <b>423</b> (e.g., a second order component) is also distorted (e.g., decreased in amplitude), in accordance with an embodiment. The distorted frequency components <b>421</b> and <b>423</b> in the frequency content <b>420</b> are indicative of an unhealthy engine. Furthermore, the particular characteristics of the distorted frequency components (e.g., amplitude) relative to the other frequency components in the frequency content <b>420</b> of the unhealthy engine can be indicative of a particular type of engine degradation or failure (e.g., cylinder number 3 of the engine is inoperable). Also, the phase of the half order component, with respect to a reference cylinder (e.g., cylinder number 1), can be used to isolate a problem to a particular cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The degraded components may cause the engine to operate less efficiently, with less power, and/or with more pollution, for example. Further, the condition of the degraded components may accelerate degradation of the components which may increase the likelihood of catastrophic engine failure and road failure. A degraded engine cylinder is an example of a degraded engine component. Thus, for a four-stroke engine, the distorted frequency component may occur at the half-order frequency. For a two-stroke engine, the distorted frequency component may occur at the first-order frequency. The diagnosis, then, may include both a warning of degradation as well as an indication of the type and/or location of the degraded engine component.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an illustration of an embodiment of how a diagnostic logic <b>510</b> in the controller <b>150</b> can detect an unhealthy condition in the frequency content of an engine speed signal. For example, the half order component <b>421</b> can be compared to a threshold level T by the diagnostic logic <b>510</b>. If the magnitude of the component <b>421</b> exceeds the threshold level T, then the diagnostic logic <b>510</b> determines that degradation in the engine has occurred. Furthermore, if the diagnostic logic <b>510</b> determines that the ratio of the half order component to the first order component <b>422</b> exceeds a second threshold level, and the ratio of the first order component to the second order component <b>423</b> exceeds a third threshold level, then the diagnostic logic <b>510</b> isolates the degradation to a particular engine component (e.g., cylinder number 3). In accordance with an embodiment, the diagnostic logic includes computer executable instructions that are executed by the processor <b>152</b>. In accordance with an embodiment, the ratio of a half order component to a dc or zero order component can be indicative of an engine problem. Furthermore, the threshold level T can be dependent on an operating condition of the engine such as, for example, power, speed, ambient conditions, repair history, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Types of engine degradation or failures that can be diagnosed, distinguished, and isolated may include a worn out ignition plug, a fuel imbalance, a faulty cylinder, a knocking in the engine, a low fuel input, a low compression, and a valve train failure, for example. Once a degradation or failure is diagnosed, an action can be taken. Such actions may include, for example, providing a warning signal to the operator (e.g., via the display <b>180</b>), adjusting an engine operating parameter (e.g., derating the engine power, shutting down at least one cylinder of the engine, shutting down the engine entirely, balancing cylinders of the engine), logging a maintenance action, and transmitting the diagnosed condition to a central location (e.g., via the communications system <b>190</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Therefore, the harmonic content (magnitudes and/or phases) of the rotational speed of the engine can be analyzed (e.g., using the diagnostic logic <b>510</b> of the controller) to determine degradation in the engine. In accordance with an embodiment, the reciprocating engine is first driven to a specified operating condition, state, or mode before sampling and processing the engine speed information. In accordance with another embodiment, the engine speed information is not sampled and processed until the engine reaches a determined operating condition, state, or mode during normal operation, where the controller is triggered to extract and analyze the harmonic content of the speed of the engine when the determined condition, state, or mode is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, a difference in the measured rotational speed of the reciprocating engine from cycle to cycle (e.g., where speed is measured by the speed sensor <b>160</b>) is used to diagnose a condition of an engine. A cycle can correspond to one full rotation or revolution of the engine. However, in accordance with various embodiments, a cycle can be defined otherwise as well. For example, a cycle can be two full revolutions of the engine (which may correspond to one cycle of a firing cylinder), or a cycle may be a half a revolution of the engine (which may correspond to the frequency of firing of any cylinder of the engine).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As the speed varies from cycle to cycle, characteristics (e.g., harmonic content) of the differences from cycle to cycle can be analyzed and correlated to a degraded condition of the engine. Again, in accordance with an embodiment, the reciprocating engine can first be driven to a specified operating condition, state, or mode before sampling and processing the engine speed information. In accordance with another embodiment, the engine speed information is not sampled and processed until the engine reaches a determined operating condition, state, or mode during normal operation, where the controller is triggered to determine and analyze the speed difference of the engine from cycle to cycle when the determined condition, state, or mode is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, a difference in time for a reciprocating engine to rotate over a determined angle is used to diagnose a condition of an engine. The determined angle may be a full 360 degree rotation of the engine (cycle to cycle) or some lesser angle, for example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an illustration of an example embodiment of how such a difference in time (a time interval) can be determined. A toothed wheel <b>610</b> is connected to the rotating shaft <b>111</b> of the engine and rotates with the shaft <b>111</b>. A sensor <b>620</b> (e.g., a reluctance sensor) is positioned adjacent to the toothed wheel <b>1010</b> and is capable of sensing when a tooth of the wheel <b>610</b> passes by the sensor <b>620</b> as the wheel <b>610</b> rotates. A time domain signal from the sensor <b>620</b> is fed to the controller <b>150</b>. The controller is operable to sample the signal and determine the time difference between sensed teeth. The angular difference between adjacent teeth on the wheel corresponds to a determined angle. Therefore, the angular difference between any two teeth on the wheel corresponds to some determined angle. In accordance with an embodiment, the controller is configured to determine the time it takes for every two adjacent teeth to pass by the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, as the wheel <b>610</b> rotates, the time difference (time interval) &#x394;T<sub>1 </sub>between tooth 1 and tooth 2 is determined, the time difference &#x394;T<sub>2 </sub>between tooth 3 and tooth 4 is determined, the time difference &#x394;T<sub>3 </sub>between tooth 5 and tooth 6 is determined, and so on as the wheel rotates and the sensor <b>620</b> senses the individual teeth passing by. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an illustration of an example embodiment of how to process the time intervals, determined using the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to diagnose an engine condition.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the time domain samples of time intervals (&#x394;T<sub>1</sub>, &#x394;T<sub>2</sub>, &#x394;T<sub>3</sub>, . . . ) are processed (e.g., through a FFT process <b>310</b> of the controller) to determine the frequency content. A combined value (e.g., a root-mean-square, RMS, value or an average value) of the amplitudes of the frequency content around a specified harmonic frequency (e.g., around a half order frequency) is calculated by an RMS process <b>710</b> of the controller <b>150</b>. Frequency content can exist at and around a particular harmonic frequency (e.g., around the half order frequency) due to load and speed variations, for example. A condition of the engine is diagnosed by a comparator process <b>720</b> of the controller based on the combined value (e.g., by comparing the combined value to a threshold value). A plurality of threshold values can be provided, each corresponding to a different level of severity of the degraded engine condition. Depending on the level of severity, different actions may be taken (e.g., log a scheduled maintenance action, derate engine power, shut down the engine).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Again, in accordance with an embodiment, the reciprocating engine can first be driven to a specified operating condition, state, or mode before sampling and processing the time intervals. In accordance with another embodiment, the time interval information is not sampled and processed until the engine reaches a determined operating condition, state, or mode during normal operation, where the controller is triggered to determine and analyze the time interval information when the determined condition, state, or mode is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an illustration of an example embodiment of how to diagnose a condition of an engine by correlating engine speed characteristics and generator characteristics to each other. The rotational speed of the engine <b>110</b> is measured over time (e.g., using the speed sensor <b>160</b>) and electrical parameters associated with the generator <b>120</b> are measured over time. The controller <b>150</b> has a correlation process <b>810</b> which correlates characteristics of the measured rotational speed to characteristics of the measured electrical parameters. Based on the resultant correlations, a condition of the engine is diagnosed. Just as harmonic content of a time domain rotational speed signal from the engine may be determined using, for example, a FFT process or a bandpass filtering process, harmonic content of a time domain generator parameter may be similarly determined.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The characteristics of the rotational speed may include at least one of harmonic content of the rotational speed, a difference in the measured rotational speed from cycle to cycle, a torque profile derived from the rotational speed, and a difference in time for the reciprocating engine to rotate over a determined angle. The measured electrical parameters may include a dc-link voltage, a dc-link current, a generator field voltage, a generator field current, a generator output voltage, and a generator output current. Characteristics of the electrical parameters may include, for example, harmonic content of one or more of the parameters or a torque profile derived from one or more of the parameters. In accordance with an embodiment, the contribution of torque disturbances caused by a connected load (e.g., a sixth harmonic torque produced by a rectifier) can be removed or ignored as part of the process.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As an example, a half order component of the dc-link voltage may be correlated to a half order component of the speed signal for diagnostic purposes. If the amplitude of the half order component of the dc-link voltage is above a first threshold value, and the phase of the half order component of the speed signal is between a second threshold value and a third threshold value (with respect to some reference), then the engine is diagnosed as having a fueling problem with a particular cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As another example, a first order component of the generator field current may be correlated to a second order component of the speed signal. If the amplitude of the first order component of the field current is less than a first threshold, and the amplitude of the second order component of the speed signal is greater than a second threshold, then the engine is diagnosed as having a low compression problem. However, if the amplitude of the first order component of the field current is greater than the first threshold, and the amplitude of the second order component of the speed signal is still greater than the second threshold, then the engine is diagnosed as having a faulty ignition plug. Many other correlations and corresponding diagnoses are possible as well.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Again, in accordance with an embodiment, the reciprocating engine can first be driven to a specified operating condition, state, or mode before performing the correlation process <b>810</b>. In accordance with another embodiment, the correlation process is not performed until the engine reaches a determined operating condition, state, or mode during normal operation, where the controller is triggered to perform the correlation process on the speed and generator characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, a test kit is provided having a controller that is operable to determine a condition of a reciprocating engine based on at least one characteristic of a measured rotational speed of the reciprocating engine over time. The test kit can further include one or more sensors to sense electrical parameters associated with a generator that is operatively connected to the engine during operation. The controller is operable to communicate with the one or more sensors to sample the electrical parameters over time. The controller is further operable to correlate characteristics of the measured rotational speed and characteristics of the electrical parameters to diagnose a condition of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an illustration of an example embodiment of how to generate a torque profile from measured rotational speed of a reciprocating engine. The controller <b>150</b> implements a torque estimation process <b>910</b> which samples measured rotational speed of the engine (e.g., from the speed sensor <b>160</b>) over time, derives acceleration components (considering the derivative of speed with respect to time) from the measured rotational speed at determined characteristic frequencies, and combines the acceleration components to determine a torque profile. The engine is then diagnosed by analyzing characteristics of the torque profile. For example, harmonic components of the torque profile can be generated and compared to thresholds, for example. Again, in accordance with an embodiment, the reciprocating engine can first be driven to a specified operating condition, state, or mode before performing the torque estimation process <b>910</b>. In accordance with another embodiment, the torque estimation process is not performed until the engine reaches a determined operating condition, state, or mode during normal operation, where the controller is triggered to perform the torque estimation process and subsequent analysis of the estimated torque profile.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In accordance with various embodiments, the controller <b>150</b> is operable to report a degraded engine condition, for example, via the communication system <b>190</b>. Furthermore, in accordance with various embodiments, the controller includes instructions configured to adjust an engine operating parameter based on the diagnosed condition.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further examples of applications of systems and methods described herein are now provided. The examples illustrate various approaches for diagnosing and distinguishing between different types of engine degradation based on the frequency content of generator data (e.g., a relatively raw generator parameter such as dc-link voltage, or other derived generator parameters such as electromagnetic torque) associated with the generator, or speed of the engine during engine operation.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, a degraded cylinder of a four stroke engine may be detected based on a frequency content signature, such as the magnitude of the half-order frequency component being greater than a half-order threshold value. In an alternate embodiment, the magnitudes of the frequency content may be integrated over the range of frequencies, and a degraded cylinder of a four stroke engine may be detected based on the integration being greater than an integral threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Detection of one degraded cylinder, where the other cylinders of the engine are more healthy (or less degraded), may have a more clear frequency content signature than when multiple cylinders of the engine are degraded. For example, the frequency content signature of one degraded cylinder may be identified by comparing the magnitude of the half-order frequency component to a half-order magnitude threshold value. However, multiple degraded cylinders may have a different frequency component signature than a single degraded cylinder. Further, the position in the firing order of multiple degraded cylinders may change the frequency content signature. For example, two degraded cylinders 180&#xb0; out of phase may have a different frequency component signature than two degraded cylinders in successive firing order, and thus the methods disclosed herein may identify one or more degraded cylinders based on various changes in the frequency content signature. Further, it may be beneficial to generate a frequency content signature of a healthy engine by recording frequency content at various frequencies and operating conditions. In one embodiment, the frequency content of the engine may be compared to the frequency content signature of a healthy engine. Anomalies not matching the frequency content signature of the healthy engine or a different degraded engine component may be identified and reported by the controller, for example. Other examples of degraded engine components include a degraded crankcase evacuation system, a degraded turbocharger, and a degraded crankcase.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one embodiment, the time-domain generator data may be filtered by a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency slightly greater than the first-order frequency. For example, the cut-off frequency may be ten to twenty percent greater than the first-order frequency. Thus, in one embodiment, the cut-off frequency may be determined by the engine speed. The generator data may be sampled in time at a frequency greater than or equal to the Nyquist rate. In one embodiment, the time-domain signal may be sampled at a frequency greater than twice the first engine order frequency. In one embodiment, the time-domain signal may be sampled at a frequency greater than twice the engine red-line frequency. Thus, by low-pass filtering and sampling at a frequency greater than or equal to the Nyquist rate, the frequency content of the generator data may not be aliased. The same may applied for speed data of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As discussed herein, the sampled generator data (e.g., dc-link voltage, torque, etc.) and/or the sampled engine speed data may be transformed to generate a frequency domain frequency content. In one embodiment, a fast Fourier transform may be used to generate the frequency domain frequency content. In one embodiment, a correlation algorithm may be applied to compare the frequency content of the data, to a signature for a condition of the engine. For example, the signature for a healthy engine may include frequency content at the first-order frequency with a magnitude below a first-order threshold value and frequency content at the half-order frequency with a magnitude below a half-order threshold value. The first-order threshold value may correspond to engine speed, engine load, crankcase temperature, and historical engine data.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, the historical engine and generator data may be stored in a database including samples of frequency content from earlier operation of the engine. Thus, a trend in frequency content may be detected and the trend may be used to determine the health of the engine. For example, an increasing magnitude at the half engine order component for a given engine speed and load may indicate that a cylinder is degrading. As another example, an increasing average crankcase pressure coupled without an increasing magnitude at the half engine order component for a given engine speed and load may indicate that the turbocharger or crankcase evacuation system is degrading. A potential fault may include a degraded cylinder, a degraded turbocharger, or a degraded crankcase evacuation system.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, frequency content of the generator data and/or the engine speed data may be stored in a database including historical engine and generator data. For example, the database may be stored in memory <b>154</b> of controller <b>150</b>. As another example, the database may be stored at a site remote from rail vehicle <b>106</b>. For example, historical data may be encapsulated in a message and transmitted with communications system <b>190</b>. In this manner, a command center may monitor the health of the engine in real-time. For example, the command center may perform steps to diagnose the condition of the engine using the generator/speed data transmitted with communications system <b>190</b>. For example, the command center may receive data from rail vehicle <b>106</b>, frequency transform the data, apply a correlation algorithm to the transformed data, and diagnose potential degradation of the engine. Further, the command center may schedule maintenance and deploy healthy locomotives and maintenance crews in a manner to optimize capital investment. Historical data may be further used to evaluate the health of the engine before and after engine service, engine modifications, and engine component change-outs.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment, a potential fault may be reported to the locomotive operating crew via display <b>180</b>. Once notified, the operator may adjust operation of rail vehicle <b>106</b> to reduce the potential of further degradation of the engine. In one embodiment, a message indicating a potential fault may be transmitted with communications system <b>190</b> to a command center. Further, the severity of the potential fault may be reported. For example, diagnosing a fault based on frequency content of generator data and/or engine speed data may allow a fault to be detected earlier than when the fault is diagnosed with only average engine information. Thus, the engine may continue to operate when a potential fault is diagnosed in the early stages of degradation. In contrast, it may be desirable to stop the engine or schedule prompt maintenance if a potential fault is diagnosed as severe. In one embodiment, the severity of a potential fault may be determined according to a difference between a threshold value and the magnitude of one or more components of the frequency content of the generator and/or speed data.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">By analyzing the frequency content of generator and/or speed data, it may be possible to monitor and diagnose the engine during operation. Further, operation of an engine with a degraded component may be adjusted to potentially reduce additional degradation of the engine component and to potentially reduce the likelihood of additional engine failure and in-use failure. For example, the half-order component may be compared to a half-order threshold value. In one embodiment, if the magnitude of the half-order component is greater than the half-order threshold value, the potential fault may be a degraded cylinder. However, if the magnitude of the half-order component is not greater than the half-order threshold value, the potential fault may be a degraded turbocharger or a degraded crankcase evacuation system.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, the potential fault may be reported to the locomotive operating crew via display <b>180</b> and the operator may adjust operation of rail vehicle <b>106</b> to reduce the potential of further degradation. In one embodiment, a message diagnosing the potential fault may be transmitted with communications system <b>190</b> to a command center.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, an engine operating parameter may be adjusted to identify a degraded cylinder. For example, the degraded cylinder may be identified based on selective disabling of fuel injection to one or more cylinders of the engine. In one embodiment, fuel injection may be disabled for each cylinder of the plurality of cylinders in a sequence while one or more of the generator and/or speed data and associated frequency content are monitored. For example, fuel injection to one cylinder may be disabled while the other cylinders operate normally. By disabling each cylinder in a sequence, the degraded cylinder may be identified. As another example, fuel injection to a group of cylinders may be disabled while the other cylinders operate normally. By cycling through different groups in a sequence, the degraded cylinder may be identified through a process of elimination.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one example, the half-order frequency component of the generator and/or speed data may be monitored for each disabled cylinder of a four stroke engine. The disabled cylinder may be a degraded cylinder when the half-order frequency component drops below a half-order threshold value while the cylinder is disabled. The disabled cylinder may be a healthy cylinder when the half-order frequency component remains above the half-order threshold value while the cylinder is disabled. In other words, the degraded cylinder may be the cylinder that contributes a higher amount of frequency content at the half-order frequency component than other cylinders. In one embodiment, the selective disabling diagnosis may be performed when the engine is operating at idle or lightly loaded.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In one embodiment, the selective disabling diagnosis may be further based on frequency content of engine operating parameters, such as engine speed. For example, the engine speed may include frequency content at the half-order frequency component when a degraded cylinder is operating. Thus, observing frequency content of various engine operating parameters while selectively disabling each cylinder may identify the degraded cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one embodiment, the degraded cylinder may be identified based on selectively varying fuel injection to one or more cylinders of the engine. For example, fuel may be selectively increased or decreased to each cylinder while the half-order frequency component of the generator and/or speed data is monitored. Further, the signature, e.g. the frequency content, of each cylinder may be compared to historical data for the engine or to a healthy engine. For example, the diagnosis test may be performed on a healthy engine to generate a baseline signature. The baseline signature may then be compared to the frequency content while the engine is being diagnosed. In one embodiment, the degraded cylinder may be identified by varying engine fuel injection timing. For example, advance angle adjustments may be used to diagnose the degraded cylinder. For example, engine fuel injection timing may be retarded to potentially increase frequency content of the half-order frequency component.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It may be more desirable to switch off the engine than to have a degraded cylinder fail in a manner that may cause additional damage to the engine. In one embodiment, a threshold value may be determined that indicates continued operation of the engine may be undesirable because the potential fault is severe. For example, the potential fault may be judged as severe if a magnitude of the half-order frequency component exceeds a threshold value. The engine may be stopped if the severity of the potential fault exceeds the threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A request to schedule service may be sent, such as by a message sent via communications system <b>190</b>, for example. Further, by sending the potential fault condition and the severity of the potential fault, down-time of rail vehicle <b>106</b> may be reduced. For example, service may be deferred on rail vehicle <b>106</b> when the potential fault is of low severity. Down-time may be further reduced by derating power of the engine, such as by adjusting an engine operating parameter based on the diagnosed condition. It may be determined if derating of the engine is enabled. For example, derating the power of the engine may reduce the magnitude of one or more components of the frequency content of the generator and/or speed data.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An engine operating parameter may be adjusted, such as to reduce additional degradation of the degraded component, for example. In one embodiment, engine speed or power may be governed. In one embodiment, fuel injection may be reduced or disabled to the potentially degraded cylinder while continuing to operate the other cylinders. Thus, the engine may continue to operate and further degradation of the degraded cylinder may be reduced. In this manner, the engine may be adjusted to potentially reduce additional degradation of the engine component and to potentially reduce the likelihood of catastrophic engine failure and road failure.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment, a test kit may be used for identifying frequency content of the generator and/or speed data and diagnosing a condition of the engine based on the frequency content of the data. For example, a test kit may include a controller that is operable to communicate with one or more generator and or engine speed sensors and operable to sample the associated data. The controller may be further operable to transform signals from the one or more sensors into a frequency content that represents frequency information of the engine. The controller may be further operable to diagnose a condition of the engine based on the frequency content of the sampled data from the sensor(s). The test kit may further include one or more sensors for sensing generator parameters (e.g., generator output voltage) and/or engine parameters (e.g., engine speed).</p>
