<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Scan architectures are commonly used to test digital circuitry in integrated circuits. The present disclosure describes a method of adapting conventional scan architectures into a low power scan architecture. The low power scan architecture maintains the test time of conventional scan architectures, while requiring significantly less operational power than conventional scan architectures. The low power scan architecture is advantageous to IC/die manufacturers since it allows a larger number of circuits (such as DSP or CPU core circuits) embedded in an IC/die to be tested in parallel without consuming too much power within the IC/die. Since the low power scan architecture reduces test power consumption, it is possible to simultaneously test more die on a wafer than previously possible using conventional scan architectures. This allows wafer test times to be reduced which reduces the manufacturing cost of each die on the wafer.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional scan architecture that a circuit <b>100</b> can be configured into during test. In the normal functional configuration, circuit <b>100</b> may be a functional circuit within IC, but in test configuration it appears as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Scan architectures can be applied at various circuit levels. For example, the scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may represent the testing of a complete IC, or it may represent the testing of an embedded intellectual property core sub-circuit within an IC, such as a DSP or CPU core sub-circuit. The scan architecture includes a scan path circuit <b>104</b>, logic circuitry to be tested <b>108</b>, and connection paths <b>112</b>-<b>120</b> to a tester <b>110</b>. Tester <b>110</b> operates to: (1) output control to operate scan path <b>104</b> via control path <b>114</b>; (2) output serial test stimulus patterns to scan path <b>104</b> via scan input path <b>118</b>; (3) input serial test response patterns from scan path <b>104</b> via scan output path <b>120</b>; (4) output parallel test stimulus patterns to logic <b>108</b> via primary input path <b>112</b>; and (5) input parallel test response patterns from logic <b>108</b> via primary output path <b>116</b>. Scan path <b>104</b> operates, in addition to its scan input and scan output modes to tester <b>110</b>, to output parallel test stimulus patterns to logic <b>108</b> via path <b>122</b>, and input parallel response patterns from logic <b>108</b> via path <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Typically tester <b>110</b> is interfaced to the scan architecture by probing the die pads at wafer level, or by contacting package pins after the die is assembled into a package. While tester <b>110</b> connections to the primary inputs <b>112</b> and primary outputs <b>116</b> of logic <b>108</b> are shown, the primary input and output connections could be achieved by augmentation of scan path <b>104</b>. For example, scan path <b>104</b> could be lengthened to include boundary scan cells located on each primary input and primary output of logic <b>108</b>. The boundary scan cells would provide primary inputs to and primary outputs from logic <b>108</b>, via widened stimulus and response busses <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>, respectively. In some instances, logic <b>108</b> may be sufficiently tested by scan path <b>104</b> such that it is not necessary to provide primary inputs to and outputs from logic <b>108</b> via the tester or via the above described augmentation of scan path <b>104</b>. For example, if the amount of logic <b>108</b> circuitry made testable by the use of scan path <b>104</b> in combination with the primary inputs and outputs is very small compared to the amount of logic <b>108</b> circuitry made testable by the scan path <b>104</b> alone, then the primary input and output connections to logic <b>108</b> may removed without significantly effecting the test of logic circuitry <b>108</b>. To simplify the description of the prior art and following description of the present disclosure, it will be assumed that logic circuit <b>108</b> is sufficiently tested using only scan path <b>104</b>, i.e. the primary inputs <b>112</b> and primary outputs <b>116</b> are not required. However, it is clear that primary input and output connections to the tester or to an augmented scan path <b>104</b>, as described above, could be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of a conventional scan cell that could be used in scan path <b>104</b>. (Note: The optional-scan cell multiplexer <b>218</b> and connection paths <b>220</b> and <b>224</b>, shown in dotted line, will not be discussed at this time, but will be discussed later in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.) The scan cell consists of a D-FF <b>204</b> and a multiplexer <b>202</b>. During normal configuration of the circuit <b>100</b>, multiplexer <b>202</b> and D-FF <b>204</b> receive control inputs SCANENA <b>210</b> and SCANCK <b>212</b> to input functional data from logic <b>108</b> via path <b>206</b> and output functional data via path <b>216</b>. In the normal configuration, the SCANCK to D-FF <b>204</b> is typically a functional clock, and the SCANENA signal is set such that the D-FF always clocks in functional data from logic <b>108</b> via path <b>206</b>. During the test configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, multiplexer <b>202</b> and D-FF <b>204</b> receive control inputs SCANENA <b>210</b> and SCANCK <b>212</b> to capture test response data from logic <b>108</b> via path <b>206</b>, shift data from scan input path <b>208</b> to scan output path <b>214</b>, and apply test stimulus data to logic <b>108</b> via path <b>216</b>. In the test configuration, the SCANCK to D-FF <b>204</b> is the test clock and the SCANENA signal is operated to allow capturing of response data from logic <b>108</b> and shifting of data from scan input <b>208</b> to scan output <b>214</b>. During test configuration, SCANENA is controlled by tester <b>110</b> via path <b>114</b>. SCANCK may also be controlled by the tester, or it may be controlled by another source, for example a functional clock source. For the purpose of simplifying the operational description, it will be assumed that the SCANCK is controlled by the tester.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The scan inputs <b>208</b> and scan outputs <b>214</b> of multiple scan cells are connected to form the serial scan path <b>104</b>. The stimulus path <b>216</b> and response path <b>206</b> of multiple scan cells in scan path <b>104</b> form the stimulus bussing path <b>122</b> and response bussing path <b>124</b>, respectively, between scan path <b>104</b> and logic <b>108</b>. From this scan cell description, it is seen that the D-FF is shared between being used in the normal functional configuration and the test configuration. During scan operations through scan path <b>104</b>, the stimulus outputs <b>216</b> from each scan cell ripple, since the stimulus <b>216</b> path is connected to the scan output path <b>214</b>. This ripple causes all the inputs to logic <b>108</b> to actively change state during scan operations. Rippling the inputs to logic <b>108</b> causes power to be consumed by the interconnect and gating capacitance in logic <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a simplified example of how tester <b>110</b> operates, in states <b>300</b>, the scan architecture during test. Initially the tester will output control on path <b>114</b> to place the scan architecture in an idle state <b>302</b>. Next, the tester outputs control on path <b>114</b> to place the scan architecture in an operate scan path state <b>304</b>. In the operate scan path state, the tester outputs control to cause the scan path to accept stimulus data from the tester via path <b>118</b> and to output response data to the tester via path <b>120</b>. The tester maintains the operate scan path state until the scan path has been filled with stimulus data and emptied of response data. From the operate scan path state, the tester outputs control on path <b>114</b> to place the scan architecture in a capture response data state <b>306</b>. In the capture response data state, the tester outputs control to cause the scan path to load response data from logic <b>108</b> via path <b>124</b>. From the capture response data state <b>306</b>, the tester outputs control on path <b>114</b> to cause the scan architecture to re-enter the operate scan path state <b>302</b>. The process of entering the operate scan path state <b>304</b> to load stimulus into the scan path and empty response from the scan path, and then passing through the capture response state <b>306</b> to load new response data from logic <b>108</b> repeats until the end of test. At the end of test the tester outputs control to cause the scan architecture to re-enter the idle state <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a timing example of how tester <b>110</b> outputs SCANENA and SCANCK signals to scan path <b>104</b> during scan operations. In this example, a high to low transition on SCANENA, at time <b>406</b>, in combination with SCANCKs occurring during time interval <b>402</b>, causes stimulus data from the tester to be input to the scan path via path <b>118</b> while response data is output from the scan path to the tester via path <b>120</b>. A low to high transition on SCANENA, at time <b>408</b>, in combination with a SCANCK at time <b>404</b>, causes response data from logic <b>108</b> to be loaded into the scan path. Time interval <b>402</b> relates to state <b>304</b> of operating the scan path, and time interval <b>404</b> relates to state <b>306</b> of capturing a response, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As seen in the timing and operation diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the time interval sequences <b>404</b> (i.e. state <b>306</b>) and <b>402</b> (i.e. state <b>304</b>) cycle a sufficient number of times during test to input all stimulus to and obtain all response from logic <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">From the scan architecture described in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b> it is seen that the stimulus <b>122</b> outputs ripple the inputs to logic <b>108</b> as data shifts through the scan path <b>104</b> during scan operations. Rippling the inputs of logic <b>108</b> causes simultaneous charging and discharging of capacitances associated with the interconnects and gates of logic <b>108</b>. For example, each scan cell stimulus output <b>216</b> to logic <b>108</b> charges and discharges a certain amount of capacitance within logic <b>108</b> at a frequency related to the data bits being scanned through the scan cell. While each scan cell stimulus output may only be directly input to a few gates within logic <b>108</b>, each of the gates in logic <b>108</b> have outputs that fanout to inputs of other gates in logic <b>108</b>, and the outputs of the other gates in logic <b>108</b> again fanout to inputs of still further gates, and so on. Thus a transition on the stimulus output of a single scan cell may initiate hundreds of transitions within logic <b>108</b> as a result of the above mentioned signal transition fanout. Each of the transitions charge or discharge a portion of the total capacitance with logic <b>108</b> and therefore contribute to power consumption within logic <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The individual power (Pi) consumed by the rippling of a given scan cell output <b>216</b> can be approximated by CV.sup.2 F, where C is the capacitance being charged or discharged by the scan cell output (i.e. the capacitance of the above mentioned signal transition fanout), V is the switching voltage level, and F is the switching frequency of the scan cell output. The total power (Pt) consumed by simultaneously scanning all the scan cells in scan path <b>104</b> is approximately the sum of the individual scan cell powers, i.e. Pt=Pi.sub.1+Pi.sub.2+ . . . Pi.sub.N. The total power consumed by circuit <b>100</b>, when it is configured into the scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, can exceed the power consumed by circuit <b>100</b> when it is configured into its normal functional mode. This can be understood from the fact that, during normal functional mode of circuit <b>100</b>, not all the D-FFs <b>204</b> simultaneously operate, as they do during scan operations occurring during the above described scan test operation. Further if an IC contained multiple circuits <b>100</b>, the test of the IC may require testing each circuit <b>100</b> individually due to the above described test power consumption restriction. This lengthens the test time of the IC, which increases the cost to manufacture the IC.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A first known method of reducing power consumption during test operation is to insert blocking circuitry, such as a gate, into the stimulus paths <b>216</b> of each scan cell, such that during scan operations the inputs to logic <b>108</b> are blocked from the effect of the scan ripple. The problem with the first method is that it adds an undesirable delay (i.e. the blocking circuit delay) in the stimulus paths <b>216</b> between D-FFs <b>204</b> and logic <b>108</b>. This delay can negatively effect the performance of circuit <b>100</b> when it is configured into its normal functional mode. A second known method is to reduce the scan clock rate, such that the ripple frequency (F) is reduced. The problem with the second method is that it increases the test time since scan operations are performed at the reduced scan clock rate.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Today, there are a number of test synthesis vendor tools that can synthesize and insert scan architectures into ICs, similar in structure to the scan architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The use of such &#x201c;push-button&#x201d; scan insertion tools is an attractive alternative to customized scan designs since it is an automated process. As will be described, the present disclosure provides a method of adapting these synthesized scan architectures such that they may operate in a desired low power mode. The process of adapting scan architectures for low power operation is also easily automated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present disclosure described below provides a method of adapting synthesized scan architectures to achieve a low power mode of operation. The process of adapting scan architectures for low power operation is achieved without the aforementioned problems of; (1) having to insert blocking circuitry in the stimulus paths which adds signal delays, and (2) having to decrease the scan clock rate which increases test time. Furthermore, as will be described in more detail later, the process of adapting scan architectures for low power operation is achieved without having to modify the stimulus and response test patterns which are automatically produced by scan architecture synthesis tools.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present disclosure describes a method of adapting conventional scan architectures into a low power scan architecture. The low power scan architecture maintains the test time of conventional scan architectures, while requiring significantly less operational power than conventional scan architectures. The low power scan architecture is advantageous to IC/die manufacturers since it allows a larger number of circuits (such as DSP or CPU core circuits) embedded in an IC/die to be tested in parallel without consuming too much power within the IC/die. Since the low power scan architecture reduces test power consumption, it is possible to simultaneously test more die on a wafer than previously possible using conventional scan architectures. This allows wafer test times to be reduced which reduces the manufacturing cost of each die on the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Adapting a known scan path into a scan path of the present disclosure involves reorganizing the known scan path from being a single scan path containing all the scan cells (M), into a scan path having a desired number of selectable separate scan paths.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> after it has been adapted into the low power scan architecture of the present disclosure. The changes between the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> scan architecture and the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> low power scan architecture involve modification of scan path <b>104</b> into scan path <b>502</b>, and the insertion of an adaptor circuit <b>504</b> in the control path <b>114</b> between tester <b>110</b> and scan path <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Adapting scan path <b>104</b> into scan path <b>502</b> involves reorganizing scan path <b>104</b> from being a single scan path containing all the scan cells (M), into a scan path having a desired number of selectable separate scan paths. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, scan path <b>502</b> is shown after having been reorganized into three separate scan paths A <b>506</b>, B <b>508</b>, and C <b>510</b>. It is assumed at this point in the description that the number of scan cells (M) in scan path <b>104</b> is divisible by three such that each of the three separate scan paths A, B, and C contains an equal number of scan cells (M/3). The case where scan path <b>104</b> contains a number of scan cells (M) which, when divided by the number of desired separate scan paths, does not produce an equal number of scan cells in each separate scan path will be discussed later in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Scan paths A, B, and C are configured as follows inside scan path <b>502</b>. The serial input of each scan path A, B, and C is commonly connected to tester <b>110</b> via connection path <b>118</b>. The serial output of scan path A is connected to the input of a 3-state buffer <b>512</b>, the serial output of scan path B is connected to the input of a 3-state buffer <b>514</b>, and the serial output of scan path C is connected to the input of a 3-state buffer <b>516</b>. The outputs of the 3-state buffers <b>512</b>-<b>516</b> are commonly connected to tester <b>110</b> via connection path <b>120</b>. Scan paths A, B, and C each output an equal number of parallel stimulus inputs <b>526</b>, <b>530</b>, <b>534</b> to logic <b>108</b>, and each input an equal number of parallel response outputs <b>524</b>, <b>528</b>, <b>532</b> from logic <b>108</b>. The number of stimulus output signals to logic <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref> is the same. The number of response input signals from logic <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref> is the same. Scan path A and buffer <b>512</b> receive control input from adaptor <b>504</b> via bus <b>518</b>, scan path B and buffer <b>514</b> receive control input from adaptor <b>504</b> via bus <b>520</b>, and scan path C and buffer <b>516</b> receive control input from adaptor <b>504</b> via bus <b>522</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Adaptor <b>504</b> is connected to scan paths A, B, C via busses <b>518</b>-<b>522</b> and to tester <b>110</b> via bus <b>114</b>. The purpose of the adaptor is to intercept the scan control output <b>114</b> from tester <b>110</b> and translate it into a sequence of separate scan control outputs <b>518</b>-<b>522</b> to scan paths A, B, and C, respectively. Each of the separate scan control outputs <b>518</b>-<b>522</b> are used to operate one of the scan paths A, B, and C.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a simplified example of the combined operation states <b>600</b> of the tester <b>110</b> and adaptor <b>504</b> during test. The operation of tester <b>110</b> is the same as previously described in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When the tester transitions to the operate scan path state <b>304</b>, it begins outputting control to adaptor <b>504</b> via path <b>114</b>. The adaptor responds to the tester control input by translating it into a sequence of separate control outputs <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, and <b>522</b> to scan paths A, B, and C. As indicated in adaptor operation block <b>602</b>, the adaptor first responds to control <b>114</b> during adaptor operate state <b>604</b> to output control <b>518</b>, which enables buffer <b>512</b> and operates scan path A to input stimulus data from tester <b>110</b> via path <b>118</b> and output response data to tester <b>110</b> via path <b>120</b>. After scan path A is filled with stimulus and emptied of response, adaptor <b>504</b> responds to control <b>114</b> during operation state <b>606</b> to output control <b>520</b>, which enables buffer <b>514</b> and operates scan path B to input stimulus data from tester <b>110</b> via path <b>118</b> and output response data to tester <b>110</b> via path <b>120</b>. After scan path B is filled with stimulus and emptied of response, adaptor <b>504</b> responds to control <b>114</b> during operation state <b>608</b> to output control <b>522</b>, which enables buffer <b>516</b> and operates scan path C to input stimulus data from tester <b>110</b> via path <b>118</b> and output response data to tester <b>110</b> via path <b>120</b>. After scan paths A, B, and C have been filled and emptied, the tester <b>110</b> transitions from the operate state <b>304</b>, through the capture state <b>306</b>, and back to the operate state <b>304</b>. During this transition, the adaptor is idle during the capture state <b>306</b>, but resumes its scan control sequencing operation when the operate state <b>304</b> is re-entered. This process of sequentially scanning scan paths A, B, and C, then performing a capture operation to load response data repeats until the test has been performed and tester <b>110</b> enters the idle state <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">During the sequencing of the operation states <b>604</b>-<b>608</b>, only one of the buffers <b>512</b>-<b>516</b> are enabled at a time to output response data to tester <b>110</b>. Also, the sequencing of the adaptor operation states <b>604</b>-<b>608</b> occurs in a seamless manner such that the stimulus data from the tester <b>110</b> is input to scan path <b>502</b> as it was input to scan path <b>104</b>, and the response data to tester <b>110</b> is output from scan path <b>502</b> as it was output from scan path <b>104</b>. To the tester, the behavior of the scan path <b>502</b> and adaptor <b>504</b> combination is indistinguishable from the behavior of the scan path <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus the test time of the logic <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is the same as the test time of logic <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">From the above description, it is seen that only a subset (i.e. subset A <b>526</b>, B <b>530</b>, or C <b>534</b>) of the stimulus input bus <b>122</b> to logic <b>108</b> is allowed to ripple at any given time during the adaptor operated scan operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. In contrast, the entire stimulus input bus <b>122</b> to logic <b>108</b> ripples during the tester operated scan operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. Since, using the present disclosure, only a subset of the stimulus inputs to logic <b>108</b> are allowed to ripple at any one time, less of the aforementioned interconnect and gating capacitance of logic <b>108</b> is simultaneously charged and discharged during scan operations. By reducing the amount of logic <b>108</b> capacitance being simultaneously charged and discharged during scan operations, the power consumed by logic <b>108</b> is advantageously reduced by the present disclosure.</p>

Adaptor <b>504</b> inputs the SCANCK <b>212</b> and SCANENA <b>210</b> signals from tester <b>110</b>, via bus <b>114</b>. Adaptor <b>504</b> outputs SCANCK-A signal <b>712</b>, SCANCK-B signal <b>714</b>, SCANCK-C signal <b>716</b>, ENABUF-A signal <b>718</b>, ENABUF-B signal <b>720</b>, ENABUF-C signal <b>722</b>, and the SCANENA signal <b>210</b>. The SCANENA signal <b>210</b> is connected to all scan cell <b>200</b> multiplexers <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The SCANCK-A signal <b>712</b> is connected, in substitution of SCANCK signal <b>212</b>, to all scan cell <b>200</b> D-FF <b>204</b> clock inputs of scan path A. The SCANCK-B signal <b>714</b> is connected, in substitution of SCANCK signal <b>212</b>, to all scan cell <b>200</b> D-FF <b>204</b> clock inputs of scan path B. The SCANCK-C signal <b>716</b> is connected, in substitution of SCANCK signal <b>212</b>, to all scan cell <b>200</b> D-FF <b>204</b> clock inputs of scan path C. The ENABUF-A signal <b>718</b> is connected to the enable input of buffer <b>512</b>. The ENABUF-B signal <b>720</b> is connected to the enable input of buffer <b>514</b>. The ENABUF-C signal <b>722</b> is connected to the enable input of buffer <b>516</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, adaptor <b>504</b> includes a state machine <b>702</b>, counter <b>704</b>, and gates <b>706</b>-<b>710</b>. During the functional mode of circuit <b>500</b>, SCANENA is high as indicated at time <b>810</b> in the adaptor timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. While SCANENA is high, state machine <b>702</b> outputs control signals <b>724</b>-<b>728</b> that enable SCANCK to pass through gates <b>706</b>-<b>710</b> to functionally clock all D-FFs <b>204</b> of scan paths A, B, and C, via SCANCK-A, SCANCK-B, and SCANCK-C. In this example, the SCANCK is assumed to be the functional clock during the functional mode of circuit <b>500</b>, and the test clock during test mode of circuit <b>500</b>. While SCANENA is high, state machine <b>702</b> outputs control signals <b>718</b>-<b>722</b> to disable buffers <b>512</b>-<b>516</b>. The scan operation mode is entered by SCANENA going low as indicated at time <b>812</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. SCANENA goes low when tester <b>110</b> transitions from the idle state <b>302</b> to the operate state <b>304</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At the beginning of the scan operation mode, the state machine initializes counter <b>704</b> via control (CTL) signals <b>730</b> and disables scan access to scan paths B and C by disabling SCANCK gates <b>708</b> and <b>710</b> via signals <b>726</b> and <b>728</b>, and enables scan access to scan path A by; (1) enabling SCANCK gate <b>706</b> via signal <b>724</b>, and (2) enabling buffer <b>512</b> via signal <b>718</b>. Scan access of scan path A occurs over time interval <b>802</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. During time interval <b>802</b>, scan path A is accessed to load stimulus data from tester <b>110</b> via path <b>118</b> and unload response to tester <b>110</b> via path <b>120</b>. While scan path A is being accessed, the state machine operates counter <b>704</b> via control signals <b>730</b> to determine the number (M/3) of SCANCK-A's to output to scan path A. When the counter reaches a count, indicative of scan path A receiving the correct number (M/3) SCANCK-A inputs, it outputs a first count complete 1 (CC1) signal <b>732</b> to state machine <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In response to the first CC1 signal, the state machine initializes counter <b>704</b> via control signals <b>730</b> and disables scan access to scan path A and C, and enables scan access to scan path B over time interval <b>804</b>. The state machine enables scan access to scan path B by; (1) enabling SCANCK gate <b>708</b> via signal <b>726</b>, and (2) enabling buffer <b>514</b> via signal <b>720</b>. While scan path B is being accessed, the state machine operates counter <b>704</b> via control signals <b>730</b> to determine the number of SCANCK-B's to output to scan path B. When the counter reaches a count, indicative of scan path B receiving the correct number (M/3) SCANCK-B inputs, it outputs a second count complete 1 (CC1) signal <b>732</b> to state machine <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In response to the second CC1 signal, the state machine initializes counter <b>704</b> via control signals <b>730</b> and disables scan access to scan path A and B, and enables scan access to scan path C over time interval <b>806</b>. The state machine enables scan access to scan path C by; (1) enabling SCANCK gate <b>710</b> via signal <b>728</b>, and (2) enabling buffer <b>516</b> via signal <b>722</b>. While scan path C is being accessed, the state machine operates counter <b>704</b> via control signals <b>730</b> to determine the number of SCANCK-C's to output to scan path C. When the counter reaches a count, indicative of scan path C receiving the correct number (M/3) SCANCK-C inputs, it outputs a third count complete 1 (CC1) signal <b>732</b> to state machine <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In response to the third CC1 signal, the state machine disables all buffers <b>512</b>-<b>516</b> via signals <b>718</b>-<b>722</b> and enables gates <b>706</b>-<b>710</b> to pass the SCANCK to all scan cells of scan paths A, B, and C. Since scan paths A, B, and C were assumed to contain equal numbers of scan cells (M/3) with the sum of the scan cells in scan paths A, B, and C being equal to the number of scan cells (M) in scan path <b>104</b>, the third CC1 signal occurs one SCANCK prior to tester <b>110</b> setting the SCANENA signal high, at time <b>814</b>, during its transition from the operate state <b>304</b> to the capture state <b>306</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. While SCANENA is high, at time <b>808</b>, all scan paths A, B, and C receive a SCANCK, causing them to load response data from logic <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Following the response data load operation at time <b>808</b>, SCANENA, from tester <b>110</b>, returns low at time <b>812</b> and the above described sequence of separately accessing scan paths A, B, and C repeats until the test completes and tester <b>110</b> transitions back to idle state <b>302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Contrasting the scan timing diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</figref>, it is seen that tester <b>110</b> provides the same SCANENA timing for both diagrams. For example, (1) the SCANENA high to low transition at time <b>406</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is the same SCANENA high to low transition at time <b>812</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, (2) the SCANENA low to high transition at time <b>408</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is the same SCANENA low to high transition at time <b>814</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, (3) the same number of SCANCKs occur between time <b>406</b>/<b>812</b> and time <b>408</b>/<b>814</b> in both diagrams, and (4) the same response load SCANCK occurs at time <b>404</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and at time <b>808</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The difference between the two timing diagrams is seen in the way the adaptor <b>504</b> sequentially applies a burst of M/3 SCANCKs to scan paths A, B, and C during time intervals <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, and <b>806</b>, respectively, such that only one of the scan paths is accessed at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the example adaptor circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> has been described using a gated clocking scheme to control access to the scan cells <b>200</b> of scan paths A, B, and C, other example designs of adaptor <b>504</b> may be used to control access to other types of scan cells used in scan paths A, B, and C as well. For example, the scan cells <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> could be designed to include a state hold multiplexer <b>218</b> between the output of multiplexer <b>202</b> and input to D-FF <b>204</b>. The state hold multiplexer <b>218</b> could be controlled, via a connection <b>220</b> to the ENACK-A <b>724</b>, ENACK-B <b>726</b>, and ENACK-C <b>728</b> signals from state machine <b>702</b>, such that it provides a connection <b>222</b> between the output of multiplexer <b>202</b> and the D-FF input, or it provides a state hold connection <b>224</b> between the output of DFF <b>204</b> and the input to D-FF <b>204</b>. If this type of scan cell <b>200</b> were used in scan paths A, B, and C, the SCANCK <b>212</b> could be directly routed to all the D-FF <b>204</b> clock inputs instead of being gated to the D-FF <b>204</b> clock inputs via the SCANCK-A, SCANCK-B, and SCANCK-C signals as described for adaptor <b>504</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The adaptor <b>504</b> would be modified to operate the state holding scan cells by eliminating the gates <b>706</b>-<b>710</b> and the SCANCK-A, SCANCK-B, and SCANCK-C outputs, and providing as outputs the ENACK-A <b>724</b>, ENACK-B <b>726</b>, and ENACK-C <b>728</b> signals from state machine <b>702</b>. The ENACK-A output would be connected as control input <b>220</b> to the state hold multiplexers <b>218</b> in the scan cells of scan path A. The ENACK-B output would be connected as control input <b>220</b> to the state hold multiplexers <b>218</b> in the scan cells of scan path B. The ENACK-C output would be connected as control input <b>220</b> to the state hold multiplexers <b>218</b> in the scan cells of scan path C.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">During functional and response capture operations, the ENACK-A, ENACK-B, and ENACK-C outputs from the modified adaptor <b>504</b> would be set to enable a connection between the response signal <b>206</b> and input to D-FF <b>204</b> of each scan cell, via multiplexer <b>202</b> and the state hold multiplexer <b>218</b>. During scan operations to scan path A (timing interval <b>802</b>), the ENACK-B and ENACK-C outputs would be set to place the scan cells of scan paths B and C in their state hold connection configuration, and ENACK-A would be set to form a connection between the scan input <b>208</b> and input to D-FF <b>204</b> of the scan cells in scan paths A, to allow scan access of scan path A. During scan operations to scan path B (timing interval <b>804</b>), the ENACK-A and ENACK-C outputs would be set to place the scan cells of scan paths A and C in their state hold connection configuration, and ENACK-B would be set to form a connection between the scan input <b>208</b> and input to D-FF <b>204</b> of the scan cells in scan paths B, to allow scan access of scan path B. During scan operations to scan path C (timing interval <b>806</b>), the ENACK-A and ENACK-B outputs would be set to place the scan cells of scan paths A and B in their state hold connection configuration, and ENACK-C would be set to form a connection between the scan input <b>208</b> and input to D-FF <b>204</b> of the scan cells in scan paths C, to allow scan access of scan path C.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The modified adaptor <b>504</b> and state hold type scan cells described above operate to achieve the low power mode of scan access to scan paths A, B, and C as previously described with the original adaptor <b>504</b> and scan cell <b>200</b>. The difference between the two adaptor/scan cell combinations described above is that the original adaptor/scan cell combination operates in a gated clock mode (i.e. uses gated clocks SCANCK-A, SCANCK-B, and SCANCK-C) and the modified adaptor/scan cell combination operates in a synchronous clock mode C (i.e. uses the SCANCK).</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Scan Path Adaptation</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As mentioned previously, test synthesis tools exist that are capable of automatically instantiating scan architectures similar to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. These tools are capable of analyzing logic <b>108</b> and its stimulus and response interface to scan path <b>104</b> To Whom It May Concern: determine what stimulus test pattern data needs to input from tester <b>110</b> to logic <b>108</b> via scan path <b>104</b> and what response test patterns data is expected to be output to tester <b>110</b> from logic <b>108</b> via scan path <b>104</b>. To reduce the effort required to adapt the synthesized scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> into the low power scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the scan path adaptation process described below is preferably performed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, scan path <b>104</b> is shown receiving stimulus frames <b>920</b> from tester <b>110</b> via connection <b>118</b> and outputting response frames <b>922</b> to tester <b>110</b> via connection <b>120</b>. The term &#x201c;frame&#x201d; simply indicates the number of scan bits (M) required to fill the scan path <b>104</b> with stimulus data from tester <b>110</b> and empty the scan path <b>104</b> of response data to tester <b>110</b> during the operate state <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The test may require a large number of stimulus and response frame communications to test logic <b>108</b>. To achieve the low power mode of operation of the present disclosure, it is desired to reorganize scan path <b>104</b> into a plurality of separate scan paths. In this example, the reorganization of scan path <b>104</b> results in the previously described scan path <b>502</b>, which contains three separate scan paths <b>506</b>-<b>510</b>. It is also desired to adapt scan path <b>104</b> into scan path <b>502</b> in such a way as to avoid having to make any modifications to the stimulus and response test pattern frames <b>920</b> and <b>922</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As previously mentioned in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the number (M) of scan cells in scan path <b>104</b>, is assumed divisible by three such that scan path <b>104</b> can be seen to comprise three separate scan segments A, B, and C, each scan segment containing a third (M/3) of the scan cells (M) in scan path <b>104</b>. Scan segment A of <b>104</b> contains a subset <b>912</b> of the stimulus and response signals of the overall stimulus and response busses <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> respectively. Scan segment B of <b>104</b> contains a subset <b>910</b> of the stimulus and response signals of the overall stimulus and response busses <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> respectively. Scan segment C of <b>104</b> contains a subset <b>912</b> of the stimulus and response signals of the overall stimulus and response busses <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Each stimulus scan frame <b>920</b> scanned into scan path <b>104</b> from tester <b>110</b> can be viewed as having bit position fields [CBA] that fill scan segments C, B, and A, respectively. For example, following a scan operation, bit position field A is loaded into segment A, bit position field B is loaded into segment B, and bit position field C is loaded into segment C. Likewise, each response scan frame <b>922</b> scanned from scan path <b>104</b> to tester <b>110</b> can be viewed as having bit position fields [CBA] that empty scan segments C, B, and A, respectively. For example, following a scan operation, bit position field A is unloaded from segment A, bit position field B is unloaded from segment B, and bit position field C is unloaded from segment C. To insure that the stimulus <b>920</b> and response <b>922</b> frames are reusable when scan path <b>104</b> is reorganized into the low power configuration, the reorganization process occurs as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Scan path <b>104</b> segment A is configured as a separate scan path A <b>506</b>, as indicated by the dotted line <b>914</b>. Scan path <b>104</b> segment B is configured as a separate scan path B <b>508</b>, as indicated by the dotted line <b>916</b>. Scan path <b>104</b> segment C is configured as a separate scan path C <b>510</b>, as indicated by the dotted line <b>918</b>. The scan inputs to scan paths A, B, and C <b>506</b>-<b>510</b> are connected to tester <b>110</b> via connection <b>118</b>. The scan outputs from scan paths A, B, and C <b>506</b>-<b>510</b> are connected, via the previously described 3-state buffers <b>512</b>-<b>516</b>, to tester <b>110</b> via connection <b>120</b>. Each separate scan path <b>506</b>-<b>510</b> maintains the same stimulus and response bussing connections <b>908</b>-<b>912</b> to logic <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Operating the reorganized scan path <b>502</b> using the tester <b>110</b> used to operate scan path <b>104</b> results in the following behavior. This behavior assumes adaptor <b>504</b> has been inserted between the tester <b>110</b> and scan path <b>502</b>, to control scan path <b>502</b> as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>. During input and output of stimulus and response frames [CBA] <b>920</b> and <b>922</b> respectively, (1) stimulus bit field A is directly loaded into scan path A from tester <b>110</b> via path <b>118</b> as response bit field A is directly unloaded from scan path A to tester <b>110</b> via path <b>120</b>, (2) stimulus bit field B is directly loaded into scan path B from tester <b>110</b> via path <b>118</b> as response bit field B is directly unloaded from scan path B to tester <b>110</b> via path <b>120</b>, and (3) stimulus bit field C is directly loaded into scan path C from tester <b>110</b> via path <b>118</b> as response bit field C is directly unloaded from scan path C to tester <b>110</b> via path <b>120</b>. As seen from this description, when scan path <b>104</b> is reorganized into scan path <b>502</b> as described, scan path <b>502</b> can use the same stimulus and response frames originally intended for use by scan path <b>104</b>. Thus no modifications are necessary to the stimulus and response test pattern frames produced by the test synthesis tool.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the case where scan path <b>104</b> contains a number of scan cells (M) that is not equally divisible by the desired number of separate scan paths (N) in scan path <b>502</b>, the length of one of the separate scan paths can be adjusted to compensate scan path <b>502</b> for proper input and output of the scan frames <b>920</b>-<b>922</b>. For example, if the number of scan cells (M) in scan path <b>104</b> is not equally divisible by the number of separate scan paths (N) required to achieve a desired low power mode of operation, M can be increased by adding a value (Y) such that M+Y is equally divisible by N. Once this is done, N separate scan paths may be formed. N&#x2212;1 of the separate scan paths will have a length (M+Y)/N and one of the separate scan paths will have a length of ((M+Y)/N)&#x2212;Y. For example, if scan path <b>104</b> had 97 scan cells (M), scan path A and B of <b>502</b> would each be configured to contain 33 scan cells [(M+Y)/N=(97+2)/3=33], while scan path C would be configured to contain 31 scan cells [((M+Y)/N)&#x2212;Y=((97+2)/3)&#x2212;2=31]. In this example, the scan frame <b>920</b>-<b>922</b> [CBA] segments would be seen as; segment A=33 bits, segment B=33 bits, and segment C=31 bits.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When scan path <b>502</b> is formed to include the scan frame compensation technique described above, the operation of adaptor <b>504</b> is adjusted so it can properly control the compensated scan path <b>502</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the adaptor <b>504</b> circuit and operation was described in detail. Assuming the adaptor timing diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is being used to communicate scan frames to a scan path <b>502</b> consisting of the above mentioned 33-bit scan path A, 33-bit scan path B, and 31-bit scan path C, the following changes are required to adaptor <b>504</b>. Adaptor state machine <b>702</b> continues to monitor the CC1 <b>732</b> output from counter <b>704</b>, as previously described, to determine when to stop 33-bit scan operations to scan paths A and B at timing intervals <b>802</b> and <b>804</b>, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. However, since the scan timing interval <b>806</b> to scan path C is different from the scan timing intervals <b>802</b> and <b>804</b>, the state machine operation is altered to where it monitors the count complete 2 (CC2) output <b>734</b> from counter <b>704</b> to stop the 31-bit scan operation to scan path C. The CC2 <b>734</b> output is designed to indicate when the 31-bit scan operation to scan path C should be stopped, whereas the CC1 <b>732</b> is designed to indicate when the 33-bit scan operation to scan paths A and B should be stopped.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Parallel Scan Architectures</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates circuit <b>1000</b> that has been configured for testing using a conventional parallel scan architecture. As with the previous single scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, parallel scan architectures may be synthesized and automatically inserted into ICs to serve as embedded testing mechanisms. The parallel scan architecture includes separate scan paths 1-N <b>1010</b>-<b>1016</b> and an interface to tester <b>1008</b>. During the functional mode of circuit <b>1000</b>, the D-FFs <b>204</b> of scan paths 1-N are configured to operate with logic <b>1006</b> to provide the circuit <b>1000</b> functionality. During test mode, the D-FFs <b>204</b> of scan path 1-N are configured to operate with tester <b>1008</b> to provide testing of logic <b>1006</b>. Scan paths 1-N receive response from logic <b>1006</b> via paths <b>1040</b>-<b>1046</b>, and output stimulus to logic <b>1006</b> via paths <b>1048</b>-<b>1054</b>. Scan paths 1-N receive serial stimulus from tester <b>1008</b> via paths <b>1010</b>-<b>1024</b>, and output serial response to tester <b>1008</b> via paths <b>1026</b>-<b>1032</b>. Scan paths 1-N receive control input from tester <b>1008</b> via path <b>1034</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When circuit <b>1000</b> is first placed in the test configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the parallel scan architecture will be controlled, by tester <b>1008</b>, to be in the idle state <b>1102</b> of the test operation diagram <b>1100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. From the idle state <b>1102</b>, tester <b>1008</b> will transition the parallel scan architecture into the operate scan paths 1-N state <b>1104</b>. During the operate state <b>1104</b>, tester <b>1008</b> outputs control to scan paths 1-N causing the scan paths to input stimulus from tester <b>1008</b> via paths <b>1018</b>-<b>1024</b> and output response to tester <b>1008</b> via paths <b>1026</b>-<b>1032</b>. After the scan paths 1-N are filled with stimulus and emptied of response, tester <b>1008</b> transitions to the capture state <b>1106</b> to load the next response data, then returns to the operate state <b>1104</b> to input the next stimulus data and empty the next response data. After all stimulus and response data patterns have been applied, by repeating transitions between the operate and capture states, the test is complete and the tester returns to the idle state <b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The structure and operation of the parallel scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is very similar to the structure and operation of the single scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The parallel scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> suffers from the same power consumption problem described in the scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, since during scan operations, logic <b>1006</b> receives simultaneous rippling stimulus inputs from scan paths 1-N. Thus, the parallel scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> can be improved to where it consumes less power during test by adapting it into a low power parallel scan architecture as described below.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Low Power Parallel Scan Architecture</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> parallel scan architecture after it has been adapted for low power operation. The adaptation process, as previously described in the low power adaptation of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> scan architecture, involves the following steps. Step one includes reconfiguring scan paths 1-N <b>1010</b>-<b>1016</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> into scan paths 1-N <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, wherein each scan path 1-N <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b> contains multiple separate scan paths between their respective inputs <b>1018</b>-<b>1024</b> and outputs <b>1026</b>-<b>1032</b>. In this example, it is assumed that each scan path 1-N <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b> has been reconfigured into separate scan paths A, B, and C, as scan path <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> was reconfigured into scan path <b>502</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Step two includes inserting adaptor <b>1210</b> between tester <b>1008</b> and scan paths 1-N <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b>. In this example, it is assumed that adaptor <b>1210</b> is very similar to adaptor <b>504</b> in the way it operates the separate scan paths A, B, and C in each of the scan paths 1-N <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b>, so only the brief operation description of adaptor <b>1210</b> is given below.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As seen in the operation diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, adaptor <b>1210</b> responds to tester <b>1008</b> entering the operate state <b>1104</b> to: (1) simultaneously operate the scan paths A of scan paths <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b>, via control bus <b>1212</b>, to input stimulus from tester <b>1008</b> and output response to tester <b>1008</b>, then (2) simultaneously operate the scan paths B of scan paths <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b>, via control bus <b>1212</b>, to input stimulus from tester <b>1008</b> and output response to tester <b>1008</b>, then (3) simultaneously operate the scan paths C of scan paths <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b>, via control bus <b>1212</b>, to input stimulus from tester <b>1008</b> and output response to tester <b>1008</b>. Adaptor <b>1210</b> suspends scan operations to scan paths <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b> when tester <b>1008</b> enters the capture state <b>1106</b>, and resumes the above described scan operation sequence to the scan paths A, B, and C of scan paths <b>1202</b>-<b>1208</b> when tester <b>1008</b> re-enters the operate state <b>1104</b>. After the test completes, tester <b>1008</b> enters the idle state <b>1102</b> and the adaptor <b>1210</b> is disabled. From this description, the operation of adaptor <b>1210</b> is seen to mirror the operation of adaptor <b>504</b> with the exception that adaptor <b>1210</b> controls multiple scan paths A, multiple scan paths B, and multiple scan paths C during its control state diagram sequence <b>1302</b>. In contrast, adaptor <b>504</b> controlled only one scan path A, one scan path B, and one scan path C during its control state diagram sequence <b>602</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">While the process of adapting pre-existing scan architectures for low power operation has been described, it is anticipated that, once the low power benefit of the present disclosure is understood, test synthesis tools will be improved to provide direct synthesis of low power scan architectures. Direct synthesis of low power scan architectures will eliminate the need to perform the adaptation steps previously described, since the steps will be incorporated into the synthesis process. A direct synthesis of a single scan path low power scan architecture would result in the direct instantiation of a low power scan architecture similar to the one described and shown in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a circuit <b>1400</b> configured into a conventional scan controller based scan architecture. The scan architecture consists of logic <b>1410</b>, scan paths <b>1412</b>-<b>1418</b>, and scan controller <b>1402</b>. The scan paths are coupled to logic <b>1410</b> via stimulus and response paths <b>1424</b>, to scan controller <b>1402</b> via path <b>1404</b>, and to tester <b>1408</b> via scan inputs <b>1420</b> and scan outputs <b>1422</b>. The scan controller is coupled to tester <b>1408</b> via path <b>1406</b>. While the scan controller based architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> uses parallel scan paths <b>1412</b>-<b>1418</b>, a single scan path architecture, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, could be used as well. The scan architecture operates to test logic <b>1410</b> as previously described in regard to the scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, with the exception that the tester <b>1408</b> inputs control to scan controller <b>1402</b> instead of directly to the scan paths. In response to tester control input, the scan controller outputs scan control <b>1404</b> to scan paths <b>1412</b>-<b>1418</b> to execute the test. An example control diagram for the scan controller is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. While various different control diagrams for various different scan controllers could be shown, the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> reflects the basic scan operations typically required by any scan controller circuit <b>1402</b>. Those operations being, an idle state <b>1502</b>, an operate scan state <b>1504</b>, and a capture response state <b>1506</b>. It is understood that various other scan operation states could exist in the control diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The scan controller of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> could be anyone of many types of scan controller circuits. Two examples of some of the types of scan controllers that could be represented by scan controller <b>1402</b> are listed below.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In one realization, scan controller <b>1402</b> could represent the test access port (TAP) controller circuit of IEEE standard 1149.1, A Standard Test Access Port and Boundary Scan Architecture. A description of the IEEE TAP being used to control scan access to parallel scan paths is described in regard to FIG. 14a of-U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,365 by Whetsel and is incorporated herein by reference. The TAP operation states differ from the operation state diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, but in general it contains the fundamental scan <b>1504</b> and capture <b>1506</b> states.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In another realization, scan controller <b>1402</b> could represent the boundary input/output serializer (BIOS) circuit, described in regard to FIG. 17 of the above mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,365, being used to control scan access to parallel scan paths. The BIOS description in U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,365 is incorporated herein by reference. The BIOS operation also differs from the operation state diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, but in general it contains the fundamental scan <b>1504</b> and capture <b>1506</b> states.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In still another realization, scan controller <b>1402</b> could represent the addressable test port (ATP) circuit, described in TI patent application TI-28058, being used to control scan access to parallel scan paths. The TI-28058 patent application is incorporated herein by reference. As with the TAP and BIOS, the ATP operation differs from the operation state diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, but in general it contains the fundamental scan <b>1504</b> and capture <b>1506</b> states.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates the two modification steps to the scan controller based scan architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> to achieve the desired low power mode of operation. In the first modification step, as with the previously described modification of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> scan architecture into the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> low power scan architecture, each of the scan paths <b>1412</b>-<b>1418</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> are converted into low power scan paths <b>1602</b>-<b>1608</b>. Each of the low power scan paths <b>1602</b>-<b>1608</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> contain separate scan path segments A, B, and C arranged as shown and described previously in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the second modification step, an adaptor <b>1610</b> is inserted between the scan controller <b>1402</b> and scan paths <b>1602</b>-<b>1608</b>. Adaptor <b>1610</b> inputs control from scan controller <b>1402</b> via path <b>1404</b> and outputs control to scan paths <b>1602</b>-<b>1608</b> via path <b>1612</b>. From the general control state diagram example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, adaptor <b>1610</b> responds to scan controller <b>1402</b> output states (idle state <b>1502</b>, operate scan paths 1-N state <b>1504</b>, and capture response data state <b>1506</b>) to output control state sequences <b>1702</b> (operate scan paths A <b>1704</b>, operate scan paths B <b>1706</b>, and operate scan paths C <b>1708</b>) to scan paths <b>1602</b>-<b>1608</b>. As with previous adaptor descriptions, the control output from adaptor <b>1610</b> to scan paths <b>1602</b>-<b>1608</b> operates the scan paths <b>1602</b>-<b>1608</b> such that only one of the scan path segment groups (i.e. segment group A, B, or C) of scan paths <b>1602</b>-<b>1608</b> are enabled to shift data at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Since the adaptor's <b>1610</b> control input <b>1404</b> may come from any type of scan controller, such as the TAP, BIOS, or ATP mentioned above, the adaptor <b>1610</b> design will need to be customized to interface with the specific scan controller <b>1402</b> being used. In general, an adaptor <b>1610</b> can interface to any given scan controller by simply sensing when the scan controller starts a scan operation and sensing when the scan controller stops a scan operation. For example, when a scan controller starts a scan operation the adaptor starts executing its operate scan paths A, B, and C state sequence, and when the scan controller stops a scan operation the adaptor stops executing its operate scan paths A, B, and C state sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates the adaptor <b>1610</b> as being a circuit separate from scan controller circuit <b>1402</b>, the two circuits can be designed as one circuit. For example, if it is desired to provide the low power scan mode of the present disclosure in a scan controller based architecture, the scan controller and the adaptor circuit functions may be integrated into a single circuit realization. The previously mentioned IEEE 1149.1 TAP scan controller may indeed be designed to include the adaptor's <b>1610</b> scan path segment A, B, and C sequencing functionality. Likewise, the previously mentioned BIOS or ATP scan controllers may indeed be designed to include the adaptor's <b>1610</b> scan path segment A, B, and C sequencing functionality.</p>

This example is provided to demonstrate that cores <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> could each have a different number of scan paths when configured into the test mode. For example, core <b>1</b> has two scan paths, core <b>2</b> has three scan paths, and core <b>3</b> has N scan paths.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As previously described in regard to the test times of using scan paths <b>104</b> and <b>502</b> to test logic <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, the test times of using the scan paths of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 20</figref> to test the logic circuits of cores <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> are the same, as are the test times of using scan paths of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 21</figref> to test the logic circuits of cores <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>. Also, as previously described in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the tester scan input and scan output pattern frames used for testing the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> cores can be directly reused to test the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> cores. Likewise, the test patterns used for testing the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> cores can be reused to test the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> cores.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As mentioned, the scan paths of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> circuits were assumed to be of equal length (M). Also, the corresponding low power scan paths of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> were assumed to be modified from the M length scan paths <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> such that the scan path segments A, B, and C of each low power scan path are of equal length (M/3). With these assumptions made, a single adaptor circuit can be used to operate all the low power scan paths of cores <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> during scan operations. The single adaptor circuit would sequence through three cycles of scan burst time intervals <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, and <b>806</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> during each scan operation. For example, using the scan operation timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> modified as described below, the scan operation of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref> scan paths can be understood. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when SCANENA goes low at time <b>812</b> to start the scan operation, a first cycle of scan burst intervals <b>802</b>-<b>806</b> occurs, followed by SCANENA remaining low while a second cycle of scan burst intervals <b>802</b>-<b>806</b> occurs, followed by SCANENA remaining low while a third cycle of scan burst intervals <b>802</b>-<b>806</b> occurs. Following the third cycle of scan burst intervals <b>802</b>-<b>806</b> SCANENA returns high to end the scan operation.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">While the adaptor may be designed to operate the low power scan paths different from the operation described above, the above described operation maintains the ability to reuse the test pattern frames of the original scan paths of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. For example, each of the existing scan test pattern frames (stimulus and response) for the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> circuit can be viewed in the format of &#x201c;[core<b>1</b>] [core<b>2</b>] [core<b>3</b>]&#x201d;, where [core<b>1</b>] indicates the scan frame bit positions targeted for the core <b>1</b> scan paths, [core<b>2</b>] indicates the scan frame bit positions targeted for the core <b>2</b> scan paths, and [core<b>3</b>] indicates the scan frame bit positions targeted for the core <b>3</b> scan paths. It follows from the previous description given for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> that; [core<b>1</b>] can be further viewed in a format of [C.sub.1B.sub.1A.sub.1], [core<b>2</b>] can be further viewed in a format of [C.sub.2B.sub.2A.sub.2], and [core<b>3</b>] can be further viewed in a format of [C.sub.3B.sub.3A.sub.3], where the C.sub.1,2,3, B.sub.1,2,3, and A.sub.1,2,3 subset bit positions are targeted for each low power scan path segment C, B, and A of cores <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 21</figref>. The above described adaptor scan operation would operate to load and unload each subset C.sub.1,2,3, B.sub.1,2,3, A.sub.1,2,3 scan frame bit positions into the respective C, B, and A scan path segments of each low power scan path of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>. The advantage to this, as mentioned in regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, is that test pattern frames originally provided for the scan path arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> do not have to modified for use with the low power scan path arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As mentioned in regard to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> daisy-chain arrangement, length compensating pad bit positions are included in the test pattern frames communicated to the daisy-chained scan paths <b>3</b> of cores <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, and in the test pattern frames communicated to scan paths 4-N of core <b>3</b>. During the adaptor operated scan operation of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> circuit, these pad bit positions are communicated during the above mentioned cycles of scan burst timing intervals <b>802</b>-<b>806</b>, such that at the end of each adaptor controlled scan operation, all scan path segments A,B,C of all low power scan paths properly filled with stimulus and emptied of response.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, if the A,B,C segments of the low power scan paths of core <b>1</b> have the same length, the A,B,C segments of the low power scan paths of core <b>2</b> have the same length, and the A,B,C segments of the low power scan paths of core <b>3</b> have the same length, but the lengths of the A,B,C segments of the low power scan paths of cores <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> are not the same, separate adaptor interfaces will be needed to control the low power scan paths of each core <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>. A first adaptor interface will be connected to the control input <b>2018</b> of core <b>1</b> to provide control of the core <b>1</b> A,B,C segments, a second adaptor interface will be connected to the control input <b>2020</b> of core <b>2</b> to provide control of the core <b>2</b> A,B,C segments, and a third adaptor interface will be connected to the control input <b>2022</b> of core <b>3</b> to provide control of the core <b>3</b> A,B,C segments. The use of separate adaptor interfaces allows each of the core <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> low power scan paths to be operated according to the scan burst timing intervals (<b>802</b>-<b>806</b>) required to communicate to each of the different length low power scan path A,B,C segments of cores <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>. For example, if the A,B,C segment lengths of cores <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> were 100, 300, and 900 respectively, the scan burst intervals (<b>802</b>-<b>806</b>) of core <b>1</b> would be set at 100 each, the scan burst timing intervals (<b>802</b>-<b>806</b>) of core <b>2</b> would be set at 300 each, and the burst timing intervals (<b>802</b>-<b>806</b>) of core <b>3</b> would be set at 900 each. A single adaptor circuit may be equipped with multiple separate interfaces for connection to control inputs <b>2018</b>-<b>2022</b>, or separate adaptor circuits may be interfaced to control inputs <b>2018</b>-<b>2022</b>. In a daisy-chained arrangement, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, each core may have different A,B,C scan segment lengths. However for proper daisy-chain operation, each of the different core A,B,C scan lengths should be set to positive integer multiples of one another such that the adpator interfaces to each core can operate together during each scan operation cycle (i.e. from SCANENA going low at <b>812</b> to SCANENA going high at <b>814</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) to modulate the test patterns through all daisy-chained cores without loosing any of the stimulus and response pattern bits. For example, the 100, 300, and 900 A,B,C core scan segment lengths mentioned above have been set to where, during each scan operation cycle, the adpator of core <b>1</b> modulates test patterns through core <b>1</b> using multiple cycles of 100 bit scan burst intervals (<b>802</b>-<b>806</b>), the adpator of core <b>2</b> modulates test patterns through core <b>2</b> using multiple cycles of 300 bit scan burst intervals (<b>802</b>-<b>806</b>), and the adaptor of core <b>3</b> modulates test patterns through core <b>3</b> using multiple cycles of 900 bit scan burst intervals (<b>802</b>-<b>806</b>). Since 900 is a multiple of 300 and 300 is a multiple of <b>100</b>, all A,B,C scan paths of cores <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> will be properly filled and emptied during each scan operation cycle.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Scalable Scan Architecture Power Consumption</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As can be anticipated from the description given for the present disclosure, the power consumption of logic circuitry being tested by the low power scan architecture decreases as the number separate scan paths within the low power scan paths increases. For example, configuring a given conventional scan path into a low power scan path comprising two separate scan paths may reduce power consumption by up to 50%, since, during operation, each of the two separate scan paths separately charge and discharge one half, potentially, of the logic circuitry capacitance charged and discharged by the convention scan path. Further, configuring the same conventional scan path into a low power scan path comprising three separate scan paths may reduce power consumption by up to 66%, since, during operation, each of the three separate scan paths separately charge and discharge one third, potentially, of the logic capacitance charged and discharged by the convention scan path. Still further, configuring the same conventional scan path into a low power scan path comprising four separate scan paths may reduce power consumption by up to 75%, since, during operation, each of the four separate scan paths separately charge and discharge one fourth, potentially, the logic capacitance charged and discharged by the convention scan path. From this it is seen that the present disclosure allows a synthesis tool to be provided with the capability of scaling the power consumption of a given synthesized scan architecture to meet a desired low power mode of test operation of a circuit.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Scalable Scan Architecture Noise Reduction</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As can be anticipated from the description given for the present disclosure, the noise generated by logic circuitry being tested by the low power scan architecture decreases as the number of separate scan paths within the low power scan paths increases. For example, configuring a given conventional scan path into a low power scan path comprising two separate scan paths may reduce noise generation by up to 50%, since, during operation, each of the two separate scan paths separately activate only one half, potentially, of the logic circuitry activated by the conventional scan path. Further, configuring the same conventional scan path into a low power scan path comprising three separate scan paths may reduce noise generation by up to 66%, since, during operation, each of the three separate scan paths separately activate only one third, potentially, of the logic circuitry activated by the convention scan path.
