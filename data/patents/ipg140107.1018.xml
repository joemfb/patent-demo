<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Example conveyor systems are disclosed herein. An example conveyor system includes a main conveyor with a frame supporting at least one conveyor extension. Some conveyor extension examples include a powered conveyor belt supported by one or more conveyor sections that are articulated for assisting one or more workers in transferring items (e.g., boxes, parcels, luggage, parts, etc.) to and from the main conveyor. A single main conveyor supports two conveyor extensions mounted alongside each other with someone working at each extension to allow two workers to service a single main conveyor with minimal or no interference, thereby increasing the conveyor system's overall transfer rate. Example conveyor system disclosed herein includes various elements of positional adjustment (e.g., lateral, longitudinal, vertical, angular) to make the conveyor system particularly suited for transferring parcels between a loading dock and the interior of a truck, trailer, aircraft or container.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent generally pertains to conveyors and, more specifically, to adjustable conveyor extensions.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conveyors are mechanical devices that typically include a plurality of rollers (e.g., cylindrical or spherical rollers) that carry and transfer items over some distance or travel path. In some examples, the travel path across an upper conveying surface of the conveyor can be horizontal or at an incline (positive or negative slope). In some examples, the conveying surface is a powered belt for moving or transferring the items over some distance. In yet other cases, the conveying surface of some conveyors have powered rollers for moving the items, but other examples, the rollers are passive, free spinning rollers, where the items being transferred move along the travel path by gravity. In some cases, a moving belt overlays the rollers to help support the items on the conveyor. Conveyors are used in a wide variety of material handling applications such as for moving boxes, parcels, luggage, parts and other items.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-15</figref> show an example conveyor system <b>10</b> disclosed herein that includes an example main conveyor <b>12</b> with an example frame <b>14</b> supporting at least one example conveyor extension <b>16</b>. In some examples, conveyor extension <b>16</b> includes a powered conveyor belt system <b>18</b> (e.g., a first powered belt <b>18</b><i>a </i>or a second powered belt <b>18</b><i>b</i>) supported by one or more conveyor sections <b>20</b> that are articulated or otherwise adjustably movable for assisting one or more workers <b>22</b> in transferring items <b>24</b> (e.g., boxes, parcels, luggage, parts, etc.) to and from main conveyor <b>12</b>, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>. The belt system <b>18</b>, the conveyor extensions <b>16</b> and/or the conveyor sections <b>20</b> provide a continuous or smooth transition when transferring items <b>24</b> between the main conveyor <b>12</b> and the conveyor extension <b>16</b> (e.g., distal ends of the conveyor extension <b>16</b>). When a single main conveyor (e.g., the main conveyor <b>12</b>) supports two conveyor extensions <b>16</b> (e.g., conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>) mounted alongside each other with someone working at each extension, such an arrangement allows two workers <b>22</b> to service a single main conveyor with minimal or no interference, thereby increasing the conveyor system's overall transfer rate or efficiency. In the illustrated example, positional adjustment (e.g., lateral, longitudinal, vertical, angular) of various elements of the conveyor system <b>10</b> (e.g., the main conveyor <b>12</b>, the conveyor extension <b>16</b>, etc.) make conveyor system <b>10</b> particularly suited for transferring parcels between a loading dock <b>26</b> (or some other area) and the interior of a truck, trailer, aircraft or container; all of which will be referred to hereinafter as a container <b>28</b>. For example, the main conveyor <b>12</b> may be adjustable (e.g., laterally, longitudinally, vertically, angularly) relative to a floor of the container <b>28</b>. Additionally or alternatively, conveyor extension <b>16</b> can be adjustable (e.g., laterally, longitudinally, vertically, angularly) relative to a floor of the container <b>28</b> and/or the main conveyor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">For the illustrated example, main conveyor <b>12</b> includes frame <b>14</b> supporting a continuous conveyor belt <b>30</b> (e.g., a powered main belt) that has a first conveying or upper traveling surface <b>32</b> for moving items <b>24</b> along the main conveyor <b>12</b>. Frame <b>14</b> has a length <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>) extending along a longitudinal centerline <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>) from a back end <b>38</b> to a front end <b>40</b>. Although in some examples the main conveyor frame <b>14</b> is of a fixed length, in this particular example, length <b>34</b> is adjustable by virtue of frame <b>14</b> being telescopic. Examples of such extendable telescopic conveyors are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,643,299; 5,796,052 and 7,168,555, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. In some examples, main conveyor <b>12</b> includes a base <b>42</b> and/or other features that enable main conveyor <b>12</b> to be adjustable vertically (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>) and adjustable laterally (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>) relative to, for example, a floor of the container <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Although in some examples, only a single conveyor extension <b>16</b> is mounted to main conveyor <b>12</b>, the illustrated example shows an adaptor plate <b>44</b> to hold two conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>to frame <b>14</b> of main conveyor <b>12</b>. Adaptor plate <b>44</b>, main conveyor <b>12</b> and conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>include various features that make conveyor system <b>10</b> adjustable and movable, as indicated by the arrows shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and described below.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Arrows <b>46</b> and <b>48</b>, for instance, indicate lateral adjustment of conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>. In some examples, lateral movement <b>46</b> and <b>48</b> of the conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>is achieved through rotational movement <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> about respective vertical axis <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>, where each rotational movement <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> is enabled by a swivel joint <b>58</b> (e.g., a thrust bearing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) between adaptor plate <b>44</b> and a proximal conveyor section <b>60</b> of each conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>. Arrows <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> indicate vertical adjustment of a distal conveyor section <b>66</b> of each conveyor extension <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>relative to the centerline <b>36</b> and/or the floor of the container <b>28</b>. Arrows <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, and <b>72</b> represent belt movement of main conveyor <b>12</b>, conveyor extension <b>16</b><i>a </i>and conveyor extension <b>16</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Arrows <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> represent respective vertical, lateral and longitudinal adjustment of the main conveyor's front end <b>40</b>. Arrows <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> represent upward pivotal movement of a transition conveyor <b>84</b> of each of the conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The foregoing adjustments and movements provide conveyor system <b>10</b> with various configurations or positions to accommodate for different loading/unloading operations.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows main conveyor <b>12</b> retracted with conveyor extension <b>16</b> in a compact, or retracted configuration, which places conveyor system <b>10</b> is a stored configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows main conveyor <b>12</b> protruding through a doorway <b>86</b> and partially extending into container <b>28</b>, where conveyor system <b>10</b> is properly situated to receive or unload items <b>24</b> in the container <b>28</b> (e.g., near the center of container <b>28</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows main conveyor <b>12</b> extending fully into container <b>28</b>, wherein conveyor system <b>10</b> is properly situated to receive or unload items <b>24</b>, for example, near the front of container <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows front end <b>40</b> of main conveyor <b>12</b> elevated for accessing items <b>24</b> that are stacked higher relative to the upper surface <b>32</b> of the main conveyor <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows front end <b>40</b> of main conveyor <b>12</b> lowered for accessing items <b>24</b> that are, for example, near a floor of container <b>28</b> (e.g., stacked vertically lower relative to the upper surface <b>32</b> of the main conveyor <b>12</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows main conveyor <b>12</b> extending partway into container <b>28</b> with distal conveyor section <b>16</b> raised for accessing a high stack of items <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> but shows distal conveyor section <b>16</b> at an intermediate height for accessing items <b>24</b> stacked at a medium height. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows distal conveyor section <b>16</b> set at a lower height for receiving or unloading items <b>24</b> that are near the floor of container <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows each of the conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>adjusted laterally outward so they diverge to reach items <b>24</b> at opposite sides of container <b>28</b> relative to the centerline <b>36</b>. Specifically, each of the conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>defines (i.e., their own) respective longitudinal centerlines <b>88</b><i>a </i>and <b>88</b><i>b </i>that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> are shown to be laterally displaced out of parallel alignment with each other and are also laterally displaced out of parallel alignment with the main conveyor's longitudinal centerline <b>36</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also shows two workers <b>22</b> each using their own conveyor extension <b>16</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows conveyor extensions <b>16</b> adjusted laterally inward so both conveyor extensions <b>16</b> are conveniently positioned for receiving or unloading items <b>24</b> near the main conveyor's longitudinal centerline <b>36</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows main conveyor <b>12</b> adjusted laterally to one side of container <b>28</b> having the centerline <b>88</b><i>b </i>of conveyor extension <b>16</b><i>b </i>in parallel alignment with centerline <b>36</b>, while conveyor extension <b>16</b><i>a </i>is adjusted laterally outward toward items <b>24</b> near the other side of container <b>28</b> so that its centerline <b>88</b><i>a </i>is out of parallel alignment relative to centerline <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the actual construction of conveyor extensions <b>16</b> may vary, some examples of conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-15</figref>. For the illustrated example, each of the conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>comprises proximal conveyor section <b>60</b>. A swivel joint <b>58</b> rotatably couples proximal conveyor section <b>60</b> to adaptor plate <b>44</b>. A drive unit <b>90</b> adjusts, rotates or swivels proximal conveyor section <b>60</b> about swivel joint <b>58</b>. An intermediate conveyor section <b>92</b> pivotally couples distal conveyor section <b>66</b> to proximal conveyor section <b>60</b>. An actuator <b>94</b> (e.g., a hydraulic cylinder, pneumatic cylinder, electric motor, hydraulic motor, pneumatic motor, etc.) vertically pivots intermediate conveyor section <b>92</b> so as to adjust the elevation (e.g., a vertical height) of distal conveyor section <b>66</b>. The intermediate conveyor section <b>92</b> provides a substantially smooth or continuous transition or travel path between the upper surface <b>32</b> of the main conveyor <b>12</b> and the distal conveyor section <b>66</b> as items <b>24</b> move or travel between the upper surface <b>32</b> of the main conveyor and the distal conveyor section <b>66</b> when the distal conveyor section <b>66</b> is elevated (e.g., raised or lowered) relative to the upper surface <b>32</b> of the main conveyor <b>12</b> and/or when the distal conveyor section <b>66</b> (e.g., upper surface of belt <b>18</b>) is substantially parallel to the upper surface <b>32</b> of the main conveyor <b>12</b>. As shown, the conveyor system <b>10</b> as includes a transition conveyor section <b>84</b> to provide a transition (e.g., a smooth or continuous transition) between proximal conveyor section <b>60</b> and main conveyor belt <b>30</b> and the powered belt system <b>18</b> (e.g., a secondary powered belt system) running across proximal conveyor section <b>60</b>, intermediate conveyor section <b>92</b> and distal conveyor section <b>66</b>. Further structural and functional details of conveyor extension <b>16</b> are as follows. The transition conveyor section <b>84</b> may include rollers, a belt, or any other conveying surface.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Powered belt system <b>18</b>, in some examples, is one continuous belt driven by a suitable drive(s). In other examples, powered belt system <b>18</b> may include individual belts for each of proximal conveyor section <b>60</b>, intermediate conveyor section <b>92</b> and distal conveyor section <b>66</b>, all of which are driven by any suitable drive(s). Examples of such drive(s) include, but are not limited to, an electric motor; a hydraulic motor; a pneumatic motor; and a mechanical transmission or drive train coupling the movement of main belt <b>30</b>, its rollers, and/or its drive unit to the conveyor extension's belt system <b>18</b> or its rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As for adjustably rotating the conveyor extension <b>16</b> about its respective swivel joint <b>58</b>, drive unit <b>90</b> is schematically illustrated to represent any suitable adjustor or drive system for adjusting the lateral position of each distal conveyer section <b>16</b>. Examples of drive unit <b>90</b> include, but are not limited to, a chain or belt coupling swivel joint <b>58</b> to an output shaft <b>96</b> of a motor <b>98</b>, a motor/cam arrangement, a hydraulic cylinder, a mechanical linkage, and various combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, transition conveyor section <b>84</b> extends out over main conveyor belt <b>30</b> and comprises a series of passive rollers <b>100</b>. The term, &#x201c;passive&#x201d; as it relates to rollers <b>100</b> means that rollers <b>100</b> are free spinning rather than powered. In some examples, rollers <b>100</b> are cylindrical, and in other examples rollers <b>100</b> are spherical. In some examples, transition conveyor section <b>84</b> includes powered rollers and/or a powered belt.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, proximal conveyor section <b>60</b>, intermediate conveyor section <b>92</b> and distal conveyor section <b>66</b> are pivotally interconnected to provide a controlled articulated assembly, wherein the angular relationship between distal conveyor section <b>66</b> and proximal conveyor section <b>60</b> remains generally constant as actuator <b>94</b> adjusts the height of distal conveyor section <b>66</b>. In some examples, proximal conveyor section <b>60</b> and distal conveyor section <b>66</b> remain substantially parallel to each other to ensure a smooth transition as items <b>24</b> travel between them. Further, in some examples, the distal conveyor section <b>66</b> can be positioned substantially parallel or horizontal relative to the proximal conveyor section <b>60</b> and/or the floor of, for example, the container <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To maintaining a desired angular relationship between proximal conveyor section <b>60</b> and distal conveyor section <b>66</b> (with an intermediate conveyor section <b>92</b>&#x2032; therebetween), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a non-rotating sprocket <b>102</b> is attached to a proximal conveyor section <b>66</b>&#x2032;, another non-rotating sprocket <b>102</b> is affixed to a distal conveyor section <b>66</b>&#x2032;, and a roller chain <b>104</b> couples the two sprockets <b>102</b> to each other. Such an arrangement maintains a fixed angular relationship between the two sprockets <b>102</b>, which in turn maintains a fixed angular relationship between proximal conveyor section <b>60</b>&#x2032; and distal conveyor section <b>66</b>&#x2032;. In other examples, cogged wheels replace sprockets <b>102</b>, and a cogged belt replaces roller chain <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows another example of mechanism to maintain a desired angular relationship between a proximal conveyor section <b>60</b>&#x2033; and a distal conveyor section <b>60</b>&#x2032; (with an intermediate conveyor section <b>92</b>&#x2033; therebetween). In this example, proximal conveyor section <b>60</b>&#x2033;, distal conveyor section <b>66</b>&#x2033;, and links <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are pivotally interconnected to create a 4-bar parallelogram linkage that maintains distal conveyor section <b>60</b>&#x2033; parallel to proximal conveyor section <b>60</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples where two conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are attached to main conveyor <b>12</b>, the vertical and lateral adjustment of the two conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>are controlled independently. This allows one distal conveyor section <b>66</b> to be positioned at a first elevation (e.g., a higher vertical position) relative to the other one of the conveyor extensions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows both distal conveyor sections <b>66</b> at substantially the same position (e.g., the same vertical or upper height) (distal conveyor section <b>66</b><i>b </i>is hidden behind section <b>66</b><i>a</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows distal conveyor section <b>66</b><i>a </i>at a first position (e.g., a vertical position that is higher or) different than the position (e.g., the vertical position) of distal conveyor section <b>66</b><i>b </i>with distal conveyor section <b>66</b><i>a </i>being above the height of main conveyor <b>12</b> and distal conveyor section <b>66</b><i>b </i>being below main conveyor <b>12</b> (distal section <b>66</b><i>a </i>is at a first upper height, and distal section <b>66</b><i>b </i>is at a second lower height). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows distal conveyor section <b>66</b><i>b </i>positioned higher than distal conveyor section <b>66</b><i>a </i>with distal conveyor section <b>66</b><i>b </i>being above the height of main conveyor <b>12</b> and distal conveyor section <b>66</b><i>a </i>being below main conveyor <b>12</b> (distal section <b>66</b><i>b </i>is at a second upper height, and distal section <b>66</b><i>a </i>is at a first lower height). It should be noted that as each conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>moves between a first or upper height and a second or lower height, intermediate conveyor section <b>92</b> tilts or moves more than either proximal conveyor section <b>60</b> and distal conveyor section <b>66</b>, thereby ensuring a smooth transfer of items <b>24</b> across conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>or <b>16</b><i>b </i>regardless of the position or height of distal conveyor section <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, to control the various movements and adjustments of conveyor system <b>10</b>, a controller <b>110</b> is mounted near each conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>. In some examples, a comparable controller provides at least one worker <b>22</b> with wireless remote control. In some examples, each worker <b>22</b> has ready access to their own controller for independently controlling a chosen one of the conveyor extensions <b>16</b><i>a </i>or <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p>
