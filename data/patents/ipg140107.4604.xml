<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to Korean Patent Applications filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Sep. 28, 2009 and Sep. 27, 2010, and assigned Serial Nos. 10-2009-0092047 and 10-2010-0093476, respectively, the entire disclosure of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a transmission/reception apparatus and method for improving throughput in a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Next-generation communication systems have introduced MIMO to increase the capacity of wireless channels operated with limited frequency resources. The widely used Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Wireless Broadband (WiBro) standards are based on MIMO.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, the next-generation communication systems increase spectral efficiency or frequency efficiency by adaptively allocating a modulation order and an error-correcting code to channels between a transmitter and a receiver based on Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC). Meanwhile, to increase the system throughput by improving reception performance, the receiver takes advantage of Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) that uses decoding results of one transport layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a transmitter structure for large-delay Cyclic Delay Diversity (CDD) precoding in a MIMO communication system. The large-delay CDD is reflected in or applied to open loop spatial multiplexing, and this technology decentralizes a transport layer to all virtual antennas, contributing to a reduction in the amount of Channel Quality Information (CQI) or feedback information and the robustness of its accurate feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transmitter includes a Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selector <b>101</b>, a first Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) error adder <b>103</b>, a first Forward Error Correction (FFC) encoder <b>105</b>, a first modulator <b>107</b>, a resource allocator <b>109</b>, a first Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit <b>111</b>, a Serial-to-Parallel (S/P) converter <b>113</b>, a second CRC error adder <b>115</b>, a third CRC error adder <b>117</b>, a second FEC encoder <b>119</b>, a third FEC encoder <b>121</b>, a first rate matcher <b>123</b>, a second rate matcher <b>125</b>, a second modulator <b>127</b>, a third modulator <b>129</b>, a precoder <b>131</b>, and a second IFFT unit <b>133</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Upon receipt of CQI feedback information <b>100</b> of each user, the MCS selector <b>101</b> determines an MCS level for each user's transport block based on the received CQI feedback information <b>100</b>, and then outputs the MCS level to the first CRC error adder <b>103</b>, an FEC encoding block <b>118</b>, a rate-matching block <b>122</b>, and a modulation block <b>126</b>. As used herein, the transport block represents an independent information block undergoing encoding. It is assumed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that there are two transport blocks and the transport blocks are equivalent to a codeword.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first CRC error adder <b>103</b> generates a control signal to be transmitted to a receiver by integrating the MCS level of each user's transport block and each user's control information <b>110</b>, adds to the control signal a CRC code for detecting an error occurring in a transmission process, and outputs the CRC-added control signal to the first FEC encoder <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first FEC encoder <b>105</b> receives a signal output from the first CRC error adder <b>103</b>, performs thereon FEC encoding for correcting an error occurring due to noise, using an FEC code, and outputs the FEC-encoded signal to the first modulator <b>107</b>. There is no limit on the type of the FEC code. Generally, convolutional codes or trellis codes may be used as an FEC code for CQI feedback information.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first modulator <b>107</b> receives a signal output from the first FEC encoder <b>105</b>, maps the received signal to a signal constellation point, and outputs the mapped signal to the resource allocator <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Meanwhile, upon receipt of each user's traffic information <b>102</b>, the S/P converter <b>113</b> divides the received traffic information <b>102</b> into N pieces of traffic information, where N is the number (i.e., two) of each user's transport blocks, and outputs the divided two pieces of traffic information to the second and third CRC error adders <b>115</b> and <b>117</b>, respectively. The second and third CRC error adders <b>115</b> and <b>117</b> add to their input signals a CRC code for detecting an error occurring in the transmission process, and output the CRC-added signals to the second and third FEC encoders <b>119</b> and <b>121</b>, respectively. The second and third FEC encoders <b>119</b> and <b>121</b> receive signals output from the second and third CRC error adders <b>115</b> and <b>117</b>, respectively, perform thereon FEC encoding for correcting errors due to noise, using an FEC code, and output the FEC-encoded signals to the first and second rate matchers <b>123</b> and <b>125</b>, respectively. As stated above, there is no limit on the type of the FEC code. Generally, convolutional codes, turbo codes, or Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes may be used as an FEC code for traffic information.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first and second rate matchers <b>123</b> and <b>125</b> receive signals output from the second and third FEC encoders <b>119</b> and <b>121</b>, respectively, perform thereon rate matching so that the number of bits of the input signals may be matched to the number of modulation symbols allocated to each user, and output the rate-matched signals to the second and third modulators <b>127</b> and <b>129</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The second and third modulators <b>127</b> and <b>129</b> receive signals output from the first and second rate matchers <b>123</b> and <b>125</b>, respectively, map the received signals to a signal constellation point, and output the mapped signals to the precoder <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The precoder <b>131</b> receives each of the signals output from the second and third modulators <b>127</b> and <b>129</b>, generates a traffic channel signal by precoding the received signals according to a predetermined rule, for example, large-delay CDD, and outputs the traffic channel signal to the resource allocator <b>109</b>. A modulation order used in the second and third modulators <b>127</b> and <b>129</b> is determined depending on the MCS level selected by the MCS selector <b>101</b>, and the CRC error adders, the FEC encoders and the modulators used for the CQI feedback information <b>100</b> and the traffic information <b>102</b> are generally different from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The resource allocator <b>109</b> reorders a traffic channel signal, a control channel signal and a pilot signal, adjusts power levels of respective channels according to the power ratio capable of guaranteeing reception performance of the channels, applies the adjusted power levels to the reordered signals, and outputs the power-adjusted signals to the first and second IFFT units <b>111</b> and <b>133</b>. The first and second IFFT units <b>111</b> and <b>133</b> transform frequency-domain signals output from the resource allocator <b>109</b> into time-domain signals, and output the time-domain signals via their transmit antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a structure of a receiver, which corresponds to the transmitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and to which SIC is applied (hereinafter referred to as an &#x201c;SIC receiver&#x201d;), in a MIMO communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the SIC receiver includes a first Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) unit <b>201</b>, a second FFT unit <b>203</b>, a resource deallocator <b>205</b>, a layer ordering unit <b>207</b>, an equivalent channel generator <b>209</b>, a MIMO demodulator <b>211</b>, a rate dematcher <b>213</b>, an FEC decoder <b>215</b>, a CRC error detector <b>217</b>, a control channel detector <b>219</b>, a CQI metric generator <b>221</b>, a CQI generator <b>223</b>, an FEC encoder <b>231</b>, a rate matcher <b>233</b>, and a modulator <b>235</b>. The components other than the CQI metric generator <b>221</b> and the CQI generator <b>223</b> may be called a &#x201c;signal receiver&#x201d; since they are for signal reception.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first and second FFT units <b>201</b> and <b>203</b> transform time-domain signals received via their receive antennas, into frequency-domain signals, and output the frequency-domain signals to the resource deallocator <b>205</b>. The resource deallocator <b>205</b> separates signals output from the first and second FFT units <b>201</b> and <b>203</b> into a traffic channel signal and a control channel signal, and outputs the traffic channel signal to the MIMO demodulator <b>211</b> through the equivalent channel generator <b>209</b> and the control channel signal to the control channel detector <b>219</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The control channel detector <b>219</b> detects an MCS level for each user's transport block, resource allocation information of the traffic channel, the number of transport layers, necessity of retransmission, etc., which are needed for the reception of the traffic channel signal, using the control channel signal and channel estimate output from the resource deallocator <b>205</b>, and delivers the detected information to the blocks requiring the information. In particular, the control channel detector <b>219</b> detects the MCS level for each user's transport block, and outputs the detected MCS level to the resource deallocator <b>205</b>, the MIMO demodulator <b>211</b>, the rate dematcher <b>213</b> and the FEC decoder <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The layer ordering unit <b>207</b> determines one of the two transport blocks carrying traffic channel signals, which is to be decoded first. Generally, the layer ordering unit <b>207</b> determines the channel status for each of transport blocks, using an equivalent channel value output from the equivalent channel generator <b>209</b>, a Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR) value output from the MIMO demodulator <b>211</b>, and error detection results output from the CRC error detector <b>217</b>, and determines a decoding order so that transport blocks may be decoded in order of better channel status. The equivalent channel generator <b>209</b> reflects in the equivalent channel value the result caused by precoding the transmission signal by large-delay CDD in accordance with a predetermined rule, based on the number of transport layers, detected by the control channel detector <b>219</b>, and the resource allocation information for the traffic channel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For a transport block that is determined to be decoded first in the decoding order by the layer ordering unit <b>207</b>, the MIMO demodulator <b>211</b> receives an equivalent channel value of the equivalent channel generator <b>209</b> and a received signal on the traffic channel, generates an LLR value using a MIMO receive algorithm, and outputs the generated LLR to the rate dematcher <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The rate dematcher <b>213</b> receives a signal output from the MIMO demodulator <b>211</b>, and performs rate dematching on the received signal, and the FEC decoder <b>215</b> FEC-decodes the rate-dematched signal, and outputs the FEC-decoded signal to the CRC error detector <b>217</b>. The CRC error detector <b>217</b> detects an error occurring in the transmission process from the signal decoded by the FEC decoder <b>215</b> using the CRC technique, and determines necessity of retransmission. If no error is detected, the CRC error detector <b>217</b> delivers the decoded signal to an upper layer. The MIMO receive algorithm may include a linear receive algorithm based on Minimum Mean Square Examination (MMSE) or QR decomposition, and an algorithm based on Maximum Likelihood (ML).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If no CRC error is detected in the first decoded transport block, an LLR value for a transport block that is determined to be decoded next, i.e., secondly, in the decoding order by the layer ordering unit <b>207</b>, may be generated by a regeneration block <b>230</b>. That is, if a transmission signal for the first decoded transport block is generated and delivered to the MIMO demodulator <b>211</b>, then the MIMO demodulator <b>211</b> generates an LLR value for a second transport block by removing the transmission signal for the first decoded transport block from the received signal on the traffic channel, and outputs the generated LLR to the rate dematcher <b>213</b>. The rate dematcher <b>213</b> receives a signal output from the MIMO demodulator <b>211</b> and performs rate dematching on the received signal, and the FEC decoder <b>215</b> FEC-decodes the rate-dematched signal and outputs the FEC-decoded signal to the CRC error detector <b>217</b>. The CRC error detector <b>217</b> detects an error occurring in the transmission process from the signal decoded by the FEC decoder <b>215</b> using the CRC technique, and determines necessity of retransmission. If no error is detected, the CRC error detector <b>217</b> delivers the decoded signal to the upper layer.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is assumed herein that no CRC error is detected in the first decoded transport block. In this way, if no CRC error is detected in the first decoded transport block, the transmission signal for the first decoded transport block is removed from the received signal on the traffic channel using the regeneration block <b>230</b>, and this scheme is called &#x201c;SIC scheme.&#x201d; If a CRC error is detected in the first decoded transport block, an LLR value of a second decoded transport block is also generated in the same method as the first decoded transport block.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The CQI metric generator <b>221</b> generally estimates a CQI metric value such as an effective Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) using the equivalent channel value output from the equivalent channel generator <b>209</b>, and outputs the estimated CQI metric value to the CQI generator <b>223</b>. While it is assumed herein that the CQI metric value is generated using the equivalent channel value, the CQI metric value may be generated using the LLR value output from the MIMO demodulator <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The CQI generator <b>223</b> receives the CQI metric value output from the CQI metric generator <b>221</b>, quantizes the CQI metric value, and generates a CQI index to be reported to a transmitter. In generating the CQI index, the CQI generator <b>223</b> may use ACKnowledgement (ACK)/Negative ACKnowledgement (NACK) information received from the CRC error detector <b>217</b>. The generated CQI index is fed back to the transmitter along with feedback information.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As can be understood from Equation (2), assuming that adjacent REs are the same in actual channel characteristic, since x<sub>1 </sub>and x<sub>2 </sub>undergo equivalent channel characteristics, the CQI feedback information being transmitted to the transmitter to which large-delay CDD is applied, carries only one value rather than carrying a separate value for each transport block. Therefore, in determining an MCS level for each transport block, the transmitter also determines the same MCS level for different transport blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">However, if every transport block has the same MCS level in the transmitter to which large-delay CDD is applied, the SIC receiver may disadvantageously fail to achieve its potential capabilities to improve throughput.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this specification, detailed descriptions will be made of an example of a transmission/reception apparatus and method for improving throughput in a MIMO communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, detailed description will be made of examples of a method for selecting an MCS level by a transmission apparatus to improve throughput in a MIMO communication system, and a method for generating a CQI to be fed back to the transmission apparatus by a reception apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In detailed descriptions of embodiments of the present invention, the examples of the transmission/reception apparatus and method will be applied to a MIMO communication system using the LTE standard, representing the latest version of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-family communication networks.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Embodiments of the present invention can all be applied to a precoding technique for allowing transport blocks to have the same equivalent channels, such as large-delay CDD of the LTE standard. In detailed descriptions of embodiments of the present invention, large-delay CDD of LTE will be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a comparison graph showing throughputs of a receiver using Modified Maximum Likelihood (MML) as a MIMO receive algorithm and a receiver using MML-SIC.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it can be understood that the throughput increases with a Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and the MML-SIC receiver has a higher throughput than the MML receiver. In order for the MML-SIC receiver to obtain the improved throughput, a transmitter should allocate different MCS levels to transport blocks according to characteristics of the MML-SIC receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a structure of a first transmitter proposed for throughput improvement in a MIMO communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first transmitter includes a receiver type estimator <b>401</b>, an MCS selector <b>403</b>, a first CRC error adder <b>405</b>, a first FEC encoder <b>407</b>, a first modulator <b>409</b>, a resource allocator <b>411</b>, a first IFFT unit <b>413</b>, an S/P converter <b>415</b>, a second CRC error adder <b>417</b>, a third CRC error adder <b>419</b>, a second FEC encoder <b>421</b>, a third FEC encoder <b>423</b>, a first rate matcher <b>425</b>, a second rate matcher <b>427</b>, a second modulator <b>429</b>, a third modulator <b>431</b>, a precoder <b>433</b>, and a second IFFT unit <b>435</b>. The S/P converter <b>415</b>, the second CRC error adder <b>417</b>, the third CRC error adder <b>419</b>, an FEC encoding block <b>420</b>, a rate matching block <b>424</b>, and a modulation block <b>428</b> may be referred to as a &#x201c;signal generator.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first transmitter is similar to the transmitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in structure except for the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> and the MCS selector <b>403</b>. Operating as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> determines whether a receive algorithm of each receiver is based on SIC, and delivers the determination results to the MCS selector <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows operations of the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> and the MCS selector <b>403</b> in the first transmitter for throughput improvement in a MIMO communication system, according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in step <b>501</b>, the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> measures throughput of the receiver when the same MCS level is allocated to respective transport blocks during a K<sub>1 </sub>subframe. In step <b>503</b>, the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> measures throughput of the receiver when different MCS levels are allocated to respective transport blocks during a K<sub>2 </sub>subframe. The transport blocks correspond to associated transport layers, and the K<sub>1 </sub>and K<sub>2 </sub>subframes refer to predetermined time periods.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To this end, the MCS selector <b>403</b> allocates the same MCS level to respective transport blocks, or respective transport layers, for the K<sub>1 </sub>subframe, and allocates different MCS levels to respective transport blocks, or respective transport layers, for the K<sub>2 </sub>subframe. To allocate different MCS levels to the transport blocks, the MCS selector <b>403</b> adjusts the MCS level by using, for example, an MCS offset table given for each user or each transport block, or ACK/NACK information received from the receiver. As another example, the MCS level may be adjusted using both the ACK/NACK information and the MCS offset table. The MCS offset table includes an offset value of another transport block against an MCS level value of one transport block.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step <b>505</b>, the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> compares an average throughput for the K<sub>1 </sub>subframe with an average throughput for the K<sub>2 </sub>subframe. If the average throughput for the K<sub>2 </sub>subframe is higher, the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> determines in step <b>507</b> that the receiver is an SIC receiver. However, if the average throughput for the K<sub>1 </sub>subframe is higher, the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> determines in step <b>509</b> that the receiver is a non-SIC receiver. Thus, through steps <b>501</b> to <b>509</b>, the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> determines the type of the receiver, and outputs the results to the MCS selector <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Based on the receiver type information received from the receiver type estimator <b>401</b>, if the receiver is an SIC receiver, the MCS selector <b>403</b> allocates different MCS levels to the transport blocks using an MCS offset table given to each user in step <b>511</b>. On the other hand, if the receiver is a non-SIC receiver, the MCS selector <b>403</b> allocates the same MCS level to the transport blocks in step <b>513</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To represent an MCS level for, for example, two transport blocks, the same number, 2, of bits may be used. Generally, however, since a difference between MCS level values of two transport blocks is less than a range of all MCS level values, the number of bits of a control signal in use may be reduced by differentially encoding each MCS level index. The differential encoding should be performed such that even with the reduced number of bits, it is enough to represent the modulation order used during retransmission in the case where Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) is used.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">So far, the first embodiment has been described, in which the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> determines the receiver type and delivers the results to the MCS selector <b>403</b>. An operation of the MCS selector <b>403</b>, which is performed based on the determined receiver type, is fixedly maintained for a predetermined time.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the first embodiment, the first transmitter allocates different MCS levels to transport blocks if the receiver type is an SIC receiver, and allocates the same MCS level to the transport blocks if the receiver type is a non-SIC receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">On the other hand, in a second embodiment, a description is made of a method for increasing a time period for which different MCS levels are allocated, if the receiver is an SIC receiver, and increasing a time period for which the same MCS level is allocated, if the receiver is a non-SIC receiver. That is, in the second embodiment, the receiver's throughput may be increased by adaptively adjusting a length of the period for which the same MCS level is allocated, and the period for which different MCS levels are allocated. In this case, the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> does not deliver the determined receiver type to the MCS selector <b>403</b>, and the MCS selector <b>403</b> adaptively adjusts a length of each period and allocates an MCS level.</p>

The MCS selector <b>403</b> compares an average throughput of the receiver for the K<sub>1 </sub>subframe with an average throughput of the receiver for the K<sub>2 </sub>subframe in step <b>605</b>. If the average throughput for the K<sub>1 </sub>subframe is higher, the MCS selector <b>403</b> increases a ratio of the K<sub>1 </sub>subframe by a predetermined value in step <b>607</b>, and then returns to step <b>601</b>. However, if the average throughput for the K<sub>2 </sub>subframe is higher, the MCS selector <b>403</b> increases a ratio of the K<sub>2 </sub>subframe by a predetermined value in step <b>609</b>, and then returns to step <b>601</b>. Although not shown, if the average throughput for the K<sub>1 </sub>subframe is equal to the average throughput for the K<sub>2 </sub>subframe, the MCS selector <b>403</b>, depending on the system, may proceed to any one of steps <b>607</b> and <b>609</b>, or may keep the current ratios of the subframes.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To summarize, as described in the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the MCS selector <b>403</b> allocates the same MCS level or different MCS levels to respective transport blocks using the receiver type that the receiver type estimator <b>401</b> determined based on average throughputs for the fixed K<sub>1 </sub>and K<sub>2 </sub>subframes.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the MCS selector <b>703</b> in the second transmitter receives, from a receiver, receiver type information <b>701</b> through an uplink (UL) upper-layer message in step <b>801</b>, and then proceeds to step <b>803</b>.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a structure of an SIC receiver for throughput improvement in a MIMO communication system, according to the third and fourth embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the SIC receiver includes a first FFT unit <b>1001</b>, a second FFT unit <b>1003</b>, a resource deallocator <b>1005</b>, a layer ordering unit <b>1007</b>, an equivalent channel generator <b>1009</b>, a MIMO demodulator <b>1011</b>, a rate dematcher <b>1013</b>, an FEC decoder <b>1015</b>, a CRC error detector <b>1017</b>, a control channel detector <b>1019</b>, a CQI metric generator <b>1021</b>, a CQI generator <b>1023</b>, an FEC encoder <b>1031</b>, a rate matcher <b>1033</b>, and a modulator <b>1035</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The SIC receiver is similar to the receiver of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in structure except a signal being input to the layer ordering unit <b>1007</b> and an operation of the layer ordering unit <b>1007</b>. Although not shown, the SIC receiver includes a type information generator for generating type information indicating that its receiver type is an SIC receiver, and the type information is transmitted to a transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Rather than determining decoding order of transport blocks depending on the channel status, the layer ordering unit <b>1007</b> determines the decoding order using an MCS level specific to each user's transport block, received from the control channel detector <b>1019</b> so that transport blocks may be decoded in order of lower MCS level. That is, a transport block with the lowest MCS level is decoded first. If a transport block with a low MCS level among transport blocks having equivalent channels is decoded first, an error rate of the first decoded transport block decreases. Therefore, it is highly likely to remove a transmission signal associated with the first transport block from the received signal, resulting in an increase in gain of the SIC receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Meanwhile, the decoding order is determined according to whether a transport block is an initial transport block or a retransmission transport block, as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In a first case, if the transport blocks are all initial transport blocks, the transport blocks are decoded in order of the lowest MCS level. If a transport block with the lowest MCS level among transport blocks having equivalent channels is decoded first, an error rate of the first decoded transport block decreases. Hence, it is highly likely to remove a transmission signal associated with the first decoded transport block from the received signal, contributing to an increase in gain of the SIC receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In a second case, if the transport blocks are all retransmission transport blocks, the retransmission transport blocks are decoded in order of their initial transport blocks having a low MCS level.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In a third case, if transport blocks include an initial transport block and a retransmission transport block, the retransmission transport block is decoded first compared with the initial transport block. If there are multiple initial transport blocks, the transport blocks are decoded in order of low MCS level as in the first case, and if there are multiple retransmission transport blocks, the retransmission transport blocks are decoded in order of their initial transport blocks having a low MCS level as in the second case.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Meanwhile, there is a limit on utilization of the SIC receiver if CQI feedback information is reported only for one transport block as in the prior art in a transceiver to which large-delay CDD is applied. If it is possible to report CQI feedback information for each of two transport blocks as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the CQI metric generator <b>1021</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> generates a CQI of the transport block to be decoded first in the same way as the existing method, but it should generate a CQI of the transport to be decoded second using Equations (3) and (4) below. Since the transport blocks have equivalent channel characteristics, Equations (3) and (4) have the same value.

</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">If it is possible to feed back a CQI for each of transport blocks having equivalent channel characteristics such as Equations (3) and (4), the transmitter can determine MCS levels of the transport blocks using only the CQI feedback information without using the MCS offset table. Specifically, if the number of bits used to report the CQI feedback information is set the same as the prior art, CQI feedback information for transport blocks may be reported in an alternative way only when the receiver type is an SIC receiver.</p>
