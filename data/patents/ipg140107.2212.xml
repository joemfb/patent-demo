<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to treatment of lesions of pathological angiogenesis, especially tumors, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and angiomas. Aspects of the present invention employ a conjugate or fusion of a molecule that exerts a biocidal or cytotoxic effect on target cells in the lesions and an antibody directed against an extracellular matrix component which is present in such lesions. In preferred embodiments, the antibody is directed against fibronectin ED-B. Preferred embodiments of the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule include interleukin-2 (IL-2), doxorubicin, interleukin-12 (IL-12), Interferon-&#x3b3; (IFN-&#x3b3;), Tumor Necrosis Factor &#x3b1; (TNF&#x3b1;) also, especially with the L19 antibody (see below), tissue factor (preferably truncated). By targeting bioactive molecules to an extracellular matrix component, killing of target cells may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Tumors cannot grow beyond a certain mass without the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and a correlation between microvessel density and tumor invasiveness has been reported for a number of tumors (1). Molecules capable of selectively targeting markers of angiogenesis create clinical opportunities for the diagnosis and therapy of tumors and other diseases characterized by vascular proliferation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (2-8).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The ED-B domain of fibronectin, a sequence of 91 amino acids identical in mice, rats and humans, which is inserted by alternative splicing into the fibronectin molecule, specifically accumulates around neovascular structures and represents a target for molecular intervention (9-11). Using a human recombinant antibody (L19) to the ED-B domain the possibility of in vivo neovasculature targeting has been demonstrated in different tumor models (12,13).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is based on the inventors' experimental work employing an antibody directed against the ED-B domain of fibronectin, found in angiogenesis in pathological lesions such as tumors, conjugated with molecules that exert biocidal or cytotoxic effects on target cells. Some such molecules may interact with a membrane-bound receptor on the target cell or perturb the electrochemical potential of the cell membrane. Exemplary molecules demonstrated experimentally herein include interleukin-2 (IL-2), tissue factor, doxorubicin, interleukin-12 (IL-12), Interferon-&#x3b3; (IFN-&#x3b3;) and Tumor Necrosis Factor &#x3b1; (TNF&#x3b1;).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Interleukin-2 (IL-2), a four a helix bundle cytokine produced by T helper 1 cells, plays an essential role in the activation phases of both specific and natural immune responses (14). IL-2 promotes proliferation and differentiation of activated T and B lymphocytes and of natural killer (NK) cells, and induces cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity and NK/lymphokine activated killer (LAK) antitumor cytotoxicity. IL-2 has been used in immunotherapy approaches of several human tumors (15). Administration of recombinant IL-2 (rIL2) alone or in combination with adoptively transferred lymphoid cells has resulted in the regression of established tumors in both animal models and patients. However, its in vivo therapeutic efficacy is limited by its rapid clearance and, at high doses, by a severe toxicity mainly related to a vascular leak syndrome (16). Delivery of IL-2 to the tumor site by means of an antibody directed against a cell-surface tumor marker may allow achievement of active local concentrations of IL-2, as well as reducing toxicities associated to systemic administration (17).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, the present invention diverges in a novel and unobvious way from the referenced prior art by conjugating IL-2 to an antibody directed to an extracellular matrix component, which component is present in angiogenesis in pathological lesions. As noted, in the prior art attempts to employ IL-2 in treatment of tumors by delivery using an antibody, the antibody has been directed against a cell-surface tumor marker. However, tumor cells present a great heterogeneity in expression of cell surface tumor markers, and may be down-regulated during therapies.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The presence of IL-2 bound at a tumor cell surface results in activation and/or targeting of effector cells of the immune system, either CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells or natural killer (NK) cells, and in the induction of an efficient anti-tumor immune response. T or NK cells receive one signal through receptor(s) (for instance T-cell receptor for T cells) specifically recognizing appropriate ligands at the tumor cell surface, and a second signal through IL-2 receptor chains by IL-2, also localized at the tumor cell surface (Lode et al., 1999, <i>PNAS USA, </i>96: 8591-8596 and references therein).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Differently, in the experiments described in more detail below, the inventors constructed and expressed in mammalian cells an antibody-IL2 fusion protein, the antibody (L19, of which the sequence is disclosed in Pini et al. (1998) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>273: 21769-21776) being directed against a component of the extracellular matrix present in angiogenesis in pathological lesions (in particular fibronectin ED-B). In vivo biodistribution experiments in tumor bearing mice demonstrated accumulation of the fusion protein around new forming tumor blood vessels. The fusion protein was tested in therapeutic experiments in tumor bearing animals and surprisingly found to induce an antitumor effect and to be significantly more active in reducing tumor growth than an equimolar mixture of L19 and IL-2.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Tissue factor is a component of the blood coagulation cascade, normally present in a membrane-anchored form in the adventitia of blood vessels and therefore not accessible to other components of the blood coagulation cascade. When blood vessels are damaged (e.g. in a wound), tissue factor becomes accessible and, upon binding to Factor VIIa, starts a series of biochemical processes which result in blood clot formation. The truncated form of TF (residues 1-219) is significantly less active in promoting blood coagulation and can therefore be injected systemically either alone, or bound to a monoclonal antibody.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thorpe and colleagues have demonstrated in an artificial system the principle of selective intraluminal blood coagulation in tumoral blood vessels, resulting in tumor infarction and subsequent tumor cell death (X. Huang et al. (1997) <i>Science, </i>275, 547-550). The authors subcutaneously implanted tumor cells, engineered to secrete interferon gamma and therefore to up-regulate MHC-II expression on the luminal surface of surrounding (tumoral) blood vessels. By doing so, they created an artificial marker of angiogenesis which could be used for molecular intervention. The authors then injected these tumor-bearing mice with bispecific antibodies, capable of simultaneous binding to a truncated form of tissue factor (TF) and to MHC-II, precomplexed with TF. This macromolecular complex (Acoaguligand@) mediated the rapid tumor infarction and complete remission in some of the tumor-bearing mice treated.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a second experimental system, Thorpe and colleagues used as therapeutic agent a monoclonal antibody specific for the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), chemically cross-linked to TF (Ran et al. (1998) <i>Cancer Res., </i>58, 4646-4653). As tumor model, the authors chose SCID mice bearing a human L540 Hodgkin's tumors. A 50% reduction in tumor growth rate was observed. Based on their observations, the authors concluded that the selective thrombotic action on tumor and not normal cells resulted from a requirement for coincident expression of the target molecule VCAM-1 and PS on the tumor endothelial cell surface. This provided expectation that the selective thromobotic action would occur only if coaguiligands are delivered to the luminal side of new blood vessels and only if these blood vessels display PS on their luminal side.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">US patents U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,555 and 5,877,289 describe work by Thorpe with tissue factor.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present inventors have now found that tissue factor delivered to the extracellular matrix of pathological lesions, e.g. tumors, is surprisingly able to mediate a biocidal effect (e.g. on tumor cells), specifically infarction, especially when fused to an L19 antibody molecule (see below). In accordance with the present invention, tissue factor (preferably truncated as is known in the art) is provided as a conjugate or fusion with a specific binding member directed to a component of the extracellular matrix found in lesions of pathological angiogenesis, e.g. fibronectin ED-B or tenascin-C.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Doxorubicin (doxo) is one of the most effective anti-cancer drugs used to treat cancer and one of a few chemotherapeutic agents known to have antiangiogenic activity. However, doxorubicin has no cytotoxic activity when bound to antibodies directed against tumor-associated markers on the cell membrane which do not internalise (Chari (1998) <i>Advanced Drug Delivery </i>31, 89-104). Conjugates of doxorubicin and a rapidly internalising antibody directed against tumour-associated markers expressed on the surface of tumour cells have been shown to have an anti-tumour effect (R. V. J. Chari, 1998).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present inventors have, differently, targeted doxorubicin to the extracellular matrix of lesions, e.g. tumors, by conjugation with a specific binding member directed against a component of the extracellular matrix. In a preferred embodiment demonstrated experimentally herein, the inventors conjugated doxorubicin to an antibody fragment directed against fibronectin ED-B by means of a cleavable linker, allowing for slow release of the doxorubicin. The experiments demonstrate a therapeutic effect. Unlike other approaches, this cleavage occurs in the extracellular milieu, and does not rely on internalisation and/or proteolytic cleavage.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">IL-12 is a heterodimeric protein composed of a 40 kD (p40) subunit and a 35 kD (p35) subunit. IL-12 is produced by macrophages and B lymphocytes and has been shown to have multiple effects on T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Some of these IL-12 activities include the induction of interferon gamma in resting and activated T and NK cells, the enhancement of cytotoxic activity of NK and T cells, and the stimulation of resting T cell proliferation In the presence of a comitogen. Current evidence indicates that IL-12 is a key mediator of cellular immunity. Based on its activity, it has been suggested that IL-12 may have therapeutic potential as a vaccine adjuvant that promotes cellular-immunity and as an anti-viral and anti-tumor agent. In fact, IL-12 is currently being evaluated as an anti-cancer drug in Phase I/II clinical trails (Genetics Institute, Cambridge Mass.). However, in the phase II clinical study administration of recombinant human IL-12 (rhIL-12) resulted in severe toxicity (Atkins et. Al, 1995). This has, so far, hampered its further development. In this context, it appears that developing strategies for locally constricted delivery of the cytokine to the tumor could reduce the problems related to toxicity in clinical applications.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Single peptide chain p40-p35 fusions (Lieschke et. al, 1997) retain specific in vivo activity, comparable to that of native and recombinant IL-12. The present inventors have constructed a single polypeptide fusion protein of the murine p35-p40 genes with the antibody L19, directed against the ED-B domain of fibronectin, a component of the extracellular matrix and a marker of angiogenesis. By an in vitro assay (T cell proliferation assay) it was demonstrated that the IL-12-L19 fusion protein retained IL-12 activity comparable to commercially available IL-12. Furthermore, in vivo biodistribution experiments in mice proved accumulation of the fusion protein in tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">IL-12 has been supposed to act at the cell surface level. Thus, it was not predictable that depositing and enriching it in the tumoral extracellular matrix (ECM) would have any effect on the rate of tumor growth. In therapeutic experiments, however, the fusion protein was found to induce anti-tumor effects comparable to the ones obtained with the L19-IL2 fusion protein by significantly reducing tumor growth in tumor bearing mice.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Interferon gamma (IFN-&#x3b3;) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a central role in promoting innate and adaptive mechanisms of host defence. It is now well recognised that IFN-&#x3b3;, a non-covalently associated homodimeric cytokine, exerts its biologic effects by interacting with an IFN-&#x3b3; receptor that is ubiquitously expressed on nearly all cells. Functionally active IFN-&#x3b3; receptors consist of two distinct subunits: a 90-kDa receptor alpha chain and a 62-kDa receptor beta chain. The physiologic role of IFN-&#x3b3; in promoting host resistance to infectious organisms is unequivocal (Newport et al. (1996) <i>New Engl. J. Med., </i>335, 1941-1949; Jouanguy et al. (1996) <i>New Engl. J. Med., </i>335, 1956-1961).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In contrast, the role that IFN-&#x3b3; plays in the development of host anti-tumor responses is less well established. IFN-&#x3b3; plays a critical role in promoting rejection of transplantable tumors. Furthermore, endogenously produced IFN-&#x3b3; forms the basis of a tumor surveillance system that controls development of both chemically induced and spontaneously arising tumors in mice.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Considering that production of IFN-&#x3b3; makes a tumor immunogenic, it is tempting to speculate that decorating a tumor with IFN-&#x3b3; (for example, by means of IFN-&#x3b3;-antibody fusion proteins) may lead to an anti-tumor response. Systemically administered unconjugated IFN-&#x3b3; has been studied in multi-centre clinical trials in patients with cancer, with very modest response rates. However, recent indication of clinical usefulness of intraperitoneal applications of IFN-&#x3b3; in patients with ovarian cancer has become available from a Phase III clinical trial (Windbichler et al. (2000) <i>Br. J. Cancer, </i>82, 1138-1144).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present inventors have found that when targeting the L19-interleukin-12 fusion protein to tumor vasculature in tumor bearing mice, they have observed increased levels of IFN-&#x3b3; in the blood. In contrast, no elevated levels of IFN-&#x3b3; could be detected with a non-targeted scFv-interleukin-12 fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Tumor Necrosis Factor &#x3b1; (TNF&#x3b1;)is a cytokine produced by many cell types, mainly activated monocytes and macrophages. It is expressed as a 26 kDa integral transmembrane precursor protein from which a mature protein of approximately 17 kDa is released by proteolytic cleavage. The soluble bioactive TNF&#x3b1; is a homotrimer that interacts with two different cell surface receptors (Tartaglia L. A., et al <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>268: 18542-18548, 1993) p55TNFR (50-60 kDa) and p75TNFR (75-80 kDa). p75TNFR is species-specific; in fact, human TNF&#x3b1; does not bind to this mouse receptor.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">TNF&#x3b1; can induce hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted solid tumors, in vivo (Carswell E. A., et al, <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>USA, 72: 3666-3670, 1975), and can exert cytotoxic activity in vitro against some tumor cell lines (Helson L., et al, <i>Nature, </i>258: 731-732. 1975).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The anti-tumor efficiency of TNF&#x3b1; in some animal models fostered hopes of its possible use as a therapeutic agent in human cancer. Clinical trials performed to demonstrate the anti-tumor efficacy of TNF&#x3b1;, however, showed that systemically administrated therapeutically effective doses were accompanied by unacceptably high levels of systemic toxicity, hypotension being the most common dose-limiting toxic effect. Moreover, TNF&#x3b1; has a very rapid clearance from the bloodstream (plasma half-life generally less than 30 minutes)(Blick M. m et al. <i>Cancer Res., </i>47: 2989, 1987), which decreases the hematic concentration under therapeutic levels, very rapidly. Good clinical results have been achieved in humans only in loco-regional treatments of non disseminated tumors (e.g., isolated-limb-perfusion for sarcoma and melanoma) (Franker D. L., et al, <i>Important Adv. Oncol. </i>179-192, 1994.)</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The anti-tumor activity of TNF&#x3b1; in many animal models seems to be due to a combination of a direct toxic effect (in combination with tumor-derived factors that synergise with TNF&#x3b1;) on endothelial cells of the growing tumor vasculature (Clauss M., et al. <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>265:7078-7083, 1990a), as well as to alterations of the hemostatic properties of proliferating endothelial cells in tumor angiogenesis (Clauss., et al <i>J. Exp. Med., </i>172:1535-1545, 1990b). There is also evidence of a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells. Indirect (host-mediated) effects of TNF&#x3b1;, such as the induction of T cell-dependent immunity, can contribute to tumor regression on animal models (Palladino Jr. M. A., et al. <i>J. Immunol., </i>138:4023-4032, 1987).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the experiments described below, the inventors constructed and expressed on mammalian cells an antibody-murine TNF&#x3b1; (mTNF&#x3b1;) fusion protein, the antibody L19 being directed against a component of the ECM present in angiogenesis in pathological lesions (in particular B-FN). In vivo biodistribution experiments in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated accumulation of the fusion protein around new forming tumor blood vessels. The fusion protein was tested in therapeutic experiments in tumor bearing animals and surprisingly was found to induce an anti-tumor effect and to be active in reducing tumor growth.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The present invention provides for treatment of lesions of pathological angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one aspect the invention provides a method of treating angiogenesis in pathological lesions, the method comprising administering a conjugate of (i) a molecule which exerts a biocidal or cytotoxic effect on target cells by cellular interaction and (ii) a specific binding member specific for an extracellular matrix component which is present in angiogenesis in pathological lesions.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In another aspect, the invention provides the use of a conjugate of (i) a molecule which exerts a biocidal or cytotoxic effect on target cells by cellular interaction and (ii) a specific binding member specific for an extracellular matrix component which is present in angiogenesis in pathological lesions, in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of pathological angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a further aspect the invention provides a conjugate of (i) a molecule which exerts a biocidal or cytotoxic effect on target cells by cellular interaction and (ii) a specific binding member specific for an extracellular matrix component which is present in angiogenesis in pathological lesions, for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy. Such treatment may be of pathological lesions comprising angiogenesis.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A still further aspect of the invention provides a conjugate of (i) a molecule which exerts a biocidal or cytotoxic effect on target cells by cellular interaction and (ii) a specific binding member specific for an extracellular matrix component which is present in angiogenesis in pathological lesions. Such a conjugate preferably comprises a fusion protein comprising the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule and a said specific binding member, or, where the specific binding member is two-chain or multi-chain, a fusion protein comprising the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule and a polypeptide chain component of said specific binding member. Preferably the specific binding member is a single-chain polypeptide, e.g. a single-chain antibody molecule, such as scFv. Thus a further aspect of the present invention provides a fusion protein comprising the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule and a single-chain Fv antibody molecule specific for an extracellular matrix component which is present in lesions comprising angiogenesis, especially a tumor-associated extracellular matrix component. As discussed, in a preferred embodiment the component allowing for discriminatory targeting of extracellular matrix of pathological lesions compared with normal is fibronectin ED-B. In another preferred embodiment the component is the C domain of tenascin-C (Carnemolla et al. (1999) <i>Am. J. Pathol., </i>154, 1345-1352]).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The biocidal or cytotoxic molecule that exerts its effect on target cells by cellular interaction, may interact directly with the target cells, may interact with a membrane-bound receptor on the target cell or perturb the electrochemical potential of the cell membrane. Molecules which interact with a membrane-bound receptor include chemokines, cytokines and hormones. Compounds which perturb the electrochemical potential of the cell membrane include hemolysin, ionophores, drugs acting on ion channels. In exemplary preferred embodiments the molecule is interleukin-2, tissue factor (preferably truncated) or doxorubicin. Other embodiments may employ interleukin 12, interferon-gamma, IP-10 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As discussed further below, the specific binding member is preferably an antibody or comprises an antibody antigen-binding site. Conveniently, the specific binding member may be a single-chain polypeptide, such as a single-chain antibody. This allows for convenient production of a fusion protein comprising single-chain antibody and the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule (e.g. interleukin-2 or tissue factor). In other embodiments, an antibody antigen-binding site is provided by means of association of an antibody VH domain and an antibody VL domain in separate polypeptides, e.g. in a complete antibody or in an antibody fragment such as Fab or diabody. Where the specific binding member is a two-chain or multi-chain molecule (e.g. Fab or whole antibody, respectively), the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule may be conjugated as a fusion polypeptide with one or more polypeptide chains in the specific binding member.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The specific binding member may be specific for fibronectin ED-B, or the C domain of tenascin-C.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">An antibody antigen-binding site used in a specific binding member in accordance with the present invention may include the VH and/or VL domains of the antibody L19 or an antibody that competes with L19 for binding to ED-B. The L19 VH (EVQLLESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGFTFSSFSMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVSSISGSSGTTY YADSVKGRFTISRDNSKNTLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCAKPFPYFDYWGQGTLVTVSS (SEQ ID NO: 34)) and L19 VL (EIVLTQSPGTLSLSPGERATLSCRASQSVSSSFLAWYQQKPGQAPRLLIYYASSRATGIPD RFSGSGSGTDFTLTISRLEPEDFAVYYCQQTGRIPPTFGQGTKVEIK (SEQ ID NO: 35)) domain sequences are disclosed in Pini et al. (1998)<i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>273: 21769-21776 and are hereby incorporated by reference herein. The DNA encoding antibody scFvL19 has been deposited on Sep. 25, 2008, in ATCC (Manassas, Va.), and has accession no. PTA-9529.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Other non-antibody specific binding members which may be conjugated with IL-2, TF, doxo, IL-12, IFN-&#x3b3; or TNF-&#x3b1; or other biocidal or cytotoxic molecules and used in accordance with the present invention include peptides, aptamers and small organic molecules able to interact with a component of the ECM associated with pathological lesions.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As noted, preferably the specific binding member is conjugated with the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule by means of a peptide bond, i.e. within a fusion polypeptide comprising said molecule and the specific binding member or a polypeptide chain component thereof. See Taniguchi et al. (1983) <i>Nature </i>302, 305-310; Maeda et al. (1983) <i>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. </i>115: 1040-1047; Devos et al. (1983) <i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>11: 4307-4323 for IL-2 sequence information useful in preparation of a fusion polypeptide comprising IL-2. Sequence information for truncated tissue factor is provided by Scarpati et al. (1987) <i>Biochemistry </i>26: 5234-5238, and Ruf et al. (1991) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>226: 15719-15725. Other means for conjugation include chemical conjugation, especially cross-linking using a bifunctional reagent (e.g. employing ADOUBLE-REAGENTS&#x2122;@ Cross-linking Reagents Selection Guide, Pierce).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Where slow release is desirable, e.g. where the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule is doxorubicin or other molecule which perturbs the electrochemical potential of the cell membrane, chemical conjugation may be by means of formation of a Schiff base (imine) between a primary amino group of the specific binding member (a polypeptide such as an antibody or antibody fragment) and an oxidised sugar moiety (daunosamine) of the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule such as doxorubicin.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The lesion treated may be a tumor, including without limitation any one or more of the following: melanoma, neuroblastoma, colorectal carcinoma, renal carcinoma, lung, carcinoma, lung metastasis, breast carcinoma, high-grade astrocytoma (grade III, grade IV), meningioma, angioma.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The lesion may be ocular, e.g. arising from age-related macular degeneration, in which angiogenesis arises from choroidal vessels.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Specific Binding Member</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">This describes a member of a pair of molecules which have binding specificity for one another. The members of a specific binding pair may be naturally derived or wholly or partially synthetically produced. One member of the pair of molecules has an area on its surface, or a cavity, which specifically binds to and is therefore complementary to a particular spatial and polar organisation of the other member of the pair of molecules. Thus the members of the pair have the property of binding specifically to each other.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Antibody</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">This describes an immunoglobulin whether natural or partly or wholly synthetically produced. The term also covers any polypeptide or protein having a binding domain which is, or is substantially homologous to, an antibody antigen-binding domain. These can be derived from natural sources, or they may be partly or wholly synthetically produced. Examples of antibodies are the immunoglobulin isotypes and their isotypic subclasses; fragments which comprise an antigen binding domain such as Fab, scFv, Fv, dAb, Fd; and diabodies.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">It is possible to take monoclonal and other antibodies and use techniques of recombinant DNA technology to produce other antibodies or chimeric molecules which retain the specificity of the original antibody. Such techniques may involve introducing DNA encoding the immunoglobulin variable region, or the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), of an antibody to the constant regions, or constant regions plus framework regions, of a different immunoglobulin. See, for instance, EP-A-184187, GB 2188638A or EP-A-239400. A hybridoma or other cell producing an antibody may be subject to genetic mutation or other changes, which may or may not alter the binding specificity of antibodies produced.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As antibodies can be modified in a number of ways, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; should be construed as covering any specific binding member having an antibody antigen-binding domain binding domain with the required specificity. Thus, this term covers antibody fragments, derivatives, functional equivalents and homologues of antibodies, including any polypeptide comprising an immunoglobulin binding domain, whether natural or wholly or partially synthetic. Chimeric molecules comprising an immunoglobulin binding domain, or equivalent, fused to another polypeptide are therefore included. Cloning and expression of chimeric antibodies are described in EP-A-0120694 and EP-A-0125023.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It has been shown that fragments of a whole antibody can perform the function of binding antigens. Examples of binding fragments are (i) the Fab fragment consisting of VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) the Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iii) the Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single antibody; (iv) the dAb fragment (Ward, E. S. et al., Nature 341, 544-546 (1989)) which consists of a VH domain; (v) isolated CDR regions; (vi) F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragments, a bivalent fragment comprising two linked Fab fragments (vii) single chain Fv molecules (scFv), wherein a VH domain and a VL domain are linked by a peptide linker which allows the two domains to associate to form an antigen binding site (Bird et al, Science, 242, 423-426, 1988; Huston et al, PNAS USA, 85, 5879-5883, 1988); (viii) bispecific single chain Fv dimers (PCT/US92/09965) and (ix) &#x201c;diabodies&#x201d;, multivalent or multispecific fragments constructed by gene fusion (WO94/13804; P. Holliger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444-6448, 1993). Fv, scFv or diabody molecules may be stabilised by the incorporation of disulphide bridges linking the VH and VL domains (Y. Reiter et al, Nature Biotech, 14, 1239-1245, 1996). Minibodies comprising a scFv joined to a CH3 domain may also be made (S. Hu et al, Cancer Res., 56, 3055-3061, 1996).</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Antigen Binding Domain</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">This describes the part of an antibody which comprises the area which specifically binds to and is complementary to part or all of an antigen. Where an antigen is large, an antibody may only bind to a particular part of the antigen, which part is termed an epitope. An antigen binding domain may be provided by one or more antibody variable domains (e.g. a so-called Fd antibody fragment consisting of a VH domain). Preferably, an antigen binding domain comprises an antibody light chain variable region (VL) and an antibody heavy chain variable region (VH).</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Specific</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">This may be used to refer to the situation in which one member of a specific binding pair will not show any significant binding to molecules other than its specific binding partner(s). The term is also applicable where e.g. an antigen binding domain is specific for a particular epitope which is carried by a number of antigens, in which case the specific binding member carrying the antigen binding domain will be able to bind to the various antigens carrying the epitope.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Comprise</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">This is generally used in the sense of include, that is to say permitting the presence of one or more features or components.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Isolated</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">This refers to the state in which specific binding members of the invention, or nucleic acid encoding such binding members, will generally be employed in accordance with the present invention. Members and nucleic acid will be free or substantially free of material with which they are naturally associated such as other polypeptides or nucleic acids with which they are found in their natural environment, or the environment in which they are prepared (e.g. cell culture) when such preparation is by recombinant DNA technology practiced in vitro or in vivo. Members and nucleic acid may be formulated with diluents or adjuvants and still for practical purposes be isolated&#x2014;for example the members will normally be mixed with gelatin or other carriers if used to coat microtitre plates for use in immunoassays, or will be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents when used in diagnosis or therapy. Specific binding members may be glycosylated, either naturally or by systems of heterologous eukaryotic cells (e.g. CHO or NS0 (ECACC 85110503) cells, or they may be (for example if produced by expression in a prokaryotic cell) unglycosylated.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As noted, where an antibody antigen-binding domain directed against fibronectin ED-B is to be employed in embodiments of the present invention, a preferred such domain comprises the L19 antibody VH and VL domains. Modified forms of one or other of these domains may be employed in further embodiments, e.g. the L19 VH or L19 VL domain in which 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 amino acid substitutions have been made in a CDR, e.g. CDR3, and/or FR, which specific binding members retain ability to bind fibronectin ED-B. Such amino acid substitutions are generally &#x201c;conservative&#x201d;, for instance substitution of one hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another, or the substitution of one polar residue for another, such as arginine for lysine, glutamic for aspartic acid, or glutamine for asparagine. At certain positions non-conservative substitutions are allowable.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The present invention further extends to employing a specific binding member which competes with the L19 antibody for binding to fibronectin ED-B. Competition between binding members may be assayed easily in vitro, for example by tagging a specific reporter molecule to one binding member which can be detected in the presence of other untagged binding member(s), to enable identification of specific binding members which bind the same epitope or an overlapping epitope.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition to antibody sequences, a specific binding member employed in accordance with the present invention may comprise other amino acids, e.g. forming a peptide or polypeptide, such as a folded domain, or to impart to the molecule another functional characteristic in addition to ability to bind antigen. Specific binding members of the invention may carry a detectable label.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In further aspects, the invention provides an isolated nucleic acid which comprises a sequence encoding a specific binding member as defined above (e.g. wherein the specific binding member or a polypeptide chain component is provided as a fusion polypeptide with the biocidal or cytotoxic molecule), and methods of preparing specific binding members of the invention which comprise expressing said nucleic acids under conditions to bring about expression of said binding member, and recovering the binding member.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The present invention also provides constructs in the form of plasmids, vectors, transcription or expression cassettes which comprise least one nucleic acid as above.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The present invention also provides a recombinant host cell which comprises one or more constructs as above. A still further aspect provides a method comprising introducing such nucleic acid into a host cell. The introduction may employ any available technique. For eukaryotic cells, suitable techniques may include calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection and transduction using retrovirus or other virus, e.g. vaccinia or, for insect cells, baculovirus. For bacterial cells, suitable techniques may include calcium chloride transformation, electroporation and transfection using bacteriophage.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The introduction may be followed by causing or allowing expression from the nucleic acid, e.g. by culturing host cells under conditions for expression of the gene.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Expression may conveniently be achieved by culturing under appropriate conditions recombinant host cells containing the nucleic acid. Following production by expression a specific binding member may be isolated and/or purified using any suitable technique, then used as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment, the nucleic acid of the invention is integrated into the genome (e.g. chromosome) of the host cell. Integration may be promoted by inclusion of sequences which promote recombination with the genome, in accordance with standard techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Systems for cloning and expression of a polypeptide in a variety of different host cells are well known. Suitable host cells include bacteria, mammalian cells, yeast and baculovirus systems. Mammalian cell lines available in the art for expression of a heterologous polypeptide include Chinese hamster ovary cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells, NSO mouse melanoma cells and many others. A common, preferred bacterial host is <i>E. coli</i>. The expression of antibodies and antibody fragments in prokaryotic cells such as <i>E. coli </i>is well established in the art. For a review, see for example Pl&#xfc;ckthun, A. Bio/Technology 9: 545-551 (1991). Expression in eukaryotic cells in culture is also available to those skilled in the art as an option for production of a specific binding member, see for recent reviews, for example Reff, M. E. (1993) Curr. Opinion Biotech. 4: 573-576; Trill J. J. et al. (1995) Curr. Opinion Biotech 6: 553-560.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Suitable vectors can be chosen or constructed, containing appropriate regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer sequences, marker genes and other sequences as appropriate. Vectors may be plasmids, viral e.g. &#x2018;phage, or phagemid, as appropriate. For further details see, for example, <i>Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual: </i>2nd edition, Sambrook et al., 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Many known techniques and protocols for manipulation of nucleic acid, for example in preparation of nucleic acid constructs, mutagenesis, sequencing, introduction of DNA into cells and gene expression, and analysis of proteins, are described in detail in <i>Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, </i>Second Edition, Ausubel et al. eds., John Wiley &#x26; Sons, 1992. The disclosures of Sambrook et al. and Ausubel et al. are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The present invention also provides a method which comprises using a construct as stated above in an expression system in order to express a specific binding member or polypeptide as above.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Specific binding members according to the invention may be used in a method of treatment of the human or animal body, such as a method of treatment (which may include prophylactic treatment) of a disease or disorder in a human patient which comprises administering to said patient an effective amount of a specific binding member of the invention. Conditions treatable in accordance with the present invention are discussed elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Accordingly, further aspects of the invention provide methods of treatment comprising administration of a specific binding member as provided, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such a specific binding member, and use of such a specific binding member in the manufacture of a medicament for administration, for example in a method of making a medicament or pharmaceutical composition comprising formulating the specific binding member with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In accordance with the present invention, compositions provided may be administered to individuals. Administration is preferably in a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d;, this being sufficient to show benefit to a patient. Such benefit may be at least amelioration of at least one symptom. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of what is being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage etc, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors. Appropriate doses of antibody are well known in the art; see Ledermann J. A. et al. (1991) <i>Int J. Cancer </i>47: 659-664; Bagshawe K. D. et al. (1991) Antibody, Immunoconjugates and Radiopharmaceuticals 4: 915-922.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A composition may be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Specific binding members of the present invention, including those comprising an antibody antigen-binding domain, may be administered to a patient in need of treatment via any suitable route, usually by injection into the bloodstream an/dor directly into the site to be treated, e.g. tumor. The precise dose will depend upon a number of factors, the route of treatment, the size and location of the area to be treated (e.g. tumor), the precise nature of the antibody (e.g. whole antibody, scFv molecule), and the nature of any detectable label or other molecule attached to the antibody. A typical antibody dose will be in the range 10-50 mg. This is a dose for a single treatment of an adult patient, which may be proportionally adjusted for children and infants, and also adjusted for other antibody formats in proportion to molecular weight. Treatments may be repeated at daily, twice-weekly, weekly or monthly intervals, at the discretion of the physician.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Specific binding members of the present invention will usually be administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, which may comprise at least one component in addition to the specific binding member.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Thus pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, and for use in accordance with the present invention, may comprise, in addition to active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art.

L19-IL2 is purified in a single step by affinity chromatography, contaminations lower than 10% were detectable by SDS-PAGE. The fusion protein showed an apparent molecular mass of about 42 Kd, in line with the expected size of the fusion protein. FPLC analysis of the fusion protein on a S200 Superdex chromatography column (Pharmacia) demonstrated that the protein, in native conditions, is made up of about 70% of dimers and 30% of monomers as previously observed for the scFv L19. Both the immunological activity of the scFvL19 component and the biological activity of the IL-2 component in the purified protein were tested (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).

L19-IL2 fusion protein was shown immunohistochemically to stained strongly blood vessels of glioblastoma tumor. Radioiodinated L19-IL2 fusion protein was injected in the tail vein of mice with subcutaneously implanted F9 tumors, and L19-IL2 fusion protein distribution was obtained at different time points: 3, 6 and 24 hours. Fourteen percent of the injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g) localized in the tumor 3 hours after injection as reported in Table 1.

Twenty-four hours later animals began receiving daily intravenous injection of either PBS (6 animals), a mixture of L19 and IL2 (6 animals) or L19-IL2 fusion protein (6 animals) for 10-15 days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection the animals were sacrified, the tumoral mass removed and the tumors weighed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The results, summarized in Table 2, show a significant decrease in tumor growth in the group of animals treated with L19-IL2 fusion protein with respect both to animals injected 15 with an equimolar mixture of L19 and IL2 proteins and to the third group treated with PBS.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">F9 teratocarcinoma tumors were dissected from nude mice after 11 days of intravenous treatments. In L19-IL2 fusion protein treatment group, the tumoral mass grew only in three out of six mice. The non parametric Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences in tumor weights between the three groups of animals. The differences in tumor weights between treatment with the fusion protein (L19-IL2), treatment with PBS or a mixture (L19+ IL2) were statistically significant (see Table 3).</p>

<p id="h-0046" num="0000">ScFv (L19) -Interferon-&#x3b3;</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The present inventors have found that when targeting the L19-interleukin-12 fusion protein to tumor vasculature in tumor bearing mice, they have observed increased levels of IFN-&#x3b3; in the blood. In contrast, no elevated levels of IFN-&#x3b3; could be detected with a non-targeted scFv-interleukin-12 fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The inventors have investigated two avenues for fusing IFN-&#x3b3; to scFv (such as L19). Previously, there has been a difficulty represented by the fact that IFN-&#x3b3; needs to be homodimeric in order to be biologically active. A fusion protein between IFN-&#x3b3; and (either the heavy chain or the light chain of) an IgG (which is, in turn, a homodimeric molecule), would result in the non-covalent polymerisation/precipitation of the resulting fusion protein.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In the first approach (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), IFN-&#x3b3; monomer was fused at the C-terminal extremity of scFv. The resulting fusion protein was well expressed in stably-transfected mammalian cell culture, yielding a pure protein (after affinity chromatography on ED-B resin), with an apparent molecular weight of 43 kDalton in reducing SDS-PAGE. The protein was mainly homodimeric in solution, as determined by gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex-200 column (Amersham-Pharmacia, D&#xfc;bendorf, Z&#xfc;rich, Switzerland). Both the scFv and the IFN-&#x3b3; moieties were shown to be active in the fusion protein, since scFv(actually L19)-IFN-&#x3b3; was able to bind with high-affinity to the ED-B domain of fibronectin and to block the proliferation of tumor cells, in a typical IFN-&#x3b3;-dependent fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In the second approach (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>), IFN-7 homodimer (consisting of two IFN-&#x3b3; joined together by a polypeptide linker) was fused at the C-terminal extremity of scFv(L19). The resulting fusion protein was well expressed in stably-transfected mammalian cell culture, yielding a pure protein (after affinity chromatography on ED-B resin), with an apparent molecular weight of 59 kDalton in reducing SDS-PAGE. The protein was mainly homodimeric in solution, as determined by gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex-200 column (Amersham-Pharmacia, D&#xfc;bendorf, Z&#xfc;rich, Switzerland). The nature of the fusion protein in solution, with four antigen-binding sites and four IFN-&#x3b3; monomeric units, is compatible with biological activity. The fusion protein showed strong binding to the ED-B domain of fibronectin both by ELISA and by BIAcore analysis, and it was able to block the proliferation of tumor cells, in a typical IFN-&#x3b3;-dependent fashion.</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0198">The efficacy of the L19-mTNF&#x3b1; fusion protein in suppressing tumor growth was tested on one experimental tumor model of mouse adenocarcinoma, C51. For tumor induction, 10<sup>6 </sup>C51 cells were injected subcutaneously in Balb/C animals. After 12 days (when the tumor reaches approximately 100-200 mm<sup>3</sup>) animals received intravenous injections of either PBS (3 animals) or L19-mTNF&#x3b1; fusion protein (3 animals). The animals were monitored for weight and tumor growth daily for 6 days. The results, summarised in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, show a decrease in tumor growth in the group of animals treated with L19-mTNF&#x3b1; fusion protein with respect to animals injected with PBS (bars represent SE). The weight loss was always less than 6% throughout the experiment time.</p>
