<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a scooter type motorcycle equipped with a fuel cell system, and more particularly, to scooter type motorcycle equipped with a fuel cell system and having a fuel tank supporting structure.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A vehicle driven by a power of a fuel cell has been developed, which includes a fuel tank that stores a fuel, for example, hydrogen gas, a fuel cell stack (hereinafter, simply called a fuel cell) that generates electric power by chemical reaction of the fuel and air, i.e., oxygen in the air, a secondary cell, and a motor that drives a drive wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, many conventional fuel cell systems for four-wheel vehicles generate relatively large electric power of several tens kW, and generate equivalent amounts of heat with power generation. Thus, the conventional fuel cell systems for four-wheel vehicles include water cooling type cooling units with high cooling efficiency. Further, in order to generate a large electric power, the conventional fuel cell system includes a compressor which feeds a large amount of air to the fuel cell system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A scooter type motorcycle driven by an electric power of the fuel cell (which may be called hereinafter merely &#x201c;scooter type fuel cell driven motorcycle&#x201d;, &#x201c;fuel cell driven motorcycle&#x201d;, or merely &#x201c;fuel cell motorcycle&#x201d;) as one example of the conventional fuel cell driven vehicle includes a water cooling fuel cell system capable of generating relatively large electric power. Such a scooter type fuel cell driven motorcycle includes: a radiator for cooling the fuel cell, which is disposed near to a front side of a vehicle main body; a cooling system which is disposed behind the radiator; a fuel cell disposed rearward of the cooling system and before a front end of a seat; and a fuel tank which is behind the fuel cell and substantially occupies a space under the seat. The cooling system thermally connects the radiator, the fuel cell and various electric components (for example, see Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2007-99008)).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, an air cooling type fuel cell system generates relatively small electric power of several kW, but does not require a radiator, a cooling water pump, a reservoir tank, and piping which are included in the cooling system of a water cooling type fuel cell system, and can cool the heat generated with electric power generation with air as the reactant gas.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, an air cooling type fuel cell system has low pressure loss in an air passage, and accordingly, an air cooling type fuel cell system has a simple system configuration in which a blower fan may suffice in place of a compressor, as an auxiliary machine to suppress the power consumption of the auxiliary machine to be low. Therefore, air cooling type fuel cell systems are utilized for the fuel cell driven vehicles such as fuel cell motorcycles capable of traveling with low output power as compared with four-wheel vehicles, and compact motor vehicles such as motor chairs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, a fuel cell driven vehicle uses hydrogen gas as the fuel, and therefore, it is necessary to reliably protect a fuel tank from accidents such as overturning and collision for the sake of safeness.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, in the conventional vehicle driven by the fuel cell, since a fuel tank is disposed in the space under the seat, it is difficult to say that the fuel tank can be protected in the accidents such as overturning and collision of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, a conventional fuel cell vehicle mainly gives a weight to protection of the fuel tank, and if the fuel cell vehicle can sufficiently secure the storage amount of fuel in the fuel tank, it is difficult to sufficiently extend the cruising distance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention was conceived in consideration of the circumstances encountered in the prior art mentioned above, and an object thereof is to provide a scooter type motorcycle equipped with a fuel cell system as a prime mover and a fuel tank storing a fuel for generating electric power by the fuel cell system, as well as reliably protecting the fuel tank and sufficiently increasing a storage amount of the fuel tank.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above and other objects can be achieved according to the present invention by providing a scooter-type motorcycle equipped with a fuel cell system, comprising:</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The lower down frame <b>23</b> is extended substantially directly below from a lower portion of the head pipe <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The upper frame <b>24</b> is extended in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> from a lower end of the lower down frame <b>23</b> through a lower end of the upper down frame <b>22</b> in a front half part of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>, and is smoothly inclined upward rearward at the rear side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> in a rear half part of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The seat <b>12</b> is disposed above a rear half part of the upper frame <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the upper frame <b>24</b> includes a pivot <b>28</b> in the rear half part of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The lower frame <b>25</b> is extended toward a lower side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> from the lower end of the lower down frame <b>23</b>, is bent at a position where it reaches a lower end of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>, and extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>. The lower frame <b>25</b> is further bent at a position, where it reaches a central portion of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> and extends upward to the rear side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>, and is then connected to the upper frame <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each of the lower frames <b>25</b> includes a foot rest <b>29</b> for a rider at a front side thereof. The lower frame <b>25</b> located at a left side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> includes a side stand bracket <b>30</b>. A side stand <b>31</b>, which allows the motorcycle <b>1</b> to stand alone in a state tilted to the left side, is swingably attached to the side stand bracket <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The frame <b>10</b> also includes a guard frame <b>33</b> which is installed at the bent portions at the rear sides of the lower frames <b>25</b>. A center stand <b>34</b>, which allows the fuel cell driven motorcycle <b>1</b> to stand alone, is swingably provided for the guard frame <b>33</b>. The guard frame <b>33</b> extends to a apace formed below a fuel supply main valve <b>52</b> (which may be called valve part <b>52</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">By the frame <b>10</b> which is arranged and constituted as mentioned above, the vehicle main body <b>3</b> includes the fuel tank <b>15</b> in a center tunnel region <b>35</b> surrounded by a pair of the left and right upper frames <b>24</b> and a pair of the left and right lower frames <b>25</b>, and includes the fuel cell <b>2</b>, the secondary cell <b>16</b>, the power management device <b>17</b> and the motor controller <b>18</b> in a device mounting region <b>36</b> (device mounting space) surrounded by the rear half part of the upper frame <b>24</b>, the outer cover <b>11</b> and the seat <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the device mounting region <b>36</b>, the secondary cell <b>16</b>, the power control device <b>17</b> and the fuel cell <b>2</b> are disposed in this sequence from the front side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>. The motor controller <b>18</b> is attached at a side of the power management device <b>17</b>, for example, at a left side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, the rear wheel <b>7</b> is disposed in a tire house region <b>37</b> which is behind the center tunnel region <b>35</b> of the frame <b>10</b> and under the device mounting region <b>36</b>. Furthermore, a partition (bulkhead) wall member <b>39</b> which defines the respective regions is provided between the device mounting region <b>36</b> and the tire house region <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The outer cover <b>11</b> includes a front leg shield cover <b>41</b> which covers the front half part of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>, a front frame cover <b>42</b> which is located at a central upper portion of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> and covers an upper side of the upper frame <b>24</b>, and a frame cover <b>43</b> which is located at the rear half part of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> and covers a lower portion of the seat <b>12</b> of a side surface of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The frame cover <b>43</b> and the seat <b>12</b> define the device mounting region <b>36</b> which accommodates the fuel cell <b>2</b>, the secondary cell <b>16</b>, the power management device <b>17</b> and the motor controller <b>18</b>. Accordingly, the device mounting region <b>36</b> is a sealed space enclosed by the seat <b>12</b>, the frame cover <b>43</b> and the bulkhead member <b>39</b>. By providing ventilation holes, not illustrated, in proper spots in the frame cover <b>43</b> or the bulkhead member <b>39</b>, the flow of air as reactant gas, which is supplied to the fuel cell <b>2</b>, can be easily and reliably controlled, and the flow of air as cooling air can also be easily and reliably controlled to the electric components to be cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The device mounting region <b>36</b> does not have to be a completely hermetic space.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The seat <b>12</b> is mounted on the upper portion of the rear half part of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>. The seat <b>12</b> is of a tandem type and includes a front part <b>12</b><i>a </i>on which a driver is seated and a rear part <b>12</b><i>b </i>on which a passenger is seated, both being integrally formed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The fuel cell <b>2</b> is disposed to a rear side of the device mounting region <b>36</b> defined under the seat <b>12</b>. More specifically, the fuel cell <b>2</b> is disposed below the rear part <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the seat <b>12</b> on which the passenger is seated. The fuel cell <b>2</b> is formed into a flat cube shape, and has an intake surface <b>2</b><i>a</i>, which has an inlet port of the reactant gas, oriented upward toward the front side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> in a forward inclined manner. In concrete, the intake surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>of the fuel cell <b>2</b> is oriented to a step portion of the front part <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the rear part <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the seat <b>12</b>, so that the fuel cell <b>2</b> secures a relatively large clearance between the intake surface <b>2</b><i>a </i>and the seat <b>12</b>, thereby sufficiently in-taking atmosphere (air) of the device mounting region <b>36</b>, as a reactant gas.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The fuel cell <b>2</b> is provided with a fan <b>45</b>, which acts to intake the atmosphere (air) in the device mounting region <b>36</b> as the reactant gas from the intake surface <b>2</b><i>a</i>. The fuel cell <b>2</b> generates electric power by chemical reaction of the hydrogen gas supplied from the fuel tank <b>15</b> and oxygen contained in air, and thereafter, exhausts excessive humid gas from an exhaust port <b>46</b>. In this process, the fuel cell <b>2</b> is cooled by the air as the reactant gas. The exhaust port <b>46</b> of the fuel cell <b>2</b> is communicated with an exhaust duct <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The exhaust duct <b>47</b> is disposed behind the fuel cell <b>2</b>, and guides the exhaust gas of the fuel cell <b>2</b> to an exhaust port <b>48</b> opened at a rear end of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>. The exhaust port <b>46</b> of the fuel cell <b>2</b> communicates with the exhaust duct <b>47</b> at a lower end portion of a front side of the exhaust duct <b>47</b>, and the exhaust duct <b>47</b> has the exhaust port <b>48</b> at a location which is at an end portion of a rear side of the exhaust duct <b>47</b> and at an upper side from the communication position with the exhaust port <b>46</b> of the fuel cell <b>2</b>, more desirably, at an upper end portion of the rear side. According to the location of the exhaust port <b>48</b> disposed at the upper side from the communication position with the exhaust port <b>46</b> of the fuel cell <b>2</b>, the excessive humid gas containing unreacted hydrogen gas can be surely exhausted to the outside of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The fuel tank <b>15</b> stores hydrogen gas as the fuel for the fuel cell <b>2</b>. The fuel tank <b>15</b> is, for example, a high-pressure compressed hydrogen storing system of about 35 MPa. The fuel tank <b>15</b> extends in the center tunnel region <b>35</b> in a substantially central lower portion of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> so that a longitudinal axis direction of the fuel tank <b>15</b> accords with the longitudinal direction of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the periphery of the fuel tank <b>15</b> is surrounded by a pair of the upper frames <b>24</b> and a pair of the lower frames <b>25</b> to thereby securely protect the fuel tank <b>15</b> from the accidents such as overturning and collision of the fuel cell motorcycle <b>1</b>. The fuel tank <b>15</b> is also sandwiched between the left and right foot rests <b>29</b> provided at the lower frames <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The fuel tank <b>15</b> is fixed into the center tunnel region <b>35</b> by the clamp band <b>49</b> which is arranged between the upper frame <b>24</b> disposed at the side portion at one side, for example, right side, of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> and the lower frame <b>25</b> disposed at the side portion, for example, at the left side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>. The clamp band <b>49</b> may be arranged between the upper frame <b>24</b> disposed at the left side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>, and the lower frame <b>25</b> disposed at the right side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, the fuel tank <b>15</b> includes a pressure container <b>51</b> constituted of a composite container of an aluminum liner, the fuel supply main valve (valve part) <b>52</b> integrally having a main valve, not shown, using an electromagnetic valve and a regulator, not shown, and a fuel filling joint <b>54</b> having a fuel filling port <b>53</b>. The pressure container <b>51</b> is a columnar container having semispherical mirror plates at both ends.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The fuel filling joint <b>54</b> communicates with the pressure container <b>51</b> so as to guide the hydrogen gas as a fuel into the pressure container <b>51</b> from the fuel filling port <b>53</b>. The fuel filling port <b>53</b> is disposed to be sufficiently apart from the secondary cell <b>16</b>. More specifically, the fuel filling port <b>53</b> is disposed in the vicinity of the upper down frame <b>22</b>, outside the device mounting region <b>36</b> which accommodates a number of devices, and the fuel filling port <b>53</b> is covered with the front frame cover <b>42</b>. More concretely, the fuel filling port <b>53</b> is disposed near above the mirror plate at the front side of the pressure container <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The fuel filling port <b>53</b> is oriented to an upper side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>. When it is required to supply the fuel into the fuel tank <b>15</b>, the front frame cover <b>42</b> is opened to form an open space above the fuel filling port <b>53</b>. Accordingly, even if the fuel leaks in the fuel filling operation, the leak fuel does not stay. Further, since the fuel filling port <b>53</b> is disposed at the same location as the fuel supply port in a scooter type motorcycle including an ordinary gasoline engine, an operator (rider) does not feel any sense of incompatibility.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The secondary cell <b>16</b> is constituted of a box-shaped lithium ion battery. The secondary cell <b>16</b> is disposed near the front side of the device mounting region <b>36</b> which is defined below the seat <b>12</b> and is disposed above the mirror plate at the rear side of the pressure container <b>51</b> of the fuel tank <b>15</b>. More concretely, the secondary cell <b>16</b> is disposed under the front part <b>12</b><i>a </i>of the rider's seat <b>12</b> and is raised substantially upright on a phantom horizontal plane of the fuel cell motorcycle <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The fuel cell system motorcycle <b>1</b> includes a secondary cell <b>56</b> which can supply electric power of 12V system as a power supply for meters, not shown, and lamps, also not shown, in addition to the secondary cell <b>16</b>. The secondary cell <b>56</b> is disposed at a side of the pressure container <b>51</b> of the fuel tank <b>15</b>, for example, at a right side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>. The secondary cell <b>56</b> is disposed at a lower side from the fuel filling port <b>53</b>, and at a front side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> from the valve part <b>52</b> of the fuel tank <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Even if hydrogen gas which is a fuel leaks from the fuel filling port <b>53</b>, the hydrogen gas rises upward from the fuel cell motorcycle <b>1</b>, and therefore, diffuses outside the motorcycle without staying in the motorcycle body. Even if the fuel hydrogen gas leaks from the valve part <b>52</b>, the hydrogen gas moves toward the tire house region <b>37</b>, and therefore, the hydrogen gas diffuses outside the motorcycle without staying inside the motorcycle body.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The power management device <b>17</b> is disposed by being sandwiched by the secondary cell <b>16</b> and the fuel cell <b>2</b>. The power management device <b>17</b> is held by being tilted rearward in the clearance between the secondary cell <b>16</b> and the fuel cell <b>2</b>. The motor controller <b>18</b> which is provided side by side with the power management device <b>17</b> is also sandwiched by the secondary cell <b>16</b> and the fuel cell <b>2</b> and is held by being tilted rearward in the clearance between the secondary cell <b>16</b> and the fuel cell <b>2</b> similarly to the power management device <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As mentioned above, by disposing the secondary cell <b>16</b>, the power management device <b>17</b>, the motor controller <b>18</b> and the fuel cell <b>2</b>, it becomes possible to locate the adjacent devices with electrical connections as closely as possible to each other. The wiring length between the devices can be made short, and the weight relating to the wiring can be made light.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The motor controller <b>18</b> is provided side by side with the power management device <b>17</b>. Specifically, the motor controller <b>18</b> is disposed on the left side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>, whereas the power management device <b>17</b> is disposed on the right side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>. The motor controller <b>18</b> has a cooling fin <b>57</b> directed downward toward the lower side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The vehicle controller <b>19</b> is disposed in front of the lower frame <b>25</b> so as to oppose to the mirror plate on the front side of the fuel tank <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Incidentally, the front wheel <b>5</b> is rotatably supported by the front fork <b>27</b>, which is constituted so as to provide a stereoscopic structure elastically extendable and contractible, and which supports a front fender <b>58</b> above the front wheel <b>5</b>. The handle <b>6</b> is connected to an upper end portion of the front fork <b>27</b>. The front wheel <b>5</b>, the front fork <b>27</b> and the handle <b>6</b> are supported swingably around the head pipe <b>21</b>, and constitute a steering mechanism <b>59</b> of the fuel cell motorcycle <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The rear wheel <b>7</b> is rotatably supported by a swing arm <b>60</b> which is pivotally attached to a pivot <b>28</b> swingably. The swing arm <b>60</b> is elastically supported by the frame <b>10</b> via a rear suspension <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The motor <b>8</b> is a prime mover of the fuel cell motorcycle <b>1</b> which drives the rear wheel <b>7</b>. The motor <b>8</b> is integrally mounted on the swing arm <b>60</b> and constitutes a unit swing type swing arm. The motor <b>8</b> is connected to the rear wheel <b>7</b> via a transmission, not illustrated. The drive force to be generated by the motor <b>8</b> will be transmitted to the rear wheel <b>7</b> through the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, the vehicle main body <b>3</b> includes fuel leakage detectors <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> which detect the leakage of the hydrogen gas as the fuel. The fuel leakage detectors <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> are constituted by using hydrogen gas detectors so as to detect the hydrogen gas. The fuel leakage detector <b>63</b> is disposed near the upper side of the device mounting region <b>36</b>, that is, the inner space of the seat <b>12</b>. The fuel leakage detector <b>64</b> is disposed at a position which is near to the upper side of a space near the valve part <b>52</b> of the fuel tank <b>15</b>, of the center tunnel region <b>35</b>, and is close to the tire house region <b>37</b>. The hydrogen gas is lighter than the air, i.e., atmosphere, of the device mounting region <b>36</b> and the center tunnel region <b>35</b>, and can be easily detected at the time of leakage of the hydrogen gas from the fuel cell <b>2</b>, the fuel tank <b>15</b>, and the intermediate pipe connecting the fuel tank <b>15</b> and the fuel cell <b>2</b>. In particular, the device mounting region <b>36</b> is a sealed space, and when hydrogen gas, which is the fuel, leaks from the fuel cell <b>2</b>, or the piping system, not illustrated, near the fuel cell <b>2</b>, the leakage of the fuel can be quickly detected by the fuel leakage detector <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, when the hydrogen gas, which is the fuel, leaks from the vicinity of the valve part <b>52</b> of the fuel tank <b>15</b>, the fuel leakage detector <b>64</b> can reliably detect the leakage of the fuel even under the situation in which the leakage fuel easily flows out to the tire house region <b>37</b> by traveling air or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view partially showing the center tunnel region of the scooter type fuel cell driven motorcycle including the fuel tank supporting structure according to the embodiment of the present invention, in which the electric components such as the fuel cell <b>2</b>, the secondary cell <b>16</b>, the power management device <b>17</b> and the motor controller <b>18</b> are omitted from showing.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the motorcycle <b>1</b> driven by the electric power of the fuel cell includes a pair of the left and right upper frames <b>24</b> extended in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>, a pair of the left and right lower frames <b>25</b> which extend in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> and have their rear side end portions bent and connected to the respective upper frames <b>24</b>, and the fuel tank <b>15</b> which is disposed in the center tunnel region <b>35</b> surrounded by the upper frame <b>24</b> and the lower frame <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The valve part <b>52</b> of the fuel tank <b>15</b> is located at the rear side of the center tunnel region <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The guard frame <b>33</b> is installed at the bent portions on the rear sides of the lower frames <b>25</b> and extends to a lower side from the valve part <b>52</b>. Further, the guard frame <b>33</b> is provided with a center stand support bracket <b>65</b> at which the center stand <b>34</b> is swingably provided.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Accordingly, the fuel cell driven motorcycle <b>1</b> can securely protect the fuel tank <b>15</b> by a pair of left and right upper frames <b>24</b> and a pair of left and right lower frames <b>25</b>, and the fuel tank <b>15</b> can secure a fuel storage amount as large as possible without limiting the longitudinal size of the pressure container <b>51</b> by the guard frame <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, the fuel cell driven motorcycle <b>1</b> can reliably protect the lower side of the valve part <b>52</b> by the guard frame <b>33</b>, prevents scattering stones, bumps and dips on the road surface and the like from directly hitting or colliding to the valve part <b>52</b>, and sufficiently protects the valve part <b>52</b> in which leakage of the fuel easily occurs because the valve part <b>52</b> has a number of joint portions in its construction.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Furthermore, the fuel cell driven motorcycle <b>1</b> has the structure in which the fuel tank <b>15</b> except for the lower side of the valve part <b>52</b> can be directly seen from the lower side of the vehicle main body <b>3</b>, and therefore, the fuel tank <b>15</b> can be easily disposed in the center tunnel region <b>35</b> from the lower side thereof, thus improving the maintainability of the motorcycle <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The guard frame <b>33</b> includes the center stand <b>34</b>, and therefore, a considerable bending load acts on the connecting portion with the lower frame <b>25</b>, that is, the base portion of the guard frame <b>33</b>, each time when the fuel cell motorcycle <b>1</b> is caused to stand alone. Therefore, when the storage amount of the fuel tank <b>15</b> is further increased, and longitudinal size thereof is further enlarged, if the guard frame <b>33</b> extends to be longer, it becomes difficult to secure the strength of the base portion of the guard frame <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In order to obviate this defect, another example of the fuel tank supporting structure in the case of further increasing the storage amount of the fuel tank <b>15</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for example.</p>

Accordingly, the lower frame <b>25</b>A can protect the side of the valve part <b>52</b> with the bent portion to the raised portion connected to the upper frame <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the fuel cell driven motorcycle <b>1</b> of this embodiment, the length of the portion of the lower frame <b>25</b>A, which extends in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle main body <b>3</b> so as to locate the raised portion of the lower frame <b>25</b>A at the side of the valve part <b>52</b>, is increased (i.e., extended).
