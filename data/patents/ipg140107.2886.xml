No. 8,106,135 which is a CIP of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/951,299, filed Sep. 27, 2004 now abandoned, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0002">This invention relates to a polyethersulfone composition, a method to synthesize the polyethersulfone composition and articles made from the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0003">Polyethersulfones are a commercially important family of high performance, high temperature amorphous thermoplastics. These polymers are of interest to many industries because of their combination of high heat resistance, hydrolysis resistance in steam and hot water environments and good overall chemical resistance. Another reason these polymers are of great commercial interest is because in addition to offering the stated high performance attributes, they are also transparent, unlike most semi-crystalline materials which are also used in high temperature applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0004">Polyethersulfones can be produced by a variety of methods. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,108,837 and 4,175,175 describe the preparation of polyarylethers and in particular polyarylethersulfones. U.S. Pat. No. 6,228,970 describes the preparation polyarylethersulfones with improved polydispersity and lower amounts of oligomers. British patent GB 1,264,900 teaches a process for production of a polyethersulfone comprising structural units derived from 4,4&#x2032;-biphenol, bisphenol-A (4,4&#x2032;-isopropylidenediphenol), and 4,4&#x2032;-dichlorodiphenylsulfone.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0005">The transparency of polyarylethersulfones makes them suitable for use in a variety of applications such as lids and covers for surgical and dental instrument sterilization trays which have to undergo steam autoclave sterilization. In the application just mentioned, the contents of the sterilization trays may by virtue of the transparency of the polyethersulfone, be inventoried by visual inspection without exposing the contents to the environment. Other uses and potential uses of polyethersulfones include pet transport containers, and dairy processing equipment, particularly milking machine components. Food and beverage applications also include uses such as coffee serving carafes and containers, microwave cookware, covers for cookware containers, and doors and windows for appliances, such as rotisserie grills. The inherent flammability resistance and low smoke release characteristics of polyethersulfones, particularly those of polyetherphenylsulfone, enhance the utility of such polymers in applications such as mass transit where low heat release on combustion and low toxic smoke emission properties of components used in passenger compartments are of critical concern. In the aircraft industry, in particular, the low flammability and low smoke attributes of polyethersulfones make such materials suitable for use in a variety of aircraft cabin interior components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0006">While the currently available polyethersulfones typically possess intermediate heat resistance, it would be desirable to improve their heat resistance while still maintaining or improving their impact properties. This would improve the utility of these polymers in a number of applications, especially in applications such as automotive headlight reflectors, medical trays, aircraft cabin interior components, consumer oriented hot food or beverage service items like tableware and baby bottles, pet transport containers, surgical trays, coffee serving carafes, cookware containers, where improving impact resistance at higher temperatures would be highly desirable. It is axiomatic that the deficiencies of currently available materials are tolerated because viable alternatives are lacking. Key areas for improvement in order to maximize the utility of polyethersulfones are; physical/mechanical integrity at high temperatures, hot water resistance, resistance to cleaning agents, and chemical inertness of the resin under conditions of use.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0007">Commercially important polyarylethersulfones include polysulfone (PSU), polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) and polyethersulfone (PES). PSU is a well-known high temperature amorphous engineering thermoplastic resin exhibiting a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about 185&#xb0; C., high strength, stiffness and toughness over a temperature range of from about &#x2212;100&#xb0; to 150&#xb0; C. PSU has an Izod impact strength value (Notched Izod value) of about 69 Jm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(1.3 ft-lb/in). PSU was commercially introduced in 1965 by the Union Carbide Corporation and is commercially available as UDEL&#xae; polysulfone from Solvay Advanced Polymers LLC. Another versatile polyarylethersulfone polymer is polyphenylsulfone (PPSU). PPSU is commercially available from Solvay Advanced Polymers LLC under the trademark of RADEL&#xae;. It has a Tg of 220&#xb0; C. and an Izod impact strength value of about 700 Jm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>(13 ft-lb/in).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0008">In various applications it would be highly desirable to produce polyarylethersulfones with higher glass transition temperatures (i.e. increased heat resistance) relative to known polyethersulfones, while maintaining or improving the high impact strength typically exhibited by materials of the polyethersulfone class. In order to achieve higher heat resistance in polyethersulfones having excellent impact strength, improvements in the design of the polyethersulfone compositions are necessary.</p>

Similarly a tetrahydronaphthyl radical is an aromatic radical comprising an aromatic group (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>) fused to a nonaromatic component &#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>&#x2014;. Aromatic radicals may be &#x201c;substituted&#x201d; or &#x201c;unsubstituted&#x201d;. A substituted aromatic radical is defined as an aromatic radical which comprises at least one substituent. A substituted aromatic radical may comprise as many substituents as there are positions available on the aromatic radical for substitution. Substituents which may be present on an aromatic radical include, but are not limited to halogen atoms such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Substituted aromatic radicals include trifluoromethylphenyl, hexafluoroisopropylidenebis(4-phenyloxy) (i.e. &#x2014;OPhC(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PhO&#x2014;), chloromethylphenyl; 3-trifluorovinyl-2-thienyl; 3-trichloromethylphenyl (i.e. 3-CCl<sub>3</sub>Ph-), bromopropylphenyl (i.e. BrCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>Ph-), and the like.

<p id="p-0086" num="0086">250 ML-SCALE FBPA/BP COPOLYMERIZATION (30/70 COMPOSITION): Synthesis of the disodium salt of fluorenylidene bisphenol A (FBPA): Under an Argon atmosphere 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene (fluorenylidene bisphenol A (FBPA)) (50.6318 g, 0.14449 mol) was dissolved in Argon-degassed methanol (MeOH) (120 mL). To the slightly yellow solution an aqueous (50.55%) sodium hydroxide solution (22.8659 g, 0.28899 mol) was added dropwise at room temperature. The color of the solution changed slightly to orange and precipitation occurred. Addition of 60 mL more of MeOH redissolved the precipitate. The resulting yellow-orange solution was transferred by means of a peristaltic pump at a constant flow rate of 2 mL/min to another reactor, which contained mechanically stirred, hot (170&#xb0; C.) 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) (150 mL). By means of a short-path distillation head the MeOH/water mixture was distilled off. When around 190 mL were distilled off the temperature was raised to 210&#xb0; C. Later, 50 mL of o-DCB were added and the temperature was raised to 225&#xb0; C. Distillation was continued until the water content of the distillate was determined to be 20 ppm. Then, the mixture was diluted with dry o-DCB (50 mL) and cooled to room temperature under Argon. The resulting suspension was filtered under nitrogen. The filter cake was washed with Argon-degassed heptane. The off-white powder was dried at 130&#xb0; C. under vacuum for 2 days to give 52 g (91%) of the disodium salt of FBPA (FBPA Na<sub>2</sub>-salt). The salt was used directly for polymerization.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">Polymerization: The disodium salt of fluorenylidene bisphenol A (FBPANa<sub>2</sub>) (10.2065 g, 25.8799 mmol) and the disodium salt of biphenol (BPNa<sub>2</sub>) (13.9275 g, 60.5086 mmol) were weighed into a reaction flask under nitrogen atmosphere and suspended in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) (100 mL). Some o-DCB (&#x2dc;33 g) was distilled out via a short path distillation head to dry the mixture, then dichlorodiphenylsulfone (DCDPS) (24.8075 g, 86.3874 mmol) and dry o-DCB (33 g) were added. Again, o-DCB (38 g) was distilled out to dry the mixture. The water content of the distillate was determined by Karl Fischer titration to be between 10 and 20 ppm. Hexaethylguanidinium chloride (HEGCl) (3.6 ml at 0.96 Min o-DCB) was added at 180&#xb0; C. and the polymerization was started. Aliquots were withdrawn to monitor the molecular weight of the polymer. When the target molecular weight was achieved, the brown honey-colored solution was quenched at 180&#xb0; C. with 10 drops of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>(85%). After 15 min, o-DCB (155 mL) was added to dilute the quenched product mixture to about 10% solids.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">Work-up procedure A: The mixture was cooled to 85&#xb0; C. and while being stirred at 350 rpm, 1.7 mL of water was added to agglomerate the sodium chloride. The mixture was then heated to 120&#xb0; C. to boil off the water. When the bubbling stopped the mixture was filtered hot through densely packed Celite (&#x2dc;3-5 mm thick). The resulting clear polymer solution was cooled to room temperature-, precipitated into MeOH using a blender, filtered, and oven dried to afford the product copolymer as an off-white fluffy powder (30.2 g, 78%). The latter was redissolved in chloroform (190 mL) and precipitated in MeOH.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0089">Work-up Procedure B: In an alternate procedure, the catalyst was removed by direct precipitation into a nonsolvent such as methanol without the addition of the 1.7 mL of water.

<p id="p-0090" num="0090">Work-up Procedure C: In another alternative procedure, the catalyst was removed by adsorption using silica gel. The remaining steps described in Work-up Procedure A were carried out to afford the product polymer.</p>

Under an inert atmosphere biphenol (99.1534 g, 0.53248 mol) was added followed by additional MeOH (350 mL). Aqueous sodium hydroxide (123.5549 g at 49.25 wt %, 1.52138 mol) was added dropwise using an addition funnel to the slurry and rinsed-in with MeOH (30 mL). The resulting reddish-orange solution was transferred by means of a peristaltic pump at &#x2dc;6 mL/min into mechanically stirred (200 rpm) hot (165&#xb0; C.) o-DCB (1480 mL). The addition was complete after around 135 minutes and at this point about 880 mL of solvents (MeOH/water/o-DCB) had been distilled off. The distillation was continued at 185-190&#xb0; C. until all of the water was distilled off. Distillation of o-DCB was continued until about 200 mL of clear o-DCB were removed. The water content of the last fraction was determined to be 17 ppm. The color of the mixed salt slurry in o-DCB was almost white.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0093">Polymerization: To the white slurry of the FBPANa<sub>2 </sub>and the BPNa<sub>2 </sub>in o-DCB, was added DCDPS (220.62 g, 0.76827 mol) followed by additional o-DCB (100 mL). The mixture was heated and o-DCB (940 mL) was distilled off until the solids content was about 29% (29.2%). When about 840 mL of o-DCB had been distilled off the water content of the distillate was determined to be 9 ppm. The catalyst (32 mL at 0.96 M) was then added to the reaction mixture at a pot temperature 185&#xb0; C. A vigorous reflux was observed. The polymerization was allowed to proceed. After the final molecular weight was reached, the solution was quenched at 180&#xb0; C. with phosphoric acid (7.1 g of 85% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>). After 13 more minutes the mixture was diluted with o-DCB (1735 mL) to 10% solids. The solution was brought to 90&#xb0; C. and water (11 mL) was added while stirring at 350 rpm. Salt crystals were observed to form in less than a minute. After 15 minutes, the suspension was heated to 135&#xb0; C. to boil off the water. Then, the hot mixture was drained and filtered through a suitable filtration device. The filtration took less than 15 minutes. The clear solution was cooled to ambient temperature and some precipitation occurred. The mixture was heated to 90&#xb0; C. and the resultant solution was precipitated into MeOH. The fluffy product polymer was dissolved in chloroform (10% solids) and precipitated in MeOH to yield 315 g (92%) of final product polymer as a fluffy solid. DSC: One T<sub>g </sub>at 243&#xb0; C.

The product polymer exhibited a single glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) at 234.8&#xb0; C. Notched Izod impact testing (ASTM D 256) was carried out on ten molded test parts and showed an average value of 8.44 ft-lb/in and a standard deviation of 1.63 ft-lb/in.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">The data presented in Examples 1-4 illustrate a surprising combination of very high Tg together with excellent ductility characteristics (Notched Izod above 1 ft-lb/in.) among compositions of the present invention. The glass transition temperature and Notched Izod data for the polyethersulfone compositions of Examples 1-4 are shown graphically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>10</b> shows the correlation between the concentration of FBPA in the copolymer and the glass transition temperature of the copolymer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <b>20</b> shows the correlation between the concentration of FBPA in the copolymer and the Notched Izod value of the copolymer. It should be noted that as the concentration of FBPA-derived structural units increases relative to the concentration of biphenol-derived structural units, the Notched Izod value observed for the composition decreases (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). See Example 3 (50% FBPA polysulfone) which exhibited very poor performance in Notched Izod testing. A second set of data is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, illustrating properties of copolymers of bis(4-chlorophenyl)sulfone, biphenol and PPPBP.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> show that polyethersulfones according to the present invention provide both high Tg and high toughness. For example, polyethersulfones containing 15-30% of units derived from FBPA had Tg ranging from about 235&#xb0; C. to about 245&#xb0; C. and IZOD from about 8 ft-lb/in to about 8 ft-lb/in.; polyethersulfones containing 10-25% of units derived from PPPBP had Tg ranging from about 235&#xb0; C. to about 245&#xb0; C. and IZOD form about 3 ft-lb/in. to greater than 1 ft-lb/in. In contrast, a polymer composed of units derived from only biphenol and dichlorodiphenylsulfone, without a bisphenol monomer, had a Tg of 224&#xb0; C. and a Notched IZOD value of about 13 ft-lb/in. Polymers having no biphenol monomer had a Tg of about 280&#xb0; C. and IZOD of less than 1 ft-lb/in for the FBPA-containing composition and a Tg of about 270&#xb0; C. and IZOD of less than 1 ft-lb/in for the PPPBP-containing composition.</p>
