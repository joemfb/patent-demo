<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a system for integrated circuit packages, and more particularly to a system for limiting the impact of delamination in flip chip packages.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many of today's most common consumer products, such as hand held computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephones, and digital cameras, rely on flip chip technology to meet the demands of function versus space. Many of these devices have to perform flawlessly in adverse environmental conditions. A primary enemy of flip chip technology is heat. A flip chip integrated circuit may be held in place by hundreds of solder interconnects that provide an electrical and thermal interface to the system in which it is installed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Problems can occur in flip chip devices if the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the surrounding package or board doesn't exactly match the CTE of the flip chip device and the solder interconnects. The corners and edges of the flip chip may move slightly due to the heat. This slight movement may cause extremely large pressures on the solder interconnects and in some cases may cause cracks that can cause failure of the flip chip integrated circuit. The occurrence of these cracks is called delamination.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The delamination typically occurs in the thin outer layers of the integrated circuit that form the foundation for the solder interconnects. The delamination may cause cracks that increase the probability that the integrated circuit will fail. It exposes the design to conditions far beyond the original design goals. This excursion into uncharted performance areas may cause the integrated circuit to operate but misinterpret data or transfer erroneous information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many strategies have been developed in order to live with delamination. The outermost interconnects in an array may be reserved for ground connections while the inner most interconnects may be the data to operate the function. This allows giving up some interconnects as a sacrificial barrier. This type of strategy may extend the useable life of an integrated circuit, but cannot prevent the eventual demise of the flip chip integrated circuit. While giving a sense of good design, this strategy leaves the reliability of the flip chip integrated circuit at the mercy of heat and the delamination process.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a need still remains for a means to resist the cause of delamination and extend the reliability of the flip chip integrated circuit. In view of the growing demand for integrated circuit devices packed full of our favorite functions in smaller and smaller spaces, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations, and the diminishing opportunities for meaningful product differentiation in the marketplace, it is critical that answers be found for these problems. Additionally, the need to save costs, improve efficiencies and performance, and meet competitive pressures, adds an even greater urgency to the critical necessity for finding answers to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a mock bump system including providing a flip chip integrated circuit having an edge and forming a mock bump near the edge.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Certain embodiments of the invention have other aspects in addition to or in place of those mentioned above. The aspects will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description when taken with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a mock bump system <b>100</b> for flip chip integrated circuits, in an embodiment of the present invention. The cross-sectional view of the mock bump system <b>100</b> depicts a flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b> having an active surface <b>104</b> and a back side <b>106</b>. A mock bump <b>108</b>, such as a mushroom shaped bump, may be formed on the active surface <b>104</b> near an edge <b>110</b>. The mock bump <b>108</b> may include two differently shaped but contiguous sections. The mock bump <b>108</b> can include a bump body <b>107</b> and a bump cap <b>109</b> extending from the bump body <b>107</b>. The bump can <b>109</b> can be in the shape of a hemisphere. The bump cap <b>109</b> further has a wider diameter than the bump body <b>107</b>, which provides a flat surface on the wider portion of the bump cap <b>109</b> facing the flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b>. The flat surface of the bump cap <b>109</b> is separated from the flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b> by a gap. An under bump metallization <b>112</b>, such as successive layers of metal, may be distributed across the active surface <b>104</b>. A chip interconnect <b>114</b>, such as a solder ball, solder bump, solder column, or stud bump, may be formed on each of the under bump metallization <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The chip interconnect <b>114</b> may be coupled to a contact pad <b>116</b> on a component side <b>118</b> of a substrate <b>120</b>. The mock bump <b>108</b> may be formed by a deposition of a metal having a high reflow temperature, such as copper (Cu) or nickel (Ni). The high reflow temperature assures that the mock bump <b>108</b> does not change shape during the reflow process of the chip interconnect <b>114</b>, which has a lower reflow temperature. An underfill material <b>122</b>, such as a low stress liquid epoxy, may be injected between the flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b> and the substrate <b>120</b>. The chip interconnect <b>114</b> can extend further from the flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b> than the mock bump <b>108</b> such that the mock bump <b>108</b> does not contact the substrate <b>120</b>. The underfill may completely encase the mock bump <b>108</b>, the under bump metallization <b>112</b> and the chip interconnect <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The active surface <b>104</b> of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b> may be coated with a passivation layer <b>124</b>, such as a silicon oxide (SiO) layer or a silicon nitride (SiN) layer. The underfill material <b>122</b> may have a weak adhesion with the passivation layer <b>124</b>. In order to better support the interface between the underfill material <b>122</b> and the flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b>, the mock bumps <b>108</b> will have a strong adhesion to the underfill material <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The inverted mushroom shape of the mock bump <b>108</b> presents a strong adhesion by providing a flat surface beneath the surface of the underfill. By placing the mock bumps <b>108</b> along the edge <b>110</b> of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b>, the edge <b>110</b> and the corners (not shown) may be prevented from rising away from the underfill material <b>122</b>. This reduction in the flexure of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b> may prevent the delamination of the under bump metallization <b>112</b> from the flip chip integrated circuit <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The number and position of the mock bumps <b>108</b> is an example only and the actual number and position may differ. Likewise the number and position of the under bump metallization <b>112</b> and the chip interconnect <b>114</b> is an example only and the actual number and position may differ.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a flip chip integrated circuit <b>200</b> having the mock bump system <b>100</b>. The cross-sectional view of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>200</b> depicts a flip chip integrated circuit <b>202</b> having a barrier region <b>204</b> adjacent to the edge <b>110</b>. The mock bump <b>108</b> may be positioned on the barrier region <b>204</b>. Since the barrier region is present in all of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>202</b> there is no difference in the size of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>202</b> when the mock bumps <b>108</b> are included in the design.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The addition of the mock bumps <b>108</b> may provide significant leverage on the edge <b>110</b> of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>202</b>. When the underfill material <b>122</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is applied over the mock bumps <b>108</b>, it provides an anchor-like attachment to the edge <b>110</b> of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>202</b>. There may be no electrical connection between the mock bump <b>108</b> and any of the chip interconnects <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a flip chip integrated circuit assembly <b>300</b> in a substrate attach phase of manufacturing. The cross-sectional view of the flip chip integrated circuit assembly <b>300</b> depicts a flip chip integrated circuit <b>302</b> having the mock bump <b>108</b>, the under bump metallization <b>112</b>, and the chip interconnect <b>114</b>. The substrate <b>120</b> may have the contact pad <b>116</b> with an adhesive <b>304</b>, such as a solder paste, deposited thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, therein is shown an active side view of a flip chip integrated circuit <b>400</b> having the mock bump system. The active side view of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>400</b> depicts a semiconductor die <b>402</b> having an array <b>404</b> of the chip interconnect <b>114</b> dispersed over the interior portion of the semiconductor die <b>402</b>. The mock bumps <b>108</b> may be formed in a double row around the array <b>404</b>. The mock bumps <b>108</b> reside in a space that may have no electrical connections. The outer region of the semiconductor die <b>402</b> may usually be reserved for a barrier (not shown), built on the interior metal layers, that prevents cracks from reaching the embedded logic (not shown) during the singulation process. The addition of the mock bumps <b>108</b> does not add any additional area to the semiconductor die <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The mock bump <b>108</b> may have a maximum diameter of 10 &#x3bc;m. This size is in comparison to the chip interconnects <b>114</b> that may have a diameter in the range of 50 &#x3bc;m to 500 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The number and position of the mock bumps <b>108</b> is an example only, and a double row of the mock bumps <b>108</b> is for simplification. The mock bumps <b>108</b> may be in any position or arrangement near the edge <b>110</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, of the semiconductor die <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a segment of a flip chip integrated circuit <b>500</b> in a contact plating phase of manufacture. The cross-sectional view of a segment of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>500</b> depicts a semiconductor wafer <b>502</b>, such as a silicon wafer, having a bond pad <b>504</b>. The bond pad <b>504</b> may include an aluminum bond pad, a copper bond pad, a nickel bond pad, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The passivation layer <b>124</b> may be deposited on the semiconductor wafer <b>502</b> and the bond pad <b>504</b>, while leaving the top of the bond pad <b>504</b> exposed. The under bump metallization <b>112</b> may consist of several layers of metal each lending a specific characteristic to the stack. For simplicity the layers are not shown in detail. The under bump metallization <b>112</b> may be shown as a single layer for the purpose of this explanation and in further figures. The under bump metallization <b>112</b> may be limited to the region around a specific unit of the bond pad <b>504</b>, or it may extend between several of the bond pads <b>504</b> depending on the internal connections of the embedded logic (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a segment of a flip chip integrated circuit <b>600</b> in a first metal plating phase of manufacture. The cross-sectional view of the segment of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>600</b> depicts the flip chip integrated circuit <b>500</b> having a first photo resist layer <b>602</b> formed thereon. The processing of the first photo resist layer <b>602</b> provides an opening over the under bump metallization <b>112</b> for the mock bump <b>108</b>. The first photo resist layer <b>602</b> may be a temporary layer used in the manufacturing process to set the dimensions of a layer or structure.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The mock bump <b>108</b> may be formed by a deposition of a metal having a high reflow temperature, such as copper (Cu) or nickel (Ni). The high reflow temperature assures that the mock bump <b>108</b> will not change shape during the reflow process of the chip interconnect <b>114</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which has a much lower reflow temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The mock bump <b>108</b> may include two unique but contiguous sections. A bump body <b>604</b>, which may be in the shape of a cylinder, a rectangular solid, or some other geometric shape, and a bump cap <b>606</b>. The bump cap <b>606</b> may be in the shape of a hemisphere or it may have an oval vertical portion. The bump cap <b>606</b> further has a wider diameter than the bump body <b>604</b>. This provides a flat surface beneath the bump cap <b>606</b> that may add to the adhesion with the underfill material <b>122</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The bump body <b>604</b> and the bump cap <b>606</b> may be deposited through the opening in the first photo resist layer <b>602</b> by electroplating to form a structural connection with the under bump metallization <b>112</b>. The shape of the mock bump <b>108</b> will not change after this deposition step. A bump seat <b>608</b> may be completely protected from any copper of nickel contamination by the first photo resist layer <b>602</b>. The bump seat <b>608</b> may be exposed in a later manufacturing step.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a segment of a flip chip integrated circuit <b>700</b> in a second metal plating phase of manufacture. The cross-sectional view of the segment of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>700</b> depicts a second photo resist layer <b>702</b> over the flip chip integrated circuit <b>500</b>. The second photo resist layer <b>702</b> differs from the first photo resist layer <b>602</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, only by its thickness. The first photo resist layer <b>602</b> must be completely removed by a previous process step in order to expose the bump seat <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An opening may be formed in the second photo resist layer <b>702</b> over the bump seat <b>608</b> for exposing the under bump metallization <b>112</b>. An interconnect body <b>704</b> may be formed in the opening by electroplating a solder, such as Lead (Pb), Tin (Sn), Bismuth (Bi), Indium (In), or an alloy thereof. An interconnect cap <b>706</b> may be continuously formed by the continued deposition of the solder above the top of the second photo resist layer <b>702</b>. The deposition of the solder forms a raw interconnect <b>708</b> in the shape of a mushroom, similar to the shape of the mock bump <b>108</b>, though this shape is only temporary. After the deposition of the solder, the second photo resist layer <b>702</b> is completely removed in preparation of the next manufacturing step.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, therein is shown a cross-sectional view of a segment of a flip chip integrated circuit <b>800</b> in a reflow phase of manufacture. The cross-sectional view of the segment of the flip chip integrated circuit <b>800</b> depicts the flip chip integrated circuit <b>500</b> having the mock bump <b>108</b> coupled to the under bump metallization <b>112</b>. The chip interconnect <b>114</b> may have been by reflowing the raw interconnect <b>708</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. During the reflow process, the temperature is maintained below the temperature necessary to reflow the mock bump <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">While the description of the manufacturing process of the mock bump <b>108</b> and the chip interconnect <b>114</b> is an example it may not be the only way to produce the current invention. Other processes may include attaching a pre-formed unit of the mock bump <b>108</b> or the chip interconnect <b>114</b>. Thus the invention is not limited by its manufacturing technique.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It has been unexpectedly discovered that the mushroom shape of the mock bump <b>108</b> supplies a significant improvement in the reliability of the flip chip attachment over and above other shapes that were tested. The combination of the flat surface embedded in the underfill material <b>122</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the adhesion of the rounded section of the bump cap <b>606</b>, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, may prevent or severely restrict the delamination process.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, therein is shown a flow chart of a mock bump system <b>900</b> for manufacturing the mock bump system <b>100</b> for flip chip attach in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system <b>900</b> includes providing a flip chip integrated circuit having an edge in a block <b>902</b> and forming a mock bump near the edge in a block <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It has been discovered that the present invention thus has numerous aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An aspect that has been discovered is that in the present invention the mushroom shape of the mock bump does not melt during the reflow or soldering process and may solve the delamination problem.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another aspect is the addition of the mock bumps over the barrier region of the flip chip integrated circuit may provide additional reliability without impacting the size of the flip chip integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Yet another important aspect of the present invention is that it valuably supports and services the historical trend of reducing costs, simplifying systems, and increasing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">These and other valuable aspects of the present invention consequently further the state of the technology to at least the next level.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, it has been discovered that the mock bump system for flip chip integrated circuits of the present invention furnishes important and heretofore unknown and unavailable solutions, capabilities, and functional aspects for manufacturing reliable flip chip integrated circuits. The resulting processes and configurations are straightforward, cost-effective, uncomplicated, highly versatile and effective, can be surprisingly and unobviously implemented by adapting known technologies, and are thus readily suited for efficiently and economically manufacturing flip chip integrated circuit devices fully compatible with conventional manufacturing processes and technologies. The resulting processes and configurations are straightforward, cost-effective, uncomplicated, highly versatile, accurate, sensitive, and effective, and can be implemented by adapting known components for ready, efficient, and economical manufacturing, application, and utilization.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific best mode, it is to be understood that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the aforegoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations that fall within the scope of the included claims.
