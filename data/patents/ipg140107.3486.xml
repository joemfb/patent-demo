<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present embodiments relate to electrical devices having an electrical plug with prongs to interface with an electrical outlet or receptacle, such as charger devices having stowable prongs.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many different types of portable electronic devices are currently available including: personal data assistants (PDAs), smart phones, handheld computers, two-way pagers, music players and cellular telephones, for example. These portable electronic devices are typically powered by rechargeable power packs, which may include rechargeable batteries, such as rechargeable lithium-ion or nickel cadmium batteries, for example. Rechargeable power packs may be re-charged from a low charge state using a charger that plugs into an electrical wall outlet and the portable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some electrical devices having an electrical outlet with prongs that interface with an electrical receptacle, and that have stowable prongs, that is, prongs that are deployed during use and that are stowed when not in use. An illustrative device that may benefit from stowable prongs is a charger device that provides power to or recharges a power pack of a portable electronic device as described above. In general, charger devices having stowable prongs are smaller than devices having permanently deployed prongs. By reducing the size of the charger device, transportation of the charger device is more convenient for users.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The concepts described herein may be applied to a variety of electrical devices, but for convenience, the concepts will be described with reference to a charger. In addition, the concepts will be described herein with respect to electrical plugs similar to those used in North America, having bladed prongs without a grounding connector. The concepts may be adapted to electrical plugs having grounding connectors. The concepts may further be applicable to plugs used outside of North America. Furthermore, the term &#x201c;prongs&#x201d; as used herein encompasses a variety of male electrical connectors, whether they are blades, round pins, half-round pins, rectangular pins or any other conformation.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an aspect there is provided a charger device for recharging a rechargeable battery of a portable electronic device, the charger device including: a housing; prongs for engaging an electrical outlet, the prongs being coupled to one another by a cross-member and being movable relative to the housing between a retracted position in which the prongs are received in the housing and an extended position in which the prongs protrude from the housing, the prongs being biased toward the extended position; a locking arm comprising a first end, a cut out for receiving the cross-member when the prongs are in the retracted position and a second end for abutting the cross-member when the prongs are in the extended position, the first end of the locking arm being coupled to a carriage and the cutout being provided between the first end and the second end, the locking arm being movable by the carriage into and out of engagement with the cross-member and the locking arm being biased toward the passage; and electrical components for electrically communicating with a portable electronic device to enable charging of a power pack of the portable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, components of an example portable electronic device <b>10</b> are generally shown. The portable electronic device is just one of many electronic devices that may use a charger having stowable prongs, and in some cases, the portable electronic device itself may include stowable prongs. The portable electronic device <b>10</b> includes data communication capabilities and may communicate with other electronic devices directly or through a wireless network. The portable electronic device <b>10</b> is based on the computing environment and functionality of a handheld computer, such as a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA), for example. It will be understood, however, that the portable electronic device <b>10</b> is not limited to a wireless personal digital assistant. Other portable electronic devices are possible, such as cellular telephones, smart telephones, electronic messaging devices, music players, gaming devices, remote controls and laptop computers, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The portable electronic device <b>10</b> includes a number of components including a processor <b>14</b>, which controls the overall operation of the device <b>10</b>. A communication subsystem <b>40</b> controls data and voice communication functions, such as email, PIN (Personal Identification Number) message functions, SMS (Short Message Service) message functions and cellular telephone functions, for example. The communication subsystem <b>40</b> is in communication with a wireless network <b>12</b>, which may be a data-centric wireless network, a voice-centric wireless network or a dual-mode wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the communication subsystem <b>40</b> is a dual-mode wireless network that supports both voice and data communications. The communication subsystem <b>40</b> is configured in accordance with the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) standards. The communication subsystem <b>40</b> may alternatively be configured in accordance with Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE) or Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) standards. Other wireless networks may also be associated with the portable electronic device <b>10</b>, including Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or CDMA2000 networks. Some other examples of data-centric networks include WiFi 802.11, Mobitex&#x2122; and DataTAC&#x2122; network communication systems. Examples of other voice-centric data networks include Personal Communication Systems (PCS) networks like GSM and Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The wireless network <b>12</b> includes base stations (not shown) that provide a wireless link to the portable electronic device <b>10</b>. Each base station defines a coverage area, or cell, within which communications between the base station and the portable electronic device <b>10</b> can be effected. It will be appreciated that the portable electronic device <b>10</b> is movable within the cell and can be moved to coverage areas defined by other cells. Data is delivered to the portable electronic device <b>10</b> via wireless transmission from the base station. Similarly, data is sent from the portable electronic device <b>10</b> via wireless transmission to the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The communication subsystem <b>40</b> further includes a short range communications function, which enables the device <b>10</b> to communicate directly with other devices and computer systems without the use of the wireless network <b>12</b> through infrared or Bluetooth&#x2122; technology, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Prior to the portable electronic device <b>10</b> being able to send and receive communication signals over the wireless network <b>12</b>, network registration or activation procedures typically have been completed. In order to enable network communication, a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card <b>24</b> is inserted into a card interface <b>26</b>. The SIM card, or Removable User Identity Module card, is used to identify the user of the mobile device, store personal device settings and enable access to network services, such as email and voice mail, for example, and is not bound to a particular portable electronic device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The processor <b>14</b> is also connected to a Random Access Memory (RAM) <b>16</b> and a flash memory <b>18</b>. An operating system and device software are typically stored in flash memory <b>18</b> and are executable by the processor <b>14</b>. Some device software components may alternatively be stored in RAM <b>16</b>. The portable electronic device <b>10</b> includes computer executable programmed instructions for directing the portable electronic device <b>10</b> to implement various applications. Some examples of applications that may be stored on and executed by the device <b>10</b> include: electronic messaging, games, calendar, address book and music player applications. Software applications that control basic device operation, such as voice and data communication, are typically installed during manufacture of the device <b>10</b>. For devices that do not include a SIM card <b>24</b>, user identification information may be programmed into the flash memory <b>18</b>. The flash memory <b>18</b> may alternatively be a persistent storage, a Read-Only Memory (ROM) or other non-volatile storage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The processor <b>14</b> receives input from various input devices including a keypad <b>38</b> and other input devices <b>36</b>. The keypad <b>38</b> may be a complete alphanumeric keypad or telephone-type keypad. The other input devices <b>36</b> may replace or complement the keypad <b>38</b> to facilitate input and may include devices such as: single or multi-function buttons, a touch screen, a mouse, a trackball, a capacitive touch sensor or a roller wheel with dynamic button pressing capability. The portable electronic device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown by way of example and it will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that many different device types, shapes and input device configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The processor <b>14</b> outputs to various output devices including an LCD display screen <b>20</b>. A microphone <b>32</b> and speaker <b>22</b> are connected to the processor <b>14</b> for cellular telephone functions. A data port <b>34</b> is connected to the processor <b>14</b> for enabling data communication between the portable electronic device <b>10</b> and another computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The power pack for portable electronic device <b>10</b> may be any kind of power pack, typically having one or more rechargeable elements. For simplicity, the power pack will be illustrated as one or more rechargeable batteries <b>30</b>. Battery interface <b>28</b> enables electric communication between one or more rechargeable batteries <b>30</b> and the processor <b>14</b>, that is, the battery interface <b>28</b> enables electric power to be delivered from one or more rechargeable batteries <b>30</b> to the processor (and perhaps other electrical components as well). A charging interface <b>44</b> provides a connection between the rechargeable battery <b>30</b> and a charger device <b>46</b>, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the battery <b>30</b> is being recharged. The data port <b>34</b> may be incorporated into the charging interface <b>44</b> to provide data lines for data transfer and a supply line for charging a battery <b>30</b> of the portable device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The portable electronic device <b>10</b> is operable in a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal representing information such as a text message, an email message, a media file to be transferred, or web page download is processed by the communication subsystem <b>40</b> and input to the processor <b>14</b>. The processor <b>14</b> further processes the signal and renders images for display on the display screen <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the processed signals may be output to another computing device through the data port <b>34</b>. In order to transmit information in the data communication mode, the user of the portable electronic device <b>10</b> composes information for transmission, such as email messages, for example, using the keypad <b>38</b> and other input devices <b>36</b> in conjunction with the display screen <b>20</b>. The composed information is transmitted through the communication subsystem <b>40</b> over the wireless network <b>12</b> or via short range communications. Operation of the portable electronic device <b>10</b> in the voice communication mode is similar to the data communication mode, however, the received signals are output to the speaker <b>22</b>, or an auxiliary device such as a headset or headphones, and signals for transmission are generated by the microphone <b>32</b>. The portable electronic device <b>10</b> may also include other voice subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, for example. Jack <b>42</b> is provided for receiving an audio accessory such as headphones, a headset, amplified speakers or amplified headphones, for example. Jack <b>42</b> may also receive other accessories such as a multi-media accessory including play, pause, stop and rewind buttons or a TV-out accessory that allows for connection of the portable electronic device to a TV, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that additional subsystems corresponding to additional device features may also be connected to the processor <b>14</b>. Further, although many subsystems that use electrical power have been described, the concepts described herein may be applicable to devices that include subsystems that use electrical power, even if such subsystems have not been specifically described.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a charger device <b>12</b> is generally shown coupled to the portable electronic device <b>10</b>. The charger device <b>12</b> includes a charger unit <b>50</b> and a cable <b>48</b> for connecting the charger unit <b>50</b> to the portable electronic device <b>10</b>. The cable <b>48</b> includes a connector (not shown) for coupling to the charging interface <b>44</b> of the portable electronic device <b>10</b>. Connectors of this type are well known in the art and therefore will not be described further here. The charger device <b>46</b> may be used with any type of portable electronic device <b>10</b> that includes a rechargeable power pack. Examples of portable electronic devices <b>10</b> include: personal data assistants (PDAs), smart phones, handheld computers, two-way pagers, music players and cellular telephone, for example. Typically the charger device <b>46</b> includes one or more electrical components for electrically communicating with the portable electronic device <b>10</b>. That is, the charger device <b>46</b> may include components that convey and/or condition power from an outlet to enable charging of the power pack of the portable electronic device <b>10</b>. Such electrical components may include components such as wires or other conductors, transformers, rectifiers and voltage regulators.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the charger unit <b>50</b> includes a base <b>52</b>, a prong unit <b>54</b>, a locking member <b>56</b> and a cover <b>58</b> that is coupled to the base <b>52</b>. When assembled, the cover <b>58</b> and an end plate <b>62</b> of the base <b>52</b> provide a housing <b>64</b> that may be handled by a user of the portable electronic device <b>10</b> when plugging prongs <b>66</b> of the charger unit <b>14</b> into an electrical outlet (not shown). A prong unit spring <b>60</b> and a locking member spring <b>68</b> are further provided within the housing <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The base <b>52</b> includes four prong unit guides <b>70</b> that extend from the end plate <b>62</b> of the base <b>52</b>. The prong unit guides <b>70</b> define a passage <b>72</b> that is sized for slidably receiving the prong unit <b>54</b>. A post <b>74</b> extends generally from a centre of the end plate <b>62</b> and base flange <b>76</b> is provided adjacent an edge <b>78</b> of the end plate <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The base <b>52</b> further includes detents <b>80</b> that are coupled to the end plate <b>62</b>. The detents <b>80</b> are sized for mating with apertures <b>82</b>, which are provided on opposite sides of the cover <b>58</b>. The detents <b>80</b> are received in the apertures <b>82</b> to hold the cover <b>58</b> and the base <b>52</b> together when assembled, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Alternatively, the base <b>52</b> and cover <b>58</b> may be coupled to one another using an adhesive or an ultrasonic welding process.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Prongs <b>66</b> of the prong unit <b>54</b> are coupled to one another by a cross-member <b>84</b>. The cross-member <b>84</b> is generally rectangular in cross-section, however, may alternatively be circular, oval, square or any other shape. The cross-member <b>84</b> includes an aperture <b>86</b> for receiving the post <b>74</b>. The prong unit <b>54</b> is slidable relative to the base <b>52</b> along a longitudinal axis of the post <b>74</b>. Spacers <b>55</b> are coupled to the cross-member <b>84</b> for abutting an inner surface of the cover <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The locking member <b>56</b> is generally L-shaped and includes locking arms <b>88</b> that are coupled to a carriage <b>90</b>. Each locking arm <b>88</b> includes a cutout <b>92</b> that is provided between a first end <b>94</b>, which is coupled to the carriage <b>90</b>, and a second end <b>96</b> thereof. A flange <b>98</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) and enlarged end <b>100</b> are provided at opposite ends of the carriage <b>90</b>. A post-receiving slot <b>102</b> extends through the carriage <b>90</b> for receiving the post <b>74</b>. The post-receiving slot <b>102</b> is sized to receive the post <b>74</b> with a clearance that allows for some movement of the carriage <b>90</b> relative to the base unit <b>62</b>. The clearance generally being equal to the distance that the carriage is movable into the housing <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, a single locking arm <b>88</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, when assembled, the locking member <b>56</b>, the prong unit spring <b>60</b> and the prong unit <b>54</b> are received over the post <b>74</b>. The locking member spring <b>68</b> is provided between the flange <b>98</b> of the locking member <b>56</b> and the base flange <b>76</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The enlarged end <b>100</b> of the locking member <b>56</b> is aligned with a cutout <b>104</b> of the cover <b>58</b> so that it is accessible by the user to function as a button.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Electrical components <b>112</b> of the charger unit <b>50</b> are shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The electrical components <b>112</b> includes an electrical contact part (not shown) for contacting the prongs <b>66</b> and electrical components provided between the electrical contact part and the cable <b>48</b> of the charger device <b>46</b> for transferring electrical energy from the electrical outlet to the portable electronic device. The electrical contact part may be a metal spring contact or a brush similar to a brush of an electric motor, for example. The electrical components of charging devices are well known in the art and therefore will not be described further herein. An aperture (not shown) is provided in the housing <b>64</b> to allow for the cable <b>48</b> to communicate with the electrical components <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The locking member <b>56</b> is movable between a first position and a second position and is biased toward the first position by the locking member spring <b>68</b>. In the first position, an end surface <b>106</b> of the enlarged end <b>100</b> is generally flush with an outer surface <b>108</b> of the cover <b>58</b>. In the second position, the end surface <b>106</b> of the enlarged end <b>100</b> is received within the housing <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the end surface <b>106</b> of the enlarged end <b>100</b> of the locking member <b>56</b> is a different color than the housing <b>64</b> so that the user is able to quickly locate the enlarged end <b>100</b>. In another embodiment, a word, such as &#x201c;PUSH&#x201d;, for example, is provided on the end surface <b>106</b> of the enlarged end <b>100</b>. Alternatively, a logo, symbol or other characters may be provided on the enlarged end <b>100</b>. In still another embodiment, the end surface <b>100</b> is textured so that the enlarged end <b>100</b> may be easily located by a user who is not looking at the charger unit <b>50</b>. It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that these and other features for facilitating user-location of the button may be provided. In addition, the end <b>98</b> may be any shape that provides a useable surface that a user may press. The end surface <b>106</b> may include protruding features such as waves, dimples or big patterns that allow for quick and easy user location of the button.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The prong unit <b>54</b> is movable between an extended position and a retracted position through passage <b>72</b> and is biased toward the extended position by the prong unit spring <b>60</b>. In the extended position, the prongs <b>66</b> protrude through slots <b>110</b> of the cover <b>58</b>. In the retracted position, the prongs <b>66</b> are received within the housing <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In operation, the charger device <b>46</b> is stored with the prongs <b>66</b> in the retracted position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. To use the charger device <b>46</b>, the user pushes the enlarged end <b>100</b> of the locking member <b>56</b> into the second position and then releases the enlarged end <b>100</b>. This moves the carriage <b>90</b>, which moves cutouts <b>92</b> of the locking arms <b>88</b> out of engagement with the cross-member <b>84</b> of the prong unit <b>54</b>. This allows the prong unit spring <b>60</b> to uncompress and force the prong unit <b>54</b> into the extended position. Once the prong unit <b>54</b> has traveled beyond the second end <b>96</b> of the locking arms <b>88</b>, the carriage <b>90</b> returns to the first position under the force of the locking member spring <b>68</b>. In this position, the locking arms <b>88</b> abut an underside of the cross-member <b>84</b> to restrict movement of the prong unit <b>54</b> into the housing <b>64</b>. The prongs <b>66</b> of the charger device <b>46</b> may then be plugged into an electrical outlet. The battery <b>30</b> of the portable electronic device <b>10</b> may then be charged when the cable <b>48</b> is connected to the charging interface <b>44</b> of the portable electronic device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When charging of the portable electronic device <b>10</b> has finished and the user wishes to stow the charger device <b>46</b>, the user performs the following. The user first pushes the enlarged end <b>100</b> of the locking member <b>56</b> into the second position, then, when the cutout <b>92</b> moves out of engagement with the cross-member <b>84</b>, the user pushes the prongs <b>66</b> at least part way into the housing <b>64</b>, releases the enlarged end <b>100</b> and continues to push the prongs <b>66</b> further into the housing <b>18</b>. When the cutout <b>92</b> is aligned with the cross-member <b>84</b>, the locking member spring <b>68</b> forces the carriage <b>90</b> into the first position and the cutout <b>92</b> receives the cross-member <b>84</b>. Once the prong unit <b>54</b> is locked in the retracted position, the user may release the prongs <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The base <b>52</b>, the cover <b>58</b> and the locking member <b>56</b> and may be injection molded using a non-conductive material. A suitable plastic, such as polycarbonate or ABS, for example, may be used. The prongs <b>66</b> are made of an electrically conductive metal, such as steel, stainless steel or brass, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another embodiment, the prong unit <b>54</b> is stowed at an angle within the housing <b>64</b>. In this embodiment, the prong unit <b>54</b> would follow a track that would move the prongs out of alignment with the slots <b>110</b> in the cover <b>58</b> so that the prongs <b>66</b> would be restricted from extending by the cover. In this embodiment, the prongs <b>66</b> would be closer to the walls of the cover <b>58</b> to allow more room in the middle of the charger unit <b>50</b> for electrical components.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The retractable prongs <b>66</b> of the charger device <b>46</b> allow the overall size of the device <b>46</b> to be reduced. This is particularly useful when traveling because the charger device <b>46</b> may be comfortably carried in the user's pocket or may take up only a small portion of a user's luggage.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Another potential advantage of the charger device <b>46</b> is that the prongs <b>66</b> can be extended and retracted using one hand: a single push of the enlarged end <b>100</b> extends the prongs <b>66</b> from a retracted position and a push of the enlarged end <b>100</b> while pushing the prongs <b>66</b> against a surface retracts the prongs <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, both the extending and retracting actions can be performed in situations where vision is limited by tactilely locating the enlarged end <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another potential advantage is that by providing a retracted position for the charger device <b>46</b>, the chance of snagging the prongs <b>66</b> on clothing or damaging luggage contents is reduced. Further, the chance of accidental stowing of the prongs is reduced by one or more physical features described above. For example, a user's action of inserting the prongs into an electrical outlet (whether due to friction with the outlet or misalignment of the prongs with the respective sockets) will not ordinarily cause the prongs to be stowed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Specific embodiments have been shown and described herein. However, modifications and variations may occur to those skilled in the art. All such modifications and variations are believed to be within the scope and sphere of the present embodiments.</p>
