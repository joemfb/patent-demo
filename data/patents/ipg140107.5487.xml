<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. Also, the following detailed description does not limit the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The term &#x201c;content,&#x201d; as used herein, is intended to be broadly interpreted to include, for example, visual data, audio data, a combination of audio data and visual data, or other forms of media content. By way of example, content may include television content and Internet content. Television content may include local programming, national programming, free programming, live-programming (e.g., a live broadcast, etc.), etc.), movies, sports, news, video-on-demand (VoD) content, premium channel content, premium channel bundles (e.g., Home Box Office and Cinemax, etc.), pay-per-view (PPV) content, television guides, weather information, sports information, traffic information, horoscope information, games, etc. Internet content may include podcasts, web sites, etc. The content may be in various formats, such as, for example, standard definition, high-definition, 3-D, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to exemplary embodiments described herein, an AI-based recommender may recommend content, customer equipment, types of service, levels of service, packages of service, etc., to a customer. According to an exemplary embodiment, the AI-based recommender may use rules, weights associated with the rules, as well as other data and factors to be described further below. In contrast to other recommenders, which make recommendations that are not customer-specific or not tailored to a particular customer, the AI-based recommender described may make recommendations that are customer-specific and tailored to the customer. For example, the customer may be identified when using a service based on a manual log-in or automatically identified (e.g., a device identifier that is mapped to the customer). Once the customer is identified, a qualification process may be initiated to select new products, services, etc., to the customer. For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, the qualification process may include identifying products, services, etc., to which the customer is subscribed and compare those products, services, etc., to a pool of products, services, etc., available. The qualification process may select products, services, etc., for which the customer qualifies. These selected products, services, etc., may be provided to the AI-based recommender. The AI-based recommender may then make customer-specific recommendations to the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additionally, according to an exemplary embodiment, a self-provisioner may provide the recommendations to the customer in a customer-specific manner. For example, the self-provisioner may generate user interfaces in correspondence to the customer-specific recommendations. For example, the self-provisioner may generate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that correspond to the recommendations and which allow the customer to select the recommendations. For example, the customer may purchase content, a service, or other things which may be recommended, as described further below. In turn, the self-provisioner may process the customer's request and allow the customer to self-provision the purchasing, etc., various content, services, packages, equipment, etc.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a diagram illustrating exemplary criteria that AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use to generate recommendations. For example, as illustrated, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may receive a list of qualified products, services, etc., pertaining to a customer. AI-based recommender may use rules <b>305</b>, data <b>310</b>, and factors <b>315</b> to generate recommendations. According to other exemplary embodiments, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use additional, fewer, and/or different types of rules, data, factors, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For purposes of description, rules <b>305</b> may be categorized as primary rules, secondary rules, and exclusionary rules, however, other categorizations may be used and/or such categorizations may not be used. The primary rules may include criteria that are based on, among other things, customer profile, customer behavior (e.g., usage, etc.), customer affinities, associations between customer's current subscription, equipment, etc., and possible recommendations, customer's changes in service (e.g., purchasing, cancelling, upgrading, etc.), popularity of recommendations, etc. For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, the primary rules may include criteria pertaining to one or more of the following: (1) migration history; (2) association of possible recommendations with one or more factors (e.g., location, time of year, etc.); (3) customer affinity based on customer's current subscription, equipment, level of service, and/or other service-related parameters, relative to possible recommendations; (4) customers' previous purchase and cancellation of possible recommendations; (5) customer's current subscription, equipment, etc., and all possible recommendations (e.g., based on popularity); (6) based on customer's viewership of content; or (7) sale statistics of possible recommendations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The secondary rules may include criteria that may be based on, among other things, time-based criteria (e.g., time difference between last purchase and recommendation date, length of time customer has been a customer, etc.), customer interest (e.g., with respect to a recommendation, other content, other services, etc.), trends of recommendations with respect to other customers, an appreciation value or a depreciation value of a recommendation with respect to a location associated with the customer, etc. An example of secondary rules is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The exclusionary rules may include criteria that may eliminate a recommendation from being provided to a customer. For example, the customer may already have the recommended service, the recommended equipment, the recommended content, etc. (e.g., a recent purchase, etc.), internal marketing directives may prohibit the offering of particular recommendations, the customer's history indicates previous exposure to the recommendation but no interest, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As previously described, according to exemplary embodiments, weights may be associated with rules <b>305</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use these weights for generating recommendations. For example, when AI-based recommender <b>110</b> generates recommendations relating to content, a weight may be assigned to a particular content. AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use these weights to determine which content to select as a recommendation. According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may have a maximum weight for a recommendation (e.g., not greater than 1, etc.). According to another exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may not have a maximum weight for a recommendation. Rules <b>305</b> and weights associated with rules <b>305</b> are described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Depending on the service(s) to which the customer is subscribed, the generated recommendations may be provided to the customer via those service(s). In the case of when the customer subscribes to multiple services, the recommendations may be provided to the customer via one or more of those services. For example, recommendations for voice service or Internet service may be provided to the customer via the customer's television service, in addition to or instead of, via the customer's phone service or Internet service.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use data <b>310</b> and factors <b>315</b>, in addition to rules <b>305</b>, to generate recommendations. Data <b>310</b> may include various types of data pertaining to customers. By way of example, data <b>310</b> may include service usage (e.g., viewing patterns of content, number of calls, type of calls (e.g., long distance, international, etc.) etc.), purchasing history, cancellation history, changes of service, content searches, location of the customer, type of equipment, type of service (e.g., level of service, etc.), calls to customer service (e.g., content of calls, etc.), digital video recorder (DVR) usage, etc. Data <b>310</b> may include archived data (e.g., recommendation data, data-mined data, etc.), as further described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Depending on which rule <b>305</b> is used, data <b>310</b> may pertain to the customer to which the recommendation is directed and/or pertain to other customers.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, according to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use factors <b>315</b>. By way of example, factors may include time of the year (e.g., week, month, season, holiday, etc.), the location of the customer (e.g., ZIP code of customer, city of customer, state of customer, etc.), current events (e.g., success of a sports team, success of a movie, which may be shown on a premier movie channel, etc.), the state of the economy (e.g., strength of economy vis-&#xe0;-vis price of recommendation, etc.), sale history pertaining to a recommendation, release of new service (e.g., from cable to fiber optic), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use one or more portions of data <b>310</b> and/or factors <b>315</b>, in conjunction with rules <b>305</b> to generate recommendations. For example, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use data <b>310</b> and/or factors <b>315</b> to generate a recommendation and/or a weight associated with the recommendation.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Described below is an example of the primary rules, the secondary rules, and the exclusionary rules of rules <b>305</b>. In this example, rules <b>305</b> may pertain to generating recommendations for television content. For example, the television content may correspond to a package or a bundle of packages (e.g., a premier movie package, a sports package, movie bundles, etc.). According to other exemplary embodiments, rules <b>305</b> may pertain to generating recommendations for other types of content, equipment, etc., as previously described. Additionally, in this example, data <b>310</b>, and factors <b>315</b> may relate to generating recommendations that pertain to television content. In this regard, depending on the service (e.g., television, Internet, voice, etc.) and/or content for which a service provider may be generating recommendations, rules <b>305</b>, data <b>310</b>, and/or factors <b>315</b> may be different than that described in this example. For example, with respect to voice service, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may generate recommendations relating to service packages (e.g., a long-distance calls package, an international calling package, etc.). Similarly, with respect to Internet service, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may generate recommendations relating to service packages (e.g., upload/download speed packages, etc.). Additionally, for example, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may generate recommendations on a per customer basis or a per device basis. For example, if the customer has multiple SPN TV interface devices <b>160</b>, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may generate recommendations independently for each SPN TV interface device <b>160</b> versus on a customer basis.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this example, the primary rules may include criteria pertaining to the following: (1) migration from one package to another package; (2) association of packages with respect to one or multiple factors for customers that have at least one package; (3) affinity of a customer purchasing a portion of a multi-package combination when the customer already is subscribed to another portion of the multi-package combination; (4) affinity of a customer having a package to purchase another package; (5) purchases and cancellations of the same package; (6) current package of the customer and all combinations of packages that may be offered with the current package; (7) the customer's viewing of a sports package to recommend another sports package; (8) association of packages with respect to one or multiple factors for customers with no packages; (9) an assessment of the sales of a newly launched package, and an affinity of the customers' current package(s) with the newly launched package. The primary rules are described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As previously described, the primary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include migration from one package to another. For example, the rule may pertain to an affinity of a customer having a package (e.g., a package X) to purchase another package (e.g., a package Y). The weight associated with this rule may correspond to a probability of the customer having the package X and purchasing the other package Y. The weight may be calculated according to the following exemplary expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=[no. of customer purchasing package <i>Y </i>after package <i>X</i>]/[no. of customers purchasing package <i>X]. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to an exemplary embodiment, a weight may be calculated for all package combinations. If a customer has the package X, then AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may select a package Y having a higher weight relative to another package Y. Additionally, if package Y does not include package X, but a combination offer exists that includes both package X and package Y, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may select the combination offer.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 2), the primary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include an association of packages with one or multiple factors (e.g., location, time of year, etc.) for customers that have at least one package. The weight associated with this rule may correspond to a level of association (e.g., the greater the weight, the higher the association is with the factor(s)). The weight may be calculated according to the following exemplary expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=[no. of particular package sold]/[total no. of packages sold].<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
For example, if the factor corresponds to location (e.g., ZIP code), the weight may be calculated for a particular ZIP code with respect to a particular package sold and all packages sold in the ZIP code.
</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">On the basis of the weight, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may select one or multiple packages. For example, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may select a package having a higher weight than another package having a lower weight.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may calculate another weight (i.e., a second weight) for the one or multiple packages selected based on the first weight. For example, the second weight may correspond to sales of the package with respect to one or multiple time periods (e.g., 2 months, 6 months, 1 year, etc.). If multiple time periods are used, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may calculate differential changes in the percentage of sales. Additionally, or alternatively, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may calculate an average percentage of sales of the package based on the one or multiple time periods. Additionally, or alternatively, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may calculate the above-mentioned sales trends on a per location-basis (e.g., per ZIP code, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to an exemplary embodiment, when AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may calculate multiple weights, such as the first weight and the second weight, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may determine a final weight. By way of example, the first weight and the second weight may be added together or some other type of mathematical operation (e.g., division, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) may be performed to determine the final weight. According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may identify customers (e.g., customer identifiers, etc.) and/or customer premises devices (e.g., SPN TV interface devices <b>160</b>, etc., by way of address, equipment identifier, etc.) that are not subscribed to the one or multiple packages selected. AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may select one or multiple packages based on the above information (e.g., final weights, packages to which customers are not subscribed, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 3), the primary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include an affinity of a customer purchasing a portion of a multi-package combination when the customer already is subscribed to another portion of the multi-package combination. For example, suppose a customer has two packages of a combination that includes three packages. The weight associated with this rule may correspond to a ratio of a customer having the complete multi-package combination to those that may have only a portion of the multi-package combination. According to such an example, the weight may correspond to a ratio of a customer having all three packages to those customers having two packages of the three packages available. The weight may be calculated according to the following exemplary expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=[no. of customers having all packages of a combination]/[no. of customers having a portion of the packages of the combination].<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The weight may be calculated for all package combinations. For example, according to the three package scenario, the weight may be expressed according to the following exemplary expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=[no. of customers having packages <i>X,Y,Z</i>]/[no. of customers having a portion of the packages <i>X,Y,Z]. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
In this example, the weight may be calculated for customers that have packages X and Y, packages X and Z, packages Y and Z, as well as the remaining package combinations.
</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may recommend the missing package(s) of the combination that has/have the highest weight(s).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 4), the primary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include an affinity of a customer having a package to purchase another package. For example, suppose a customer has a package X but does not have a package Y. The weight associated with this rule may correspond to a probability of the customer having a package to purchase another package. The weight may be calculated according to the following exemplary expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=[no. of customers having multiple packages]/[no. of customers purchasing less than the multiple packages]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The weight may be calculated for all package combinations. For example, according to a two package scenario in which the customer has package X and a package Y may be recommended, the weight may be expressed according to the following expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=[no. of customers having packages <i>X </i>and <i>Y</i>]/[no. of customers purchasing package <i>X], </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
in which it is assumed that the customer already has package X. According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may recommend the package with the highest weight.
</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 5), the primary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include purchase and cancellation histories of the same package with other customers and/or the customer to which the recommendation may be directed. The weight may be calculated according to the following exemplary expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=([no. of purchases of this package]/[no. of purchases of all of the packages])*Constant,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
in which the constant may correspond to a normalization factor that may have a value between 0 and 1. According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may recommend the same package or a combination of packages if there are any package(s) available.
</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 6), the primary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include a customer's current package and all combinations of packages that may be offered with the current package. For example, based on the customer's current package, all combination of packages may be considered. According to an exemplary embodiment, the weight may be calculated based on the popularity of the combination package being recommended.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 7), the primary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include the customer's viewing of a sports package to recommend another sports package. The weight may be calculated as an average of the maximum weights for each customer with respect to recommendation(s) made by the other primary rules.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 8), the primary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include an association of packages with one or multiple factors (e.g., location, time of year, etc.). This rule is identical to rule 2. However, this rule may apply to customers that do not have any packages. The weight associated with this rule may correspond to a level of association (e.g., the greater the weight, the higher the association is with the factor(s)). The weight may be calculated according to the following exemplary expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=[no. of particular package sold]/[total no. of packages sold]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
For example, if the factor corresponds to location (e.g., ZIP code), the weight may be calculated for a particular ZIP code with respect to a particular package sold and all packages sold in the ZIP code.
</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the basis of the weight, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may select one or multiple packages. For example, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may select a package having a higher weight than another package having a lower weight.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 9), the primary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include an assessment of the sales of a newly launched package, and an affinity of the customer's current package(s) with the newly launched package. The weight pertaining to the sales of the newly launched package may be calculated according to the following exemplary expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=[no. of sales of newly launched package]/[total no. of packages sold],<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
in which the sales may be considered over some period of time (e.g., 30 days, etc.).
</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, the weight pertaining to the affinity of the customer's current package(s) may be calculated according to the following exemplary expression:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Weight=[customer with a package having an affinity to the newly launched package]/[total no. of customers having the newly launched package],<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
in which for customers that have the newly launched package, it is determined what other packages, if any, they may have.
</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may determine a final weight based on the above-mentioned weights. By way of example, the first weight and the second weight may be added together or some other type of mathematical operation (e.g., division, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) may be performed to determine the final weight. According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may select a newly launched package to recommend to a customer based on the final weight.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this example, the secondary rules may include criteria pertaining to the following: (1) the weight for the recommendation packages may be increased if the duration between a last purchase date and the recommendation date is less than an average duration for customers that transition between the current package and the recommendation packages; (2) the weight for the recommended packages may be increased if the customer ever viewed the recommended packages; and (3) regional package weight depreciation. AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may apply the secondary rules to recommendation data generated based on the primary rules.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As previously described, the secondary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include increasing the weight of recommended packages if the duration between the last purchase date and the recommendation date is less than an average duration for customers that transition between the current package and the recommendation packages. According to this rule (i.e., rule 1), customers that have purchased more than one packages (e.g., two or more) may be identified. Then, for each customer, all the possible combination of packages purchased (referred to as a to-package) and all the possible combination of packages previously purchased (referred to as a from-package), as well as the duration between the two purchases may be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may determine the number of customers making purchases of the to-package when they already have purchased the from-package, during the particular duration. AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may group the customers according to the number of customers pertaining to the packages corresponding to the to-and-from packages. AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may select a certain number of groups (e.g., top group(s)) to further consider for recommendations.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may calculate an average number of days taken by the customers in each group to purchase the to-package relative to when the customers purchased the from-package. AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may then determine whether the customer to which AI-based recommender <b>110</b> is recommending, has the recommended package as the to-package and the from-package, and the duration between the last date of purchase and the recommended date is less than or equal to a particular time period (e.g., 4 days, etc.), the weight assigned to the recommended package may be increased by a particular percentage or multiplier (e.g., 150%, 1.3 times, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 2), the secondary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include increasing the weight of a recommended package if the customer has viewed any of the recommended package. By way of example, if the customer had viewed a free weekend of HBO, then if the recommended package corresponds to a subscription to HBO, the weight of the recommended package may be increased by a particular percentage or multiplier.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 3), the secondary rules of rules <b>305</b> may include decreasing the weight of recommended packages that correspond to regional packages (e.g., a Spanish package, etc.) when the customer has already viewed the recommended package, made price inquiries with respect to the recommended package, or expressed some other initial interest in the recommended package, but never purchased the recommended package.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In this example, the exclusionary rules may include criteria pertaining to the following: (1) eliminate a recommendation for customers that have multiple views of the package but no purchases (e.g., reflecting a lesser probability of conversion); (2) eliminate a recommendation if the customer has already purchased the package; and (3) exclude a recommendation if the package is not supposed to be recommended. AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may apply the exclusionary rules to recommendation data generated based on the secondary rules.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As previously described, the exclusionary rules may include eliminating a recommendation for a customer that has had multiple views of the recommendation package but no purchases. For example, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may determine what packages the customer has viewed and purchased. With reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 2), AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may eliminate a recommendation if the customer has already purchased the recommended package. Additionally, with reference to the next rule (i.e., rule 3), AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may eliminate a recommendation if the package is a package that cannot be recommended. By way of example, the package may correspond to particular content that the customer has requested not to receive (e.g., related to content filtering). According to another example, the customer may be receiving a free promotional offer a package (e.g., 3 free months of HBO) and the service provider may wish to prohibit certain other packages from being recommended (e.g., 3 free months of Starz) while the customer is already receiving the free promotional offer.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use additional rules if, for example, a sufficient number of recommendations are not generated. For example, the additional rules may include recommendations for default packages, such as movie packages, family packages, sports packages, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary process that AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may perform to generate a recommendation. According to other exemplary embodiments, the order of the rules may be different. By way of example, one or more of the exclusionary rules may be applied concurrently with the primary rules and/or the secondary rules.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and in accordance with that previously described, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use various types of data (e.g., data <b>310</b>) and factors <b>315</b> (illustrated as data feed) when applying rules <b>305</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment, the data feed may include archived data (e.g., past recommendations, etc.). For example, according to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may archive recommendation data that is generated after applying each of the primary rules, the secondary rules, and the exclusionary rules. In this way, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may learn by using the archived data as a feedback mechanism. For example, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may modify rules <b>305</b>, factors <b>315</b>, etc., used for generating recommendations.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As previously described, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may apply a rule set (e.g., primary rules, secondary rules, etc) to recommendation data that is generated after applying a particular set of rules. For example, a primary recommendation set (e.g., recommendation data) may be used by AI-based recommender <b>110</b> when applying the secondary rules and a secondary recommendation set may be used by AI-based recommender <b>110</b> when applying the exclusionary rules.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C-3F</figref> are diagrams illustrating exemplary recommendations generated by an exemplary embodiment of AI-based recommender <b>110</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>, in this example, it may be assumed that the customer's current subscription includes HBO and Cinemax. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, after application of the primary rules, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may generate recommendations. For example, based on rule 1, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may recommend a Karaoke package and a Movies/HBO package. In this example, each recommendation includes a particular weight. For example, the Movies/HBO package has a weight of 16.00%. As further illustrated, application of the secondary rules may not impact the recommendations generated from the primary rules. Additionally, the exclusionary rules may cause the recommendation of the Movies/HBO package to be removed since the customer already has HBO and Cinemax.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may apply additional rules to generate additional recommendations, such as, for example, WWE, NHL Center Ice, and NBA League Pass. AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may then generate a final recommendation that includes the Movies/HBO/Cinemax package, Epix, Karaoke, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3E and 3F</figref>, in this example, it may be assumed that the customer's current subscription includes the Movie/HBO/Cinemax package. Additionally, the customer's history may include purchasing and dropping NBA League Pass Regular Season for $189.00 and purchasing and dropping NFL Mid-Season Red Zone for $29.00. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, after application of the primary rules, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may generate recommendations. For example, based on rule 2, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may recommend Epix. Additionally, as illustrated, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may recommend other content based on other rules (e.g. rule 7, rule 9, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As further illustrated, application of the secondary rules and the exclusionary rules may not impact the recommendations generated from the primary rules. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may apply additional rules to generate additional recommendations, such as, for example, Karaoke, WWE, and NHL Center Ice. AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may generate a final recommendation that includes Epix, NFL Mid-Season Red Zone, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As previously described, according to an exemplary embodiment, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may provide the recommendations to self-provisioner <b>115</b>. Self provisioner <b>115</b> may generate a user interface that is customer-specific and in correspondence to the recommendations. Additionally, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may allow the customer to self-provision (e.g., subscribe to, purchase, etc.) the recommendations presented.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As previously described, according to an exemplary embodiment, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may generate a customer-specific, user interface to present the recommendations to the customer. For example, the user interface may correspond to a GUI that provides the customer with the recommendations and allows the customer to select a recommendation. According to other embodiments, the user interface may be different. For example, depending on the type of service the customer has with the service provider (e.g., telephone, Internet, television, etc.), the recommendations may be presented to the customer aurally, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to an exemplary embodiment, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may generate the user interface based on an order of likelihood that the customer may select the recommendation. For example, when AI-based recommender <b>110</b> generates multiple recommendations and provides them to self-provisioner <b>115</b>, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may provide the recommendations in an order corresponding to a likelihood that the customer may select a recommendation (e.g., in a list, etc.). Based on the order of the recommendations, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may generate the customer-specific user interface. By way of example, when the user interface corresponds to a GUI, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may select a GUI (e.g., from a database, etc.) that corresponds to a recommendation. Self-provisioner <b>115</b> may continue this process and generate a GUI that corresponds to an order of the recommendations. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may generate and present to a customer a GUI that offers the recommendations to the customer, and the customer may navigate through the GUI and select a desired recommendation.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">According to an exemplary embodiment, when a customer selects a recommendation (e.g., to purchase, to subscribe, etc.), self-provisioner <b>115</b> may process the customer's response. For example, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may provision the customer's request or forward the customer's request to a provisioning system.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">While it has been described that AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may use data <b>310</b> and/or factors <b>315</b> to generate recommendations and/or weights associated with the recommendations, according to an exemplary embodiment, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may modify an order of the recommendations based on data <b>310</b> and/or factors <b>315</b>. By way of example, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may modify the order of recommendations based on pricing of each recommendation, and/or some other factor. For example, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may re-order the recommendations from lowest price to highest price. According to other embodiments, as previously described, self-provisioner <b>115</b> may not modify the order of the recommendations or the weights associated with the recommendations.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are flow diagrams illustrating an exemplary process associated with exemplary embodiments of customer identifier <b>120</b>, AI-based recommender <b>110</b>, and self-provisioner <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, process <b>500</b> may include providing a service to a customer (block <b>505</b>). For example, as previously described, a service provider may provide one or more services to a customer. For example, SPN <b>105</b> may provide various services (e.g., television, Internet access, phone, etc.) to a customer.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A customer may be identified (block <b>510</b>). For example, as previously described, a customer may be identified automatically or based on manual input from the customer depending on which service is being used, how the service is accessed, etc. As an example, if the customer accesses a customer service portal on the Internet, the customer may manually log-in to access his/her account. Alternatively, when the customer uses his/her user device <b>170</b>, a telephone number or an equipment identifier may permit customer identifier <b>120</b> to identify the customer. Alternatively, when the customer uses his/her desktop computer to access the Internet via SPN Internet interface device <b>175</b>, a device identifier of the SPN Internet interface device may be obtained to identify the customer. Alternatively, when the customer uses his/her SPN TV interface device <b>160</b>, a device identifier of the SPN TV interface device <b>160</b> may be obtained to identify the customer. Customer identifier <b>120</b> may identify the customer based on the device identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Products and/or services may be selected for which the customer qualifies (block <b>515</b>). For example, as previously described, customer identifier <b>120</b> may select products and/or services for which the identifier customer qualifies. For example, customer identifier <b>120</b> may determine the products, services, etc., associated with the identified customer by accessing a customer profile database. Customer identifier <b>120</b> may also determine products, services, etc., that may be offered by the SP or associated with a particular marketing campaign. Based on a comparison between products, services, etc., currently associated with the customer and those available, customer identifier <b>120</b> may select products, services, etc., for which the customer qualifies. As an example, a particular marketing campaign may include up-selling premier movie channels or high-definition set top boxes with digital video recorder (DVR) services. Customer identifier <b>120</b> may provide a list of products and/or services for which the customer qualifies, as well as information that identifies the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Data mining with respect to a customer may be performed (block <b>520</b>). For example, as previously described, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> or some other system may perform data mining, knowledge discovery, etc. to create a repository of data (e.g., data <b>310</b>) to be used by AI-recommender <b>110</b> to generate recommendations. For example, the data may pertain to the customer, other customers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Factors may be received (block <b>525</b>). For example, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may receive one or more factors (e.g., factors <b>315</b>) to be used when generating recommendations and/or weights associated with the recommendations. For example, network administrators may provide AI-based recommender <b>110</b> with the one or more factors.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, rules for generating recommendations may be received (block <b>530</b>). For example, AI-based recommender <b>110</b> may receive rules (e.g., rules <b>305</b>) to be used when generating recommendations and/or weights associated with the recommendations. For example, network administrators may provide AI-based recommender <b>110</b> with the rules.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Recommendations having weights may be generated based on the data, factors, and the rules (block <b>535</b>). For example, as previously described, AI-recommender <b>110</b> may generate recommendations based on data <b>310</b>, factors <b>315</b>, and/or rules <b>305</b>. Additionally, for example, as previously described, AI-recommender <b>110</b> may generate weights for the recommendations.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A user interface for presenting the recommendations to the customer may be generated (block <b>540</b>). For example, as previously described, self-provisioner <b>110</b> may generate a user interface for providing the recommendations to the customer(s).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The user interface may be provided to the customer to self-provision (block <b>545</b>). For example, as previously described, self-provisioner <b>110</b> may provide the user interface to the customer(s) via a service (e.g., phone service, Internet access service, television service).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A customer's selection of a recommendation may be received (block <b>550</b>). For example, as previously described, self-provisioner <b>110</b> may receive a customer's selections of a recommendation.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The customer's selection may be provisioned (block <b>555</b>). For example, as previously described, self-provisioner <b>110</b> may provision the customer's selection or send the customer's selection to another provisioning system.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate an exemplary process <b>500</b> for generating customer-specific recommendations and self-provisioning of those recommendations, according to other embodiments, process <b>500</b> may include additional operations, fewer operations, and/or different operations than those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> and described herein.
