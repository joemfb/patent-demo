<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority for German Patent Application #DE10 2010 029 787.9 filed on Jun. 8, 2010 and the same is incorporated herein as if fully set forth.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a front module for a motor vehicle and to a method for producing a front module.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally known from the prior art are front modules for motor vehicles, which front modules are composed entirely of metal. Such front modules have generally been credited with the advantage of having high mechanical stability. A disadvantage of such front modules is however the high weight on account of the use of metal. Furthermore, such front modules must for example additionally be provided, in a complex manner, with corrosion protection, which increases the production costs of corresponding front modules.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also known from the prior art, for example from EP 1 612 024 A1, are composite components having a carrier component and a covering component composed of plastic and having arranged between said components a reinforcement component composed of metal.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast, the invention is based on the object of providing a front module for a motor vehicle and also a method for producing a front module.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The objects on which the invention is based are achieved in each case by means of the features of the independent patent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are specified in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A front module for a motor vehicle is specified, wherein the front module is in one piece and is composed exclusively of plastic. Here, use must be made of a high-strength plastic, wherein high mechanical stability of the front module is ensured on account of its being in one piece. Because only plastic is used, it is for example possible to provide any desired shapes and radii of the front module. Complex lacquering for the purpose of providing corrosion protection is likewise dispensed with. Furthermore, a corresponding front module has a significantly lower inherent weight than a front module which additionally has metal. In this way, it is ultimately possible for the overall weight of a vehicle to be reduced, which firstly lowers the energy consumption of the vehicle and secondly results in higher acceleration values of said vehicle for the same drive power.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one embodiment of the invention, the front module has a trapezoidal shape with two horizontal support elements which are spaced apart from one another and two vertical support elements which are spaced apart from one another, wherein at least two of the support elements are connected to one another by transverse struts. It is pointed out that, in the invention, the expression &#x201c;trapezoidal&#x201d; should not be understood to mean a mathematically exact trapezoidal shape. Said expression should rather be understood to mean that the front module is composed substantially of four sides, wherein said sides, similarly to those of a trapezium, are correspondingly aligned parallel to or inclined with respect to one another. This therefore however also includes embodiments which have, for example with regard to one of said sides, a significantly elongated V-shape or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is also pointed out that the expressions &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; and &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; serve merely for general definition and do not restrict the alignment of the support elements, for example in relation to a vehicle body or generally in relation to a front module.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The use of transverse struts has the advantage that forces acting on the individual support elements can be distributed in an efficient manner over the entire front module. The mechanical stability of the front module is significantly increased in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to one embodiment of the invention, the upper horizontal support element is connected by the transverse struts to the vertical support element or to the lower horizontal support element. This has the advantage that normally high forces acting on the upper horizontal support element can be dissipated effectively over the entire front module. In this way, the stability of the upper horizontal carrier element need not imperatively be so high that forces acting on said support element can correspondingly be dissipated to the vertical support elements. Although the total mass of the front module is increased as a result of the introduction of the transverse struts, the total weight can however be reduced overall in turn as a result of the weight saving on account of the fact that the horizontal upper support element can be formed with lower stability.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a further embodiment of the invention, the support elements are composed of a first plastic and the transverse struts are composed of a second plastic. Here, the first plastic is significantly less strong than the second plastic. This has numerous advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Firstly, this yields a significant cost saving, because high-strength and expensive plastics are used only where correspondingly high forces need to be conducted. As already mentioned above, forces acting in particular on the upper horizontal support element are dissipated via the transverse struts to the front module, such that it is adequate to ensure particularly high stability and stiffness of the transverse struts. A further advantage is attained if the first plastic is a plastic which can be deformed in the event of a collision of a person against the front module. In other words, the use of two plastics of different hardness can therefore serve to provide pedestrian protection.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, it may be specified in this regard that, above a collision speed of 30 kilometres per hour of a person against the front module, a deformation of the latter occurs such that, in this way, the collision energy is reduced and furthermore the risk of injury for certain types of injury decreases. In particular, it may be provided for this purpose that the upper horizontal support element is designed especially to provide such pedestrian protection. That is to say, if a pedestrian collides with the engine hood arranged thereabove, the collision energy can be dissipated by the correspondingly regulated deformation of the upper horizontal support element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further embodiment of the invention, at least one of the support elements has at least a first and a second section, wherein the first section is composed of the first plastic and the second section is composed of the second plastic. In this way, local sections of the front module can be mechanically reinforced. In this way, it is possible for example to make allowance for the fact that forces can act on different sections of the front module in a particularly significant way.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The front module has for example longitudinal support plates, preferably likewise produced from plastic and integrally connected to the front module. Said longitudinal support plates are arranged on the vertical support elements and are provided for fastening the front module to a vehicle body. If in particular the longitudinal support plates are now arranged on the vertical support elements at the level of the connection points between the respective vertical support elements and the transverse struts, a transmission of force from the front module to the vehicle body takes place to a high degree via said longitudinal support plates. If, therefore, the longitudinal support plates and also the regions of the connection points of the respective vertical support elements and the longitudinal support plates are now composed of the second plastic, it is ensured that no deformation of the front module occurs at the stated points on account of the high forces acting. In other words, high strength of the front module is ensured in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It may thus be summarized that, in such an embodiment, the entire front module is monolithic, that is to say in one piece, and is composed exclusively of plastic. Here, said front module notionally comprises both the horizontal and vertical support elements and also the transverse struts and the longitudinal support plates. Such a front module may be produced for example in a two-component injection-moulding process in substantially two working steps, as a result of which a front module can be produced in a cost-effective way. Welding and other methods for connecting individual elements of the front module to one another are therefore dispensed with.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this connection, it is also pointed out that the present invention is not restricted to the use of only two plastics. It is also possible for more than two types of plastics to be used. For example, the horizontal support elements may be produced from a different plastic material than the vertical support elements. The longitudinal support plates may also have a different plastic material, which makes particular allowance for the high forces acting on the longitudinal support plates.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a further embodiment of the invention, the second plastic is encapsulated by injection moulding by the first plastic. Here, &#x201c;encapsulated by injection moulding&#x201d; should not be understood restrictively to mean that the second plastic is completely enveloped by the first plastic. It is also possible in principle in this regard for the second plastic to be partially surrounded by the first plastic. This has the advantage that, similarly to the steel reinforcement in a concrete wall, use can be made both of the mechanical properties of the first plastic and also those of the second plastic. For example, if on account of the high mechanical stability the second plastic is more brittle and can be subjected only insufficiently to bending loads, it is possible by means of the combination with the first plastic and the lower mechanical stiffness thereof to profit from the fact that, as a result of the combination, an element is produced which has excellent mechanical properties both under compressive loading and also under bending loading. The overall stability of a correspondingly produced front module is thereby significantly increased.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a further embodiment of the invention, the front module also has a receptacle for a lock for a bonnet of a motor vehicle, wherein the receptacle is constructed on the upper horizontal support element. The second section between the connection points of the transverse struts to the upper horizontal support element may for example serve for this purpose. In general, at least one of the support elements has at least a first and a second section, wherein the first section is composed of the first plastic and the second section is composed of the second plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The connection of a receptacle for a lock for a bonnet of a motor vehicle to the upper horizontal support element has the advantage that forces acting on the front module in particular as a result of the closure of an engine hood can be absorbed and distributed over the front module as a whole in an effective manner. Here, if parts of the front module additionally serve for pedestrian protection, the corresponding region of the upper horizontal support element may be designed such that, as described above, corresponding impact energy can be dissipated from the bonnet to the front module, and energy dissipation simultaneously takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method for producing a front module as described above by means of a two-component injection-moulding process, wherein the method has the following steps:</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">a) providing an injection-moulding device having a first and a second cavity,</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">b) injecting the second plastic into the first cavity in order to obtain an injection-moulded part,</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">c) transferring the injection-moulded part into the second cavity,</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">d) injecting the second plastic into the first cavity in order to obtain a further injection-moulded part, and injecting the first plastic into the second cavity in order to obtain the front module,</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">e) withdrawing the front module from the second cavity, and repeating steps c-e.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Such a process yields the advantage that corresponding front modules can be produced in a continuous manner: that is to say, while steps c-e are repeated, production both of the injection-moulded part and also of the front module takes place continuously, wherein the injection-moulded part is integrated in the front module. It is possible in particular to realize a mass production process in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The transfer of the injection-moulded part into the second cavity and the withdrawal of the front module from the second cavity may be realized for example using corresponding robots.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a further embodiment of the invention, the injection-moulded part is encapsulated by injection moulding by the first plastic.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">These and other aspects of the disclosed subject matter, as well as additional novel features, will be apparent from the description provided herein. The intent of this summary is not to be a comprehensive description of the claimed subject matter, but rather to provide a short overview of some of the subject matter's functionality. Other systems, methods, features and advantages here provided will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following FIGUREs and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages that are included within this description, be within the scope of any claims filed later.</p>

Said longitudinal support plates <b>110</b> are arranged on the vertical support elements <b>204</b> and serve, as described above, for fastening the front module to a vehicle body (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Here, the longitudinal support plates <b>110</b> are arranged on the vertical support elements <b>204</b> at the level of the connection points between the respective vertical support elements <b>204</b> and the transverse struts <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a further embodiment of a front module <b>108</b> in a schematic illustration. In the same way as the front module described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the front module <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also has a trapezoidal shape, wherein all of the elements illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are formed in one piece with one another and consist exclusively of plastic, that is to say in particular do not have metal reinforcements. In contrast to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the upper horizontal support element <b>200</b> and the vertical support elements <b>204</b> have different sections. With regard to the support element <b>200</b>, in section <b>302</b> between the connection points of the transverse struts <b>206</b> to the upper horizontal support element <b>200</b>, use is made of a plastic which has the same material as that used for the transverse struts <b>206</b>. The vertical support elements <b>204</b> have a region <b>304</b>, wherein said region <b>304</b> is formed between the areal connection points (connection sections) of the respective vertical support elements <b>204</b> and the longitudinal support plates <b>110</b>. Said regions <b>304</b> are also produced from the high-strength plastic material used for the transverse struts <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The front module <b>108</b> therefore consists, overall, of two plastic components, specifically a high-strength plastic component for the regions <b>304</b> and <b>302</b> and the transverse struts, and also a plastic component of lower hardness for the other support elements <b>200</b>, <b>202</b> and <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If for example high forces now act on the region <b>302</b>, no deformation takes place in said region and said forces are dissipated in an effective manner via the transverse struts <b>206</b> and the region <b>304</b> to the longitudinal support plates <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are cutouts <b>300</b> which serve for the lead through of fastening means for fixing the longitudinal support plates on the vehicle body (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). It is however pointed out that parts of the front module <b>108</b> may have further cutouts, for example also with an integrated plastic thread. If such cutouts are provided on high-strength regions of the front module <b>108</b>, these may be used for receiving fastening means for the retention of further vehicle elements. Conceivable here would be the retention of for example different fluid containers such as containers for washer fluids, brake fluids or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a receptacle <b>306</b> with cutouts <b>308</b>. Said receptacle <b>306</b> serves for receiving and fastening a lock of a bonnet. The lock can be fixed to the front module <b>108</b> via the cutouts <b>308</b>. Since the receptacle <b>306</b> is situated in the high-strength region <b>302</b> of the front module <b>108</b>, it is ensured that forces acting on the front module <b>108</b> for example during the closure of the bonnet do not lead to a deformation of the front module <b>108</b>. It is pointed out here that both the region <b>302</b> and also the receptacle <b>306</b> are illustrated on an over dimensioned scale in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This however serves merely for illustrative purposes. In reality, said regions will be significantly narrower so as to ensure that, to the sides of said regions, forces acting on the support element <b>200</b> can lead to a targeted deformation of the support element. As described above, this serves for example for pedestrian protection. It is nevertheless possible in a cheap manner to provide a lightweight and highly stable front module.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> schematically shows different steps of a method for producing a front module as described above in a two-component injection-moulding process. Firstly, in step <b>400</b>, an injection moulding device is provided which has two different injection moulding components <b>414</b> and <b>416</b> which are spatially separate from one another. Not visible here are a first and a second cavity of the injection moulding components <b>414</b> and <b>416</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Here, the method proceeds from the state in which an injection-moulded part <b>408</b> composed of a high-strength plastic and a front module, composed of a high-strength plastic <b>410</b> and a plastic of lower strength <b>412</b>, have already been produced in a cyclic fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step <b>402</b>, the injection-moulded part <b>408</b> is now withdrawn from the first cavity, which can now be seen, and inserted into the second cavity <b>420</b> of the injection moulding element <b>416</b>. The finished front module <b>108</b> comprising the high-strength plastic <b>410</b> and the plastic of lower strength <b>412</b> has previously been withdrawn from the second cavity <b>420</b>&#x2014;said front module can now be used for example for installation in a motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a step <b>404</b>, the withdrawn injection-moulded part <b>408</b> is now inserted into the cavity <b>420</b>. As a result, in step <b>404</b>, in the injection moulding element <b>414</b> there is an empty cavity <b>418</b> and in the injection moulding element <b>416</b> there is a cavity <b>420</b> which is partially filled by the injection-moulded part <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In step <b>406</b>, the method returns to the state denoted by the reference numeral <b>400</b>, in which the cavity <b>418</b> is filled with the high-strength plastic and the cavity <b>420</b> is filled with the plastic of lower strength. As a result, a new injection-moulded part <b>408</b> is created in the element <b>414</b>, and a new front module <b>308</b> is created in the element <b>416</b>. The method then continuous cyclically with steps <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>.</p>
