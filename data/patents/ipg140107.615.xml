No. 12/693,552, filed Jan. 26, 2010 (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,230,652), which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/148,652, filed Jan. 30, 2009, the entireties of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates generally to mull posts for use in exterior or other door assemblies, and more particularly to a reinforced mull post for use in an exterior or other door assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Entryway systems used in residential and commercial buildings include single and double door assemblies having one or more sidelights or sidelight panels flanking the door(s). Such entryway systems are typically fabricated using vertical mullions or mull posts positioned between the door(s) and the associated sidelight or sidelight panel to connect the structures. When these entryway systems are used in coastal regions of the country, it is desirable that the systems be capable of withstanding the extremely high pressures caused by high winds as well as impacts caused by flying debris.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditionally, mull posts have been fabricated from wood, such as pine, small pieces of which are finger jointed end to end and milled to form the mull profile. While such construction is acceptable in many regions, it generally does not result in mull posts that can withstand the extreme weather conditions that often occur in coastal areas. For instance, when an entryway having traditional wood mull posts is exposed to the high pressures from wind forces that entryways in coastal areas may experience, the forces transferred through the door to the mull posts can cause the mulls, and thus the entryway, to fail. Often the mulls break apart at the finger joints that are used to join the small segments of mull together. Even where the finger joints hold, the wood of the mulls can split apart along the grain at the locations of door hardware such as the strike plate, deadbolt strike, and hinges. Further, the high pressure can cause the mulls to deflect or bend, compromising the integrity of hardware fasteners. Thus, traditional finger jointed wood mull posts are not acceptable for use in regions with stringent design pressure requirements. Even where solid wood mull designs are used to eliminate failure at finger joint locations, problems caused by splitting of the wood along its grain remain.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More recently, extruded polymer mull posts made from inexpensive materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) have been used. While polymer mull posts may not be as susceptible to breaking or splitting like traditional wood mulls, they still may be highly susceptible to deflection or bending when exposed to high pressure, thus compromising the integrity of the entryway system as previously explained.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to the high design pressure requirements in hurricane prone regions, building codes in coastal regions also typically require that an entryway withstand a direct impact by airborne debris such as tree limbs. Traditional solid wood mull posts and extruded polymer mulls may be highly vulnerable to such impacts, again, for the reasons previously stated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, a need exists for an entryway system incorporating high strength mull posts that meet or exceed design requirements imposed by stringent building codes in coastal regions. Such mull posts should be inexpensive to produce, and should emulate the appearance of traditional wooden mulls so that they are acceptable for use in private residences.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect, a reinforced mull post assembly is disclosed. The reinforced mull post assembly, comprises: a mull post comprising a two piece housing formed by an elongated support piece and a stop piece coupled together by interlocking flanges, the support piece having external first and second support faces and the stop piece having first and second legs forming first and second raised stops laterally offset from the first and second support faces, respectively, the housing including a central chamber therein; the interlocking flanges including the stop piece having first flanges, each having a recess therein, and the support piece having second flanges, each second flange having a rib received within the corresponding recess of the corresponding first flange; the central chamber including a longitudinal void section and a transverse void section; and a reinforcing member disposed within the central chamber and including portions within the longitudinal void section and the transverse void section.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect, a reinforced mull post assembly is disclosed. The reinforced mull post comprises: a mull post comprising a two piece housing formed by an elongated support piece and a stop piece coupled together by interlocking flanges, the stop piece having first and second legs forming first and second raised stops disposed laterally outside the support piece and offset from external surfaces of the elongated support piece, the housing including a central chamber therein.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a typical exterior door assembly <b>1</b> comprises a central hinged door <b>2</b> and side light window panels <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> that flank the door on either side. The exterior door assembly <b>1</b> further comprises a pair of vertical door jambs <b>8</b>, that extend between a sill <b>12</b> and a header <b>14</b>. Together, the jambs <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, the sill <b>12</b> and header <b>14</b> define the outer peripheral frame of the exterior door assembly <b>1</b>. A pair of exemplary spaced mull posts <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> extend vertically between the sill <b>12</b> and the header <b>14</b> and define a central opening in which the hinged door <b>2</b> is disposed, as well as two flanking side openings on either side of the door for receiving the side light window panels <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a partial cross-section of the door assembly <b>1</b> is shown. As can be seen, the left-most exemplary mull post <b>16</b> is positioned between the left-most side light window panel <b>6</b> and the door <b>2</b>. A piece of weather-stripping <b>20</b> is engaged between the exemplary mull post <b>16</b> and the door <b>2</b>, and a door hinge <b>22</b> is shown fixing the door <b>2</b> to the exemplary mull post <b>16</b> by way of traditional threaded fasteners <b>23</b>. Thus, the exemplary mull post <b>16</b> serves to provide both horizontal and lateral sealing of the door <b>2</b> and side light window panel <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a cross-section of the exemplary mull post <b>16</b> is shown. Although the description will proceed with reference to mull post <b>16</b>, it will be appreciated that the identical description also applies to mull post <b>18</b>. Furthermore, the exemplary mull post <b>16</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents one exemplary mull post assembly according to the disclosure. Another exemplary mull post assembly is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-7</figref> and may be substantially disposed within exterior door assembly <b>1</b> such as exemplary mull post <b>16</b> is disposed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the mull post <b>16</b> has a support portion <b>24</b> and a stop portion <b>26</b>. The support portion <b>24</b> comprises first and second support faces <b>28</b>, for engaging respective end surfaces of the side light panel <b>6</b> and door <b>2</b> to provide a desired lateral offset between the two. The stop portion <b>26</b> comprises first and second raised stops <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> for engaging respective side surfaces of the side light panel <b>6</b> and door <b>2</b> to provide a desired horizontal positioning of each within the door assembly <b>1</b>. Defined within each of the first and second raised stops <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is a longitudinal slot <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> that extends along the length of the vertical mull post <b>16</b>. These longitudinal slots <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> are sized and shaped to receive weather stripping <b>20</b> and/or a tab fixture (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) for engaging and sealing the door <b>2</b> and side light <b>6</b> to the mull post <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The stop portion <b>26</b> of the mull post <b>16</b> may further have an exposed face portion <b>40</b> that extends along the length of the mull post <b>16</b> and is exposed to the exterior of the building in which the door assembly <b>1</b> is installed. In the illustrated embodiment, this exposed face portion <b>40</b> is flat, however, it will be appreciated that a the face portion may be provided in any of a variety of different decorative shapes to result in a desired external appearance for the mull post <b>16</b>. This exposed face portion <b>16</b> may have a surface that can be painted or otherwise finished in any manner to provide the appearance of a traditional wood mullion.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While the external appearance of the mull post <b>16</b> provides the look of a single-piece construction, the interior of the exemplary mull post <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is made up of multiple components that reinforce the mull post and provide a desired high degree of strength and rigidity. Thus, the mull post <b>16</b> may comprise an outer polymer profile portion <b>42</b> with first and second reinforcing members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> sandwiched within. The polymer profile portion <b>42</b> incorporates the external physical features as previously described. It also comprises a hollow center <b>48</b> sized and shaped to receive the first and second reinforcing members <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, the polymer profile portion <b>42</b> that includes support portion <b>24</b> and stop portion <b>26</b>, is fabricated from a thermoplastic material, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and is formed using an extrusion process, although other formation processes such as molding may also be used. The first reinforcing member <b>44</b> may comprise engineered wood, such as laminated veneer lumber (LVL). The second reinforcing member <b>46</b> may comprise a steel U-channel that wraps around one end of the first reinforcing member <b>44</b> to further enhance the strength and rigidity of the resulting mull post <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The material of the polymer profile portion <b>42</b> may be any of a variety of thermosetting polymers, a non-limiting list of which includes PVC, PE (Polyethylene), PP (Polypropylene), ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), PC (Polycarbonate), PS (Polystyrene), NYLON and TEFLON. The hollow center <b>48</b> may be formed during the extrusion process (where an extrusion process is used), or it may be formed after the profile portion is formed (e.g., by machining from of a solid formed profile).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first reinforcing member <b>44</b> may comprise a sold piece of wood or other material (e.g., a second polymer), or it may comprise plurality of individual plies <b>50</b> of material glued or otherwise adhered together to form a multiple ply structure (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). As will be appreciated, the material and structure of the plies <b>50</b> may be varied depending upon the ultimate use and desired strength of the mull post <b>16</b>. For instance, the first reinforcing member <b>44</b> may be a traditional engineered lumber product such as LVL, which uses multiple layers of thin wood assembled with adhesive. LVL offers several advantages over solid wood in that it is stronger, straighter, and more uniform. It is also much less likely than conventional lumber to warp, twist, bow, or shrink due to its composite nature. Another appropriate engineered material for use as the first reinforcing member <b>44</b> is parallel strand lumber (PSL), which is manufactured from large flakes of wood. Where LVL is used, the types of wood used to form the veneers of the plies <b>50</b> may vary and the plies may be oriented such that their grains extend in different directions to enhance the strength of the member. Various types of LVL and PSL are available from vendors of engineered lumber and are well known by those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As an alternative to LVL or PVL, the first reinforcing member <b>44</b> may be formed from plies <b>50</b> made of a mixture of wood and other materials to enhance the strength of the member. For example, some of the plies <b>50</b> may be wood veneers while other plies may be plastic, carbon composite, fiberglass, or metal such as aluminum. The use of such non-wooden plies combined with wooden plies may form a first reinforcing member <b>44</b> of exceptional strength and resistance to failure under even the most severe load conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As noted, the second reinforcing member <b>46</b> may comprise a steel U-channel that wraps around one end of the first reinforcing member <b>44</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the second reinforcing member <b>46</b> is positioned so that it wraps around the first reinforcing member <b>44</b> at the end immediately adjacent the stop portion <b>26</b> of the mull post <b>16</b> to provide support to the exposed face portion <b>40</b>, and to provide the mull post with maximum rigidity against flexure in use. As can be seen, the second reinforcing member <b>42</b> does not extend the entire width &#x201c;W&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the first reinforcing member <b>44</b>. This ensures that fasteners (such as for attaching hinges or other connecting hardware) can be easily screwed through the support portion <b>24</b> of the mull post <b>16</b> and into the first reinforcing member <b>44</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the leg portions <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> of the second reinforcing member <b>46</b> extend approximately one half the width &#x201c;W&#x201d; of the first reinforcing member <b>44</b>. Depending on the application, the leg portions <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> may extend over greater or lesser percentages of the width &#x201c;W&#x201d; of the first reinforcing member <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As will be appreciated, the second reinforcing member <b>46</b> may be provided in shapes other than the U-shape illustrated in the figures. For example, the second reinforcing member <b>46</b> could simply comprise a flat metal member positioned on one broad flat side of the first reinforcing member <b>44</b>, running the entire length of the mull post <b>16</b>. Alternatively, a pair of flat metal members could be positioned on opposite broad sides of the first reinforcing member <b>44</b>. In addition, any of a variety of metals can be used, a non-limiting list of which includes aluminum, steel, stainless steel and copper. Further, highly-rigid non-metals such as fiberglass, graphite reinforced polymers, and the like could also be used to form the second reinforcing member <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In addition, it will be appreciated that the mull post <b>16</b> may be provided with a profile portion <b>42</b> and only a single reinforcing member. Thus, in one embodiment the mull post <b>16</b> may comprise the profile portion <b>42</b> and only the first reinforcing member <b>44</b>. In another alternative embodiment the mull post <b>16</b> may comprise the profile portion <b>42</b> and only the second reinforcing member <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Where the polymer profile portion <b>42</b> is formed by an extrusion process, a cap stock layer <b>56</b> may be co-extruded onto the profile portion <b>42</b> to provide protection to the profile portion <b>42</b> to increase weatherability (e.g., resist UV rays), and to provide a desired finished exterior appearance and/or color to the mull post <b>16</b>. This cap stock layer <b>56</b> may comprise PVC, and may be provided in a thickness range of about 0.4 to about 0.6 millimeters. In one embodiment, the cap stock layer <b>56</b> is applied in a thickness of about 0.6 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As discussed above, with prior solid wood or finger jointed wood mullions, the attachment points of the hinges to the mullion tend to be regions of failure under extreme wind induced pressures on the door. With the disclosed reinforce mull post, however, the screws that attach the hinges (and other door hardware) to the mull post extend deeply into the multiple plies of the first reinforcing member <b>44</b>. Since the grains of the plies <b>50</b> can be oriented in various directions, the tendency for inward force at the locations of the hinges to split the mullion along its length is minimized. Furthermore, threading screws into a multiply material such as LVL is expected to form a far stronger attachment as compared to treading screws into the solid pine of traditional mullions. Accordingly, the screws will not be pulled out of the mull post under the stress of extreme pressure induced forces. This is expected to be even more true where the truss may include plies of non-wooden materials such as plastic or metal.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although the disclosed designs have been disclosed for use in mull post applications, it may also be used to advantage to form the vertical door jambs <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, sills <b>12</b> and headers <b>14</b> of the door assembly <b>1</b>. Often, however, only the mull posts <b>16</b> are formed using the disclosed reinforced design because the strength of the jambs, sills and headers is not as critical as that of the mull posts since the jambs, sills and header are typically secured directly to the heavy construction framing of the opening into which the door assembly installed. As such, forces imparted to the jambs are typically transferred directly to the framing timbers and splitting and failure of the jambs generally is less a problem that failure of the otherwise unsupported mullion members.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The disclosed mull posts <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may be attached at their top and bottom ends with screws or other appropriate fasteners to the sill <b>12</b> and header, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With the disclosed door assembly <b>1</b> installed in a dwelling that is subjected to the high winds of a hurricane or other storm, the door and panels can be subjected to extreme pressures and consequently extreme inwardly directed forces. These forces are transferred from the door and panels to the reinforced mull posts of the entryway, which, due to their reinforced construction, resist the failure modes common for traditional mull posts and transom mulls. Ultimately, much of the force born by the mull posts <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are transferred to the vertical jambs <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, the sill <b>12</b> and the header <b>14</b>, and, in turn, to the framing timbers of the building.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A further exemplary mull post design in shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5E</figref>. Each of these figures represents a cross-sectional view with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5D</figref> illustrating various components in various arrangements and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> showing a cross-sectional view of an exemplary mull post assembly including all components. Exemplary mull post <b>100</b> is an alternative embodiment to the mull post shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Exemplary mull post <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> may be similarly situated within exterior door assembly <b>1</b> such as exemplary mull post <b>16</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, e.g. exemplary mull post <b>100</b> may extend vertically between sill <b>12</b> and header <b>14</b> as does exemplary mull posts <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> illustrated and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5E</figref>, stop component <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> combines with support component <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> to form a housing with a central cavity such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. Stop component <b>102</b> and support component <b>104</b> are separate members.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Stop component <b>102</b> includes internal portion <b>106</b> and external portion <b>108</b> in the illustrated embodiment. According to other exemplary embodiments, stop component <b>102</b> may be formed of a single composition, i.e. a single material. Internal portion <b>106</b> may be formed of rigid PVC, polyvinyl chloride, in one exemplary embodiment but may be formed of other suitable polymers, plastics and rigid materials and other exemplary embodiments. External portion <b>108</b> may be advantageously formed of wood or a wood composite in one exemplary embodiment but may be formed of plastics, polymers, PVC or other suitable components in other exemplary embodiments.

Internal portion <b>106</b> includes surface <b>110</b> which will be a smooth surface in various exemplary embodiments to aid in slidably receiving an internal reinforcing member when stop component <b>102</b> is joined to support component <b>104</b>. Stop component <b>102</b> includes opposed flanges <b>112</b> which may alternatively be described as ribs. Flanges <b>112</b> each extend laterally inward from the opposed sides of generally U-shaped stop component <b>102</b> and are adapted to engage with corresponding flanges <b>116</b> of support component <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.
