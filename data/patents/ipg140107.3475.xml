<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a start-up circuit and motor driving IC, and more particularly, to a start-up circuit and motor driving IC capable of determining an operating mode of the motor driving IC by itself without an enable pin, to adjust an activation signal to perform activation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the development of computer technology in recent years, the heat generated from a central processing unit (CPU) increases as the frequency of the CPU increases. Therefore, the need for heat-dissipation becomes important. The main method for heat-dissipation is still heat-dissipating fans. There are voltage control and pulse width modulation (PWM) control methods for motor driving ICs of heat-dissipating fans used in CPUs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, which are schematic diagrams of conventional motor driving ICs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> having a voltage control mode and a PWM control mode, respectively. Noticeably, the motor driving ICs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> can be a same motor driving IC in practice as long as control modes of the motor driving IC are switched via adjusting input signals of a system voltage pin VCC_P and a PWM pin PWM_P.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, for the voltage control mode of the motor driving IC <b>10</b>, a driving current IL at the output pins OUT<b>1</b>_P and OUT<b>2</b>_P can be changed via adjusting a system voltage VCC at a system voltage pin VCC_P, so as to change rotation speeds of a motor <b>102</b> and the corresponding fan.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, for the PWM control mode of the motor driving IC <b>12</b>, the system voltage VCC at a system voltage pin VCC_P is fixed, and then the driving current IL outputted by the output pins OUT<b>1</b>_P and OUT<b>2</b>_P can be changed by adjusting the duty of a PWM signal PWMS at a PWM pin PWM_P, so as to change the rotation speeds of the motor <b>102</b> and the corresponding fan.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of a driving circuit <b>104</b> of the motor driving IC <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the motor driving IC <b>12</b> can utilize a PWM output signal PWMout, which is equivalent to the PWM signal PWMS, to control the on/off of an upper gate switch <b>106</b> and a lower gate switch <b>108</b> of the driving circuit <b>104</b>, so as to change the driving current IL of the driving motor <b>102</b>, and thus change the rotation speeds of the motor <b>102</b> and the corresponding fan as well. Noticeably, the motor driving IC <b>10</b> can also comprise the driving circuit <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> to drive the motor <b>102</b>, where the motor driving IC <b>10</b> can be seen as the motor driving IC <b>12</b> with the PWM pin PWM_P not coupled to the PWM signal PWMS, i.e. floating, and thus a duty of the inputted PWM signal PWMS is equivalent to a full duty.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, for the PWM driving IC <b>12</b>, if the duty of the PWM signal PWMS is too small, and thus the generated driving current IL is too small to overcome the static friction, the motor <b>102</b> can not be activated. In such a situation, the conventional PWM driving IC <b>12</b> utilizes the PWM output signal PWMout with greater duty, e.g. a duty of 50%, to accordingly generate the greater driving current IL first, so as to activate the motor <b>102</b> compulsively. After the motor <b>102</b> starts rotating, the PWM driving IC <b>12</b> returns to utilize the PWM signal PWMS with lesser duty as the PWM output signal PWMout.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a result, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of that the rotation speeds of the motor <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> with respect to different duty of the PWM signal PWMS whether the conventional compulsive activation mechanism is applied or not. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, without the compulsive activation mechanism, e.g. a duty of 50%, the motor <b>102</b> can be activated by the PWM signal PWMS with a duty about 20%. Oppositely, with the compulsive activation mechanism, the minimum duty to activate the motor <b>102</b> can be improved to be 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In practice, the motor driving ICs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> can be the same motor driving IC by means of adjusting input signals of a system voltage pin VCC_P and a PWM pin PWM_P to switch control modes of the motor driving IC. If the mentioned compulsive activation mechanism is built in the motor driving ICs <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, the motor driving IC <b>10</b> generates the driving current IL with the PWM output signal PWMout without a full duty, e.g. a duty of 50%, to activate the motor <b>102</b>. As a result, under the circumstances that the motor driving IC <b>10</b> is operating in the voltage control mode and the system voltage VCC is at a low voltage level, the motor driving IC <b>10</b> may not be able to overcome the static friction to activate the motor <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In such a situation, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of a conventional motor driving IC <b>14</b> further comprising an enable pin EN. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, if a signal of the enable pin EN is at a low voltage level, the motor driving IC <b>14</b> does not perform the compulsive activation mechanism and thus the voltage control mode is adapted. If the signal of the enable pin EN is at a high voltage level, the motor driving IC <b>14</b> performs the compulsive activation mechanism and thus the PWM control mode is adapted.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">However, since the pins of a general motor driving IC are limited, the conventional method of using the enable pin EN to control whether to enable the compulsive activation mechanism results in limited functions of the motor driving IC. Therefore, there is a need to improve the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is therefore an objective to provide a start-up circuit and motor driving IC capable of determining an operating mode of the motor driving IC by itself without an enable pin, to adjust an activation signal to perform activation.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention discloses a start-up circuit for a motor driving IC. The start-up circuit includes a determination unit for generating a determination result indicating an operating mode of the motor driving IC according to an external PWM signal, and an output unit for outputting an activation signal according to the determination result and a PWM activation signal, wherein a duty of the PWM activation signal is greater than that of the external PWM signal.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention further discloses a motor driving IC for driving a fan. The motor driving IC includes a selector for selecting one of an external PWM signal and an activation signal as a PWM output signal according to a selection signal, and an activation circuit for generating the activation signal, the activation circuit includes a determination unit for generating a determination result indicating an operating mode of the motor driving IC according to the external PWM signal, and an output unit for outputting the activation signal according to the determination result and a PWM activation signal, wherein a duty of the PWM activation signal is greater than that of the external PWM signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of operations of a motor driving IC <b>20</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the motor driving IC <b>20</b> includes a system voltage pin VCC_P&#x2032;, a PWM pin PWM_P&#x2032; and output pins OUT<b>1</b>_P&#x2032; and OUT<b>2</b>_P&#x2032;. The main difference between the motor driving IC <b>20</b> and the motor driving IC <b>14</b> is that the motor driving IC <b>20</b> can determine an operating mode by itself according to a signal type of an external PWM signal EXT_PWM received at a PWM pin PWM_P&#x2032;, to decide whether to activate the compulsive activation mechanism, and thus the enable pin EN shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> is not required to be set in the motor driving IC <b>20</b>. Operations of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> about driving the motor can be referred to the driving circuit <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, if the motor driving IC <b>20</b> determines the duty of the external PWM signal EXT_PWM is a full duty, the motor driving IC <b>20</b> determines the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> is the voltage control mode, and thus does not activate the compulsive activation mechanism and still utilize the external PWM signal EXT_PWM with a full duty to drive the motor. If the motor driving IC <b>20</b> determines the external PWM signal EXT_PWM switches between different voltage levels, the motor driving IC <b>20</b> determines the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> is the PWM control mode, and thus activates the compulsive activation mechanism and utilizes a PWM activation signal C<b>2</b> with a greater duty, e.g. a duty of 50% greater than that of the external PWM signal EXT-PWM, to activate the motor. After ensuring that the motor has rotated, the motor driving IC <b>20</b> switches to utilize the external PWM signal EXT_PWM with less duty to drive the motor. As a result, the motor driving IC <b>20</b> can determine whether to activate the compulsive activation mechanism by itself according to the external PWM signal EXT_PWM, and thus the integrality can be increased without including the enable pin EN.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Specifically, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, which is a block diagram of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the motor driving IC <b>20</b> includes a selector <b>202</b>, a start-up circuit <b>204</b> and a counter <b>206</b>. In short, the counter <b>206</b> counts switching times of the magnetic field when the motor drives the fan to be rotating according to a rotation signal ROT, so as to generate a selection signal SEL indicating whether the fan has rotated or not, e.g. the fan is determined to be rotating if counted <b>2</b> or <b>4</b> circles. The start-up circuit <b>204</b> generates an activation signal ACT. The selector <b>202</b> receives the external PWM signal EXT_PWM and the activation signal ACT, and then selects to output one of the external PWM signal EXT_PWM and the activation signal ACT as a PWM output signal PWMout&#x2032; according to the selection signal SEL, and thus drive the motor by a driving circuit similar to the driving circuit <b>104</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In such a situation, if the selection signal SEL indicates the fan has not rotated, the selector <b>202</b> outputs the activation signal ACT as the PWM output signal PWMout&#x2032;, i.e. activate the motor with the activation signal ACT. On the contrary, if the selection signal SEL indicates the fan has rotated, the selector <b>202</b> outputs the external PWM signal EXT_PWM as the PWM output signal PWMout&#x2032;, i.e. drive the motor with the external PWM signal EXT_PWM. As a result, the motor driving IC <b>20</b> can change the signal for driving the motor according to whether the fan has rotated or not, so as to activate the motor with the activation signal ACT when the fan has not rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is a schematic diagram of the start-up circuit <b>204</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the start-up circuit <b>204</b> includes a determination unit <b>302</b> and an output unit <b>304</b>. The determination unit <b>302</b> generates a determination result PWM_O indicating the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> according to the external PWM signal EXT_PWM, and the output unit <b>304</b> outputs the activation signal ACT according to the determination result PWM_O and the PWM activation signal C<b>2</b>. A duty of the PWM activation signal C<b>2</b> is greater than that of the external PWM signal EXT_PWM.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In such a condition, if the determination result PWM_O indicates the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> is the voltage control mode, the output unit <b>304</b> outputs the activation signal ACT with a full duty. If the determination result PWM_O indicates the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> is the PWM control mode, the output unit <b>304</b> outputs the PWM activation signal C<b>2</b> as the activation signal ACT. As a result, the output unit <b>304</b> can output the appropriate activation signal ACT to activate the motor by itself when the motor driving IC <b>20</b> operates in different modes, and thus the motor driving IC <b>20</b> can overcome the static friction without including the enable pin EN.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In detail, the output unit <b>304</b> can be an OR gate, for outputting the activation signal ACT according to the determination result PWM_O and the PWM activation signal C<b>2</b>. The determination unit <b>302</b> can include an inverter <b>306</b> and flip-flops <b>308</b> and <b>310</b>. The inverter <b>306</b> receives the external PWM signal EXT_PWM to generate a reset signal RES. The flip-flops <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> are coupled in series, for outputting the determination result PWM_O according to the system voltage VCC, a control clock C<b>1</b> and the reset signal RES. The flip-flops <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> include input terminals D and D&#x2032;, clock terminals CLK and CLK&#x2032;, reset terminals R and R&#x2032;, output terminals Q and Q&#x2032; and terminals QB and QB&#x2032;, respectively. The input terminal D, the clock terminal CLK and the reset terminal R of the flip-flop <b>308</b> can be utilized for receiving the system voltage VCC, the control clock C<b>1</b> and the reset signal RES, respectively. And the output terminal Q can be utilized for outputting an output signal PWM_R. And the input terminal D&#x2032;, the clock terminal CLK&#x2032; and the reset terminal R&#x2032; of the flip-flop <b>310</b> can be utilized for receiving the output signal PWM_R, the control clock C<b>1</b> and the reset signal RES, respectively. And the output terminal Q&#x2032; can be utilized for outputting the determination result PWM_O.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In such an configuration, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, which are schematic diagrams of the external PWM signal EXT_PWM, the control clock C<b>1</b>, the PWM activation signal C<b>2</b>, the output signal PWM_R, the determination result PWM_O and the activation signal ACT when the operating modes of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> are the voltage control mode and the PWM control mode, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, when the motor driving IC <b>20</b> operates in the voltage control mode, the external PWM signal EXT_PWM has a full duty, i.e. the external PWM signal EXT_PWM is always at a high voltage level, so that the reset signal RES is at a low voltage level and thus the flip-flops <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> are not reset. In such a condition, since the flip-flops <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> switch the output signal PWM_R and the determination result PWM_O to the levels of the system voltage VCC and the output signal PWM_R during a rising edge the control clock C<b>1</b> is at a high voltage level, respectively, and therefore the output signal PWM_R is switched to the voltage level of the system voltage VCC during the first rising edge of the control clock C<b>1</b>, and then the determination result PWM_O is switched to the high voltage level of the output signal PWM_R during the second rising edge of the control clock C<b>1</b>, wherein the flip-flops <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> are not reset within an interval of the two rising edges. Subsequently, the output unit <b>304</b> can switch from outputting the originated PWM activation signal C<b>2</b> as the activation signal ACT to outputting the activation signal ACT with a full duty as the activation signal ACT when the output signal PWM_R is switched to a high voltage level. As a result, during the voltage control mode, the determination unit <b>302</b> only needs one period of the control clock C<b>1</b> to perform detection, e.g. the detection only needs 125 microsecond if the frequency of the control clock C<b>1</b> is 8 KHz, so as to generate the determination result PWM_O indicating that the motor driving IC <b>20</b> operates in the voltage control mode, and thus the output unit <b>304</b> can output the activation signal ACT with a full duty.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, when the motor driving IC <b>20</b> operates in PWM control mode, the external PWM signal EXT_PWM performs switching between high/low voltage levels according to its duty, therefore if the external PWM signal EXT_PWM is at a low voltage level, the reset signal RES is at a high voltage level, and thus the flip-flops <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> reset the output signal PWM_R and the determination result PWM_O to low voltage levels, respectively. In such a situation, since the flip-flops <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> switch the output signal PWM_R and the determination result PWM_O to the levels of the system voltage VCC and the output signal PWM_R during the rising edge the control clock C<b>1</b> is at high voltage level, respectively, and thus the output signal PWM_R is switched to a high voltage level of the system voltage VCC when the first rising edge of the control clock C<b>1</b> and thus the external PWM signal EXT_PWM is at a high voltage level and the flip-flop <b>308</b> does not perform resetting to the output signal PWM_R. Subsequently, if the external PWM signal EXT_PWM switches to low voltage level based on its duty, the flip-flop <b>308</b> resets the output signal PWM_R to a low voltage level, such that the output signal PWM_R is still at a low voltage level during the second rising edge of the control clock C<b>1</b>, and thus the determination result PWM_O is at a low voltage level of the output signal PWM_R as well.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, since the external PWM signal EXT_PWM switches between high/low voltage levels within one period of the control clock C<b>1</b>, though the output signal PWM_R is switched to a high voltage level of the system voltage VCC during the first rising edge, the reset signal RES controls the output signal PWM_R to switch to a low voltage level before the second rising edge of the control clock C<b>1</b>, so that the determination result PWM_O is always at a low voltage level, and thus the output unit <b>304</b> always outputs the PWM activation signal C<b>2</b> as the activation signal ACT. As a result, the output unit <b>304</b> can always output the PWM activation signal C<b>2</b> with the greater duty as the activation signal ACT to activate the motor compulsively during the PWM control mode.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Noticeably, the spirit of the present invention is that the motor driving IC <b>20</b> can determine the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b>, so as to decide whether to activate the compulsive activation mechanism according to the signal type of the received external PWM signal EXT_PWM, and thus the enable pin EN shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> is not required to be set in the motor driving IC <b>20</b>. Those skilled in the art should make modifications or alterations accordingly. For example, realizations of the circuits of the determination unit <b>302</b> and the output unit <b>304</b> are not limited to the circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as long as the functions of determining the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> and switching the activation signal ACT can be achieved, respectively. For example, there are two flip-flops <b>308</b> and <b>310</b> included in the determination unit <b>302</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but the number of the flip-flops is not limited, as long as the switching of the external PWM signal EXT_PWM can be determined. Besides, the frequency of the control clock C<b>1</b> is preferably less than the operating range of the external PWM signal EXT_PWM, e.g. 8 KHz is less than the operating range 10 KHz, to ensure the detection time is greater than the period of the external PWM signal EXT_PWM. In addition, the frequency of the PWM activation signal C<b>2</b> can be 33 KHz and have a duty of 50% as the compulsive activation signal, but is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the prior art, the method of utilizing the enable pin EN to control whether to enable the compulsive activation mechanism results in the limited functions of the motor driving IC due to the limited pins of general motor driving ICs. In comparison, the motor driving IC <b>20</b> of the present invention can determine the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> by itself according to the external PWM signal EXT_PWM, and does not activate the compulsive activation mechanism if the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> is determined to be the voltage control mode while activating the compulsive activation mechanism if the operating mode of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> is determined to be the PWM control mode, such that the integrality of the motor driving IC <b>20</b> can be increased without including the enable pin EN.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">To sum up, the present invention can determine the operating mode of the motor driving IC by itself to adjust an activation signal and perform activation without including an enable pin.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention.</p>
