<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present application relates generally to wireless communications, and more specifically to systems, methods, and devices to enable wireless communication in sub-gigahertz bands. Certain aspects herein relate to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communications that are sent using 32 tones over a bandwidth of equal to or less than 1.25 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In many telecommunication systems, communications networks are used to exchange messages among several interacting spatially-separated devices. Networks may be classified according to geographic scope, which could be, for example, a metropolitan area, a local area, or a personal area. Such networks may be designated respectively as a wide area network (WAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), local area network (LAN), or personal area network (PAN). Networks also differ according to the switching/routing technique used to interconnect the various network nodes and devices (e.g., circuit switching vs. packet switching), the type of physical media employed for transmission (e.g., wired vs. wireless), and the set of communication protocols used (e.g., Internet protocol suite, SONET (Synchronous Optical Networking), Ethernet, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Wireless networks are often preferred when the network elements are mobile and thus have dynamic connectivity needs, or if the network architecture is formed in an ad hoc, rather than fixed, topology. Wireless networks employ intangible physical media in an unguided propagation mode using electromagnetic waves in the radio, microwave, infra-red, optical, etc. frequency bands. Wireless networks advantageously facilitate user mobility and rapid field deployment when compared to fixed wired networks.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The devices in a wireless network may transmit/receive information between each other. The information may comprise packets, which in some aspects may be referred to as data units. The packets may include overhead information (e.g., header information, packet properties, etc.) that helps in routing the packet through the network, identifying the data in the packet, processing the packet, etc., as well as data, for example user data, multimedia content, etc. as might be carried in a payload of the packet.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The systems, methods, and devices of the invention each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Various aspects of the novel systems, apparatuses, and methods are described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. The teachings disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to any specific structure or function presented throughout this disclosure. Rather, these aspects are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Based on the teachings herein one skilled in the art should appreciate that the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover any aspect of the novel systems, apparatuses, and methods disclosed herein, whether implemented independently of or combined with any other aspect of the invention. For example, an apparatus may be implemented or a method may be practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, the scope of the invention is intended to cover such an apparatus or method which is practiced using other structure, functionality, or structure and functionality in addition to or other than the various aspects of the invention set forth herein. It should be understood that any aspect disclosed herein may be embodied by one or more elements of a claim.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although particular aspects are described herein, many variations and permutations of these aspects fall within the scope of the disclosure. Although some benefits and advantages of the preferred aspects are mentioned, the scope of the disclosure is not intended to be limited to particular benefits, uses, or objectives. Rather, aspects of the disclosure are intended to be broadly applicable to different wireless technologies, system configurations, networks, and transmission protocols, some of which are illustrated by way of example in the figures and in the following description of the preferred aspects. The detailed description and drawings are merely illustrative of the disclosure rather than limiting, the scope of the disclosure being defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Wireless network technologies may include various types of wireless local area networks (WLANs). A WLAN may be used to interconnect nearby devices together, employing widely used networking protocols. The various aspects described herein may apply to any communication standard, such as WiFi or, more generally, any member of the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless protocols. For example, the various aspects described herein may be used as part of the IEEE 802.11ah protocol, which uses sub-1 GHz bands.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some aspects, wireless signals in a sub-gigahertz band may be transmitted according to the 802.11ah protocol using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) communications, a combination of OFDM and DSSS communications, or other schemes. Implementations of the 802.11ah protocol may be used for sensors, metering, and smart grid networks. Advantageously, aspects of certain devices implementing the 802.11ah protocol may consume less power than devices implementing other wireless protocols, and/or may be used to transmit wireless signals across a relatively long range, for example about one kilometer or longer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, a WLAN includes various devices which are the components that access the wireless network. For example, there may be two types of devices: access points (&#x201c;APs&#x201d;) and clients (also referred to as stations, or &#x201c;STAs&#x201d;). In general, an AP serves as a hub or base station for the WLAN and an STA serves as a user of the WLAN. For example, a STA may be a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile phone, etc. In an example, an STA connects to an AP via a WiFi (e.g., IEEE 802.11 protocol such as 802.11ah) compliant wireless link to obtain general connectivity to the Internet or to other wide area networks. In some implementations an STA may also be used as an AP.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An access point (&#x201c;AP&#x201d;) may also comprise, be implemented as, or known as a NodeB, Radio Network Controller (&#x201c;RNC&#x201d;), eNodeB, Base Station Controller (&#x201c;BSC&#x201d;), Base Transceiver Station (&#x201c;BTS&#x201d;), Base Station (&#x201c;BS&#x201d;), Transceiver Function (&#x201c;TF&#x201d;), Radio Router, Radio Transceiver, or some other terminology.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A station &#x201c;STA&#x201d; may also comprise, be implemented as, or known as an access terminal (&#x201c;AT&#x201d;), a subscriber station, a subscriber unit, a mobile station, a remote station, a remote terminal, a user terminal, a user agent, a user device, user equipment, or some other terminology. In some implementations an access terminal may comprise a cellular telephone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (&#x201c;SIP&#x201d;) phone, a wireless local loop (&#x201c;WLL&#x201d;) station, a personal digital assistant (&#x201c;PDA&#x201d;), a handheld device having wireless connection capability, or some other suitable processing device connected to a wireless modem. Accordingly, one or more aspects taught herein may be incorporated into a phone (e.g., a cellular phone or smartphone), a computer (e.g., a laptop), a portable communication device, a headset, a portable computing device (e.g., a personal data assistant), an entertainment device (e.g., a music or video device, or a satellite radio), a gaming device or system, a global positioning system device, or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless medium.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed above, certain of the devices described herein may implement the 802.11ah standard, for example. Such devices, whether used as an STA or AP or other device, may be used for smart metering or in a smart grid network. Such devices may provide sensor applications or be used in home automation. The devices may instead or in addition be used in a healthcare context, for example for personal healthcare. They may also be used for surveillance, to enable extended-range Internet connectivity (e.g., for use with hotspots), or to implement machine-to-machine communications.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Certain of the devices described herein may further implement Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) technology and be implemented as part of the 802.11ah standard. A MIMO system employs multiple (N<sub>T</sub>) transmit antennas and multiple (N<sub>R</sub>) receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the N<sub>T </sub>transmit and N<sub>R </sub>receive antennas may be decomposed into N<sub>S </sub>independent channels, which are also referred to as spatial channels or streams, where N<sub>S</sub>&#x2266;min{N<sub>T</sub>, N<sub>R</sub>}. Each of the N<sub>S </sub>independent channels corresponds to a dimension. The MIMO system can provide improved performance (e.g., higher throughput and/or greater reliability) if the additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and receive antennas are utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communication system <b>100</b> in which aspects of the present disclosure may be employed. The wireless communication system <b>100</b> may operate pursuant to a wireless standard, for example the 802.11ah standard. The wireless communication system <b>100</b> may include an AP <b>104</b>, which communicates with STAs <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A variety of processes and methods may be used for transmissions in the wireless communication system <b>100</b> between the AP <b>104</b> and the STAs <b>106</b>. For example, signals may be sent and received between the AP <b>104</b> and the STAs <b>106</b> in accordance with OFDM/OFDMA techniques. If this is the case, the wireless communication system <b>100</b> may be referred to as an OFDM/OFDMA system.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A communication link that facilitates transmission from the AP <b>104</b> to one or more of the STAs <b>106</b> may be referred to as a downlink (DL) <b>108</b>, and a communication link that facilitates transmission from one or more of the STAs <b>106</b> to the AP <b>104</b> may be referred to as an uplink (UL) <b>110</b>. Alternatively, a downlink <b>108</b> may be referred to as a forward link or a forward channel, and an uplink <b>110</b> may be referred to as a reverse link or a reverse channel.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The AP <b>104</b> may act as a base station and provide wireless communication coverage in a basic service area (BSA) <b>102</b>. The AP <b>104</b> along with the STAs <b>106</b> associated with the AP <b>104</b> and that use the AP <b>104</b> for communication may be referred to as a basic service set (BSS). It should be noted that the wireless communication system <b>100</b> may not have a central AP <b>104</b>, but rather may function as a peer-to-peer network between the STAs <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the functions of the AP <b>104</b> described herein may alternatively be performed by one or more of the STAs <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates various components that may be utilized in a wireless device <b>202</b> that may be employed within the wireless communication system <b>100</b>. The wireless device <b>202</b> is an example of a device that may be configured to implement the various methods described herein. For example, the wireless device <b>202</b> may comprise the AP <b>104</b> or one of the STAs <b>106</b>.</p>

The wireless device <b>202</b> may also include a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>220</b> for use in processing signals. The DSP <b>220</b> may be configured to generate a data unit for transmission. In some aspects, the data unit may comprise a physical layer data unit (PPDU).

The user interface <b>222</b> may comprise a keypad, a microphone, a speaker, and/or a display. The user interface <b>222</b> may include any element or component that conveys information to a user of the wireless device <b>202</b> and/or receives input from the user.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The various components of the wireless device <b>202</b> may be coupled together by a bus system <b>226</b>. The bus system <b>226</b> may include a data bus, for example, as well as a power bus, a control signal bus, and a status signal bus in addition to the data bus. Those of skill in the art will appreciate the components of the wireless device <b>202</b> may be coupled together or accept or provide inputs to each other using some other mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although a number of separate components are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, those of skill in the art will recognize that one or more of the components may be combined or commonly implemented. For example, the processor <b>204</b> may be used to implement not only the functionality described above with respect to the processor <b>204</b>, but also to implement the functionality described above with respect to the signal detector <b>218</b> and/or the DSP <b>220</b>.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As discussed above, the wireless device <b>202</b> may comprise an AP <b>104</b> or an STA <b>106</b>, and may be used to transmit and/or receive communications. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates various components that may be utilized in the wireless device <b>202</b> to transmit wireless communications. The components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be used, for example, to transmit OFDM communications. In some aspects, the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are used to generate and transmit packets to be sent over a bandwidth of less than or equal to 1.25 MHz, as will be discussed in additional detail below. For ease of reference, the wireless device <b>202</b> configured with the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is hereinafter referred to as a wireless device <b>302</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The wireless device <b>302</b><i>a </i>may comprise a modulator <b>302</b> configured to modulate bits for transmission. For example, the modulator <b>302</b> may determine a plurality of symbols from bits received from the processor <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or the user interface <b>222</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for example by mapping bits to a plurality of symbols according to a constellation. The bits may correspond to user data or to control information. In some aspects, the bits are received in codewords. In one aspect, the modulator <b>302</b> comprises a QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) modulator, for example a 16-QAM modulator or a 64-QAM modulator. In other aspects, the modulator <b>302</b> comprises a binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulator or a quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulator.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The wireless device <b>302</b><i>a </i>may further comprise a transform module <b>304</b> configured to convert symbols or otherwise modulated bits from the modulator <b>302</b> into a time domain. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the transform module <b>304</b> is illustrated as being implemented by an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) module. In some implementations, there may be multiple transform modules (not shown) that transform units of data of different sizes. In some implementations, the transform module <b>304</b> may be itself configured to transform units of data of different sizes. For example, the transform module <b>304</b> may be configured with a plurality of modes, and may use a different number of points to convert the symbols in each mode. For example, the IFFT may have a mode where 32 points are used to convert symbols being transmitted over 32 tones (i.e., subcarriers) into a time domain, and a mode where 64 points are used to convert symbols being transmitted over 64 tones into a time domain. The number of points used by the transform module <b>304</b> may be referred to as the size of the transform module <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the modulator <b>302</b> and the transform module <b>304</b> are illustrated as being implemented in the DSP <b>320</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As discussed above, the DSP <b>320</b> may be configured to generate a data unit for transmission. In some aspects, the modulator <b>302</b> and the transform module <b>304</b> may be configured to generate a data unit comprising a plurality of fields including control information and a plurality of data symbols. The fields including the control information may comprise one or more training fields, for example, and one or more signal (SIG) fields. Each of the training fields may include a known sequence of values or symbols. Each of the SIG fields may include information about the data unit, for example a description of a length or data rate of the data unit.</p>

For example, the time-domain output of the transform module <b>306</b> may be converted to a baseband OFDM signal by the digital to analog converter <b>306</b>. The digital to analog converter <b>306</b> may be implemented in the processor <b>204</b> or in another element of the wireless device <b>202</b>. In some aspects, the digital to analog converter <b>306</b> is implemented in the transceiver <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) or in a data transmit processor.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The analog signal may be wirelessly transmitted by the transmitter <b>310</b>. The analog signal may be further processed before being transmitted by the transmitter <b>310</b>, for example by being filtered or by being upconverted to an intermediate or carrier frequency.

Bits for transmission that are to be received at an output of the receiver are provided to an encoder <b>504</b>. The encoder <b>504</b> may apply a forward error correcting (FEC) code on the bit stream. The FEC code may be a block code, a convolutional code, or the like. The encoded bits are provided to an interleaving system <b>505</b> that distributes the encoded bits into N transmit streams.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The interleaving system <b>505</b> includes a stream parser <b>506</b> that parses an input bit stream from the encoder <b>504</b> to N spatial stream interleavers <b>508</b><i>a</i>, <b>508</b><i>b</i>, and <b>508</b><i>n</i>. The stream parser <b>506</b> may be provided with the number of spatial streams and parse bits on a round-robin basis. Other parsing functions may also be used. One parsing function that may be used is k<sub>n</sub>=N<sub>TX</sub>*k+n (i.e., round-robin with one bit per spatial stream, then on to the next spatial stream where k<sub>n </sub>is the input bit index and N<sub>TX </sub>is the number of transmitters/spatial streams). Another more general function f(k,n) might also be used, for example, sending two bits to a spatial stream, then moving on to the next spatial stream. Each interleaver <b>508</b><i>a</i>, <b>508</b><i>b</i>, and <b>508</b><i>n </i>may each thereafter distribute bits so that errors may be recovered due to fading or other channel conditions. Hereinafter the interleavers <b>508</b><i>a</i>, <b>508</b><i>b</i>, and <b>508</b><i>n </i>may be referred to an interleaver <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Each transmit stream may then be modulated by a modulator <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b</i>, or <b>502</b><i>n</i>.

The modulated bits for each stream may be provided to transform modules <b>510</b><i>a</i>, <b>510</b><i>b</i>, and <b>510</b><i>n</i>. In some implementations, the transform modules <b>510</b><i>a</i>, <b>510</b><i>b</i>, and <b>510</b><i>n </i>may perform an inverse discrete time fourier transform (IDFT) to convert the modulated bits from a frequency domain into a time domain.

After the modulated bits have been converted into time domain signals for each spatial stream, the time domain signal may be converted into an analog signal via converters <b>512</b><i>a</i>, <b>512</b><i>b</i>, and <b>512</b><i>n </i>as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, antennas <b>516</b><i>a</i>, <b>516</b><i>b</i>, and <b>516</b><i>n </i>are distinct and spatially separated antennas. In other embodiments, distinct signals might be combined into different polarizations off of fewer than N antennas. An example of this is where spatial rotation or spatial spreading is done, where multiple spatial streams are mapped on a single antenna. In any case, it should be understood that distinct spatial streams can be organized in different manners. For example, a transmit antenna might carry data from more than one spatial stream or several transmit antennas might carry data from a spatial stream. For example, consider the case of a transmitter with four transmit antennas and two spatial streams. Each spatial stream can be mapped onto two transmit antennas in that case, so two antennas are carrying data from just one spatial stream.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As described above, certain implementations described herein may be directed to to wireless communication systems that may be used for smart metering or in a smart grid network. These wireless communication systems may be used to provide sensor applications or be used in home automation. Wireless devices used in such systems may instead or in addition be used in a healthcare context, for example for personal healthcare. They may also be used for surveillance, to enable extended-range Internet connectivity (e.g., for use with hotspots), or to implement machine-to-machine communications. Accordingly, some implementations may use low data rates such as approximately 150 Kpbs. Implementations may further have increased link budget gains (e.g., around 20 dB) over other wireless communications such as 802.11b. In accordance with low data rates, if wireless nodes are configured for use in a home environment, certain aspects may be directed to implementations with good in-home coverage without power amplification. Furthermore, certain aspects may be directed to single-hop networking without using a MESH protocol. In addition, certain implementations may result in significant outdoor coverage improvement with power amplification over other wireless protocols. Furthermore, certain aspects may be directed to implementations that may accommodate large outdoor delay-spread and reduced sensitivity to Doppler. Certain implementations may achieve similar LO accuracy as traditional WiFi.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Accordingly, certain implementations are directed to transmitting and receiving wireless signals in sub-gigahertz bands. In one aspect, this may result in a propagation gain of, for example, 8.5 dB (e.g., available due to 900 MHz vs. 2.4 GHz). In another aspect, obstruction loss may be reduced by using sub-gigahertz signal which may result in, for example, a 3 dB gain.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Certain implementations are further directed to sending wireless signals with low bandwidths in sub-gigahertz bands. This may further allow achieving greater link budget gains over other wireless communication systems. For example, in one exemplary implementation, a symbol may be configured to be transmitted or received using a bandwidth of 1 MHz. A wireless device <b>202</b> may be configured to operate in one of several modes. In one mode, symbols such as OFDM symbols may be transmitted or received using a bandwidth of 1 MHz. In another mode, symbols may be transmitted or received using a bandwidth of 2 MHz. Additional modes may also be provided for transmitting or receiving symbols using a bandwidth of 4 MHz, 8 MHz, 16 MHz, and the like. The bandwidth may also be referred to as the channel width.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Each mode may use a different number of tones/subcarriers for transmitting the information. For example, in one implementation, a 1 MHz mode (corresponding to transmitting or receiving symbols using a bandwidth of 1 MHz) may use 32 tones. In one aspect, using a 1 MHz mode may provide for a 13 dB noise reduction as compared to a bandwidth such as 20 MHz. In addition, low rate techniques may be used to overcome effects such as frequency diversity losses due to a lower bandwidth which could result in 4-5 dB losses depending on channel conditions. To generate/evaluate symbols sent or received using 32 tones, a transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> as described above may be configured to use a 32 point mode (e.g., a 32 point IFFT or FFT). The 32 tones may be allocated as data tones, pilot tones, guard tones, and a DC tone. In one implementation, 24 tones may be allocated as data tones, 2 tones may be allocated as pilot tones, five tones may be allocated as guard tones, and 1 tone may be reserved for the DC tone. In this implementation, the symbol duration may be configured to be 40 &#x3bc;s including cyclic prefix.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, a wireless device <b>302</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be configured to generate a packet for transmission via a wireless signal using a bandwidth of 1 MHz.

The packet may be formed of one or more OFDM symbols having 32 tones allocated as just described using a processor <b>320</b>. A transform module <b>304</b> in a transmit chain may be configured as an IFFT module operating according to a thirty-two point mode to convert the packet into a time domain signal. A transmitter <b>310</b> may then be configured to transmit the packet.</p>

The wireless device <b>402</b><i>b </i>may include a processor <b>420</b> including a transform module <b>404</b> in a receive chain that may be configured as an FFT module operating according to a thirty-two point mode to transform the time domain signal into a frequency spectrum. A processor <b>420</b> may be configured to evaluate the packet. The 1 MHz mode may support a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for both a low data rate and a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; rate. According to some implementations, the preamble <b>702</b> may be designed for a low rate mode that offers reliable detection and improved channel estimation as will be further described below. Each mode may be configured to use a corresponding preamble configured to optimize transmissions for the mode and desired characteristics as will be further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In addition to a 1 MHz mode, a 2 MHz mode may additionally be available that may be used to transmit and receive symbols using 64 tones. In one implementation, the 64 tones may be allocated as 52 data tones, 4 pilot tones, 1 DC tone, and 7 guard tones. As such, a transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may be configured to operate according to a 64 point mode when transmitting or receiving 2 MHz symbols. The symbol duration may also be 40 &#x3bc;s including cyclic prefix. Additional modes with different bandwidths (e.g., 4 MHz, 8 MHz, and 16 MHz) may be provided that may use transform modules <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> operating in modes of corresponding different sizes (e.g., <b>128</b> point FFT, 256 point FFT, 512 point FFT, etc.). In addition, each of the modes described above may be configured additionally according to both a single user mode and a multi user mode. Wireless signals using bandwidths less than or equal to 2 MHz may provide various advantages for providing wireless nodes that are configured to meet global regulatory constraints over a broad range of bandwidth, power, and channel limitations.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Additional modes transmitting over different signal bandwidths are also possible. For example symbols may be transmitted over bandwidths of 625 KHz, 1.25 MHz, or 5 MHz according to some implementations.

In another aspect, the bandwidth may be between 625 KHz and 1.25 MHz. The packet may be formed of one or more OFDM symbols having 32 tones allocated as 24 data tones, 2 pilot tones, 5 guard tones, and 1 DC tone using a processor <b>320</b>. A transform module <b>304</b> in a transmit chain may be configured as an IFFT module operating according to a thirty-two point mode to convert the packet into a time domain signal. A transmitter <b>310</b> may then be configured to transmit the packet.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Likewise, a wireless device <b>402</b><i>b </i>may be configured to receive the packet over a bandwidth of lower than or equal to 1.25 MHz.

In one implementation, to operate according to a mode such as 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 4 MHz, etc. as described above, a controller <b>224</b> may be configured to downclock one or more of the components in the wireless device <b>202</b> such that the wireless device <b>202</b> will operate in a 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 4 MHz, 8 MHz, or 16 MHz. In addition, the controller <b>224</b> may be configured to downclock operation of one or more of the components in the wireless device <b>202</b> such that the wireless device <b>202</b> will operate in modes corresponding to using bandwidths of 5 MHz, 2.5 MHz, 1.25 MHz, and/or 0.625 MHz channel width. During such downclocked operation, the number of tones used by the transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may remain the same in some aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Downclocking operation of the wireless device <b>202</b> may comprise operating one or more of the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> at a reduced clock rate. For example, the downclocking may comprise operating the processor <b>204</b>, the signal detector <b>218</b>, the DSP <b>220</b>, and/or any other digital signal circuitry at a lower rate, for example by adjusting, modifying, or assigning the timing settings of one or more of these components. In some aspects, the downclocked operation is performed in response to a command from the controller <b>224</b>. In some aspects, the controller <b>224</b> provides a clock signal which is reduced in comparison to a clock signal used when operating in the 20 MHz, 40 MHz, or 80 MHz channel width.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In some aspects, the controller <b>224</b> is configured to cause the operation of the wireless device <b>202</b> to be downclocked by a factor of 10 (e.g., by 10&#xd7;). In such configuration, operation in the 20 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 2 MHz channel width, and operation in the 40 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 4 MHz channel width. Furthermore, operation in the 80 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in an 8 MHz channel width, and operation in the 160 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 16 MHz channel width.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some aspects, the controller <b>224</b> is configured to cause the operation of the wireless device <b>202</b> to be downclocked by a factor of 4 (e.g., by 4&#xd7;). In such configuration, operation in the 20 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 5 MHz channel width, and operation in the 40 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 10 MHz channel width.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some aspects, the controller <b>224</b> is configured to cause the operation of the wireless device <b>202</b> to be downclocked by a factor of 8 (e.g., by 8&#xd7;). In such configuration, operation in the 20 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 2.5 MHz channel width, and operation in the 40 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 5 MHz channel width. Similarly, operation in the 80 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 10 MHz channel width.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some aspects, the controller <b>224</b> is configured to cause the operation of the wireless device <b>202</b> to be downclocked by a factor of 16 (e.g., by 16&#xd7;). In such configuration, operation in the 20 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 1.25 MHz channel width, and operation in the 40 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 2.5 MHz band. Similarly, operation in the 80 MHz channel width will be downclocked to operation in a 2.5 MHz channel width.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In order to enable operation in a 0.625 MHz channel width, operation in the MHz channel width may be downclocked by a factor of 32 (e.g., by 32&#xd7;). As discussed above, during such operation, the transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may continue to operate using 64 tones. When the wireless device <b>202</b> operates in the 0.625 MHz channel width, the carrier frequency will be reduced, which may decrease the phase noise. When the wireless device <b>202</b> operates in the 1 MHz mode, downclocking may be used, for example by a factor of 10&#xd7;, for purposes such as providing the symbol duration (e.g., for 40 &#x3bc;s.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When operating according to a 0.625 channel width, when the transform module <b>304</b> and/or the transform module <b>404</b> uses 32 points instead of 64, operation in a 20 MHz channel width may be downclocked by 16&#xd7;. Downclocking by 16&#xd7; instead of by 32&#xd7; reduces the increase in symbol duration, which reduces the phase drift within a transmitted symbol. In such aspects, any increase in phase noise due to downclocking by 16&#xd7; instead of 32&#xd7; may be offset by the reduction in phase drift, which may reduce hardware requirements. Further, requirements of the pulse position modulation (PPM) may be eased due to frequency offset in 16&#xd7;. Similar benefits may also apply to using a 1 MHz bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Similarly as described above, in one aspect, when a 1 MHz bandwidth for transmission or reception of OFDM symbols is used, a 32 point transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may be used. In this case tones may be allocated as 24 data tones, 2 pilot tones, 5 guard tones, and a DC tone. In another aspect, when a 2 MHz bandwidth for transmission or reception of OFDM symbols is used, a 64 point transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may be used. In this case tones may be allocated as 52 data tones, 4 pilot tones, 7 guard tones, and a DC tone. In yet another aspect, when a 4 MHz bandwidth for transmission or reception of OFDM symbols is used, a 64 point transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may be used. In this case tones may be allocated as 108 data tones, 6 pilot tones, 11 guard tones, and three DC tones. In yet a further aspect, when a 8 MHz bandwidth for transmission or reception of OFDM symbols is used, a 256 point transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may be used. In this case tones may be allocated as 234 data tones, 8 pilot tones, 11 guard tones, and three DC tones. Accordingly, the spacing between tones for these bandwidths may be 31.25 KHz. In addition, the symbol duration may be 40 &#x3bc;s including a cyclic prefix of either 4 &#x3bc;s (for short cyclic prefixes) or 8 &#x3bc;s (for long cyclic prefixes). A longer cyclic prefix may be used to accommodate outdoor delay spreads. Furthermore, large symbol durations may be needed to keep cyclic prefix overhead manageable.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Similar tone allocations may be used for other bandwidths. For example, in another aspect, when a 625 KHz bandwidth for transmission or reception of OFDM symbols is used, a 32 point transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may be used. In this case tones may be allocated as 24 data tones, 2 pilot tones, 5 guard tones, and a DC tone. In another aspect, when a 1.25 MHz bandwidth for transmission or reception of OFDM symbols is used, a 64 point transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may be used. In this case, tones may be allocated as 52 data tones, 4 pilot tones, 7 guard tones, and a DC tone. In yet another aspect, when a 2.5 MHz bandwidth for transmission or reception of OFDM symbols is used, a 64 point transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may be used. In this case tones may be allocated as 108 data tones, 6 pilot tones, 11 guard tones, and three DC tones. In yet a further aspect, when a 5 MHz bandwidth for transmission or reception of OFDM symbols is used, a 256 point transform module <b>304</b> or <b>404</b> may be used. In this case tones may be allocated as 234 data tones, 8 pilot tones, 11 guard tones, and three DC tones. Accordingly, the spacing between tones for these bandwidths may be 19.5 KHz. In addition, the symbol duration may be 51.2 &#x3bc;s including a cyclic prefix of either 6.4 &#x3bc;s (short) or 12.8 &#x3bc;s (long).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some aspects, the amount by which operation of the wireless device <b>202</b> is downclocked is predetermined. For example, the downclocking factor may be stored in the memory <b>206</b> or the controller <b>224</b>, and loaded at startup of the wireless device <b>202</b>. In such configuration, the controller <b>224</b> may cause the wireless device <b>202</b> to operate in a downclocked mode according to the predetermined or loaded downclocking factor.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some aspects, the amount by which operation of the wireless device <b>202</b> is downclocked at any given time may be determined in situ. For example, the signal detector <b>218</b> may determine a downclocking factor from a beacon or pilot received by the receiver <b>212</b>. In some aspects, this factor is determined at startup of the device, or when connecting to the network for the first time. In some aspects, a new factor is determined during handoff of the wireless device <b>202</b> or each time the wireless device <b>202</b> connects to a new network. In some aspects, a predetermined factor may be modified or updated based on a received signal, such as based on a received beacon or pilot. In this way, the wireless device <b>202</b> may operate in different bandwidths pursuant to a location of the device or a network to which the device is connecting, for example. The controller <b>224</b> may cause the wireless device <b>202</b> to operate in a downclocked mode according to the determined downclocking factor.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some aspects, the wireless device <b>202</b> is permanently configured to operate in the downclocked mode. For example, the components of the wireless device <b>202</b> may be hardwired or have firmware installed therein that causes the device to always perform downclocked operation. In such aspects, the wireless device <b>202</b> may be incapable of communicating in the 20 MHz, 40 MHz, and 80 MHz channel widths. Further, the factor of downclocking may be fixed in such aspects. For example, the components may be manufactured and/or installed so as to implement only the fixed downclocking factor. In other aspects, the wireless device may be operated in any of the 20 MHz, 40 MHz, and 80 MHz channel widths, or may be selectively downclocked by the controller <b>224</b> to operate in the 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 4, MHz, 8 MHz, and 16 MHz channel width.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some implementations, when transmitting in a sub-gigahertz range (e.g., 900 MHz), a repetition mode may be used where repetition coding is implemented. A repetition mode may allow for accurate transmission over long distances without sacrificing too much preamble overhead. In some implementations 2&#xd7; repetition encoding may be used. For example, repetition encoding may allow for as little as 105 dB of pathloss to provide good in-home coverage. When using a wireless sensor network, without repetition coding, customers may have to install higher-power sensors in difficult to reach places. It may not be practical to sell two types of sensors (sensors for &#x201c;easy to reach places&#x201d; versus &#x201c;difficult to reach places&#x201d;). Furthermore, high-power sensors may not be able to work with low power batteries (e.g., coin-cell batteries) due to peak current drain. Alternatively, without repetition, multiple APs could be installed. However, choosing location &#x26; configuration of the APs could be non-trivial for an average consumer. As such, repetition coding may provide various advantages for certain implementations for low data rate applications such as sensor networks.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As an example, in one aspect BPSK rate &#xbd; coding may be used with 4&#xd7; repetition yielding 94 Kbps. In another aspect, BPSK rate &#xbd; coding may be used with 2&#xd7; repetition yielding 188 Kbps. In yet another aspect, BPSK rate &#xbd; coding may be used yielding 375 Kbps. In a further aspect, 64 QAM rate &#xbe; coding may be used resulting in 3.75 Mbps.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some implementations, the 1 MHz mode and the 2 MHz mode may be required and configured to be interoperable. Using two required modes may avoid issues where devices could be configured for some regulatory regions but may not work for other regulatory regions and may allow for devices to have more options if regulatory constraints change allowing for less restrictive communications. Higher bandwidths (e.g., 8 MHz) may be used for cellular offload.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when transmitting packets in sub-gigahertz bands with bandwidths as described above, the preamble <b>702</b> may be designed to have robust mode detection in an early state of the preamble to detect between different modes. The preamble <b>702</b> may further be optimized to minimize overhead and provide adequate coexistence of devices transmitting using the 1 MHz mode and devices transmitting using greater than or equal to 2 MHz modes. The preamble <b>702</b> may be designed to have robust mode detection in an early state of the preamble to detect between 1 MHz transmissions (32 pt FFT) and 2 MHz transmissions (64 pt FFT). The physical layer packet <b>700</b> may be generated for transmission for different data rates to allow in one aspect for transmission of data over greater distances. For example, the physical layer packet <b>700</b> may be generated for a low data rate along with another &#x201c;normal&#x201d; data rate as described above.</p>

The periodicity of the non-zero tones may be the same as used for STF sequences used in higher bandwidths such as 2 MHz. In some implementations, the STF field <b>804</b><i>a </i>may be boosted, such as by 3 dB for repetition coding. The STF <b>804</b><i>a </i>may be sent over four OFDM symbols where each symbol repeats a known STF sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The preamble <b>802</b><i>a </i>may further include a long training field (LTF) <b>806</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In some cases, it may be desirable to use additional guard tones for the LTF <b>806</b><i>b </i>and/or SIG <b>808</b><i>b </i>fields. For example, it may be desirable for the 4 MHz, 8 MHz, and 16 MHz preamble symbols to correspond to corresponding symbols used for 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz of 802.11ac transmissions. As one example, the LTF <b>806</b><i>b </i>may use the VHT-LTFs for 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz 802.11ac transmissions depending on whether the OFDM symbol is for 4 MHz, 8 MHz, and 16 MHz respectively. As the VHT-LTFs for 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz have 11 guard tones (5/6), using these VHT-LTFs may not provide non-zero values for channel estimation for 2 tones at each edge, for example if the SIG <b>808</b><i>b </i>field allocated 52 tones for data. Furthermore, there may be stricter filtering requirements for symbols being transmitted using greater bandwidths (4 MHz, 8 MHz, and 16 MHz) if the LTF <b>806</b><i>b </i>and SIG <b>808</b><i>b </i>are transmitted using 52 data tones (i.e., having less guard tones). Duplicating the LTF <b>802</b><i>b </i>used for 2 MHz transmissions may fail to adequately address these issues as the LTF uses 52 non-zero tones and thus the same guard tone issue remains. As such, an optimized LTF <b>806</b><i>b </i>and SIG <b>808</b><i>b </i>may be provided for 2, 4, and 8 MHz transmissions. In one aspect, the fields are chosen so as to be able to re-use 20, 40, and 80 MHz LTF sequences used for IEEE 802.11ac packets.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As such, in one implementation, for the 2 MHz packets shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</figref>, the SIG fields <b>808</b><i>b </i>and <b>808</b><i>c </i>may be transmitted using a different tone allocation than the rest of the fields of the packets <b>800</b><i>b </i>and <b>800</b><i>c</i>. For example, The SIG fields <b>808</b><i>b </i>and <b>808</b><i>c </i>may be transmitted using 48 data tones rather than 52 data tones. This may correspond to the tone allocation used for an L-SIG of 802.11a tone allocation. This SIG field <b>808</b><i>b </i>and <b>808</b><i>c </i>may then be duplicated for each 2 MHz segment for transmissions over 2 MHz. In another implementation, the STFs <b>804</b><i>b </i>and <b>804</b><i>c</i>, the LTFs <b>806</b><i>b </i>and <b>806</b><i>c</i>, and the SIG fields <b>808</b><i>b </i>and <b>808</b><i>c </i>may be generated for transmission using a different tone allocation than the rest of the fields of the packet. For example the STFs <b>804</b><i>b </i>and <b>804</b><i>c</i>, the LTFs <b>806</b><i>b </i>and <b>806</b><i>c</i>, and the SIG fields <b>808</b><i>b </i>and <b>808</b><i>c </i>may be generated for transmission using 48 tones allocated for data.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As described above, the SIG fields <b>808</b><i>b </i>and <b>808</b><i>c </i>for a 2 MHz mode may use two symbols transmitting up to 52 bits of data. The entries into the SIG fields <b>808</b><i>b </i>and <b>808</b><i>c </i>may correspond to the entries shown in Table 2 below. The first 26 bits that are un-shaded may correspond to the first symbol while the last 26 bits that are shaded may correspond to the second symbol. It should be appreciated that while 52 bits of data are shown in the table below, however as described above, in some implementations, the SIG fields <b>808</b><i>b </i>and <b>808</b><i>c </i>may be sent using 48 data tones and as such the SIG field may correspond to 48 bits. In one corresponding implementation, the number of reserved bits shown in Table 2 below may be reduced so that 48 bits are sent or received.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram showing another exemplary structure of a preamble <b>910</b> and payload <b>920</b> of a physical layer packet <b>900</b> for transmission via wireless signal. The packet <b>900</b> may be used when the wireless device <b>202</b> is downclocked from the 20 MHZ channel width or the 40 MHz channel width to operate in a 1.25 MHz or 2.5 MHz channel width, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the illustrated aspect, the packet <b>900</b> comprises a preamble <b>910</b> and a payload <b>920</b>. The preamble <b>910</b> may include a training field and signal (SIG) field. In the aspect illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the training field comprises a short training field (STF) <b>912</b> followed by a long training field (LTF) <b>914</b>. Each of the STF <b>912</b> and LTF <b>914</b> may comprise 2 symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The preamble <b>910</b> further comprises a SIG field <b>916</b>. The SIG field <b>916</b> may indicate a duration of the packet <b>900</b>, as well as other parameters such as bandwidth of a remaining portion of the packet <b>900</b>. In some aspects, the SIG field <b>916</b> comprises a space-time block coding (STBC) sub-field, a modulation and coding scheme (MCS) sub-field, and/or a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) sub-field. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the SIG field <b>916</b> may comprise 2-3 symbols. In some aspects, the SIG field <b>916</b> comprises a greater number of symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In some aspects, the SIG field <b>916</b> is transmitted in the lowest bandwidth being used in the wireless system <b>100</b> or being used by the AP <b>104</b>, or is transmitted to be compatible with a transform module using the lowest number of points in the wireless system <b>100</b>. For example, when 1.25 MHz and 2.5 MHz channel widths are being transmitted over 64 and 128 tones, respectively, the SIG field <b>916</b> is transmitted over 64 tones. This may similarly be applied for channel widths of 1 MHz and 2 MHz respectfully. This allows terminals that are incapable of receiving communications over the higher bandwidth or over a greater number of tones, or terminals that are not listening on the higher bandwidth or over the greater number of tones, to receive the SIG field <b>916</b> and determine the length of the packet <b>900</b>. In this way, collisions in the system <b>100</b> may be reduced because all terminals, regardless of the bandwidth or transform module they are using, may determine when the packet <b>900</b> is being communicated. The STF <b>912</b> and/or the LTF <b>914</b> may be transmitted in the same channel width or over the same number of tones as the SIG field <b>916</b>. A remaining portion of the packet <b>900</b> may be transmitted in the same bandwidth or in a different bandwidth, or over the same or a different number of tones, which may be indicated in the SIG field <b>916</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The STF <b>912</b> and the LTF <b>914</b> may comprise a high throughput short training field sequence (HT-STF) and an HT-LTF, respectively that may correspond to fields used according to an IEEE 802.11n transmission. In the preamble <b>910</b>, however, the length of the SIG field <b>916</b> may be greater than the length of the HT-SIG field in the Greenfield preamble. This increased length may be used to indicate transmission features which are not available in the 802.11n standard.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">For example, in addition to being used when the wireless device <b>202</b> is downclocked to operate in a 1.25 MHz or 2.5 MHz channel width, the packet <b>900</b> may additionally be used when the wireless device <b>202</b> is downclocked from the 80 MHz channel width to operate in a 5 MHz channel width. In this aspect, the SIG field <b>916</b> may include an additional symbol so that the SIG field <b>916</b> may indicate whether a 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, or 5 MHz channel width is used for a remaining portion of the packet <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In some aspects, the length of the STBC sub-field, MCS sub-field, or CRC sub-field may be reduced in comparison to the 802.11n Greenfield preamble. For example, instead of including a number of bits in the STBC sub-field sufficient to allow for an odd number of space-time streams, the STBC sub-field may be reduced to one bit in some aspects. In such aspect, the bit indicates whether STBC encoding was performed with respect to all of the space-time streams or alternatively none of the space-time streams. When the length of the STBC sub-field, MCS sub-field, and/or CRC sub-field is reduced, the SIG field <b>916</b> may include bits that indicate whether a 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, or 5 MHz channel width is used for a remaining portion of the packet <b>900</b> without increasing the length of the SIG field <b>916</b> in comparison to the 802.11n Greenfield preamble (and similarly for a 1 MHz, 2 MHz, or 4 MHz channel width). In one aspect, the MCS sub-field may have a length of less than 7 bits while the CRC sub-field may have a length of less than 8 bits. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the MCS sub-field may have a length of 4 bits while the CRC may also have a length of 4 bits.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In some aspects, the SIG field <b>916</b> may comprise an indicator signifying whether multi-user multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) information is included. In these aspects, some or all of the MU-MIMO information may be transmitted in the SIG field <b>916</b>. Thus, the increased length of the SIG field <b>916</b> may be used to include such indicator and/or such MU-MIMO information.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some aspects, the SIG field <b>916</b> is transmitted and received over 52 data tones. In contrast, the HT-SIG field is typically sent over 48 data tones when transmitting pursuant to 802.11n in order to accommodate legacy terminals. Further, the SIG field <b>916</b> may be transmitted without rotation in some aspects, in contrast to 802.11n Greenfield transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The packet <b>900</b> may further comprise one or more data or extension LTFs <b>918</b>. The data or extension LTFs <b>918</b> may be used to form a channel estimate for demodulating the payload <b>920</b>. In aspects where MU-MIMO information is included in the SIG field <b>916</b>, the number of data or extensions LTF <b>918</b> may be based at least in part on the number of users for which the MU-MIMO information is included. Further, the packet <b>900</b> may include one or more additional STFs after the SIG field <b>918</b> when the MU-MIMO information is included. The one or more additional STFs may be steer or beamformed, for example by using different precoding.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">When the system <b>100</b> is using 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, and 5 MHz channel widths, or when the wireless device <b>202</b> is configured to receive or transmit communications over all three of these bandwidths, a preamble that is similar to the preamble used in 802.11 ac communications may be used by the wireless device <b>202</b>. As discussed above, a 20 MHz, 40 MHz, or 80 MHz channel width may be used with 802.11ac communications. Thus, a downclocked version of the 802.11 ac preamble may be used when channel widths of 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, and 5 MHz are being used.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some aspects, the L-SIG field which is generally included in the 802.11ac preamble may be omitted in the downclocked preamble. Omitting the L-SIG field may reduce the length of the preamble in some aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an example of a packet <b>1000</b> in which an L-SIG field is omitted. The packet <b>1000</b> may comprise a PHY layer packet for use with the wireless device <b>202</b>. The packet <b>1000</b> may be used when the wireless device <b>202</b> is downclocked from the 20 MHZ, 40 MHz, and 80 MHz channel widths to operate in 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, and 5 MHz channel widths, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The packet <b>1000</b> comprises a preamble <b>1010</b> and a payload <b>1030</b>. The preamble <b>1010</b> comprises an STF <b>1012</b>, and LTF <b>1014</b>, and a SIGA field <b>1016</b>. In some aspects, the STF <b>1012</b>, LTF <b>1014</b>, and SIGA field <b>1016</b> may include information similar to the information included in the STF <b>912</b>, LTF <b>914</b>, and SIG field <b>916</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In one aspect, an L-SIG field that could be included between the LTF <b>1014</b> and the SIGA field <b>1016</b> in other implementations is omitted. In some aspects, the length of the SIGA field <b>1016</b> is less than the length of the combined length of the L-SIG field and the SIGA field in the 802.11ac standard. In some aspects, the SIGA field <b>1016</b> indicates a duration of the packet <b>1000</b> and/or indicates whether MU-MIMO information is included. The SIGA field <b>1016</b> may further indicate which of the 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, and 5 MHz channel widths is used for a remaining portion of the packet <b>1000</b> (or similarly 1 MHz, 2 MHz, and 4 MHz).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The preamble <b>1010</b> may further comprise one or more STFs <b>1022</b> and one or more LTFs <b>1024</b>. The STFs <b>1022</b> and LTFs <b>1024</b> may include information similar to the information included in the LTFs <b>918</b> and the additional STFs discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The preamble <b>1010</b> may further comprise one or more SIGB fields <b>1026</b>. The SIGB fields <b>1026</b> may include user-specific information such as modulation and coding rate.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some aspects, the portions of the packet <b>1000</b> that are shaded in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> are spatially multiplexed, beamformed, or otherwise steered to a different device, for example when MU-MIMO is used. Each of the STFs <b>1022</b>, LTFs <b>1024</b>, and/or SIGB fields <b>1026</b> may include information specific to a user or device when MU-MIMO is used.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an example of a packet <b>1100</b>. The packet <b>1100</b> may comprise a PHY layer packet for use with the wireless device <b>202</b>, for example. The packet <b>1100</b> may be used in the system <b>100</b> when the 0.625 MHz channel width is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The packet <b>1100</b> comprises a preamble <b>1110</b> and a payload <b>1120</b>. The preamble <b>1110</b> comprises an STF <b>1112</b>, an LTF <b>1114</b>, and a SIG field <b>1116</b>. The STF <b>1112</b> and the LTF <b>1114</b> each comprise two symbols, and may include information similar to the information included in the STF <b>912</b> and the LTF <b>914</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In contrast to the STF <b>912</b> and the LTF <b>914</b>, however, both of the STF <b>1112</b> and the LTF <b>1114</b> are compatible with a transform module using 32 points. For example, the wireless device <b>202</b> may generate the STF <b>1112</b> and the LTF <b>1114</b> by using the 32-point mode of the transform module <b>304</b> when generating the packet <b>1100</b> for transmission. Similarly, the wireless device <b>202</b> may use the 32-point mode of the transform module <b>404</b> to evaluate the STF <b>1112</b> and the LTF <b>1114</b> when the packet <b>1100</b> is received.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some aspects, the STF <b>1112</b> and the LTF <b>1114</b> are optimized to have a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) over 32 tones. The STF <b>1112</b> and LTF <b>1114</b> may be repeated across frequencies when transmitted over bandwidths greater than 0.625 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the aspect illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the SIG field <b>1116</b> comprises 3-6 symbols. In some aspects, the SIG field <b>916</b> comprises a greater number of symbols. Further, the SIG field <b>1116</b> is compatible with a transform module using 32 points.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The SIG field <b>1116</b> may include all of the information which the SIG field <b>916</b>, discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, includes. For example, the SIG field <b>1116</b> may indicate a duration of the packet <b>1100</b>, as well as other parameters. The SIG field <b>1116</b> may comprise an STBC sub-field, an MCS sub-field, and/or a CRC sub-field. The SIG field <b>1116</b> may further include information regarding MU-MIMO, and may indicate whether a 0.625 MHz, 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, or 5 MHz channel band is used for a remaining portion of the packet <b>1100</b> (or similarly 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 4 MHz, or 8 MHz).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The SIG field <b>1116</b> may be transmitted over 32 tones, however, due to the compatibility with the transform using 32 points. Thus, the length of the SIG field <b>1116</b> is greater than the length of the SIG field <b>916</b> in order to accommodate all of the information that may be contained in the SIG field <b>1116</b>. In some aspects, the length of the SIG field <b>1116</b> is double the length of the SIG field <b>916</b> when similar information is included in the two. In some aspects, the SIG field <b>1116</b> may have fewer than twice the number of symbols in the SIG field <b>916</b> when transmitted similar information. For example, although the SIG field <b>914</b> may comprise 2 symbols in certain aspects, the SIG field <b>1116</b> may consist of only 3 symbols when transmitting the same information. This may be accomplished in some aspects by reducing the number of bits in the STBC, MCS, and/or CRC sub-fields.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some aspects, the length of the SIG field <b>1116</b> varies based on its contents. The SIG field <b>1116</b> may be repeated across frequencies when transmitted over bandwidths greater than 0.625 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The preamble <b>1110</b> may further comprise one or more data or extension LTFs <b>1118</b>. The data or extension LTFs <b>1118</b> may be configured similar to the LTFs <b>918</b>, and the payload <b>1120</b> may be configured similar to the payload <b>920</b>, except that each of the LTFs <b>1118</b> and the payload <b>1120</b> may be transmitted or received in the 0.625 MHz channel width. Thus, each of the each of the LTFs <b>1118</b> and the payload <b>1120</b> may be operated on by a transform module using 32 points, and each may be received over 24-32 tones.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In some aspects, it may be possible to reduce the length of the SIG field <b>1116</b> by dividing the SIG field <b>1116</b> into a plurality of portions. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an example of a packet <b>1200</b> having a divided SIG field. The packet <b>1200</b> may comprise a PHY layer packet for use with the wireless device <b>202</b>, and may be used in the system <b>100</b> when the 0.625 MHz channel width is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The packet <b>1200</b> comprises a preamble <b>1210</b> and the payload <b>1220</b>, discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The preamble <b>1210</b> comprises the STF <b>1212</b> and the LTF <b>1214</b> discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The preamble <b>1210</b> further comprises a SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>and a SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b</i>. In some aspects, a great number of SIG fields may be included in the packet <b>1200</b>. In the aspect illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>comprises one symbol, and the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>comprises 2-3 symbols. In some aspects, either of the SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>and the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>may comprise additional symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In the packet <b>1200</b>, a SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>is compatible with a transform module having the smallest size in the wireless system <b>100</b>. In the wireless system <b>100</b> discussed above, the smallest size transform module uses 32 points (e.g., when transmitting or receiving in the 0.625 MHz channel width). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>is compatible with a transform module using 32 tones, and thus may be transmitted and received over 32 tones. The SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>may be repeated across frequencies when transmitted over bandwidths greater than 0.625 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>may indicate a duration of the packet <b>1200</b>. Thus, all terminals in the wireless system <b>100</b>, regardless of the bandwidth or transform module they are using, may determine when the packet <b>1200</b> is being communicated. Further, the SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>indicates a number of tones or a transform module size for receiving the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b</i>, or a bandwidth over which the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>is transmitted. For example, the SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>may indicate whether the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>should be evaluated with a transform module using 32 points or 64 points, and/or whether the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>should be received over the 0.625 MHz channel width, or over a 1.25 MHz, 2.5 MHz, or 5 MHz channel width.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In some aspects, a higher bandwidth is used for the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>than is used for the SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a</i>. The higher bandwidth may be used when transmitting to terminals that are configured for reception in the higher bandwidth, or based on a bandwidth allocation determined by the AP <b>106</b>. In some aspects, the amount of information being conveyed in the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>may be used to determine which bandwidth is used for the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">When the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>is transmitted in a greater bandwidth, for example over a greater number of tones, than the SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a</i>, more information may be included in the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>than may fit in the SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a</i>. Bifurcating the SIG field of the packet <b>1200</b> as discussed herein may therefore ensure that the duration of the packet <b>1200</b> may be properly determined by all terminals in the system <b>100</b>, while reducing the length of the SIG field (i.e., the combined length of the SIG<b>1</b> field <b>1216</b><i>a </i>and SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b</i>) in certain communications. For example, the SIG<b>2</b> field <b>1216</b><i>b </i>may be transmitted over 64 tones for bandwidths greater than 0.625 MHz, which may reduce the 3-6 symbol length of the SIG field <b>1116</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.
