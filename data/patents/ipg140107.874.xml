<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention in question refers to a liquid fuel-fired furnace installation, including its functional description. The liquid fuel in form of ecologic alcohol is combusted in the furnace installation, fireplace for example, emitting heat, which is used for compartment heating. Moreover, the furnace installation can be used for decorative purposes in various types of public compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Bio-fireplace furnace installation according to Polish patent application P 385294, in which the furnace installation consists of two basal parts, accumulative container and radiator chamber in form of a tailored in shape cover, is already commonly known. The container is mounted in an additional vessel, whereas its part with the radiator chambers is shape tailored to the container shape with suitably shaped chambers in form of semicircular open vessels in the upper part. The presented furnace installation and its functional description does not satisfy conditions of the newest rigorous regulations with respect to the use of liquid fuel furnace installations, in which the fuel is located near the furnace, being combusted in the open area over the furnace installation. Moreover, the presented furnace installation does not assure a possibility of its cubic capacity increase with respect to the delivered liquid fuel, what can result in a filling frequency reduction, precluding immediate quenching. Commonly known furnace installations are also sensitive to air blasts and they heat up the fuel containers. A number of improvements was introduced in the solution of furnace installation from patent description EP 2028420 A1. However, mode of the liquid fuel combustion is based on the rule that combustion of fluid delivered via pipe into a furnace installation takes place in result of combustion of combustible gases over the furnace installation surface. Such manner of the liquid fuel combustion requires use of complex control systems, including combustion process control. Another disadvantage of this solution is a lack of a possibility of automatic fuel ignition from an electric spark, if the ambient temperature is lower than 15&#xb0; C., as the phenomenon of suitable fuel evaporation allowing a vapor concentration needed for ignition from the electric is not observed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention presented here is aimed at a construction of the furnace installation eliminating the mentioned disadvantages. Its principle of operation would be based on different rule with respect to liquid fuel combustion manner, whereas the new principle should allow the furnace installation cubic capacity increase in case of disposable amount of delivered fuel, as well as with respect to the installation operational safety.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In case of the new furnace installation, the basic task was realized in such manner that, according to the invention essential features, the installation consists of at least one fuel tank, a fuel evaporation plate, a fuel vapor distribution plate and a fuel flow cut-off valve, whereas the fuel tank is connected via a conduit with the fuel evaporation plate, which is equipped with a vapor outlet connected with a cut-off valve. It is also equipped with an externally mounted heating plate with a fuel light up inlet, whereas the vapor distribution plate is connected to the inlet connector and having holes in an upper part for vapor exhaust.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, the furnace installation, according to significant invention features, is characterized by a fuel tank equipped with fuel inlet and vent pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an advantageous option, the furnace installation is equipped with two fuel tanks, positioned in parallel, and connected via a pipe conduit. Evaporation plate and distribution plate are located between the fuel tanks. The main tank located near the fuel inlet used for firing up is equipped with a metering pump, and a firing up trough with a wick located under the fuel inlet. All mentioned components are closed in a housing equipped with ventilation slots.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another option, a furnace installation adapted for remote electronic control, is characterized by a set of heaters replacing the heating plate and electric valve and distribution plate temperature sensors and an evaporation plate temperature sensor, as well as automatic spark ignition and a set of safety sensors, including movement sensor, carbon oxide or optional carbon dioxide sensor, humidity sensor, are installed in the control system, whereas the fuel inlet in the main tank is protected with a mobile cover connected with a switch disabling the installation when the cover is open.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an aspect of the principle of operation, the invention characteristic feature is that only fuel vapors are combusted in the furnace installation. The liquid fuel delivered into the combustion chamber is previously heated up in a heating chamber up to a selected temperature, until obtaining vapors, which in result of generated pressure are transferred into the combustion zone being the surface of an optionally shaped distribution chamber with numerous holes. Vapors get out via these holes and after ignition they are exposed to a controlled combustion process.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A next essential operational feature of the furnace installation is that the fuel is delivered to the evaporation plate in a gravitational manner, due to the connected vessels principle. The fuel is delivered in such manner that an aerial layer is left over the fuel table, which protects the fuel against entry into the valve and then into the fuel inlet. A small amount of fuel is metered for the ignition. The fuel is ignited in the heating plate what results in a fast heating of the evaporation plate together with the fuel, and the generated fuel vapors, under the influence of vaporization and raised pressure are transferred into the valve, and via an inlet connection into the distribution plate, where they are propagated and then exhausted via plate holes over the plate along its whole length. Then, after fuel depletion in the heating plate, the fuel vapors combusted over the distribution plate heat up the plate and its heat is transferred onto an evaporation stimulating process of fuel combustion on a targeted level in a self-acting manner, up to the moment of fuel depletion in the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, the principle of operation of the furnace installation is characterized by this that the flame extinguishing or stoppage of the fuel vapor combustion process is obtained as a result of cut-off valve closing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other essential advantage of the furnace installation in automatic option is that the furnace installation is electronically controlled with use of a pilot, allowing automatic spark ignition, whereas after the installation is set working, the furnace installation is self-controlled with respect to combustion parameters, detecting unwanted concentration of generated gases, system leakage, and improper transport (overturning, conveying).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The furnace installation and its principle of operation possess a number of advantageous technical and usable features, as compared with commonly known furnace installations used as fireplaces and heating decorative devices.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to essential features of the invention, the installation constitutes considerable technical development as compared with commonly known furnace installations, for example applied in bio-fuel bio-fireplaces. The advantages comprise as follow:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0014">1. as compared to the standard installations, the fuel load in enlarged, and cubic capacity of fuel tanks is limited only by the product size. In solutions known so far, the fuel volume was limited with respect to surface vapor combustion manner. So far, combustion on the liquid surface caused heating of the whole liquid volume, what resulted in the liquid boiling in its whole volume, and the flame was no longer controlled. In the present solution, vaporization takes place within a precisely controlled small volume, and the fuel in tanks is not heated up, and only a small amount of fuel is heated up in the evaporation chamber,</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0015">2. immediate flame extinguishing takes place as vapor delivery is stopped, instead of the oxygen delivery for combustion. In former solutions, flame extinguishing resulted from cutting-off the air delivery to the fuel surface, what not always assured the flame extinguishing because of leakages and generated vapors. Additionally, after the furnace extinguishing, the fuel was evaporated for a long time period because of the raised temperature. Thanks to a tight vapor cut-off, in the proposed solution, evaporation is no longer observed.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0016">3. the described device is characterized by a uniform operation, i.e. the device generates a defined amount of vapors allowing formation of a desired flame size. The amount of heat taken from the flame for vaporization of the next fuel amount/portion is relatively constant, and the flame has a constant size during operation. Thanks to selection of a suitable material, a thickness of the walls and their geometry, the amount of heat needed to evaporate the fuel is sufficient for combustion to be kept on a constant level.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0017">4. an insensitiveness to blasts of air directed into the furnace installation. The furnace installation, used so far, possesses a disadvantage in the form of rapidly dislocated vapor masses. Furnace installations in which combustion of the fluid surface takes place together with a fuel reduction and a raise of its temperature generate larger amount of vapors than during initial operation. The space over the fluid is filled with vapors, and an air blast directed toward the furnace installation pushes the vapors outside, where they are mixed with air creating a combustible mixture. That results in the formation of a &#x201c;fire sphere&#x201d; much greater than a standard furnace flame. In the presented solution, according to the essential invention features, the amount of vapors produced in time is the same, and their influence takes place through a train of holes. An air blast directed toward the furnace installation results in a flame quenching but not in pushing out of great amounts of vapors. Thanks to that the installation is safer than commonly known solutions.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0018">5. thanks to a selection of a suitable material of a known thermal conductivity, as well and thanks to a matching of the amount of vaporized fuel to the thickness of the walls, as well as the wall arrangement, a stabile constant flame was obtained, whereas a flame enlargement is not possible without an additional heat source because the system, as stabilized, is working continuously with the same heat circulation.</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0019">6. an additional advantage of the new combustion mode application, particularly in devices of liquid fuel-fired fireplaces comprises the possibility of an optional flame line formation, which can be oblique, arc-shaped or wavy. Former known solutions allowed formation of only parallel to the base disposed straight lines. A next advantage is a lack of necessity of long anticipation for the furnace installation cooling down before re-starting. Possibility of ignition with electric spark, even if the room temperature drops below 15&#xb0; is also an advantageous feature of the new solution.</li>

<p id="p-0023" num="0028">A furnace installation in an option with a single fuel tank is composed of the main components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which comprise: a fuel tank <b>1</b>, an evaporation plate <b>2</b> and a fuel distribution plate <b>3</b>, over which the vapors are combusted, and a vapor cut-off valve. Tank <b>1</b> is equipped with a fuel inlet <b>5</b> and a venting pipe <b>6</b>, which is connected with evaporation plate <b>2</b> with pipe <b>7</b>. Fuel P is delivered to evaporation plate <b>2</b> via pipe <b>7</b> in a gravitational manner due to the connected vessels rule. Evaporation plate <b>2</b> has the vapor outlet <b>8</b> connected with the cut-off valve <b>4</b> and it is equipped with an external heating plate <b>9</b> with fuel inlet <b>10</b> for the furnace installation ignition. Distribution plate <b>3</b> is connected with cut-off valve <b>4</b> via inlet <b>11</b> and it has <b>12</b> holes in its upper part for the exhaust of fuel vapors.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029">The principle of operation of the furnace installation is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Fuel P is poured into fuel tank <b>1</b> via fuel inlet <b>5</b> and then it flows via pipe <b>7</b> to the evaporation plate <b>2</b>, whereas the fuel level marked with a dotted line <b>13</b> is considered as maximum level in order to leave free an aerial space over fuel table, as well as in order to protect fuel P against entry into the vapor outlet <b>8</b>. A small amount of fuel P (5 ml to 50 ml) is poured in the ignition plate <b>10</b>, and the fuel is ignited. Fuel combusted in the heating plate <b>9</b> causes fast heating of the evaporation plate <b>2</b> and fuel P, which is present in the plate. Defined volume of fuel P poured in allows heating up of the system up to a temperature allowing intensive fuel P evaporation. Under influence of the evaporation and a raised pressure, vapors are transferred into a vapor outlet <b>8</b> via the cut-off valve <b>4</b> and via the inlet <b>11</b> into the distribution plate <b>3</b>, where the vapors are propagated and exhausted through the holes <b>12</b> on their whole length, where their ignition from the flame occurs within the heating plate <b>9</b> and then combustion takes place. Right after the system heating and the start of the installation operation, an amount of fuel P poured into heating plate <b>9</b> is depleted. At the same time, vapors located over the distribution plate <b>3</b> cause the plate heating. The heat is transferred via system components into the evaporation plate <b>2</b> and the fuel evaporation process is kept on a desired level. Up to the depletion of the fuel P in tank <b>1</b> and evaporation plate <b>2</b>, the system is self-operated. The cut-off valve <b>4</b> can be closed in any moment, what results in the cut-off of the vapor inflow into distribution plate <b>3</b> and consequently in the flame in the flame extinguish. The cut-off valve <b>4</b> closing results in the formation of an overpressure within the evaporation plate <b>2</b> and a push-out of fuel P into fuel P tank <b>1</b>, which in turn causes mixing of the heated fuel P with the cool fuel in fuel tank <b>1</b> and termination of the evaporation process, whereas the fuel P is no longer in contact with the heated elements of the evaporation plate <b>2</b>. The venting system <b>6</b> is installed in the fuel tank <b>1</b>, protecting the system against a pressure raise, whereas fuel tank <b>1</b> has enlarged capacity as compared to a nominal value, thus at the moment of relocation of the fuel volume from the evaporation plate <b>2</b> is not accompanied with the tanks overfilling.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">An advantageous example of the furnace installation with two fuel tanks, including details, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 6</figref>. The installation is equipped with two fuel tanks&#x2014;a main tank <b>1</b> and additional tank <b>14</b> enlarging volume of collected fuel P. The fuel inlet <b>5</b> is installed in the main fuel tank <b>1</b>. Both fuel tanks <b>1</b> and <b>14</b> are connected with a pipe <b>15</b>, through which the fuel P is poured into the second tank <b>14</b>. The stub pipe <b>16</b> connected with the evaporation plate <b>2</b> is placed in the pipe <b>15</b> connecting both tanks. Both tanks are equipped with venting stub pipes <b>6</b> and <b>17</b>. The tanks are located on a suitable level, assuring continuous gravitational supply of the fuel used in the evaporation plate <b>2</b>. The tanks are suitably inclined in order to allow the fuel P flow. The manual pump <b>18</b> is installed at the main tank <b>1</b>, near the fuel inlet <b>5</b>. A protecting cover <b>19</b> should be opened in order to access fuel inlet <b>5</b> and pump <b>18</b>. Pressing the pump <b>18</b> results in sucking the fuel P from the tank <b>1</b> and pressing the fuel via the stub pipe <b>20</b> into the trough-shaped heating plate <b>9</b>. The wick <b>21</b> is located in the trough, which is ignited via the slot <b>22</b> in the fire grate <b>23</b>. This allows ignition of the fuel P in the heating plate <b>9</b>. Evaporation plate <b>2</b> is connected with the distribution plate <b>3</b> via the cut-off valve <b>4</b>. The evaporated vapors are transferred into the distribution plate <b>3</b>, where under the influence of a small overpressure and temperature they come out via a train of holes <b>12</b> over the distribution plate <b>3</b> where they are combusted. The principle of operation of the furnace installation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, is analogical to that previously described in case of furnace installation with a single fuel tank <b>1</b>. In case of the option with two fuel tanks <b>1</b> and <b>14</b>, the fuel P is poured into the tanks <b>1</b> and <b>14</b> via the fuel inlet <b>5</b>. The fuel flows into the second tank <b>14</b> via pipe <b>15</b> connecting both tanks. Via the stub pipe <b>16</b> connected with the evaporation plate, the fuel flows also into the plate. Fuel levels in all the connected vessels are the same. At the bottom side, the system is shielded with the protective cover <b>24</b> with suitable venting holes <b>25</b>. The wick <b>21</b> holds up fuel combustion in the trough <b>9</b>. The fuel ignited in the heating plate <b>9</b> during combustion heats up the evaporation plate <b>2</b> and the fuel contained in it. When a suitable temperature is achieved, fuel P in the evaporation plate <b>2</b> intensively evaporates. The vapors flow via the cut-off valve <b>4</b> into the distribution plate <b>3</b>. The vapors distributed along the whole plate length flow up via the train of holes <b>12</b> and they are combusted over it. At the same time, the combusted vapors heat up the elements of the distribution plate <b>3</b> and the evaporation plate <b>2</b>, so an additional delivery of heat energy is not needed. A metered amount of fuel introduced into the heating plate <b>9</b> is combusted and there is no need of additional fuel metering. When heated up and started, the system is self-combusted. Material, thickness of walls and volumes of heated and ignited fuel were matched in such way, that when the suitable temperature is reached, the system no longer needs additional heat sources in order to assure a stable operation of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">In order to stop the system operation, the cut-off valve <b>4</b> located between the evaporation plate <b>2</b> and the distribution plate, is closed. Stoppage of the vapor flow results in the flame extinguishing. At the same time, the vapors generated in the evaporation plate <b>2</b>, having no way to escape, generate an overpressure over the liquid table in the evaporation plate <b>2</b>. The overpressure pushes out the heated fuel into the tanks <b>1</b> and <b>14</b> where it is mixed with a cool fuel. As there is no contact with the hot walls of the evaporation plate <b>2</b>, the evaporation process is rapidly stopped. In order to restart the system, the cut-off valve <b>4</b> should be opened, allowing fuel to flow into the evaporation plate (equalization of the level in connected vessels) and supply of the fuel portion into the heating plate <b>9</b>, and finally the fuel ignition. When heated, the vapors are ignited by the flame of the fuel combusted in the heating plate <b>9</b>. When the combustion in the heating plate <b>9</b> is stopped (heating up), the system is operated up to a moment of fuel cut-off or depletion on the fuel in the tanks <b>1</b> and <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">An example of an electronically controlled furnace installation is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The principle of operation is identical as in the case of the option without an electronic control with one exception, that elements responsible for the ignition, stoppage and safety, are operated automatically. A set of heaters <b>26</b> was used instead of the pump <b>18</b> and the heating plate <b>9</b>. The cut-off valve <b>4</b> was replaced with an electric-valve <b>27</b>. The system was equipped with additional temperature sensors <b>28</b> of the distribution plate <b>3</b> and the temperature sensor <b>29</b> of the evaporation plate <b>2</b> near the set of heaters <b>26</b>. Additionally, the system was equipped with an automatic spark ignition system comprising a spark generator <b>30</b> and spark magneto electrodes <b>31</b>. The device is also equipped with a set of safety sensors comprising: a movement sensor <b>32</b>, disabling the furnace installation in case of overturning or relocation, a carbon oxide sensor <b>33</b> or optionally an oxygen or carbon dioxide sensor, disabling the installation in case of sensing an improper concentration of the tested gas, and a humidity sensor <b>34</b> controlling the system tightness and reacting in case of sensing a liquid presence under the tanks on the shield <b>24</b>, resulting from a fuel effluent or fuel poured by the user. The fuel filler <b>10</b> is covered with a movable cover <b>35</b>, protected with a switch <b>36</b>, which switches off the installation and extinguishes the flame in case of its opening during the system operation. In this option, the installation is equipped with a control system <b>37</b>, however the control panel <b>38</b> has the function of a communicator between the user and the control system <b>37</b>, allowing readout of messages and generation of commands like: switch on, switch off, flame height control, etc. A generation of commands is possible with use of a remote control pilot <b>39</b>. he control panel <b>38</b> is also equipped with suitable connections (not shown in the figure) allowing PC installation in order to load new software or regulation (setting). This solution serves for producer or authorized service. These connections allow also the connection of the installation with an intelligent house installation, including the furnace installation control from a panel of this installation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">The principle of operation of the installation of this type is following. When the fuel P is poured into the tank <b>1</b>, the user closes the movable cover <b>35</b>, which is protected with the switch <b>36</b>, and the system cannot be switched ON before the cover is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0034">When the cover <b>35</b> is closed and the button &#x2018;start&#x2019; on the control panel <b>38</b> or pilot <b>39</b> is pushed, the set of heaters <b>26</b> is enabled and the electric-valve <b>27</b> is opened. The set of heaters <b>26</b> heats the evaporation plate <b>2</b> up to a temperature of intensive fuel evaporation. The vapors are transferred via the electric-valve <b>27</b> into the distribution plate <b>3</b> and are then exhausted via the holes <b>12</b>. At the moment, when the vapors reach the distribution plate <b>3</b>, its temperature is raised, what is sensed by the temperature sensor <b>28</b>. When the plate reaches a suitable temperature, a suitable signal is sent to the spark generator <b>30</b>, and a spark is generated on the electrodes <b>31</b>. The spark ignites the vapors over the distribution plate <b>3</b>. The ignition of the vapors increases the temperature on the temperature sensor <b>29</b>, signaling the flame ignition. If the temperature is not raised in a few seconds since the spark was generated, the sequence is repeated. If after several collapsed trials the temperature is not raised, the installation is switched OFF and the electric-valve <b>27</b> is closed. However, if the vapors were ignited and the temperature on the sensor <b>29</b> was raised, the operation is continued, and the set of heaters <b>26</b> is switched OFF. The fuel is evaporated in result of the heat transfer though the elements of the plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. There is an option of successive switching OFF the heaters <b>26</b>, in order to raise the temperature of the evaporation plate <b>2</b> to control (raise) the flame. Because of the safety reasons, self-acting shut down, or shut down by the user intervention is also possible. A self-acting shut down takes place in several cases, i.e.: if the installation is moved, what is signalized by the sensor <b>32</b>, if an improper concentration of gas in the air is detected by the sensor <b>33</b>, if the fuel in the fuel tanks <b>1</b> and <b>14</b> is depleted and the temperature <b>29</b> is raised on the evaporation plate <b>2</b>, or if the set of heaters <b>26</b> is activated without the fuel and the temperature is raised above a permissible temperature on the temperature sensor <b>29</b> located on the evaporation plate <b>2</b>, and also if the movable cover <b>35</b> protecting access to the fuel inlet <b>5</b> is open, which is detected by switch <b>36</b> or if the diagnostic system detects a defect of any sensor. In each of the mentioned cases, the electro-valve <b>27</b> is closed, the installation is shut down, and a suitable message is displayed on a control panel <b>38</b>.
<br/>
However, a new combustion mode used in a furnace installation is schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. After filling up a fuel tank <b>111</b>, the liquid fuel from the tank <b>111</b> is transferred via the pipe <b>121</b> into the heating chamber <b>131</b>. The fuel is heated in the chamber up to a temperature of 60-75&#xb0;, optimally with the use of an electric heating element <b>141</b>, which generates the vapors. Under the influence of the generated pressure, the vapors are transferred via the pipe <b>151</b> into the combustion zone <b>161</b>, defined by the surface <b>171</b> of the distribution chamber <b>181</b>. It has a form of a pipe with numerous shaped holes <b>191</b>, from which the vapors exhausted from the combustion chamber <b>181</b> are combusted in result of electric spark formation, forming the flame. The flame is controlled by a raised heating chamber <b>131</b> pressure, in result of a heating time regulation of a built-in heating element <b>141</b>, or in result of a power regulation of the heating element <b>141</b>, which is electrically energized vie the cable <b>171</b>.
