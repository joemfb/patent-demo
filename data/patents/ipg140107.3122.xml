<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF MS) includes an ion gate, an ion guide downstream of the ion gate, and a TOF analyzer downstream of the ion guide. The TOF MS is operated with an adjustable duty cycle to limit the amount of ions entering a TOF analyzer and avoid saturating a detector system of the TOF MS. The duty cycle is adjusted by controlling the ion gate. The ion guide emits ions as a continuous beam, without trapping the ions. The ion guide may be operated as a collision cell. The TOF MS may also include a mass filter upstream of the ion guide.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to acquisition of spectrometric data by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS), and more particularly to controlling the number of ions entering the TOF analyzer of an MS system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A mass spectrometry (MS) system in general includes an ion source for ionizing components of a sample of interest, a mass analyzer for separating the ions based on their differing mass-to-charge ratios (or m/z ratios, or more simply &#x201c;masses&#x201d;), an ion detector for counting the separated ions, and electronics for processing output signals from the ion detector as needed to produce a user-interpretable mass spectrum. Typically, the mass spectrum is a series of peaks indicative of the relative abundances of detected ions as a function of their m/z ratios. The mass spectrum may be utilized to determine the molecular structures of components of the sample, thereby enabling the sample to be qualitatively and quantitatively characterized.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF MS) utilizes a high-resolution mass analyzer (TOF analyzer). Ions are transported from the ion source into the TOF entrance region through a series of ion guides and ion lenses. The TOF analyzer extracts ions in pulses (or packets) into an electric field-free drift tube. In the drift tube, ions of differing masses travel at different velocities and thus separate (spread out) according to their differing masses, enabling mass resolution based on time-of-flight.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To elucidate additional information regarding a sample, an MS system may be configured for carrying out tandem MS, or MS-MS, experiments. MS-MS may be implemented in a TOF-based system, an example of which is the qTOF system. The qTOF system utilizes, in series, a first quadrupole device, a second quadrupole device, and a TOF analyzer. The first quadrupole device is operated as a mass filter to select a single ion mass or mass range from the larger range of ions provided by the ion source. The second quadrupole device is typically an RF-only device enclosed in a gas chamber and utilized as a collision cell to dissociate the selected ions, or &#x201c;parent&#x201d; ions, into fragment ions (or &#x201c;daughter&#x201d; ions) by collision induced dissociation (CID). Parent ions and/or fragment ions may be analyzed by the TOF analyzer. If parent ion spectra are desired at the high resolution obtained in the TOF section, the gas in the collision cell is often left at its normal pressure but the ions entering the collision cell are reduced to a low enough energy to avoid fragmentation. In all these arrangements, typically there is no means available for limiting the ion signal in cases where the detector system, e.g. the electronics employed in collecting/accumulating and processing ion signals, is saturated or overloaded.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is a need for TOF MS systems and methods that provide a way to limit the number of ions entering the TOF analyzer to avoid detector system saturation.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure describes time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) systems and methods for controlling the transfer of ions into the TOF analyzer of such systems, thereby avoiding detector system saturation. Ion transfer may be controlled in a way that retains the quantitative nature of the analysis. All ions may be transferred into the TOF analyzer during times when the detector system is not saturated. If the detector system is saturated or approaching saturation, the number of ions transferred into the TOF analyzer may be limited by way of a gating process described below. By avoiding saturation of the detector system, the dynamic range of the TOF MS system may be extended beyond the range currently possible. Moreover, as new techniques that improve ion transport efficiency into the TOF analyzer become available, embodiments disclosed herein may allow for increased sensitivity and lower detection limits without further limiting the high end of the dynamic range.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view of an example of a time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF MS) system <b>100</b> according to one embodiment. The TOF MS system <b>100</b> generally includes, in series, an ion source <b>104</b>, an ion gate <b>108</b>, an ion guide <b>112</b>, a TOF analyzer <b>116</b>, and a system controller (or controller) <b>120</b>. As described below, the ion gate <b>108</b> is utilized to control a duty cycle according which ions are transmitted into the TOF analyzer <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the ion guide <b>112</b> may be operated as a collision cell. In some embodiments, the TOF MS system <b>100</b> may further include a mass filter <b>124</b> between the ion source <b>104</b> and the ion guide <b>112</b>. Ion optics <b>128</b> may be present between the ion source <b>104</b> and the mass filter <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the ion optics <b>128</b> may be configured and operated as an ion gate for controlling the duty cycle instead of the ion gate <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The ion source <b>104</b> may be any type of continuous-beam or pulsed ion source suitable for TOF MS. Examples of ion sources <b>104</b> include, but are not limited to, electrospray ionization (ESI) sources, other atmospheric pressure ionization (API) sources, photo-ionization (PI) sources, electron ionization (EI) sources, chemical ionization (CI) sources, laser desorption ionization (LDI) sources, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) sources. Depending on the type of ionization implemented, the ion source <b>104</b> may reside in a vacuum chamber or may operate at or near atmospheric pressure. Sample material to be analyzed may be introduced to the ion source <b>104</b> by any suitable means, including hyphenated techniques in which the sample material is the output of an analytical separation instrument such as, for example, a gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) instrument (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The ion guide <b>112</b> generally operates to focus and transmit ions. For this purpose, the ion guide <b>112</b> may include a linear multipole electrode configuration (e.g., quadrupole, hexapole, octopole, etc.). In the illustrated embodiment, the ion guide <b>112</b> includes a plurality of guide electrodes <b>132</b> (only two of which are shown) arranged about a guide axis such that they are circumferentially spaced from each other about the guide axis. The guide electrodes <b>132</b> are positioned at radial distances from the guide axis, thereby surrounding an interior region of the ion guide <b>112</b> that is elongated along the guide axis. The ion guide <b>112</b> further includes a guide entrance (or ion entrance) into the interior region, and a guide exit (or ion exit) out from the interior region. A voltage source <b>136</b>, controlled by the controller <b>120</b>, applies an RF voltage or composite RF/DC voltage to the guide electrodes <b>132</b> to confine ions along the guide axis. DC voltages, controlled by the controller <b>120</b>, may also be utilized to accelerate the ions from the guide entrance to the guide exit. The ion guide <b>112</b> also functions as an ion cooler for thermalizing or damping the ions. In some embodiments, the ion guide <b>112</b> also functions as a collision cell to fragment ions. For such purposes, the guide electrodes <b>132</b> may be enclosed in a gas chamber <b>140</b>. A gas inlet <b>142</b> admits a neutral damping or collision gas (e.g., helium, nitrogen, argon, etc.) into the gas chamber <b>140</b> to enable thermalization, and in some embodiments the gas pressure may be increased to a level enabling ion fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation (CID). The ion guide <b>112</b> may thus be configured to output parent ions, fragment ions, or a mixture of fragment ions and non-fragmented parent ions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In other embodiments, the illustrated ion guide <b>112</b> may schematically represent two separate ion guides, one configured or operated as a collision cell and the other configured or operated to cool the ions without causing fragmentation. The collision cell may be either upstream or downstream of the ion cooler.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The TOF analyzer <b>116</b> generally includes an ion pulser (or extractor) <b>148</b>, an electric field-free drift tube <b>150</b>, and an ion detector <b>152</b> enclosed in a vacuum chamber. The ion pulser <b>148</b> accelerates packets of ions received from the ion guide <b>112</b> into the drift tube <b>150</b>. The voltage applied to the ion pulser <b>148</b> and the pulse rate (extraction rate) are controlled by the controller <b>120</b>. The ions extracted by the ion pulser <b>148</b> travel along a flight path in the drift tube <b>150</b> at mass-dependent velocities and arrive at the detector <b>152</b>, which produces ion detection signals from which a mass spectrum of the detected ions may be generated, as appreciated by persons skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the TOF analyzer <b>116</b> has an orthogonal configuration, by which ions are accelerated in a direction orthogonal to the direction in which they entered the TOF analyzer <b>116</b>, are reflected by a reflectron (ion mirror) <b>154</b>, and then travel back through the drift tube <b>150</b> to the detector <b>152</b>. Orthogonal TOF designs offer advantages known to persons skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The detector <b>152</b> may be part of a detector system that includes electronics configured for collecting, summing and otherwise processing the detected signals as needed for producing spectral information. One or more components of the detector system may be prone to saturation or overloading, one non-limiting example being one or more analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) commonly used in conjunction with the data recorder that records multiple ions per transient. Saturation of the detector system (i.e., one or more components of the detector system) is addressed by embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The mass filter <b>124</b>, when provided, operates to receive ions having a range of masses (m/z ratios) from the ion source <b>104</b> and, by imposing stability conditions on ion trajectories, allows only ions of a selected mass, or (typically narrow) range of masses, to pass through to the ion guide <b>112</b>. For this purpose, the mass filter <b>124</b> may include a linear multipole electrode configuration similar to that of the ion guide <b>112</b>. Thus, the mass filter <b>124</b> may include a plurality of filter electrodes <b>162</b> (only two of which are shown) circumferentially arranged about a filter axis and surrounding an elongated interior region of the mass filter <b>124</b>. The mass filter <b>124</b> further includes a filter entrance (or ion entrance) into the interior region, and a filter exit (or ion exit) out from the interior region. A voltage source <b>166</b> applies a composite RF/DC voltage to the filter electrodes <b>162</b> to establish conditions that allow only ions of a selected mass or mass range to successfully traverse the axial length of the mass filter <b>124</b> and exit from the filter exit. The mass filter <b>124</b> may operate as a continuous beam device that does not store or trap ions.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The ion gate <b>108</b> (or <b>128</b>) may be cycled between an open state and a closed state. The cycling parameters (voltage magnitude, pulse rate) may be controlled by a voltage source <b>168</b> (or <b>170</b>) and the controller <b>120</b>. The ion gate <b>108</b> may have any structure suitable for gating or deflecting ions in response to a control signal, such as various types of ion optics devices appreciated by persons skilled in the art. During the open state, all ions transmitted to the ion gate <b>108</b> are permitted to pass through the ion gate <b>108</b> to the next device of the TOF MS system <b>100</b> (the ion guide <b>112</b>, or in some embodiments the mass filter <b>124</b>). During the closed state, no ions transmitted to the ion gate <b>108</b> are permitted to pass through the ion gate <b>108</b>, and instead are reflected from the ion gate <b>108</b>, defected away from the ion beam axis, or otherwise blocked.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The ion gate <b>108</b> operates according to a duty cycle, which may be dictated by the controller <b>120</b>. The duty cycle may be defined as the percentage of the gate cycle time during which the ion gate <b>108</b> is open and ions are thus allowed to pass through. If the value of the duty cycle is 100%, the ion gate <b>108</b> is always open during the gate cycle time, and thus the ion gate <b>108</b> does not limit the number of ions that enter the TOF analyzer <b>116</b> during the gate cycle time. If, for instance, the duty cycle is reduced to 50%, then the ion gate <b>108</b> is open during half of the gate cycle time and closed during half of the gate cycle time.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the TOF MS system <b>100</b> may be operated in different modes, and may be switched from one mode to another, including as part of the same sample analysis. In one mode, the full mass range of ions produced in the ion source <b>104</b> are transmitted into the TOF analyzer <b>116</b> without fragmenting the ions. In another mode, only ions of one or more selected m/z ratios are transmitted into the TOF analyzer <b>116</b>, such as by operating the mass filter <b>124</b> or other ion guide that provides low- and/or high-mass cutoffs. In another mode, the ions are fragmented (such as by operating the ion guide <b>112</b> as a collision cell or operating a separate collision cell) and the resulting fragment ions are transmitted into the TOF analyzer <b>116</b>. In another mode, only ions of one or more selected m/z ratios (i.e., parent ions) are transmitted into the ion guide <b>112</b>, the selected ions are fragmented in the ion guide <b>112</b> (or in a collision cell separate from the ion guide <b>112</b>), and the fragment ions are transmitted into the TOF analyzer <b>116</b>. A combination of one or more of the foregoing modes may be implemented as required by the desired method. For example, a spectrum of selected parent ions may be acquired, and subsequently (or simultaneously) a spectrum of fragment ions produced from the parent ions may be acquired. Such a process may be repeated for parent ions of different masses. When implementing different modes of operation or switching from one mode of operation to another mode of operation, different adjustments to the duty cycle may be implemented as needed to avoid saturating or overloading the detector system.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As an example of operation, the controller <b>120</b> monitors the ion signal (total detected beam current) measured by the detector <b>152</b> during a TOF scan, which may be implemented during the normal course of analyzing a sample. The controller <b>120</b> determines whether the ion signal intensity corresponding to the largest mass peak detected is too high, i.e., is saturating or will saturate the detector system. This determination may be done with consideration being given to one or more electronics components of the detector system known to be particularly susceptible to signal saturation. If the ion signal intensity is too high, the controller <b>120</b> adjusts the current duty cycle to a lower duty cycle (i.e., a smaller fraction of the current duty cycle). Subsequent ions reaching the ion gate <b>108</b> are subjected to the lower duty cycle, resulting in a lesser number of ions being transmitted in the TOF analyzer <b>116</b> and avoiding detector system saturation. Because the duty cycle being implemented at any given time is always known by the controller <b>120</b>, the full amplitude of the original peak intensities may be obtained by taking the measured signal and dividing by the duty cycle (fraction). This process may be repeated for all sets of ions transmitted through the system. The controller <b>120</b> may also increase the duty cycle if it determines that the ion signal being detected is too low.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, calculating a new duty cycle (gate fraction) may be done as follows. If the largest peak height seen in a given spectrum is designated f and the duty cycle of the ion gate <b>108</b> is designated g, then the signal that would have been seen for that peak on the detector <b>152</b> without the gate (or with the gate open over the full cycle) is F, according to the relation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>f=g*F. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The &#x201c;true&#x201d; signal F is then:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">F=f/g (the peak signal measured divided by the duty cycle that was in operation when peak signal was measured).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To avoid saturation, a target value TV (e.g., 0.7) may be selected from which a new duty cycle is then calculated, and which will result in a lesser number of ions entering the TOF analyzer <b>116</b> and thus a lower intensity of the peak signal f during the next iteration, as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>g</i>=TV/<i>F. </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Because the value of F is not seen directly, it may be computed from the above formula F=f/g. Thus, for a given iteration of ions transmitted through the system, the new (adjusted) gate duty cycle for the next iteration may be calculated as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>g</i><sub>(i+1)</sub>=TV*<i>g</i><sub>i</sub><i>/f</i><sub>i </sub>(i.e., the next duty cycle is TV times the previous duty cycle divided by the previous largest peak signal measured).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">However, the value for g cannot be larger than 1, as 1 corresponds to a 100% (always open) duty cycle. Therefore, if the value selected for TV would result in g<sub>(i+1) </sub>being greater than 1, then g<sub>(i+1) </sub>is set to 1. Stated in another way, the value for g<sub>(i+1) </sub>is set to either 1 or TV*g<sub>i</sub>/f<sub>i</sub>, whichever is lower (i.e., the minimum value is selected). This condition may be expressed as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>g</i><sub>(i+1)</sub>=min(1,(TV*(<i>g</i><sub>i</sub><i>/f</i><sub>i</sub>)).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For each iteration of ions run through the system, the above formula may be utilized to recalculate (adjust) the duty cycle g on the ion gate <b>108</b> so as to decrease the duty cycle when the detector system is saturated (or approaching saturation), and to increase the duty cycle when the detector system is not saturated and there is room for increasing signal intensity. Different target values (TV) may be selected for different operating conditions, such as the different modes of operation discussed above. For example, the target value utilized when scanning fragment ions may be different than the target value utilized when scanning more massive parent ions. The controller <b>120</b> may determine the target value to use according to the current conditions or mode of operation, and a look-up table of target values may be stored in a memory accessible by the controller <b>120</b>, as appreciated by persons skilled in the art. It will also be understood that the above formula may be modified, or different formulas utilized, to provide alternative ways to determine adjustment of the duty cycle, or to provide additional or other functions such as, for example, filtering noise or anticipating when a peak signal is growing or diminishing from its previous value. In addition, peak signals other than the largest peak may be utilized to determine the adjustment of duty cycle. For example, for a given spectrum a user might choose to allow certain large peaks to saturate the detector system in a case where the user is not interested in those large peaks but rather is interested in smaller peaks. The system may be configured to allow the user to specify a list of peaks to exclude from the intensity adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It will be noted that the ion gate <b>108</b> functions in conjunction with the ion guide <b>112</b>, and particularly in consideration of the axial length and pressure of the ion guide <b>112</b>. When ions pass through the ion guide <b>112</b> they are spread out in time. The amount of time spreading that occurs is related to the number of collisions with gas molecules in the ion guide <b>112</b>. At pressures typical for a collision cell, typical delay times through the ion guide <b>112</b> may range from tens of microseconds to several milliseconds, depending on the operating parameters (pressure, axial electric field, etc.). So although the ion gate <b>108</b> may pulse ions into the ion guide <b>112</b>, the ions may nonetheless exit the ion guide <b>112</b> as a continuous beam as a result of the spreading and cooling that occurs in the ion guide <b>112</b>. Thus, the gating operation will not adversely impact the pulsing operation of the TOF analyzer <b>116</b>. Moreover, the time scale of the gating process is shorter than that of a typical chromatographic peak or band, and thus the gating operation will not affect a combined chromatographic-spectrometric analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a typical embodiment, the total gate cycle time should be shorter than the time spreading that occurs in the downstream ion guide <b>112</b>. For example, if the time spreading in the ion guide <b>112</b> is 200 &#x3bc;s, the gate cycle time could be set to 100 &#x3bc;s. The time that the ion gate <b>108</b> is passing ions through to the ion guide <b>112</b> could then range from 100 &#x3bc;s (always open) when the detector system is not saturated down to 5 &#x3bc;s if the signal level is up to 20 times higher. This would then create a series of ion pulses entering the ion guide <b>112</b> that vary in length from 5 &#x3bc;s to almost 100 &#x3bc;s. If the ion guide <b>112</b> provides a time spread of 200 &#x3bc;s, then the ions exiting the ion guide <b>112</b> will appear to be a uniform, continuous stream of ions again such that, as noted above, there will be no impact on the repetition rate of the TOF analyzer <b>116</b>. Larger time spreads in the ion guide <b>112</b>, for example by utilizing higher pressures or longer physical lengths of the ion guide <b>112</b>, may result in even higher gains in dynamic range.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In other embodiments, the methods described herein be implemented using the ion optics <b>128</b> as the ion gate.</p>
