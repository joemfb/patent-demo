<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In an example, a chip-scale atomic clock physics package is provided. This chip-scale atomic clock physics package includes a body defining a cavity, and a first scaffold mounted in the cavity. A laser is mounted on the first surface of the first scaffold. A second scaffold is also mounted in the cavity. The second scaffold is disposed such that the first surface of the second scaffold is facing the first scaffold. A first photodetector is mounted on the first surface of the second scaffold. A vapor cell is mounted on the first surface of the second scaffold. A waveplate is also included, wherein the laser, waveplate, first photodetector, and vapor cell are disposed such that a beam from the laser can propagate through the waveplate and the vapor cell and be detected by the first photodetector. A lid is also included for covering the cavity.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific illustrative embodiments. However, it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical, and electrical changes may be made. Furthermore, the method presented in the drawing figures and the specification is not to be construed as limiting the order in which the individual steps may be performed. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an example physics package for a chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) physics package <b>100</b>. The CSAC physics package <b>100</b> can include a ceramic body <b>102</b> defining a cavity <b>103</b> for housing components of the CSAC physics package <b>100</b>. The ceramic body <b>102</b> including the components in the cavity <b>103</b> can comprise a ceramic leadless chip carrier (CLCC) package. The CSAC physics package <b>100</b> can also include a non-magnetic (e.g., ceramic) lid <b>104</b> configured to fit over the cavity <b>103</b> of the ceramic body <b>102</b> to form a closed package encasing the cavity <b>103</b> and the components therein. In an example, the ceramic lid <b>104</b> has a generally planar shape. A solder seal <b>106</b> can be used to seal the lid <b>104</b> to the body <b>102</b>. In an example, the lid <b>104</b> can be sealed to the body <b>102</b> in a vacuum. In an example, die attach and sealing operations for the CSAC physics package <b>100</b> (e.g., for sealing the lid <b>104</b> to the body <b>102</b>) are accomplished without the use of flux to enable low pressure in the sealed package which can enable lower power operation. This physics package can enable batch vacuum sealing of the lid <b>104</b> to the body <b>102</b>. The CSAC physics package <b>100</b> can also include a getter film <b>101</b> coating most of the interior surface of a ceramic lid <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an example, the ceramic body <b>102</b> has one side (e.g., the top) open such that the body <b>102</b> defines the cavity <b>103</b>. The lid <b>104</b> can cover the open side of the body <b>102</b> to enclose the cavity <b>103</b>. In an example, the cavity <b>103</b> has a shape generally pentagonal cross section when viewed from the open side (e.g., top). In another example, the cavity <b>103</b> has a generally circular cross-section when viewed from the open side (e.g., top). In any case, the cavity <b>103</b> can include a base surface <b>105</b> and one or more interior sides <b>107</b>. The one or more sides <b>107</b> can have one or more steps <b>109</b> defined therein for, for example, supporting structures within the cavity of the body <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The CSAC physics package <b>100</b> can include one or more scaffolds <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> for supporting components such as a laser <b>110</b>, waveplate <b>111</b>, vapor cell <b>114</b>, and photodetector <b>116</b>. In an example, a scaffold <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> can include a membrane suspended within a frame. The scaffolds <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> can also include a stiffening member attached to the membrane to provide additional structure for the membrane. To produce the scaffolds <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> at a size that can be used for the CSAC physics package <b>100</b>, the scaffolds <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> can be fabricated using semiconductor fabrication processes. Accordingly, the frame and stiffening member can be composed of silicon and the membrane can be composed of polyimide. The polyimide can thermally isolate the stiffening member and components on the scaffolds <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> from the frame and body <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The CSAC physics package <b>100</b> includes a lower scaffold <b>108</b> and an upper scaffold <b>112</b> that are mounted in the cavity <b>103</b>. In an example, the lower scaffold <b>108</b> and the upper scaffold <b>112</b> can be disposed parallel to one another and parallel to the base surface <b>105</b> of the cavity <b>103</b>. In this example, the lower scaffold <b>108</b> is attached to the base surface <b>105</b> of the cavity <b>103</b> via a fluxless die attach. In an example, the fluxless die attach can be a plurality of gold (Au) stud bumps. The lower scaffold <b>108</b> can function as a support structure for a heater, the laser <b>110</b>, and the waveplate <b>111</b>. The lower scaffold <b>108</b> and components thereon (e.g., laser <b>110</b>, waveplate <b>111</b>) can be electrically coupled to pins on the body <b>102</b> via wire bonds to a pad on a lower step <b>109</b> of the inner side surface <b>107</b> of the cavity <b>103</b> of the ceramic body <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The lower scaffold <b>108</b> can include a first side <b>113</b> that opposes the base surface <b>105</b> and a second side <b>115</b> that is reverse of the first side <b>113</b> and facing the lid <b>104</b> and the upper scaffold <b>112</b>. In an example, the frame <b>119</b> and the stiffening member <b>123</b> are on the first side <b>113</b>. The stiffening member <b>123</b> can define a plurality of apertures to reduce the mass thereof. In an example, the laser <b>110</b> and the waveplate <b>111</b> are mounted to the second side <b>115</b>. Moreover, the waveplate <b>111</b> can be disposed overtop of the laser <b>110</b> such that a beam of the laser <b>110</b> propagates through the waveplate <b>111</b>. In an example, the laser <b>110</b> can be solder bonded to the second side <b>115</b> using, for example, flip-chip mounting. Additionally, a plurality of solder balls <b>117</b> can be attached to the second side <b>115</b>. The plurality of solder balls <b>117</b> can be disposed around the laser <b>110</b> and project a height above the second side <b>115</b> that is higher than the laser <b>110</b> such that the waveplate <b>111</b> can be soldered to the plurality of solder balls <b>117</b> and disposed overtop of the laser <b>110</b>. In an example, the plurality of solder balls <b>117</b> can be formed using a jetting process tuned to produce solder balls of the desired size. In an example, the solder balls <b>117</b> can be formed of a solder having a high temperature melting point, such that, once formed on the scaffold <b>108</b>, the solder balls <b>117</b> generally maintain their structure during further fabrication of the CSAC physics package <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an example, a first portion of the solder balls <b>117</b> on the second side <b>115</b> have a lower height above the second side <b>115</b> than a second portion of the solder balls <b>117</b>. Moreover, the first portion of solder balls <b>117</b> can be disposed to attach about a first edge of the waveplate <b>111</b> and a second portion of the solder balls <b>117</b> can be disposed to attach about a second edge of the waveplate <b>111</b>. The differing height of the first and second portions of the solder balls <b>117</b> can cause the waveplate <b>111</b> to be disposed at an angle with respect to the second side <b>115</b>. Orienting the waveplate <b>111</b> at an angle can direct laser reflections off of the waveplate <b>111</b> away from the laser <b>110</b>. In an example, the laser <b>110</b> can be a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). In an example, the waveplate <b>111</b> can be a quarter waveplate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an example, the upper scaffold <b>112</b> can function as a support structure for an alkali vapor cell <b>114</b> and a photodetector <b>116</b>. The upper scaffold <b>112</b> can be supported on an upper step <b>109</b> (e.g., an upper shelf) of the inner side surface <b>107</b> of the cavity <b>103</b> of the ceramic body <b>102</b>. Moreover, by forming steps <b>109</b> in the sides <b>107</b> of the cavity <b>103</b>, the body <b>102</b> can be used to, at least partially, space the upper scaffold <b>112</b> from the lower scaffold <b>108</b>. In an example, the upper scaffold <b>112</b> can be attached to one or more spacers <b>118</b> (e.g., leg structures, washer) extending up from the upper step <b>109</b> of the cavity <b>103</b> to further space the upper scaffold <b>112</b> from the lower scaffold <b>108</b>. In an example, the spacer <b>118</b> can be composed of ceramic. In an example, the spacer <b>118</b> can have a ring shape (e.g., a pentagon ring shape) defining an aperture therein. The spacer <b>118</b> can be disposed around the vapor cell <b>114</b> such that the vapor cell <b>114</b> is within the aperture defined in the spacer <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an example, the spacer <b>118</b> can function to reduce fatigue on the joint(s) coupling the upper scaffold <b>112</b> to the upper step <b>109</b>. The spacer <b>118</b> can reduce fatigue by being composed of a material that has a thermal expansion coefficient that is in between the thermal expansion coefficient of the body <b>102</b> and the thermal expansion coefficient of the upper scaffold <b>112</b>. Accordingly, as the body <b>102</b> and the upper scaffold <b>112</b> expand and contract due to temperature changes, the spacer <b>118</b> can absorb some of the changes. For example, the body <b>102</b> can be composed of a ceramic having a thermal expansion coefficient of 7 ppm per degree Celsius, the spacer <b>118</b> can have a thermal expansion coefficient of 5 ppm per degree Celsius, and the upper scaffold <b>112</b> can have a thermal expansion coefficient of 3 ppm per degree Celsius. In another example, the spacer <b>118</b> can be formed of the same material as the body <b>102</b> and the lid <b>104</b>. The spacer <b>118</b> can provide mechanical support and electrical contact for the upper scaffold <b>112</b>. In some examples, the spacer <b>118</b> can also provide mechanical support and electrical contact for additional electronic components such as surface mount technology (SMT) electronics <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The combination of the upper scaffold <b>112</b> and the ceramic spacer <b>118</b> can traverse the cavity <b>103</b> of the body <b>102</b> and attach to the upper step <b>109</b>. In an example, the upper scaffold <b>112</b> can be attached to the spacer <b>118</b> via fluxless die attach. The spacer <b>118</b> can be attached via fluxless die attach to the body <b>102</b>, for example, at the upper step <b>109</b> of the body <b>102</b>. In an example, the fluxless die attach can be a plurality of gold (Au) stud bumps.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The upper scaffold <b>112</b> can include a first side <b>121</b> that opposes the lid <b>104</b> and a second side <b>124</b> that is reverse of the first side <b>121</b> and facing the lower scaffold <b>108</b>. In an example, the frame <b>125</b> and the stiffening member <b>127</b> are on the first side <b>121</b>. The stiffening member <b>127</b> can define a plurality of apertures to reduce the mass thereof. In an example, the photodetector <b>116</b> and the vapor cell <b>114</b> are mounted to the second side <b>124</b>. Moreover, the vapor cell <b>114</b> can be disposed overtop of the photodetector <b>116</b> and aligned with the laser <b>110</b> and waveplate <b>111</b> such that a beam from the laser <b>110</b> propagates through the waveplate <b>111</b>, then through the vapor cell <b>114</b> and can be detected by the photodetector <b>116</b>. In an example, the photodetector <b>116</b> can be solder bonded to the second side <b>124</b> using, for example, flip-chip mounting. A plurality of solder balls <b>126</b> can be attached to the second side <b>124</b>. The plurality of solder balls <b>126</b> can be disposed around the photodetector <b>116</b> and can project a height above the second side <b>124</b> that is higher than the photodetector <b>116</b> such that the vapor cell <b>114</b> can be soldered to the plurality of solder balls <b>126</b> and disposed overtop of the photodetector <b>116</b>. In an example, the vapor cell <b>114</b> can be disposed at least 200 micrometers apart from the photodetector <b>116</b>. This gap can enable flux to be flushed from between the vapor cell <b>114</b> and the photodetector <b>116</b>. In an example, the plurality of solder balls <b>126</b> can be formed using a jetting process tuned to produce solder balls of the desired size. In an example, the solder balls <b>126</b> can be formed of a solder having a high temperature melting point, such that, once formed on the scaffold <b>112</b>, the solder balls <b>126</b> generally maintain their structure during further fabrication of the CSAC physics package <b>100</b>. In an example, the vapor cell <b>114</b> can be an alkali vapor cell containing rubidium atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example, the upper scaffold <b>112</b> is in a flipped position with respect to the lower scaffold <b>108</b>. That is, the frame <b>119</b> of the lower scaffold <b>108</b> projects in the opposite direction from the frame <b>125</b> of the upper scaffold <b>112</b>. Additionally, the components (e.g., laser <b>110</b>, waveplate <b>111</b>, and photodetector <b>116</b>, vapor cell <b>114</b>) are on the side of their respective scaffold <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> that is the reverse of the side having the frame <b>119</b>, <b>125</b>. Accordingly, in order to mount the scaffolds <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> with the components all within the space between the scaffolds <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>, the scaffolds are disposed in a flipped position with respect to one another. Additionally, the components (e.g., the laser <b>110</b>, waveplate <b>111</b>, photodetector <b>116</b>, and vapor cell <b>114</b>) can be disposed in between the polyimide layers of the scaffolds <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The CSAC physics package <b>100</b> can include an input/output (I/O) solder pad <b>122</b> on a bottom portion of the body <b>102</b>. Thus, wires can attach to the CSAC physics package <b>100</b> on a bottom portion thereof. In an example, interconnects between the I/O solder pad <b>122</b> and internal components (e.g., laser <b>110</b>, waveplate <b>111</b>, and photodetector <b>116</b>, vapor cell <b>114</b>) can be routed through the body <b>102</b>. In some examples, interconnects for components on the upper scaffold <b>112</b> (e.g., photodetector <b>116</b>) can be routed through the spacer <b>118</b>. Thus, the spacer <b>118</b> can include electrical traces on an internal or outside portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an example, a magnetic coil can be disposed about (e.g., within) the spacer <b>118</b> such that the magnetic coil extends around the vapor cell <b>114</b>. The magnetic coil can be configured to provide a bias field for the vapor cell <b>114</b>. In an example, the magnetic coil can be integrated into (e.g., internal to) the spacer <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of another example physics package for a CSAC physics package <b>200</b>. The CSAC physics package <b>200</b> can include a ceramic body <b>202</b> defining a cavity <b>203</b> for housing components of the CSAC physics package <b>200</b>. The ceramic body <b>202</b> including the components in the cavity <b>203</b> can comprise a ceramic leadless chip carrier (CLCC) package. The CSAC physics package <b>200</b> can also include a non-magnetic (e.g., ceramic) lid <b>204</b> configured to fit over the cavity <b>203</b> of the ceramic body <b>202</b> to form a closed package encasing the cavity <b>203</b> and the components therein. In an example, the ceramic lid <b>204</b> has a generally planar shape. A solder seal <b>206</b> can be used to seal the lid <b>204</b> to the body <b>202</b>. In an example, die attach and sealing operations for the CSAC physics package <b>200</b> (e.g., for sealing the lid <b>204</b> to the body <b>202</b>) are accomplished without the use of flux to enable low pressure in the sealed package which can enable lower power operation. In an example, the lid <b>204</b> can be sealed to the body <b>202</b> in a vacuum. This physics package can enable batch vacuum sealing of the lid <b>204</b> to the body <b>202</b>. The CSAC physics package <b>200</b> can also include a getter film coating most of the interior surface of a ceramic lid <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an example, the ceramic body <b>202</b> has one side (e.g., the top) open such that the body <b>202</b> defines the cavity <b>203</b>.

In any case, the cavity <b>203</b> can include a base surface <b>205</b> and one or more interior sides <b>207</b>. The one or more sides <b>207</b> can have one or more steps <b>209</b> defined therein for, for example, supporting structures within the cavity of the body <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The CSAC physics package <b>200</b> can include one or more scaffolds <b>208</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>220</b> for supporting components such as a laser <b>210</b>, waveplate <b>211</b>, vapor cell <b>214</b>, and photodetector <b>216</b>. In an example, a scaffold <b>208</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>220</b> can include a membrane suspended between a frame. The scaffolds <b>208</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>220</b> can also include a stiffening member attached to the membrane to provide additional structure for the membrane. To produce the scaffolds <b>208</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>220</b> at a size that can be used for the CSAC physics package <b>200</b>, the scaffolds <b>208</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>220</b> can be fabricated using semiconductor fabrication processes. Accordingly, the frame and stiffening member can be composed of silicon and the membrane can be composed of polyimide. The polyimide can thermally isolate the stiffening member and components on the scaffolds <b>208</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>220</b> from the frame and body <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The CSAC physics package <b>200</b> includes a lower scaffold <b>208</b>, an upper scaffold <b>112</b>, and a middle scaffold <b>220</b> that are mounted in the cavity <b>203</b>.

Traces can extend across the tethers <b>302</b> to electrically couple the components on the stiffening member to the stud bumps <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The upper scaffold <b>212</b> and middle scaffold <b>220</b> can be mounted on opposite sides of one or more spacers <b>218</b> (e.g., leg structure, washer). The upper scaffold <b>212</b> can function as a support structure for the photodetector <b>216</b> and the middle scaffold <b>220</b> can function as a support structure for the waveplate <b>211</b>. In addition, the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and middle scaffold <b>220</b> can function as a support structure for the alkali vapor cell <b>214</b>. In particular, the vapor cell <b>214</b> can be supported between the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and the middle scaffold <b>220</b>. Accordingly, the vapor cell <b>214</b> attached to the upper scaffold <b>212</b> on one end and the middle scaffold <b>220</b> on the opposite end. Moreover, the vapor cell <b>214</b> can be disposed within an aperture of the spacer <b>218</b>. Accordingly, the upper scaffold <b>212</b>, middle scaffold <b>220</b>, and the spacer <b>218</b> can form a support structure for the vapor cell <b>214</b>. In an example, a heater for the upper surface of the vapor cell <b>214</b> can be mounted on the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and a heater for the lower surface of the vapor cell <b>214</b> can be mounted on the middle scaffold <b>220</b>. In another example, one or more heaters can be fabricated on one or more surfaces of the vapor cell <b>214</b>. In an example, the spacer <b>218</b> can have a ring shape (e.g., a pentagon ring shape) defining an aperture therein. The spacer <b>218</b> can be disposed around the vapor cell <b>214</b> such that the vapor cell <b>214</b> is within the aperture defined in the spacer <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an example, the spacer <b>218</b> can also function to reduce fatigue on the joint(s) coupling the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and the middle scaffold <b>220</b> to the upper step <b>209</b>. The spacer <b>218</b> can reduce fatigue by being composed of a material that has a thermal expansion coefficient that is in between the thermal expansion coefficient of the body <b>202</b> and the thermal expansion coefficient of the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and middle scaffold <b>220</b>. Accordingly, as the body <b>202</b>, the upper scaffold <b>212</b>, and the middle scaffold <b>220</b> expand and contract due to temperature changes, the spacer <b>218</b> can absorb some of the changes. For example, the body <b>202</b> can be composed of a ceramic having a thermal expansion coefficient of 7 ppm per degree Celsius, the spacer <b>218</b> can have a thermal expansion coefficient of 5 ppm per degree Celsius, and the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and middle scaffold <b>220</b> can have a thermal expansion coefficient of 3 ppm per degree Celsius. In another example, the spacer <b>218</b> can be formed of the same material as the body <b>202</b> and the lid <b>204</b>. The spacer <b>218</b> can provide mechanical support and electrical contact for the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and middle scaffold <b>220</b>. In some examples, the spacer <b>218</b> can also provide mechanical support and electrical contact for additional electronic components such as surface mount technology (SMT) electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As mentioned above, the spacer <b>218</b> with the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and middle scaffold <b>220</b> mounted thereon can be mounted to a step <b>209</b> in the body <b>202</b>. In particular, the spacer <b>218</b> can be mounted to an upper step <b>209</b>. Steps <b>209</b> in the sides <b>209</b> of the cavity <b>203</b> can be used to, at least partially, space the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and middle scaffold <b>220</b> from the lower scaffold <b>208</b>. The spacer <b>218</b> can extend up from the upper step <b>209</b> of the cavity <b>203</b> to further space the upper scaffold <b>212</b> from the lower scaffold <b>208</b> and middle scaffold <b>220</b> and provide space for the vapor cell <b>214</b> between the middle scaffold <b>220</b> and the upper scaffold <b>214</b>. In an example, the spacer <b>218</b> can be composed of ceramic.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The combination of the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and the ceramic spacer <b>218</b> can traverse the cavity <b>203</b> of the body <b>202</b> on a top portion of the spacer <b>218</b>. Likewise, the middle scaffold <b>220</b> and the ceramic spacer <b>218</b> can traverse the cavity <b>203</b> of the body <b>202</b> on a bottom portion of the spacer <b>218</b>. In an example, the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and the middle scaffold <b>220</b> can be attached to the spacer <b>218</b> via fluxless die attach. The spacer <b>218</b> can be attached via fluxless die attach to the upper step <b>209</b> of the body <b>202</b>. In an example, the fluxless die attach can be a plurality of gold (Au) stud bumps.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The upper scaffold <b>212</b> can include a first side <b>221</b> that opposes the lid <b>204</b> and a second side <b>224</b> that is reverse of the first side <b>221</b> and facing the middle scaffold <b>220</b> and the lower scaffold <b>208</b>. In an example, the frame <b>225</b> and the stiffening member <b>227</b> are on the first side <b>221</b>. The stiffening member <b>227</b> can define a plurality of apertures to reduce the mass thereof. In an example, the photodetector <b>216</b> and the vapor cell <b>214</b> are mounted to the second side <b>224</b>. Moreover, the vapor cell <b>214</b> can be disposed overtop of the photodetector <b>216</b> and aligned with the laser <b>210</b> and waveplate <b>211</b> such that a beam from the laser <b>210</b> propagates through the waveplate <b>211</b>, then through the vapor cell <b>214</b> and can be detected by the photodetector <b>216</b>. In an example, the photodetector <b>216</b> can be solder bonded to the second side <b>224</b> using, for example, flip-chip mounting. A plurality of solder balls <b>226</b> can be attached to the second side <b>224</b>. The plurality of solder balls <b>226</b> can be disposed around the photodetector <b>216</b> and can project a height above the second side <b>224</b> that is higher than the photodetector <b>216</b> such that the vapor cell <b>214</b> can be soldered to the plurality of solder balls <b>224</b> and disposed overtop of the photodetector <b>216</b>. In an example, the vapor cell <b>214</b> can be disposed at least 200 micrometers apart from the photodetector <b>216</b>. This gap can enable flux to be flushed from between the vapor cell <b>214</b> and the photodetector <b>216</b>. In an example, the plurality of solder balls <b>226</b> can be formed using a jetting process tuned to produce solder balls of the desired size. In an example, the solder balls <b>226</b> can be formed of a solder having a high temperature melting point, such that, once formed on the scaffold <b>212</b>, the solder balls <b>224</b> generally maintain their structure during further fabrication of the CSAC physics package <b>200</b>. In an example, the vapor cell <b>214</b> can be an alkali vapor cell containing rubidium atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an example, the upper scaffold <b>212</b> is in a flipped position with respect to the lower scaffold <b>208</b> and the middle scaffold <b>220</b>. That is, the frame <b>219</b> on the lower scaffold <b>208</b> and the middle scaffold <b>220</b> project in the opposite direction from the frame <b>225</b> of the upper scaffold <b>212</b>. Additionally, the vapor cell <b>214</b> can be disposed in between the polyimide layers of the upper scaffold <b>212</b> and middle scaffold <b>220</b>.</p>

The frame <b>225</b> and the stiffening member <b>227</b> can be separated from one another on the membrane with a plurality of tethers <b>402</b> of the membrane extending between the frame <b>225</b> and the stiffening member <b>227</b>. A plurality of stud bumps <b>404</b> can be on the frame <b>225</b> to attach the frame <b>225</b> to the body <b>202</b>.

The middle scaffold <b>220</b> can be mounted to the spacer <b>218</b> on the first side <b>228</b> of the scaffold <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an example, the frame <b>229</b> and the stiffening member <b>231</b> are on the second side <b>230</b>. The stiffening member <b>231</b> can define a plurality of apertures to reduce the mass thereof. The vapor cell <b>214</b> can also be mounted on the first side <b>228</b> of the middle scaffold <b>220</b>. The waveplate <b>211</b> can be mounted on the second side <b>230</b> of the middle scaffold <b>220</b>. In an example, a plurality of tilting features <b>232</b> can be fabricated into the second side <b>230</b> of the middle scaffold <b>220</b>. The waveplate <b>211</b> can be mounted to these tilting features <b>232</b>, which can be configured to orient the waveplate <b>211</b> at an angle with respect to the middle scaffold <b>220</b>. For example, a first feature can have a lower height than a second feature, and a first edge of the waveplate <b>211</b> can be attached to the first feature and a second edge of the waveplate <b>211</b> can be attached to the second feature. Orienting the waveplate <b>211</b> at an angle can direct laser reflections off of the waveplate <b>211</b> away from the laser <b>210</b>. In an example, the waveplate <b>211</b> can be a quarter waveplate.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a bottom view of an example middle scaffold <b>220</b>.

Additionally, other components (e.g., the waveplate <b>211</b>) can be mounted on the stiffening member <b>231</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an example, a magnetic coil <b>234</b> can be disposed about (e.g., within) the spacer <b>218</b> such that the magnetic coil extends around the vapor cell <b>214</b>. The magnetic coil can be configured to provide a bias field for the vapor cell <b>214</b>. In an example, the magnetic coil <b>234</b> can be integrated into (e.g., internal to) the spacer <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an example, a second photodetector <b>236</b> can be configured to detect reflections of the laser <b>210</b> from the waveplate <b>211</b>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an example, to manufacture the CSAC physics package <b>100</b> or CSAC physics package <b>200</b>, the scaffolds, spacer, body, and lid can be formed and combined together.
