<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Medical forms are used to collect data and information regarding a patient's symptoms and conditions. One technique for preparing a medical form is to manually edit a pre-existing form (e.g., a form existing in Microsoft Word&#x2122; format) with new or customized questions. The form is then sent to review boards for review through a physical or electronic mailing. Additionally, once a form has been finalized, it may be presented to a patient, study participant or other individual (collectively referred to as &#x201c;patients&#x201d; herein, without limitation, for purposes of convenience). For example, physicians may present patients with the forms when the patient visits the physician's office. Additionally, hardcopy (i.e., paper) versions of medical forms may be distributed to patients for completion. For patient's who have not completed medical forms prior to the patient's examination, the patient may often complete the medical form at the physician's office by filling out a hardcopy of the form.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Frequently, the patient's responses to the questions included in the medical forms are entered into a computerized system by medical personnel. In this case, in order for a physician to review the patient's responses, the physician may access the computerized system and view the answers to the questions, which is often a lengthy process of reviewing individual questions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

The medical integration system <b>102</b> also generates <b>139</b> a visual representation of the data matching the entered criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates <b>140</b> a study instrument, as follows. The medical integration system <b>102</b> receives <b>142</b> a description of the study entered into the system <b>102</b> through a graphical user interface <b>144</b>, an example of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The description of the study may include study details (e.g., information about a study), the name of the study, study duration (e.g., a length in time which the study is available for a patient to complete), a number of patients to be included in the study, and clinic accessibility information (e.g., whether physicians within a clinic are granted permissions to view a study).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, the medical integration system <b>102</b> receives <b>148</b> various criteria for a patient to possess in order to be included in the study. The system <b>102</b> may generate a graphical user interface <b>150</b>, an example of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Through the graphical user interface <b>150</b>, the user may enter various patient criteria, including diagnosis codes, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (&#x201c;ICD&#x201d;) codes (e.g., ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes), Current Procedural Terminology (&#x201c;CPT&#x201d;) codes and other various diagnosis information and treatment information and various inclusive or exclusive criteria (e.g., age information, height information, weight information and smoker status information). The system <b>102</b> includes, for example, a utility to search an ICD code library based on an ICD code description or a partial ICD code to find the correct code. Additionally, the system <b>102</b> may generate a list of predefined criteria and displays this generated list for the user during generation of the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the exemplary embodiment described herein and referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> receives <b>154</b> a selection of one or more instruments to be used in the study. The instruments include pre-defined forms, which may be standard for a particular industry, for example the medical industry. The instruments may also be custom generated, as described in further detail below. The medical integration system <b>102</b> generates <b>158</b> an instrument timeline, which specifies the time (e.g., a number of days, weeks or months) in which a particular question in the instrument should be answered by a patient participating in the study. The timeline may also include the amount of time an instrument is made available to the user to complete.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates a graphical user interface <b>160</b> through which the timeline <b>162</b> may be displayed. In this embodiment, the illustrated timeline <b>162</b> includes a horizontal axis <b>164</b> specifying a number of months relative to the start date of the study for which a particular question should be completed by a patient. The illustrated timeline <b>162</b> may also include a vertical link <b>166</b>, which is capable of moving along the horizontal axis <b>164</b> to select a particular month (e.g., two months or four months) in which a particular question should be completed by a patient. As user herein and throughout the application, the term &#x201c;link&#x201d; includes, without limitation, pointers, Uniform Resource Location links, a reference or pointer to physical data, and a file that serves as a reference to another file.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the exemplary embodiment described herein and referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates <b>170</b> invitation messages inviting physicians to join a study. The system <b>102</b> may include an invitation module, through which users invite physicians and other health care providers (collectively referred to as &#x201c;physicians&#x201d; herein, without limitation, for purposes of convenience) to participate in the study and to enroll their respective patients in the study. The invitation module generates, for example, a list of physicians associated with the user's hospital, clinic and/or research facility. The invitation module may also generate a list of physicians who have previously participated in studies generated by the medical integration system <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Through the invitation module, the user may select from the generated lists physicians to invite to join the study. To find physicians to invite to join the study, the user may also search the system <b>102</b> for the names of individual physicians to participate in and to collaborate in the study. In addition to inviting individual physicians, the user may define groups of physicians to participate in the study as collaborators, observers, and students of the instrument. In this embodiment, the medical integration system <b>102</b> stores the names of groups of physicians that have previously been defined and invited to join other studies. The medical integration system <b>102</b> allows the user to access and search these pre-defined groups of physicians and invite groups of physicians to join the user's study. Through the invitation module, a user may also invite a physician not currently enrolled in the system <b>102</b> to participate in the study. In this preferred embodiment, the invitation module sends an invitation message (e.g., an email or other electronic message) to join the study to the invited physicians.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this exemplary embodiment, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates <b>174</b> a study summary, including the information (e.g., study description information, patient criteria information, selected questionnaire information, timeline information, and invited physician information) input into the medical integration system <b>102</b> by the user. The system <b>102</b> may receive from the user a verification message indicating that the summary information is accurate. The medical integration system <b>102</b> generates <b>178</b> the instrument and sends the invited physicians a copy of the instrument and a list of the user specified patient criteria. The medical integration system <b>102</b> may also record the completion date by which specific questions in the instrument should be answered according to the timeline <b>162</b>. The medical integration system <b>102</b> may also send alert messages (e.g., electronic messages, text messages or short message service (&#x201c;SMS&#x201d;) messages) of the upcoming completion dates to the participating patients.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an exemplary embodiment, the medical integration system <b>102</b> also allows the user to specify whether &#x201c;skipped questions&#x201d; are allowed for the instrument and/or the number of questions to be completed before an instrument score is calculated. In a particular example, the user may specify whether the instrument allows a percentage of questions to be skipped or whether all questions in the instrument need to be completed.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Frequently, Internal Review Boards (&#x201c;IRBs&#x201d;) require a patient to fill out a consent form prior to participating in a study or completing an instrument. For this case, the medical integration system <b>102</b> includes a consent form module through which users upload one or multiple consent forms to be presented to the patient before participating in the study and/or before starting an instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an exemplary embodiment, once a generated instrument has been finalized, the medical integration system <b>102</b> provides the user with the options to start the study or to leave the study open for editing and trial runs. When the study is left open for trial runs and editing, for example, the medical integration system <b>102</b> may generate an online forum for collaboration between the study generator and other participating users. Additionally, in this example when the study is left open for trial runs and editing, the study instrument is editable, meaning that the criteria and the study options described above are editable. If the user selects the option to start the study, the system <b>102</b> may send the selected patients, participants and collaborators an invitation message to view and participate in the study by completing the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another exemplary embodiment, a study may include a customized instrument generated through the medical integration system <b>102</b>. Users are provided a secure space to generate medically-based questions originating from various question styles used by standard instruments. Multimedia modules may be attached to the questions to make the questions more understandable for the patients completing the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates <b>190</b> a customized instrument, as follows. In this illustrated example, the medical integration system <b>102</b> receives <b>192</b> one or more questions and associated answers from a user. The medical integration system <b>102</b> also receives <b>194</b> from the user a scoring system associated with the questions and answers. The scoring system assigns a score value to each of the answers associated with a question, enabling a physician or researcher to assess the study results. The medical integration system <b>102</b> generates <b>196</b> scoring rules based on the numerical scores associated with answers. In some examples, the scoring rules add the numerical scores associated with completed answers. In this illustrated example, the scoring rules may calculate a weighted average for the numerical scores associated with the completed answers by assigning the questions a weighted value indicating the importance of the question relative to other questions. The medical integration system <b>102</b> prompts the user generating an instrument with a series of questions to determine the desired type of score system and may generate a cautionary notification if the user later applies an analytical procedure inappropriate for the selected score system (e.g., average age of study participants may be valid and important to a study, but average social security number is neither valid nor important to the study).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In generating a customized instrument, a user may select a type of question from a list of question types generated by the system <b>102</b>. The types of questions include, for example, multiple-choice questions (e.g., one question with multiple number responses), a &#x201c;Yes/No&#x201d; question (e.g., one question with &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;No&#x201d; as responses), a &#x201c;True/False&#x201d; question (e.g., one question with &#x201c;True&#x201d; or &#x201c;False&#x201d; as responses), a scaling question (e.g., one question and a sliding scale bar through which a user selects an answer located between two values, N1 and N2), an avatar/diagram question (e.g., an interactive question in which the user selects various sections of an image or freely draws on various sections of the image), a free response question in which a user inputs a predetermined amount of characters into a multi-line textbox (e.g., &#x201c;describe in 1000 characters or less your symptoms&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates a graphical user interface <b>210</b> for a user to define custom questions for an instrument. In section <b>212</b> of the illustrated graphical user interface <b>210</b>, the user may select the type of question to be added to the instrument. In this particular embodiment, the user enters question text (e.g., &#x201c;do you have difficulty opening a tight jar?&#x201d;) in section <b>214</b> of the illustrated graphical user interface <b>210</b>. In section <b>216</b> of the illustrated graphical user interface <b>210</b>, the user is provided the option of adding a multimedia module (e.g., an image, an audio file or an image) to the question to assist a patient in understanding or interpreting the question. In this particular embodiment, the system <b>102</b> receives from the user's client system <b>106</b> request messages including data indicative of custom questions to be included in the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a multimedia module <b>220</b> may be linked to a question. In this particular embodiment, the illustrated multimedia module <b>220</b> includes a visual image <b>222</b> and an accompanying audio file <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring back to the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, section <b>226</b> of the illustrated graphical user interface <b>210</b> allows the user to associate the question with a numerical score (i.e., numbers) and a score system, including, for example, a nominal system <b>228</b>, an ordinal system <b>230</b>, an interval system <b>232</b> and a ratio system <b>234</b>. In a nominal score system, numerical identifiers are associated with a response (e.g., 1=blue, 2=red or 1=red, 2=blue). In an ordinal score system, the numerical scores are ordered in a meaningful way (e.g., 1=no pain, 2=some pain, 3=severe pain). In an interval score system, the difference between numerical scores is significant (e.g., a 20 degree temperature difference between answers relating to temperate correlates with a fixed amount of heat). In a ratio score system, the numerical scores represent a quotient, with the quotient indicative of the relative importance of an answer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Numerical scores may be associated with question responses to facilitate scoring of an instrument and mathematical and/or statistical analysis. Frequently, studies are designed to test the efficacy of a medical procedure, treatment or device. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, numerical scores are associated with questions, where a higher numerical score indicates that the treatment is effective and a lower numerical score indicates that the treatment is not effective or is less effective. In this embodiment, an instrument includes the following question: &#x201c;Did you experience an improvement in your symptoms following the treatment?&#x201d; Answers associated with this question include, for example, a &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; answer, a &#x201c;Moderately&#x201d; answer, and a &#x201c;No&#x201d; answer. A numerical score of &#x201c;3&#x201d; is associated with the &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; answer. A numerical score of &#x201c;2&#x201d; is associated with the &#x201c;Moderately&#x201d; answer. A numerical score of &#x201c;1&#x201d; is associated with the &#x201c;No&#x201d; answer. In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the answers <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> associated with a question are assigned a numerical score <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, <b>250</b>,<b>252</b>, <b>254</b> based on the selected score system <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>. Additionally, in this example, a text box <b>256</b>, <b>258</b>, <b>260</b>, <b>262</b> and <b>264</b> is provided in which the user enters text corresponding to the answers associated with the question.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, the answers to questions may be associated with a color value indicative of a feature of the answer (e.g., answers directed toward a level of pain experienced by a patient or a level of difficulty the patient experiences in performing an activity). When the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates visual representations of the answers to a question, the visual representations may be color coded based on the color value associated with an answer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates a graphical user interface <b>270</b> including, for example, answers to multiple questions. In this embodiment, the &#x201c;no difficulty&#x201d; column <b>272</b> of answers is color coded green. The &#x201c;mild difficulty&#x201d; column <b>274</b> of answers is color coded yellow. The &#x201c;moderate difficulty&#x201d; column <b>276</b> of answers is color coded orange. The &#x201c;severe difficulty&#x201d; column <b>278</b> of answers is color coded light red. The &#x201c;unable to complete&#x201d; column <b>280</b> of answers is color coded bright red.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A color value system may be executed by the medical integration system <b>102</b> in generating the illustrated graphical user interface <b>270</b> with the various colored columns of answers <b>272</b>, <b>274</b>, <b>276</b>, <b>278</b>, <b>280</b> according to the following color value rules, for example. Answers with a color value of &#x201c;1&#x201d; are assigned a color code of green, indicating that the physical action (e.g., preparing a meal) specified by the question is easy for the patient to perform. Answers with a color value of &#x201c;2&#x201d; are assigned a color code of yellow, indicating that the physical action specified by the question is mildly difficult for the patient to perform. Answers with a color value of &#x201c;3&#x201d; are assigned a color code of orange, indicating that the physical action specified by the question is moderately difficult for the patient to perform. Answers with a color value of &#x201c;4&#x201d; are assigned a color code of light red, indicating that the physical action specified by the question is severely difficult for the patient to perform. Answers with a color value of &#x201c;5&#x201d; are assigned a color code of bright red, indicating that the patient is not able to perform the physical action specified by the question.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, an instrument includes various sections. A section includes, for example, its own set of instructions that pertain to a grouping of questions. A section also includes one or more associated questions. The types of instruments include patient instruments and physician instruments. Patient instruments are designed to be filled out by or on the behalf of a patient. Physician instruments are designed to be filled out by or on behalf of a physician in regards to a patient. Instruments may be translatable to the primary language of the user and are translatable in real time, based on a selected language of the user. Through an instrument translation module, the medical integration system <b>102</b> enables the generation of multi-lingual studies.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one exemplary embodiment, the questions included in an instrument are associated with alerting features. The medical integration system <b>102</b> generates alerts by enabling physicians to establish answer threshold values for a question or an instrument. In this embodiment, if a patient fills out an instrument and the patient's answer to a particular question or questions exceeds a threshold value, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates and sends the physician a notification message (e.g., an email or an alert icon is posted on a physician dashboard graphical user interface). In a particular example, for the question &#x201c;on a scale of 1-10 how much pain do you experience in your knee when you wake up in the morning?,&#x201d; a physician establishes an answer threshold value of 8, indicating that system <b>102</b> generates and sends a notification message to the physician when a patient selects a value of 8, 9 or 10 in answering this question. The notification messages may be posted on a dashboard graphical user interface generated by the medical integration system <b>102</b>, providing physicians with a quick view of responses to a physician's instrument without the physician having to review many instruments to ascertain where patient responses exceed predefined answer threshold values.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another exemplary embodiment, instruments may be assigned a predetermined availability date: the date on which the instrument becomes available to the user. In one particular example, this date is set directly through a value being entered into a textbox by a user. In another particular example, the date is indirectly set by a reference to a number of days, weeks, months or years (e.g., 10 weeks from today). Instruments may also be assigned a duration of availability. During this duration (e.g., a number of days, weeks, months or years), the instrument is available for a user to complete.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Instrument Validation Module</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, when a customized instrument is generated, a new set of questions included in the customized instrument are reviewed, rated and validated in many review phases, with an individual phase modifying and/or eliminating questions until the instrument is final. Frequently, associations, institutions and clinics assemble expert panels to validate the custom generated instruments prior to the instruments' deployment to patients. In this case, the medical integration system <b>102</b> may generate online review forums to serve a global set of researchers or a single organization/clinic or physicians, reviewers and experts (collectively referred to as &#x201c;panel members&#x201d; herein, without limitation, for purposes of convenience). The review forums allow a physician or researcher who generated the study (collectively referred to as &#x201c;submitter&#x201d; herein, without limitation, for purposes of convenience) to submit the questions to be refined to the panel members in a secure, distributed and online environment. Through the review forums, for example, questions are viewed, commented on, rated and verified collaboratively by the panel members.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates a graphical user interface <b>300</b> that includes, for example, a visual representation of a virtual forum for the panel members to collaborate and review an instrument. In this illustrated example, section <b>302</b> of the graphical user interface <b>300</b> includes a list of postings <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> made by the various panel members for an instrument. The illustrated postings <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> include threaded discussions linked to a particular question or feature of the instrument (e.g., the instrument timeline). Panel members collaborate with one another for private discussions using threaded discussion boards before passing information onto the submitters of the instrument. As the submitters respond to the postings <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>310</b>, the submitters' responses are added to the threaded discussion.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one exemplary embodiment, the review forums include a rating system, through which panel members access tools to rate an instrument, including a list of predefined questions to consider in reviewing the instrument. The rating system enables the panel members to rank the quality of a question and the question's associated score system and numerical score.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another exemplary embodiment, the review forums also include a scoring validation system to validate the scoring system associated with an instrument. Through the scoring validation system, panel members may review and comment on the validity of the scoring system associated with the instrument and the validity of the numerical scores assigned to individual questions within an instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When a submitter and panel members have completed review of an instrument (e.g., single or multi-centered studies), the medical integration system <b>102</b> permits the electronic generation of trial studies to further validate the instrument and its questions and score system. During trial studies, for example, the medical integration system <b>102</b> engages patients to participate in the trial study, by emailing the finalized instrument to patients and soliciting feedback (e.g., feedback regarding study length or understandability of a question). Patients may provide feedback through the review forums, which include a section for a clinical trial threaded discussion.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, through the medical integration system <b>102</b>, a finalized instrument (i.e., a finalized customized and non-customized instrument) may be sent to patients to participate in the study. Patients are selected to participate in a study by the patient's physician, based on the patient's qualifications, including, for example, age and gender. Physicians are able to enter patient name and other identifying information (e.g., email address and home address) into the medical integration system <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, the medical integration system <b>102</b> also queries data repositories, including EMR systems, for the names of patients qualified to participate in a study. The medical integration system <b>102</b> may generate a list of the patients qualified to participate in a study and may enable a user to link (e.g., through a pointer) a selected patient to a particular study. As a result of the link, the system <b>102</b> may generate a notification message notifying the patient that he has been selected to participate in a study. In some examples, the patient is notified by an electronic message sent to the patient's electronic mail address. In other examples where the patient has a user account with the medical integration system <b>102</b>, the patient is notified through a dashboard message or alert displayed in the patient's dashboard graphical user interface when the patient logs into the medical integration system <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> may generate a dynamic instrument form graphical user interface <b>270</b> through which users view and complete an instrument. The illustrated dynamic instrument form graphical user interface <b>270</b> may include a form progress indicator <b>282</b>, which displays a portion of the instrument completed by the user. In this illustrated example, the form progress indicator <b>282</b> also displays a visual representation of a percentage of questions completed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The illustrated dynamic instrument form graphical user interface <b>270</b> also includes, for example, an auto-scroll feature (not shown), which allows users to easily navigate an instrument without the use of a scrollbar or a mouse wheel. Upon completion of a question within an instrument, the page automatically scrolls to the next unanswered question.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The dynamic instrument form graphical user interface <b>270</b> includes, for example, a read-only mode for the review of past instrument results. The dynamic instrument form graphical user interface <b>270</b> also includes a try-it mode which allows a user to view, fill out and score an instrument without any data being recorded in the database <b>126</b>. Try-it mode allows physicians who are unfamiliar with an instrument to fully understand the instrument before assigning the instrument to patients.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one exemplary embodiment, a skipped question manager may monitor skipped questions within an instrument. When a user skips a question, the manager marks and notifies the user (e.g., by a prompt box) before final submission of the instrument to the system <b>102</b>. In another exemplary embodiment, an audio reader feature within the medical integration system <b>102</b> returns and plays an audio rendition of a current question as an instrument is being completed. This feature can be toggled on or off by the user. The audio files may be recorded and stored on the medical integration system <b>102</b> in a digital format and relate to the respective question. Multi-language support is provided for the audio recordings.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Frequently, multiple instruments may include questions that contain similar content and/or the same content. In this case, a condense similar question module condenses into a single view or graphical user interface questions across a single instrument or across multiple instruments that are similar in type and responses. The condensed view is then presented to the user. Through condensed views, the page size of an instrument may be reduced, generating the appearance of a smaller instrument that is more manageable for a user to answer. In a preferred embodiment, the condense similar question module executes rules that match pre-defined key words to words included in a question by comparing one or more characters included in the question to the pre-defined keywords. If multiple questions include characters matching (e.g., exact match, similar match or some variation thereof) the predefined keywords included the rule, the module generates a condensed view of the multiple questions including the matching characters.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the system <b>102</b> generates a graphical user interface <b>312</b> that when rendered on a display device renders visual representations of eight questions <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<b>311</b><i>h </i>as a condensed question <b>313</b> in a &#x201c;carousel&#x201d; form. The graphical user interface <b>312</b> includes, for example, links <b>314</b><i>a</i>, <b>314</b><i>b</i>. In this illustrated example, when a user selects a link <b>314</b><i>a</i>, <b>314</b><i>b</i>, the system <b>102</b> generates another graphical user interface which displays the next question causing the view of the questions <b>311</b><i>a</i>-<b>311</b><i>h </i>to &#x201c;rotate&#x201d; the next question.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one exemplary embodiment, the condense similar question module may generate follow up or adaptive questions, which are presented after a user has responded to a question. These adaptive questions ensure that the response a patient provides for a question corresponds to the various questions across multiple instruments. Through the condense similar question module, for example, a user provides answers for questions across various instruments. Through these provided answers, the system <b>102</b> generates scores for questions across the various instruments, based on the questions' specified scoring system and the user's provided answers.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another exemplary embodiment, a reward point module allows users to earn points for the completion of an instrument. As a user completes an instrument, a predetermined number of points are issued and associated with the user's account. At the end of a study, the accumulated number of points may be applied towards the purchase of items. In a particular example, as a physician generates a study instrument, the physician may assign a reward package to the study. A reward package maps a number of points to one or more questions included in the instrument.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Control Panel</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, users may access the medical integration system <b>102</b> through a control panel. Once a user has logged into the medical integration system <b>102</b> through the control panel, users are presented with information to conduct studies, organize patients and manage data.</p>

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as patients complete instruments, the medical integration system <b>102</b> receives instrument data (e.g., answers to the questions included in the instruments) and stores this received instrument data in one or more databases <b>126</b>. In this example, patients access and complete instruments by accessing the instruments over the illustrated network <b>112</b> (e.g., the Internet or an intranet). Accordingly, the instrument data may be sent over the network <b>112</b> to the medical integration system <b>102</b> and may be stored in the database <b>126</b>. Database <b>126</b> may include multiple databases running on the same machine or on different machines.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, database <b>126</b> stores de-identified instrument data to protect patients' privacy and offer a research space for researchers worldwide. The instrument data may be de-identified by removing patient name, address, and other demographic data to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&#x201c;HIPAA&#x201d;) and other privacy concerns. In doing so, the physician losses access to data associated with the physician's patients, instruments and submissions. To enable a physician who generated the instrument to locate the physician's patients and access fields (e.g., name and address information) that the physician is entitled to access, the de-identified data may be linked or otherwise associated with an identifier, including without limitation a unique identifier, a numerical identifier and an encrypted identifier (e.g., an encrypted hidden code) (collectively referred to as an &#x201c;encrypted identifier&#x201d; herein, without limitation, for purposes of convenience.) Through the encrypted identifier, the physician may access, view and identify information removed during the de-identification process and associated with the physician's patients. In one particular example, the encrypted identifier may be generated by the system <b>102</b> using a random number generator as is commonly known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In this exemplary embodiment, the encrypted identifier enables physicians to collaborate with each other and to plot de-identified patients' data in comparison to other patients' data stored in the database <b>126</b>, including a physician's patients&#x2014;which are identifiable through the encrypted identifier. In one particular example, a physician may plot how the physician's patients compare to patients in another world/country/state/region/city.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In one exemplary embodiment, the database <b>126</b> may be structured to enable collaborators to generate a private research space within the medical integration system <b>102</b>. Collaborators share data within the private research space and with others if they choose to do so. Additionally, the database <b>126</b> may include a public space. The public space includes, for example, the information and data which is accessible to all users and members of the medical integration system <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The medical integration system <b>102</b> also includes, for example, an integration module, which is compliant with HIPAA and which allows the various processes, modules and sub-systems associated with the medical integration system <b>102</b> to communicate with one another and access the data stored in the database <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Data Mining and Research Tools Module</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> also includes a data mining and research tool module <b>120</b> (collectively referred to as &#x201c;research tool&#x201d; herein, without limitation, for purposes of convenience), which may be an interactive component integrated with the database <b>126</b> and may be used to retrieve data (e.g., information regarding a particular study or instrument) stored in the database <b>126</b> based on selected criteria. Through the research tool, a user compares instrument scores, views instrument scores, and views individual patient scores for a particular instrument for various timeline points in a study.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The research tool includes, for example, a visual dynamic query tool to mine, retrieve and graph data from the various studies. The visual dynamic query tool includes a graphical user interface through which users of the medical integration system <b>102</b> generate queries and send the generated queries to the database <b>126</b>. The research tool may also include a visual search tool though which a user of medical integration system <b>102</b> enters search criteria (e.g., an age range for patients, gender information, race information or a study name). In this particular example, based on the entered search criteria, the medical integration system <b>102</b> may generate a search query and queries the database <b>126</b> using the generated search query. The database <b>126</b> returns to the system <b>102</b> data matching the criteria included in the search query. The returned data may be formatted to fit a desired visual charting type. Additionally, the research tool <b>120</b> may execute statistical analysis rules to determine various statistical calculations, including, without limitation, average, mean, median and standard deviation calculations, for study scores, instrument scores and scores linked to a patient.

<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates a graphical user interface <b>370</b> that displays a real-time chart representative of the executed queries and the data retrieved through the executed queries. The illustrated graphical user interface <b>370</b> includes a section <b>372</b> in which the user selects the study for which a real-time chart is generated. The illustrated graphical user interface <b>370</b> also includes a section <b>374</b> in which the user selects the physicians for which the user desires to view associated patient results. The illustrated graphical user interface <b>370</b> includes a section <b>376</b> in which the user may select the instruments within a selected study for which real-time data is charted. Based on the user's selected criteria, the illustrated graphical user interface <b>370</b> displays a chart <b>378</b> of the instrument scores associated with the selected instruments for the selected physicians.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one exemplary embodiment, the medical integration system <b>102</b> includes an export data module to export and/or display data queried from the database <b>126</b> in a pre-defined format (e.g., a format that publications support and a format that conforms to medical journal and associations guidelines). In another exemplary embodiment, the medical integration system <b>102</b> also includes a multi-language module, which enables different language speaking researchers to communicate with each other in the researchers' native language. Through the execution of language rules which translate characters in a first language into a second language, the medical integration system <b>102</b> captures, executes, interprets and displays the review forums, instruments and queried data in the native language format of the researcher. Through the multi-language module, for example, the queried data is capable of being displayed in another, different language.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one particular example, a German researcher queries the medical integration system <b>102</b> in German and sends the queried data to an American collaborator. The medical integration system <b>102</b> recognizes the language difference between the sender (i.e., the German researcher) and the recipient (i.e., the American collaborator) and displays and sends the query results in English to the American collaborator. Additionally, through the multi-language module, patients may complete instruments and data is input and saved into the databases <b>126</b> in one language. Through the multi-language module, the completed instrument data may be viewed and/or queried by a user of the medical integration system <b>102</b> using a second language.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Procedure Determination Module</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The instruments described herein are often generated to test the efficacy of a procedure (e.g., a surgical procedure or a pharmaceutical treatment). In this case, through the use of the timelines described above, the system <b>102</b> may collect instrument data (through the various questions and answers) pertaining to a patient's symptoms, pain level, disability level or any other patient attributes (collectively referred to as &#x201c;disability level&#x201d; herein, without limitation, for purposes of convenience) before the procedure (&#x201c;before procedure questions&#x201d;) and after the procedure (&#x201c;after procedure questions&#x201d;). In a preferred embodiment, a physician links a procedure identifier (e.g., a procedure code or a procedure description) to the instrument. As the database <b>126</b> collects and stores the patient's answers to the questions included in the instrument, the answers are associated with the procedure identifier. In this preferred embodiment, the database stores a list of symptoms associated with a procedure, where the symptoms are categorized as those symptoms occurring before the procedure and those symptoms occurring after the procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, the medical integration system <b>102</b> may also include procedure assessment rules, which &#x201c;grade&#x201d; or classify a procedure based on the determined efficacy of the procedure. In a particular example, the procedure assessment rules collate the patient's symptoms before the procedure and the patient's symptoms after the procedure to determine if the patient's symptoms have improved following the procedure. For the procedures which improve a patient's symptoms, the procedure assessment rules may categorize those procedures as being effective.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The medical integration system <b>102</b> also includes, for example, procedure determination rules to determine a recommended procedure or a recommended medical device based on patient's symptoms and an instrument's score values, including, for example, symptom severity score values and symptom improvement score values. The medical integration system <b>102</b> generates the procedure determination rules by determining the medical procedures that have been categorized as effective (&#x201c;effective medical procedures&#x201d;) based on the score values associated with a user's answers to various questions in an instrument. In one particular example, the system <b>102</b> determines the efficacy of a joint replacement surgical procedure. A before procedure question includes the following question: &#x201c;What level of pain are you experiencing in your joint?&#x201d; The symptom improvement score values associated with this question include, for example, &#x201c;1&#x201d;, &#x201c;2&#x201d; and &#x201c;3&#x201d;. A score value of &#x201c;1&#x201d; is indicative of a high pain level. A score value of &#x201c;2&#x201d; is indicative of a moderate pain level. A score value of &#x201c;3&#x201d; is indicative of a low pain level. In this example, the after procedure question includes the same question (i.e., &#x201c;what level of pain are you experiencing in your joint?&#x201d;) as the before procedure question with the same associated score values. If a patient answered the before procedure question with a &#x201c;high pain level&#x201d; answer (i.e., a symptom improvement score value of &#x201c;1&#x201d;) and the after procedure question with the &#x201c;low pain level&#x201d; answer (i.e., a symptom improvement score value of &#x201c;3&#x201d;), the system <b>102</b> categorizes the joint replacement surgical procedure as an effective medical procedure, based on the symptom improvement score value increasing from a value of &#x201c;1&#x201d; to a value of &#x201c;3.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, for the effective medical procedures, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates a procedure determination rule including the symptoms patients experienced before the procedure. In a particular example, a procedure determination rule for joint replacement includes the following instructions &#x201c;If symptoms==joint pain or joint difficulty or joint swelling, then procedure==joint replacement.&#x201d; When a user inputs a patient's symptoms into the system <b>102</b>, the procedure determination module <b>122</b> in this example executes the procedure determination rules by matching one or more characters included in the input symptoms to the symptoms included in the procedure determination rules. Based on returned symptom matches, the procedure determination rules generate a list of recommended procedures.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Patient Flow Module</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Busy clinics experience patient overload that results in patients waiting longer to see a physician. As wait times increase, patient satisfaction with a patient's physician and/or clinic experience decreases. In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the patient flow module <b>124</b> improves patient satisfaction by efficiently tracking actions a patient needs to take and instruments a patient needs to fill out prior to engaging with a physician. The illustrated patient flow module <b>124</b> is integrated with various aspects of the medical integration system <b>102</b>, including, for example, the database <b>126</b>. Through querying the database <b>126</b>, the patient flow module <b>124</b> determines the instruments a patient needs to complete prior to a consultation with a physician. The patient flow module <b>124</b> may also track a patient's steps and activities from the time the patient arrives at the clinic, registers with the clinic, waits to see a nurse, is seen by a nurse and is moved to an examination room. In a preferred embodiment, the module <b>124</b> provides clinics (e.g., physicians and nurses and health care providers) feedback and guidance as to the next action to be performed and the information the patient needs to provide the clinic, physician or nurse. By tracking this information, the patient flow module <b>126</b> facilitates moving patients through the clinic check-in process more quickly and thereby alleviates patient wait time. The module <b>124</b> may also manage patient load by alerting health care providers of the steps that need to be taken to move patients through an examination.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">To facilitate quick and easy check-in once a patient has arrived at a clinic, the medical integration system <b>102</b> may generate a portal environment through which a patient accesses the medical integration system <b>102</b> to view the patient's appointment by entering patient information, including, for example, name information, date of birth information and/or selecting the name of the patient's doctor at the clinic. In a preferred embodiment, using the entered information, the medical integration system <b>102</b> queries the database <b>126</b> for the patient's appointment and determines the physician with which the patient is scheduled for an appointment. The module <b>126</b> may also query the database <b>126</b> to determine a listing of one or more instruments which the patient's physician requires the patient to complete prior to the consultation.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein.

The patient flow module <b>124</b> queries <b>381</b> the database <b>126</b> for a list of instruments linked to a physician thereby determining the instruments a physician requires a patient to complete prior to an examination. In this illustrated example, based on the query results, the patient flow module <b>124</b> determines <b>382</b> a list of instruments the patient needs to complete and the content of answers for the questions in a completed instrument. Additionally, in this illustrated example, the patient flow module <b>124</b> generates <b>383</b> a list of instruments the patient needs to completes and generates a graphical user interface that includes this list, as described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, the database <b>126</b> may store medical assessment rules (i.e., instructions for how the system <b>102</b>, the patient flow module <b>124</b> or a process executed by the system <b>102</b> analyzes and assesses the content of a user's answers to questions included in an instrument.) Through execution of the medical assessment rules, the system <b>102</b> determines, without limitation, diagnosis information, treatment information and medication information for a patient. The system <b>102</b> generates the medical assessment rules by receiving a listing of symptoms (e.g., symptoms regarding pain) and a listing of medical diagnoses associated with the symptoms. In a particular example of a medical assessment rule, if the system receives patient symptoms indicating that the patient is experiencing pain when opening a jar, then the patient is assigned an assessment of &#x201c;wrist pain.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the patient flow module <b>124</b> retrieves <b>138</b> the medical assessment rules from the database <b>126</b> and applies <b>385</b> the assessments rules to the content and characters included in the patient's answers. Through the application of the medical assessment rules, the patient flow module <b>124</b> may generate a list of diagnoses and treatments applicable to the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates a graphical user interface <b>387</b> that when rendered on a display device displays a visual representation <b>388</b> of the names of the forms that need to be filled out by the patient. The illustrated graphical user interface <b>387</b> also includes links <b>389</b><i>a</i>, <b>389</b><i>b</i>, selection of which cause the medical integration system <b>102</b> to generate another graphical user interface that displays the contents of the instrument associated with the selected link. In a preferred embodiment, as a patient fills out and completes the selected instruments, the patient's entered data and answers are saved in the database <b>126</b>, allowing the patient's entered data and answers to be viewed both by the patient's physician and by other researchers and collaborators querying the database <b>126</b>, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring to the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the patient flow module <b>124</b> also notifies health care providers, including physicians and nurses, of the instruments a patient has already completed.

Additionally, the module <b>124</b> enables the health care providers to add additional instruments to the list of instruments for a patient to complete. Referring to the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, these newly added instruments may be displayed in graphical user interface <b>387</b>, notifying the patient of the newly added instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Referring back to the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the patient flow module <b>124</b> facilitates information flow and continuing of medical care by enabling health care providers to send completed instruments to other health care providers and external and internal EMR systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a particular exemplary embodiment described herein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the medical integration system <b>102</b> generates a graphical user interface <b>390</b>, with illustrated section <b>392</b> displaying a list of the instruments with which a patient is currently associated and which the patient needs to complete. Through selection of the illustrated link <b>394</b>, a health care provider adds another instrument to the list of instruments the patient needs to complete. Section <b>396</b> of the illustrated graphical user interface <b>390</b> enables a user to send a completed instrument to a recipient (e.g., a physician), through selection of link <b>398</b>, thereby facilitating continuity of medical care.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the patient flow module <b>124</b> interacts with appointment systems and EMR systems <b>128</b> to enable health care providers to manage appointments, monitor patient flow in a clinic and perform the proper processes and tasks needed move patients through the clinic. In a particular example, the system <b>102</b> retrieves a physician's appointment schedule from the database <b>126</b> or another appointment schedule system. A physician's appointment schedule includes the names of the patients schedule for a visit with the physicians. In this example, if a physician is overbooked or double booked, the module <b>124</b> enables a user to associate one or more of the physician's appointments with another physician, thereby decreasing the amount by which one physician is overbooked and decreasing the amount of time a patient needs to wait to see a physician.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In the exemplary embodiment described herein, the patient flow module <b>124</b> may query the database <b>126</b> for a list of instruments completed by a particular patient. The module <b>124</b> may apply the medical assessment rules, described above, to analyze the patient data (e.g., answers to the questions included in the instrument) and to generate a visual representation of the health problems and issues experienced by the patient. In this embodiment, the visual representation enables health care providers to quickly and accurately assess a patient's condition, saving the health care provider time in diagnosing a patient's health problems.</p>
