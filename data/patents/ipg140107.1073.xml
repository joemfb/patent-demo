<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a dispenser pump mounted to an opening of a container to allow a user to dispense a cosmetic product accommodated in the container to the outside by a predetermined amount through a pumping operation, and more particularly to an improvement of a first valve which is a valve combined resilient body of Korean Utility Model No. 20-0427103 filed by the applicant. That is, the present invention relates to an improved eco-friendly dispenser pump which prevents hardening of a resilient member and deterioration of contents caused when the resilient member made of an elastomer contacts the contents while the contents are discharged through a pumping operation of a push button, and improves a problem of a conventional dispenser pump including synthetic resin components and a metallic spring by replacing a metallic spring with an elastometric spring, thereby making it possible to recycle the sources thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, a dispenser pump is mounted to a container to allow a user to dispense contents, such as a cosmetic product, shampoo, and a detergent, which are contained in the container by a predetermined amount.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various dispenser pumps mounted to a container to allow a user to dispense contents by a small amount have been conventionally suggested, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a typical dispenser pump has a structure where an opening/closing ball <b>122</b> for opening and closing a contents introducing hole <b>125</b> and an working piston <b>123</b> are installed such that a resilient force of a spring <b>121</b> can be applied thereto, and a cylinder <b>120</b> is installed in a pump body <b>110</b> such that the contents in a contents storage chamber <b>126</b> can be dispensed when a push button <b>140</b> is pushed to apply a pressure into the contents storage chamber <b>126</b> through a working piston <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An air-tight piston <b>124</b> is further installed in the working piston <b>123</b>, and the push button <b>140</b> is installed on an operation pipe <b>130</b> coupled to the working piston <b>123</b> of the cylinder <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the conventional dispenser pump having the above-mentioned structure, if the push button <b>140</b> is pushed, after an aperture is created between the air-tight piston <b>124</b> and the working piston <b>123</b> first, the air-tight piston <b>124</b> and the working piston <b>123</b> are moved downward together, generating a pressure in the contents storage chamber <b>126</b>, and the contents are dispensed through a contents feeding path <b>123</b><i>a </i>of the working piston <b>123</b> by the pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Then, the opening/closing ball <b>122</b> is attached to the contents introducing hole <b>125</b> by the compressed spring <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As mentioned above, if an external force applied to the push button <b>140</b> is released after the contents are dispensed by pushing the push button <b>140</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a repulsive resilient force accumulated in the spring <b>121</b> moves the working piston <b>123</b> and the air-tight piston <b>124</b> downward together.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As the working piston <b>123</b> and the air-tight piston <b>124</b> are moved upward, the working piston <b>123</b> is initially moved upward first, thereby closing the aperture between the working piston <b>123</b> and the air-tight piston <b>124</b>, blocking the contents feeding path <b>123</b><i>a</i>, and weakening the resilient force accumulated in the spring <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As the working piston <b>123</b> and the air-tight piston <b>124</b> continue to be moved upward with the contents feeding path <b>123</b><i>a </i>being blocked, a vacuum pressure is generated in the contents storage chamber <b>126</b> so that the opening/closing ball <b>122</b> is separated from the contents introducing hole <b>125</b> by the vacuum pressure in the contents storage chamber <b>126</b> and the contents in the container are introduced into the contents storage chamber <b>126</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The conventional dispenser pump repeats the above-mentioned operation to dispense the contents.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, the most disadvantageous problem of the conventional dispenser pump is that since the spring is metallic and an opening/closing means for dispensing contents is a metallic ball, the metallic spring and the metallic ball may be corroded by the contents and in turn the contents may be contaminated by the metallic components.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Korean Utility Model No. 20-0427103 titled &#x201c;Dispenser Pump&#x201d; filed by the applicant discloses a dispenser pump which improves the above disadvantage of the conventional dispenser pump.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although Korean Utility Model No. 20-0427103 can prevent deterioration of contents due to corrosion of components by replacing the metallic repulsive spring and the metal ball with an elastomer and employing a synthetic resin valve, the elastomer may be hardened at a portion contacting contents due to a structure where a contents dispensing hole of the elastometric member, i.e. the resilient member (first check valve) directly contact the contents, making it difficult to dispense the contents by a desired amount and lowering reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Moreover, since the conventional dispenser pump includes synthetic resin components and metallic components, the used dispenser pump cannot be recycled during separation of trash and should be wasted, causing environmental problems.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, the applicant has supplemented and improved the prior registered utility model.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and the present invention provides a dispenser pump which improves a dispenser pump of Korean Utility Model No. 20-0427103 filed by the applicant. That is, it is an object of the present invention to provide a dispenser pump which improves a configuration of a pump body and a cylinder assembled in the pump body, applies a resilient member made of an elastomer to the improved dispenser pump so that a push button performing a pumping operation can be restored to its original state by an elastometric resilient member and the elastometric resilient member cannot contact the contents, whereby an error in a pumping operation caused by loss of a flexible force of the resilient member and an irregular dispensing operation of contents can be prevented by basically preventing hardening of the resilient member by contacting the contents, and the contents can be prevented from being deteriorated when the elastometric resilient member contacts the contents.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the present invention provides an eco-friendly dispenser pump where a synthetic resin valve is used instead of a metallic ball without using a metal material of a conventional dispenser pump and a metallic spring is replaced with an elastomer so that the sources of the dispenser pump can be recycled after they are used.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, the present invention provides a dispenser pump where a space is formed between an outer peripheral surface of the resilient member and an inner peripheral surface of a first cylinder tube so that there is no contact surface when the resilient member is vertically pushed and resiliently reacts upward, making it possible to reduce resistance, whereby a resilient force of the resilient member becomes stronger to help smoothly perform a pumping operation and a fatigue of the resilient member becomes low to help extend a life of the resilient member.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a dispenser pump for allowing a user to dispense contents by a predetermined amount through a cylinder <b>20</b> installed in a pump body <b>10</b><i>a </i>by pressing a push button <b>40</b>, the dispenser pump including: a pump body <b>10</b><i>a </i>mounted to an opening of a container and to which a cylinder <b>20</b> is mounted; a cylinder <b>20</b> mounted to the pump body <b>10</b><i>a</i>; and a resilient member <b>30</b> mounted between the cylinder <b>20</b> and a working piston rod <b>26</b> so as not to contact contents, wherein the contents do not contact the resilient member so that hardening of the resilient member <b>30</b> and deterioration of the contents are prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A first separation preventing member <b>31</b><i>a </i>for preventing the annular fixing rim <b>31</b> from being deformed by an operation pressure of the connecting/feeding pipe <b>28</b> may be provided in the annular fixing rim <b>31</b> and a second separation preventing member <b>32</b><i>a </i>for preventing the annular connecting rim <b>32</b> from being separated from the working piston rod <b>26</b> may be provided in the annular connecting rim <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A space S may be formed between an outer peripheral surface of the resilient member <b>30</b> and an inner peripheral surface of a first cylinder tube <b>21</b> so that there is no contact surface when the resilient member <b>30</b> is vertically pushed and resiliently reacts upward, making it possible to reduce resistance, whereby a resilient force of the resilient member <b>30</b> becomes stronger to help smoothly perform a pumping operation and a fatigue of the resilient member becomes low to help extend a life of the resilient member <b>30</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the present invention as described above, the dispenser pump which improves a configuration of a pump body and a cylinder assembled in the pump body, applies a resilient member made of an elastomer to the improved dispenser pump so that a push button performing a pumping operation can be restored to its original state by an elastometric resilient member and the elastometric resilient member cannot contact the contents, whereby an error in a pumping operation caused by loss of a flexible force of the resilient member and an irregular dispensing operation of contents can be prevented by basically preventing hardening of the resilient member by contacting the contents, and the contents can be prevented from being deteriorated when the elastometric resilient member contacts the contents. The dispenser pump is eco-friendly because it does not employ a metallic component, so its sources can be recycled after they are used.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0110">That is, when the resiliently operated portion <b>33</b> of the resilient member <b>30</b> is extended and pulled, the annular fixing rim <b>31</b> will be deviated from the annular fixing step <b>25</b> and pulled toward the resiliently operated portion <b>33</b> without the first separation preventing member <b>31</b><i>a</i>, but since the first separation preventing member <b>31</b><i>a </i>protrudes to be caught by the middle insert step <b>40</b><i>a </i>of the push button <b>40</b> and be blocked, making it possible to prevent separation and deformation.</p>
