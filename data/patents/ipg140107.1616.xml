<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Conventional gaming apparatuses (including lottery apparatuses) and gaming systems offer a variety of bonus game features and large jackpot payouts. Most gaming system bonus wins fall into two basic categories. A first category is the large progressive jackpot. The large progressive jackpot occurs at a random time so the player has no idea of when the jackpot will hit.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A second category of gaming system bonus wins is a bonus game in which the player is aware of an approaching bonus game. Here, all players have some type of indication that a bonus is coming and only one player will win the bonus amount. The second category or type of bonus was designed to encourage players to play more as the expected bonus game plays. The problem with this type of bonus is that some players sit around and wait for the bonus game to hit and them jump in and try to win the bonus. Casino operators, or any other facilities having gaming apparatuses, do not like this because the unaware tourist leaves a loser and the savvy local player takes the winnings. Additionally, conventional gaming apparatuses require players to play and win an underlying first game before the bonus game is even offered to the player. Thus it is very difficult to ever reach a bonus game.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, a gaming apparatus is provided that comprises a display unit that is capable of generating video images, a value input device, and a controller. The controller may be operatively coupled to the display unit and the value input device. The controller may comprise a processor and a memory operatively coupled to the processor. The controller may be programmed to cause a first video image to be generated on the display unit. The first video image may represent a game selected from the group of games consisting of video poker, video blackjack, video slots, video keno, video bingo, other video card games, and video pachinko. The video image may comprise an image of at least five playing cards if the first game comprises video poker. The first video image may comprise an image of a plurality of simulated slot machine reels if the first game comprises video slots. If the first game comprises video blackjack, the first video image may comprise an image of a plurality of playing cards. Also, the first video image may comprise an image of a plurality of keno numbers if the first game comprises video keno, and the first video image may comprise an image of a bingo grid if the first game comprises video bingo.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, the memory operatively coupled to the controller may be adapted to store a second video image for display on the display unit, wherein the second video image represents a second game comprising an instant bonus game. The controller may also be programmed to allow the instant bonus game to be played by a player without requiring play of the first game. Additionally, the memory operatively coupled to the controller is adapted to store data representing a value payout associated with the instant bonus game after the instant bonus game is played by the player. The data may be transmitted to the controller from a network computer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The memory for the gaming apparatus may also store data representing a minimum jackpot value for the instant bonus game. Additionally, the memory may store data representing a buy-in amount for the instant bonus game. The controller may be programmed to notify the player when the instant bonus game will begin. Also, a gaming system may be provided comprising a plurality of gaming apparatuses as defined above, wherein said gaming apparatuses are interconnected to form a network of gaming apparatuses. These gaming apparatuses may be interconnected via the Internet, a serial network, an ethernet network, a firewire based network, other LAN, WAN, internet or intranet networks. The gaming system may provide the instant bonus game described above on the plurality of gaming apparatuses to allow a plurality of players to compete for the value payout of the instant bonus game. The payout of the instant bonus games on the apparatuses in the gaming system may comprise a percentage of a plurality of buy-in amounts collected from the plurality of players playing the instant bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with a second aspect of the invention, a gaming apparatus comprising a first display unit that is capable of generating video images and a value input device may be provided. The gaming apparatus may also include a controller that is operatively coupled to the first display unit and the value input device. The controller may comprise a processor and a memory operatively coupled to the processor. The controller may be programmed to allow a person to make a wager and to cause a first video image to be generated on the first display unit, wherein the first video image represents a first game.

Furthermore, some of the components may be directly connected to the microprocessor <b>104</b> without passing through the I/O circuit <b>108</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Overall Operation of Gaming Unit</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">One manner in which one or more of the gaming units <b>20</b> (and one or more of the gaming units <b>30</b>) may operate is described below in connection with a number of flowcharts which represent a number of portions or routines of one or more computer programs, which may be stored in one or more of the memories of the controller <b>100</b>. The computer program(s) or portions thereof may be stored remotely, outside of the gaming unit <b>20</b>, and may control the operation of the gaming unit <b>20</b> from a remote location. Such remote control may be facilitated with the use of a wireless connection, or by an Internet interface that connects the gaming unit <b>20</b> with a remote computer (such as one of the network computers <b>22</b>, <b>32</b>) having a memory in which the computer program portions are stored. For example, the network computers <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> could be used to control an instant bonus game for players of the gaming units <b>20</b>. The computer program portions may be written in any high level language such as C, C++ or the like or any low-level, assembly or machine language. By storing the computer program portions therein, various portions of the memories <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> are physically and/or structurally configured in accordance with computer program instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart of a main operating routine <b>180</b> that may be stored in the memory of the controller <b>100</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the main routine <b>180</b> may begin operation at block <b>182</b> during which an attraction sequence may be performed in an attempt to induce a potential player in a casino or other facility to play the gaming unit <b>20</b>. The attraction sequence may be performed by displaying one or more video images on the display unit <b>70</b> and/or causing one or more sound segments, such as voice or music, to be generated via the speakers <b>62</b>. The attraction sequence may include a scrolling list of standard games that may be played on the gaming unit <b>20</b> and/or video images of various games being played, such as video poker, video blackjack, video slots, video keno, video bingo, video pachinko, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">During performance of the attraction sequence, if a potential player makes any input to the gaming unit <b>20</b> as determined at a block <b>184</b>, the attraction sequence may be terminated and a game-selection display may be generated on the display unit <b>70</b> at block <b>186</b> to allow the player to select a game available on the gaming unit <b>20</b>. The gaming unit <b>20</b> may detect an input at block <b>184</b> in various ways. For example, the gaming unit <b>20</b> could detect if the player presses any button on the gaming unit <b>20</b>; the gaming unit <b>20</b> could determine if the player deposited one or more coins into the gaming unit <b>20</b>; the gaming unit <b>20</b> could determine if player deposited paper currency into the gaming unit; etc.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The game-selection display generated at block <b>186</b> may include, for example, a list of video games that may be played on the gaming unit <b>20</b> and/or a visual message to prompt the player to deposit value into the gaming unit <b>20</b>. While the game-selection display is generated, the gaming unit <b>20</b> may wait for the player to make a game selection. Upon selection of one of the games by the player as determined at block <b>190</b>, the controller <b>100</b> may determine at a block <b>192</b> if an instant bonus game is available. If an instant bonus game is available, the controller <b>100</b> may generate an instant bonus attraction and display the instant bonus attraction and an instant bonus paytable at a block <b>194</b> on either of the video display units <b>70</b> or <b>71</b>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the network computer <b>32</b> could be used to initiate and facilitate the display of the instant bonus game. Additionally, the video image of the instant bonus attraction and the instant bonus paytable may be a separate video image from the first video image of the standard game that was selected by the player, or the video image of the instant bonus attraction and the instant bonus paytable may simply comprise a portion of the first video image of the standard game selected by the player. In other words, the two video images of the standard game selected by the player and the instant bonus game may be displayed simultaneously on the display <b>70</b>, or one video image could be displayed on the display <b>70</b> and the other video image could be displayed on the display <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The instant bonus attraction may be performed in an attempt to induce a player to buy outright a bonus game, before playing a standard game. In other words, a player is given the opportunity to play the bonus game, for a fee, without having to &#x201c;earn&#x201d; the bonus game through successful play(s) of the standard game. Therefore, a player is provided the ability to play the instant bonus game whenever he or she desires. The instant bonus game may be considered similar to a lottery because all players are given the option to pay money to play the bonus game. The paytable associated with the instant bonus game may be different from a paytable for the bonus game where the player &#x201c;earned&#x201d; the bonus game as a result of a successful play of a standard game, or a series of successful plays of a standard game. For example, the controller <b>100</b> may establish a $10 minimum to buy the instant bonus game, and the payout for winning the purchased instant bonus game with the $10 wager would be $100. Winning the same bonus game in a situation where the player &#x201c;earned&#x201d; the bonus game after successful play of the standard game could result in a $1000 payout for an identical $10 wager. It should also be noted that the controller <b>100</b> may set different minimum wagers or buy-in amounts for a purchased instant bonus game and an &#x201c;earned&#x201d; bonus game. Additionally, the paytable for the instant bonus game may be configured so that a minimum jackpot value is set, and that minimum jackpot value is displayed on the display <b>70</b>, or any other display device, for viewing by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Several variations to the paytable and associated payouts described above for the instant bonus game could be implemented. For example, the gaming system <b>10</b> could be offered on a plurality of gaming apparatuses, wherein the gaming system <b>10</b> would control the timing of an instant bonus game so that a plurality of players could compete for the bonus. The ability to have multiple players playing for the same bonus game could be as simple as allowing a small group of friends to compete against each other, or as sophisticated as having a very large number of players competing for a large jackpot. For games having very large jackpots, the gaming system <b>10</b> may contribute monitarily to the jackpot for the instant bonus game. Additionally, the instant bonus game may be extended to include progressive jackpots where the jackpot is advertised in advance. For instant bonus games associated with wide area progressive jackpots, the timing of the jackpot could be scheduled at a predictable time which may also be included in an advertisement.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The gaming system <b>10</b> may further notify all of the players competing for the instant bonus jackpot of the current jackpot amount. The payout for an instant bonus game may thus comprise a contribution from the operator of the gaming system <b>10</b> as well as a percentage of all of the amounts wagered by the plurality of players playing the bonus game. The controllers for the gaming apparatusses in the gaming system <b>10</b> may update and display for the players the current value of the instant bonus jackpot as additional wagers are made, or the network computer <b>32</b> could be used for this. It should also be noted that the host facility or an operator of the gaming system <b>10</b> may control the timing of the instant bonus game through the network computer <b>32</b>. The operator's control of the instant bonus game may be supplemented by, or replaced by, the controllers in the gaming system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring again to the routine <b>180</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if the controller determines at a block <b>196</b> that the player wishes to buy and play an instant bonus game, the controller <b>100</b> may display the instant bonus game on the display <b>70</b> and allow the player to play the instant bonus game at a block <b>200</b>. The controller <b>100</b> may prompt the player to insert value equaling the minimum buy-in amount before allowing the player to play the instant bonus game. At a block <b>202</b>, the controller may determine if the player won the instant bonus game. If the player did not win the instant bonus game, then the routine <b>180</b> may return to the block <b>194</b> where the controller may generate the instant bonus attraction. The routine <b>180</b> could alternatively take the player directly to one of the game routines <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>240</b>, or <b>250</b>, if the player did not win the instant bonus game. If the player won the instant bonus game, the player may be credited according to the instant bonus paytable at a block <b>204</b>. The routine <b>180</b> may then return to the block <b>194</b> where the instant bonus attraction may be generated and displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">If the gaming apparatus <b>20</b> does not have an instant bonus game available, or if the player chooses not to buy and play the instant bonus game when it is available, upon selection of one of the standard games by the player, the controller <b>100</b> may cause one of a number of standard game routines to be performed to allow the selected game to be played. For example, the standard game routines could include a video poker routine <b>210</b>, a video blackjack routine <b>220</b>, a slots routine <b>230</b>, a video keno routine <b>240</b>, a video bingo routine <b>250</b>, and a video pachinko routine (not shown). At a block <b>260</b>, if no game selection is made within a given period of time, the operation may branch back to block <b>186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">After one of the routines <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>250</b> has been performed to allow the player to play one of the standard games, block <b>260</b> may be utilized to determine whether the player wishes to terminate play on the gaming unit <b>20</b> or to select another game. If the player wishes to stop playing the gaming unit <b>20</b>, which wish may be expressed, for example, by selecting a &#x201c;Cash Out&#x201d; button, the controller <b>100</b> may dispense value to the player at block <b>262</b> based on the outcome of the game(s) played by the player. The operation may then return to block <b>182</b>. If the player did not wish to quit as determined at block <b>260</b>, the routine may return to block <b>186</b> where the game-selection display may again be generated to allow the player to select another game.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An alternative configuration for the controller <b>100</b> could include revising the routine <b>180</b> so that a user is taken directly to one of the games <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>240</b> or <b>250</b> after playing the instant bonus game at the block <b>200</b>. This could occur only if the player wins the instant bonus game, only if the player loses the instant bonus game, or regardless of whether the player wins or loses the instant bonus game. Yet another alternative configuration could include taking the player to the block <b>260</b> after playing the instant bonus game to allow the player to quit immediately after playing the instant bonus game. As with the alternative described above, this could occur only if the player wins the instant bonus game, only if the player loses the instant bonus game, or regardless of whether the player wins or loses the instant bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It should be noted that although five standard gaming routines are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a different number of routines could be included to allow play of a different number of games. The gaming unit <b>20</b> may also be programmed to allow play of different games. Likewise, the instant bonus game described above may be the same bonus game for all of the standard games, or it may be different for each of the standard games selected. It is also possible to have multiple instant bonus games available for each of the standard games, or for a group of the standard games.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart of an alternative main operating routine <b>300</b> that may be stored in the memory of the controller <b>100</b>. The main routine <b>300</b> may be utilized for gaming units <b>20</b> and is similar to the routine <b>180</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> except that the instant bonus game is assumed available on all gaming apparatusses <b>20</b> is made available to the player after the player plays one of the standard games.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the main routine <b>300</b> may begin operation at block <b>302</b> during which an attraction sequence may be performed in an attempt to induce a potential player in a casino to play the gaming unit <b>20</b>. The attraction sequence may be performed by displaying one or more video images on the display units <b>70</b> and <b>71</b> and/or causing one or more sound segments, such as voice or music, to be generated via the speakers <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">During performance of the attraction sequence, if a potential player makes any input to the gaming unit <b>20</b> as determined at block <b>304</b>, the attraction sequence may be terminated and a game display may be generated on the display unit <b>70</b> at block <b>306</b>. The game display generated at block <b>306</b> may include, for example, an image of a standard casino game that may be played on the gaming unit <b>20</b> and/or a visual message to prompt the player to deposit value into the gaming unit <b>20</b>. Block <b>310</b> may be used to determine if the player requested initiation of a game, in which case the controller <b>100</b> may cause one of a number of game routines to be performed to allow the selected game to be played. For example, the standard game routines could include a video poker routine <b>210</b>, a video blackjack routine <b>220</b>, a slots routine <b>230</b>, a video keno routine <b>240</b>, a video bingo routine <b>250</b>, and a video pachinko routine (not shown). At the block <b>310</b>, if no game selection is made within a given period of time, the operation may branch back to block <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">After one of the standard game routines <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>240</b>, or <b>250</b> has been completed, the controller <b>100</b> may generate and display an instant bonus attraction at a block <b>312</b>. As with the routine <b>180</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the instant bonus attraction may be performed in an attempt to induce a player to buy outright a bonus game. As described above, the instant bonus game may be initiated by the gaming apparatus' controller <b>100</b> or the network computer's controller. The instant bonus attraction may be generated regardless of the outcome of the standard game, so that a player is provided the opportunity to play the bonus game even after losing the standard game. The controller <b>100</b> may also display a paytable for the bonus game at the block <b>312</b>. The paytable data may be transmitted to the controller <b>100</b> from the network computer <b>22</b> via the network <b>40</b> and stored in the memory <b>102</b>. The paytable and the minimum wager may vary depending on whether the bonus game was &#x201c;earned&#x201d; or &#x201c;bought.&#x201d; For example, the minimum wager for a bonus game that is &#x201c;earned&#x201d; could be very low, if not free, and &#x201c;earned&#x201d; bonus games that are won could at the same time offer very large payouts. But, for instant bonus games that are &#x201c;bought,&#x201d; the minimum wager could be higher than the minimum wager required for &#x201c;earned&#x201d; bonus games, and at the same time, winning a &#x201c;bought&#x201d; instant bonus game could payout a smaller sum than winning an &#x201c;earned&#x201d; bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A block <b>314</b> in the routine <b>300</b> may determine whether or not a player wants to buy and play the instant bonus game. After a player has decided to play the instant bonus game and has deposited value into the gaming unit <b>20</b>, the player is allowed to play the instant bonus game at a block <b>316</b>. After the routine <b>300</b> has been performed to allow the player to play the instant bonus game, a block <b>320</b> may be utilized to determine whether the player won the instant bonus game. If the player did not win the instant bonus game, the routine may return to the block <b>312</b> where the instant bonus attraction is again generated. Alternatively, the routine may advance the player to a block <b>324</b> where the player is given the option to quit the routine. If the player won the instant bonus game, the player may be credited according to the instant bonus paytable at a block <b>322</b>, where the routine may then return to the block <b>312</b>. The information representing the value payout associated with a winning instant bonus game may be transmitted from the network computer <b>22</b> to the memory <b>102</b> of the controller <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If the player does not want to play the bonus game (or an additional bonus game if he or she has already played one or more bonus games), a block <b>324</b> may be utilized to determine whether the player wishes to terminate play on the gaming unit <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">At block <b>382</b>, the routine may determine if the player desires a new hand to be dealt, which may be determined by detecting if the &#x201c;Deal/Draw&#x201d; button <b>364</b> was activated after a wager was made. In that case, at block <b>384</b> a video poker hand may be &#x201c;dealt&#x201d; by causing the display unit <b>70</b> to generate the playing card images <b>352</b>. After the hand is dealt, at block <b>386</b> the routine may determine if any of the &#x201c;Hold&#x201d; buttons <b>354</b> have been activated by the player, in which case data regarding which of the playing card images <b>352</b> are to be &#x201c;held&#x201d; may be stored in the controller <b>100</b> at block <b>388</b>.
