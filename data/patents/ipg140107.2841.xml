<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/421,189, filed on Dec. 8, 2010 and titled LIQUID FUELS FROM HYDROGEN, OXIDES OF CARBON, AND/OR NITROGEN; AND PRODUCTION OF CARBON FOR MANUFACTURING DURABLE GOODS. The above-mentioned application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. To the extent the foregoing application and/or any other materials incorporated herein by reference conflict with the disclosure presented herein, the disclosure herein controls.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to techniques, methods, and systems related to preparation of liquid fuels from hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide generated from organic feed stocks or other industrial emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Anaerobic digestion of organic substances generally produces hydrocarbon, such as methane, and carbon dioxide. Based on scientific research, methane and carbon dioxide are both green house gases that may cause global warming. It is advantageous to find a way to transform these gases into usable engineered fuels because this not only enhances the energy efficiency but also alleviates the global warming problem. For example, the ethanol production plants generate a considerable amount of carbon dioxide emission through their fermentation process. There is a pressing need to find useful applications of such carbon dioxide because it represents a large energy investment to grow and transport the grain or other fermented feedstock. Similarly it is important to provide practical ways to reduce their carbon dioxide emission, either for the existing ethanol plants or those to be built in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Storage and transportation of gaseous fuels, e.g., hydrogen, are complicated and expensive practices because the system generally needs to be pressurized or super-cooled to &#x2212;421&#xb0; F. Therefore, there is a need to precondition these kinds of gaseous fuels and transform them into a form (such as, liquid at ambient temperature) that can be stored and transported more efficiently. Having an efficient on-site fuel precondition system that can transform hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide into liquid fuels is valuable because it reduces the cost to store and transport gaseous fuels and also controls the emission of hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide by transforming them into usable renewable energy.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Techniques, methods, and systems are disclosed for preparing a renewable liquid fuel from hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide generated from anaerobic digestion of organic substances or from industrial emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one aspect, a method for preparing a liquid fuel can include: supplying hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide to a heated area of a reaction chamber in controlled volumes, forming carbon monoxide and hydrogen by energy provided by the heated area, transporting carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and additional hydrogen to a reactor in controlled volumes, forming the liquid fuel in the reactor by controlling the pressure in the reactor in order to achieve a predetermined object. The method can also include storing the liquid fuel in a storage device. The method provides an efficient way to handle hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide on-site and transform them into liquid fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, a method for preparing a liquid fuel can include: supplying hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide to a heat-controlled area of a reaction chamber in controlled volumes, forming carbon monoxide and hydrogen by energy provided by the heated area, transporting carbon monoxide, a part of generated hydrogen, and additional hydrogen to an reactor in controlled volumes, forming the liquid fuel in the reactor by controlling the pressure in the reactor in order to achieve a predetermined object. Meanwhile, another part of generated hydrogen can be used to form, with nitrogen, ammonia. The method can include storing the liquid fuel with the ammonia in a storage device.

The system <b>500</b> includes a reaction chamber <b>301</b>, a heated area <b>302</b>, a solar window <b>306</b>, a reactor <b>308</b>, an ammonia reactor <b>501</b>, and a storage device <b>502</b>. The system <b>500</b> includes a hydrocarbon source <b>303</b> to supply hydrocarbon to the heated area <b>302</b>, and a carbon dioxide source <b>304</b> to supply carbon dioxide to the heated area <b>302</b>. The hydrocarbon source <b>303</b> can receive hydrocarbon from anaerobic digestion of organic substances (e.g., Equation 1 above) or from other emission sources. The valve <b>3031</b> controls the volume of carbon dioxide supplied to the heated area <b>302</b>. The carbon dioxide source <b>304</b> can receive carbon dioxide from anaerobic digestion of organic substances (e.g., Equation 1 above) or from other industrial emissions such as an ethanol plant <b>305</b>. The valve <b>3041</b> controls the volume supplied to the heated area <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After receiving hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide, the heated area <b>302</b> can provide necessary energy to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen as described in Equation 2 above. In some embodiments, the heat provided by the heated area <b>302</b> can be from solar energy through the solar window <b>306</b>. In some embodiments, a light collection device (not shown) can reflect and focus sunshine through the solar window <b>306</b> to heat up the heated area <b>302</b>. In other embodiments, the solar energy can be received, converted into different form of energy (such as, electricity), and then heat up the heated area <b>302</b>. The solar window <b>306</b> can be closed when the heated area <b>302</b> has sufficient heat to form monoxide and hydrogen. In some embodiments, the heated area <b>302</b> can receive heat energy from a combustor <b>401</b>, as described above. In some embodiments, the catalysts used in the heated area <b>302</b> include nickel (around 20-30%) presented by alumina substrate (e.g., Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, carbon monoxide and the first part of the generated hydrogen in heated area <b>302</b> can be transported to a reactor <b>308</b> through a heat exchanger <b>307</b>. The heat exchanger <b>307</b> can take the heat from carbon monoxide and the first part of the generated hydrogen to pre-heat the hydrocarbon from the hydrocarbon source <b>303</b> and carbon dioxide from the carbon dioxide source <b>304</b>. The valve <b>3021</b> can control the volumes of carbon monoxide and hydrogen transported to the reactor <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the second part of the generated hydrogen can be transported to the ammonia reactor <b>501</b> to form ammonia with nitrogen, as described in Equation 6 above. The valve <b>3022</b> can control the volume of hydrogen transported to the ammonia reactor <b>501</b>. The volumes of the first part and the second part of the generated hydrogen can be determined by the predetermined objected described above. The nitrogen necessary to the reaction can be supplied from the atmosphere or other sources. The generated ammonia can be feed stocks of hydrogen and nitrogen when necessary. The generated ammonia can be separated into hydrogen and nitrogen by selective membranes or pressurized by temperature and/or charge swing processes that utilize graphene storage media. The valve <b>5011</b> can control the volume of ammonia transported to the storage device <b>502</b> and the valve <b>5012</b> can control the volume of additional hydrogen separated from ammonia to the reactor <b>308</b>. The ammonia can be stored with the liquid fuel to be produced in the storage device <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the additional hydrogen source <b>309</b> can selectively provide additional hydrogen to the reactor <b>308</b>. The valve <b>3091</b> can control the volume of hydrogen transported to the reactor <b>308</b>. The additional hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis, separation from ammonia generated in the ammonia reactor <b>501</b>, and/or from chemical reaction outside the reaction chamber (e.g., Equation 5 above). The additional hydrogen can be supplied selectively according to the situation (e.g., pressure) in the reactor. In some embodiments, the additional hydrogen can be pressurized and supplied to the reactor cyclically. The cyclic pressurization enables adequate dwell time of reactants in the reactor <b>308</b> at favorable pressurization conditions, and thus provides favorable disturbance of the reactants, making reactant contacts with catalysts more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After receiving carbon monoxide and the first part of the generated hydrogen, the reactor <b>308</b> can form the liquid fuel from according to a predetermined object. The predetermined object can include: maximize the liquid fuel production, minimize the total energy consumption, or longest use duration of catalysts used in the reaction chamber. Based on the predetermined object chosen, the liquid fuel can be formed from hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide. In some embodiments, the catalysts used in the reactor <b>308</b> can include copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) or alumni (Al). In some embodiments, the hydrocarbon can be methane and the liquid fuel can be methanol. An exemplary equation of the liquid fuel formation is shown in Equation 4 above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A regulating device (not shown) can regulate the pressure in the reactor <b>308</b> by adjusting all controlled volumes (e.g., through various valves <b>3031</b>, <b>3041</b>, <b>3021</b>, <b>3081</b>, <b>3091</b>, <b>3022</b>, <b>5011</b>, and <b>5012</b>), in order to achieve the predetermined object. In some embodiments, the regulating device can be a computer-operated device equipped with suitable sensors that monitor the situation of the reaction chamber <b>301</b>, the heated area <b>302</b>, the reactor <b>308</b>, the ammonia reactor <b>501</b>, and the storage device <b>502</b>. In other embodiments, the regulating device can be manually operated to achieve the predetermined object.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the reactor <b>308</b> can transport the liquid fuel, through a valve <b>3081</b> and a heat exchanger <b>310</b>, to a storage device <b>502</b>. The valve <b>3081</b> can control the flow of the liquid fuel transported to the storage device <b>502</b>. The heat exchanger <b>310</b> can recycle heat energy from the liquid fuel for further use. The heat exchanger <b>310</b> can also adjust the temperature of the additional hydrogen supplied from the ammonia reactor <b>501</b> before it enters the reactor <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition to the liquid fuel and ammonia, the storage device <b>502</b> can also store water, carbon donor, or additives that can be used to improve energy density of the liquid fuel, such as urea or nitrogenous compounds. The liquid fuel can be stored in different types depending on users' preference. In some embodiments, the liquid fuel can be transformed into a gaseous form by heat energy recycled from the system <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An application of a liquid fuel such as CH3OH or NH3 in a fuel cell or heat engine such as a gas turbine, rotary combustion or positive displacement piston engine provides for commensurate delivery of carbon dioxide or nitrogen and/or thermal energy. This enables economic development of processes including enhanced photosynthesis of crops in greenhouse and hydroponic systems. Deliveries of such nitrogen similarly enables greatly improved utilization of nitrogen in processes such as furnace conversion of powder molded silicon articles to silicon nitride ceramics.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The liquid fluid described in this invention can be transformed into polymers for further industrial uses. For example, in some embodiments, the liquid fuel can be methanol and it can be further converted into ethylene or propylene, and then aggregated as polymers, such as polyethylene or polypropylene.</p>
