<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to the field of interference reduction in radio frequency transmitter circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, performance requirements of radio frequency (RF) transmitter circuits may be high and may concern e.g. noise generation, susceptibility to outside interference, linearity in the operational range, etc. The radio frequency performance requirements of a multi-carrier transmitter are generally extremely high. To meet such requirements various solutions may be utilized (alone or in combination).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, to have a possibility to meet requirements on linearity, the output power amplifier (PA) may need to be linearized (e.g. by means of a linearization loop).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, to have a possibility to meet requirements on susceptibility to interference, the PA and the linearization loop may need to be shielded/isolated from interfering signals of the antenna port (e.g. signals picked up by the antenna and/or internal signals reflected at the antenna port).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One possible solution to the problem of isolating the PA is to place a (single or double) circulator between the PA output and the antenna port as exemplified in EP 1432132 A1 and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,092,684 B2.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One problem with such solutions is that inter-modulation (IM) distortion generated by or associated with the circulator(s) cannot be handled by the linearization loop.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Nevertheless, such solutions fill their purpose well enough for single carrier transmitters. Single carrier transmitters typically have high PA-efficiency and any inter-modulation (IM) distortion in such transmitters is typically associated with the circulator(s). However, the inter-modulation distortion is not a serious issue for such transmitters since it worsens only the spectrum mask, the requirements of which are typically not difficult to fulfill.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In multi-carrier (MC) transmitters, however, peaks of the inter-modulation distortion will not only fold close to the respective carriers but also to frequencies that equal any multiple of the carrier spacing. Thus, the inter-modulation distortion is a serious issue for such transmitters, and need to be dealt with if it should be possible to fulfill the performance requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there is a need for improved circuits and methods that reduce interference and/or improve linearity in radio frequency transmitter circuits.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A fourth aspect of the invention is a communication device comprising the radio frequency transmitter according to the third aspect of the invention. The communication device may, in some embodiments, be a radio base station or a mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A fifth aspect of the invention is an interference reduction method for a radio frequency transmitter, wherein the radio frequency transmitter comprises features identical with or corresponding to any of the various features as explained above for the first aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The interference reduction method is for reducing an influence of the interfering signal of the antenna port on the linearization loop and comprises extracting a compensation signal from the third transmission line vi a second directional coupler, adjusting an amplitude of the compensation signal to match an amplitude of the interfering signal of the antenna port passing through the loop impedance, adjusting a phase of the compensation signal to be of opposite phase as the interfering signal of the antenna port passing through the loop impedance, and feeding the adjusted compensation signal to the loop feed line via a third directional coupler.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the following, embodiments of the invention will be described where a linearization loop is applied which includes not only a power amplifier (PA) of a radio frequency (RF) circuit, but also an isolator (e.g. a circulator) applied between the PA and an antenna port of the RF circuit. Thus, the PA is isolated from the antenna port and a linearization loop feed-back coupling point is located after (outside) the isolator according to some embodiments. The linearization may be performed using any suitable known or future linearization method.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is understood that further elements may, according to some embodiments, also be present between the PA and the antenna port. For example, a filter may be located between the isolator and the antenna port.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">To isolate such a linearization loop arrangement from interfering signals associated with the antenna port (or at least minimize the impact of the interfering signals), embodiments of the invention introduce an interference reduction arrangement associated with the linearization loop.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The interference reduction arrangement extracts a compensation signal from signal path between the isolator and the antenna port, adjusts it, and feeds the adjusted compensation signal to the linearization loop signal path.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The adjustment has the purpose of tailoring the compensation signal to cancel or at least reduce the interfering signals in the linearization loop. The adjustment may comprise adjusting the amplitude of the compensation signal to match the amplitude of the interfering signal and adjusting the phase of the compensation signal to be of opposite phase as the interfering signal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Using embodiments of the invention may have several advantages. For example, the PA is linearized and isolated from the antenna port, the isolator is linearized, and the linearization loop is protected against interfering signals associated with the antenna port.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Interfering signals associated with the antenna port may comprise external interfering signals picked up by the antenna and propagated via the antenna port. Alternatively or additionally, the interfering signals associated with the antenna port may comprise components of internal signals reflected at the antenna port. Other interfering signals associated with the antenna port may also be envisioned.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As has been mentioned above, application of embodiments of the invention is particularly beneficial for multi-carrier radio frequency transmitters. However, it should be noted that embodiments of the invention may be beneficial and are equally applicable also for other types of radio frequency transmitters.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments a radio frequency transmitter as describe above may be manufactured by coupling a signal source to the input of the amplifier by means of a first part of a transmission line, coupling the output of the amplifier to the input of the isolator by means of a second part of the transmission line, and coupling the output of the isolator to the antenna port by means of a third part of the transmission line.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In manufacturing a linearization loop may be arranged to at least reduce (and possibly remove) a non-linearity of the isolator (and possibly also of the PA) within an applicable operational range. The arranging of the linearization loop may comprise coupling a directional coupler to the third part of the transmission line to extract a linearization signal, and arranging a loop impedance and/or at least one further linearization loop element so that they may adjust the linearization signal. The linearization loop may also be adapted, in the manufacturing process, to feed the adjusted linearization signal back to the transmission line.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">When manufacturing the radio frequency circuit according to some embodiments, an interference reducing circuit is also arranged to reduce an influence of the interfering signal of the antenna port on the linearization loop. Such arranging may include adapting a directional coupler to extract a compensation signal from the third part of the transmission line, coupling a variable gain and phase shifter to the directional coupler and to the loop feed line.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In association with the manufacturing process, the variable gain and phase shifter may also be adapted to adjust the amplitude of the compensation signal to match the amplitude of the interfering signal and to adjust the phase of the compensation signal to be of opposite phase as the interfering signal.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the variable gain and phase shifter of the interference reduction circuit may be calibrated by use of an injected interferer. The injected interferer may have different characteristic depending on various parameters. For example, the injected interferer has temperature dependent gain and phase. The calibration particulars thus obtained may be stored in association with their corresponding parameters in, for example, a look-up table. Then, the look-up table values, supplemented by relevant parameter values (e.g. measurements of a temperature sensor) may be used to control the variable gain and phase shifter in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a calibration process with known interference, as described above, the composite signal (comprising both the desired signal and the interference signal) may be correlated with the known interference signal and the result may be observed while parameters of the variable gain and phase shifter are varied. Thus, parameters of the variable gain and phase shifter may be set to reduce (and preferably minimize) the energy of the interfering signal in the compensated signal.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a calibration process with un-known interference (e.g. if the interference reduction/cancellation needs to be calibrated in real time operation, or if a calibration needs to be updated or fine-tuned in real time), the process is typically more cumbersome and less accurate. One way to achieve calibration in such a situation is to correlate the composite signal with the (known) transmitted signal and set parameters of the variable gain and phase shifter to reduce the energy that is not correlated to the transmitted signal.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an example prior art circuit with a feed-back linearization loop. A port <b>101</b> for supplying an RF signal is coupled to the input of a PA <b>103</b> via the connection <b>102</b>. The output of the PA <b>103</b> is isolated from an antenna port <b>108</b> by insertion of a circulator <b>106</b> in the connection <b>104</b>, <b>107</b> between the PA <b>103</b> and the antenna port <b>108</b>. The linearization loop connects to the transmission line via a directional coupler <b>110</b> to the connection <b>104</b>, and feeds back the extracted linearization signal as illustrated at <b>111</b>. Thus, the linearization loop does not operate on the circulator <b>106</b> and any non-linearities introduced by the circulator <b>106</b> will not be compensated for.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The feed-back linearization loop may, for example, involve digital pre-distortion (DPD) linearization. The feed-back signal illustrated at <b>111</b> may be input to further processing circuitry which may, for example, include one or more mixers, one or more intermediate frequency (IF) filters, and an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC). Generally, DPD linearization is a technique for improving linearity of radio transmitter components (such as amplifiers). Typically, the DPD loop inversely models the amplifier's gain and phase characteristics and, when combined with the amplifier, produces an overall system that is closer to linear than is the amplifier alone and thereby reduces the amplifier's distortion. According to embodiments of the invention, any suitable (known or future) DPD linearization method and architecture may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an example prior art circuit with a feed forward linearization loop. A port <b>151</b> for supplying an RF signal is coupled to the input of a PA <b>153</b> via the connection <b>152</b>. The output of the PA <b>153</b> is isolated from an antenna port <b>158</b> by insertion of a circulator <b>156</b> in the connection <b>154</b>, <b>157</b> between the PA <b>153</b> and the antenna port <b>158</b>. The linearization loop connects to the transmission line via a directional coupler <b>160</b> to the connection <b>154</b>, and via another directional coupler <b>163</b> to the connection <b>152</b>, and feeds forward the processed linearization signal to the connection <b>154</b> via yet another directional coupler <b>168</b>. Thus, the linearization loop does not operate on the circulator <b>156</b> and any non-linearities introduced by the circulator <b>156</b> will not be compensated for.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this embodiment, the feed forward linearization loop comprises a delay element <b>164</b>, variable gain and phase shifters <b>165</b> and <b>167</b>, an impedance <b>161</b>, a directional coupler <b>162</b>, an amplifier <b>166</b> and an error power amplifier (EPA) <b>169</b>. The components may be arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Alternatively, the EPA <b>168</b> may be moved to any other suitable location in the linearization line. The EPA amplifies the distortion signal (e.g. vector error) to match the distortion signal to the main path signal, and the variable gain and phase shifters <b>165</b>, <b>167</b> fine-tunes the distortion signal to optimize the subtraction at the directional coupler <b>168</b>.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Typically, feed forward loops may be very dependent on delay accuracy for adequate operation. If the delay accuracy is poor, the interference cancellation aimed at by the linearization loop may become narrow-banded.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It may be emphasized that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are schematic drawings and do not necessarily display all elements of a radio frequency transmitter. For example, a diplex filter and/or RF filter may be associated with the output port (<b>108</b>, <b>158</b>), whereby it is only necessary to perform compensation in the transmit band since the filter reduces the bandwidth of the interferers. All the interferers outside the RF bandwidth are attenuated significantly in such a scenario, so that they are not causing any problem. Such a feature may, for example, somewhat reduce the requirements of delay accuracy and power handling of the interference cancellation loop. Furthermore, there may be one or several additional amplifiers or gain and phase blocks in the EPA lineup of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. There may also be additional loops, such as control loops to tune the delays, the gain and phase parameters, etc.</p>
