<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Many computer systems and networks grow over time. In a business setting, documents may be generated over the course of business. In a home network setting, a user may generate digital images or digital video which may consume storage space. As the storage space is used up, the user may add additional storage devices, such as Universal Serial Bus hard disks, additional hard disks, or other storage devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A network storage system may receive the contents of a storage device attached to a client device to the network storage system, then access to the contents may be redirected on the client device to the network storage system. The storage device may then be removed or repurposed. The storage device management may be performed by the client device or the network storage system in various embodiments. The system may use a policy to define under what circumstances the contents of a storage device may be moved to the network storage system, or the operation may be initiated by a user. The system may also preserve any access permissions or other metadata associated with the files on the original storage device.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A network storage device may receive files from a local storage device attached to a client device. The network storage device may store all of the files contained in the local storage device, then add a redirection mechanism on the client device to point to the network storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The network storage device may serve as a mechanism to consolidate various local storage devices on a client device. For example, a user may have one or more attached hard disk storage devices connected through a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection. The network storage device may move all of the data from the various hard disk devices and then create a link or other redirection mechanism so that the user may access the same data in the same manner, but where the data are stored on the network storage device rather than the previous storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The network storage device may consolidate local storage devices from multiple client devices. Each of the transferred client storage devices may be transferred in such a way that all of the access permissions may be maintained. Even though all of the data are located on a network storage device, each client device may access their own data and may not have access to data associated with other client devices.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The network storage device may provide various data protection services, such as backup services, minoring or duplication services, or other functions that may protect the data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Throughout this specification, like reference numbers signify the same elements throughout the description of the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">When elements are referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled,&#x201d; the elements can be directly connected or coupled together or one or more intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when elements are referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled,&#x201d; there are no intervening elements present.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The subject matter may be embodied as devices, systems, methods, and/or computer program products. Accordingly, some or all of the subject matter may be embodied in hardware and/or in software (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, state machines, gate arrays, etc.) Furthermore, the subject matter may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable or computer-readable storage medium having computer-usable or computer-readable program code embodied in the medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system. In the context of this document, a computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable media may comprise computer storage media and communication media.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Computer storage media includes volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Computer storage media includes, but is not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and may be accessed by an instruction execution system. Note that the computer-usable or computer-readable medium can be paper or other suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other suitable medium, then compiled, interpreted, of otherwise processed in a suitable manner, if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Communication media typically embodies computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term &#x201c;modulated data signal&#x201d; can be defined as a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. Combinations of any of the above-mentioned should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When the subject matter is embodied in the general context of computer-executable instructions, the embodiment may comprise program modules, executed by one or more systems, computers, or other devices. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, and the like, that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Typically, the functionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of an embodiment <b>100</b>, showing a system that includes a storage device manager. Embodiment <b>100</b> is a simplified example of a local computer system with a local network storage device</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates functional components of a system. In some cases, the component may be a hardware component, a software component, or a combination of hardware and software. Some of the components may be application level software, while other components may be operating system level components. In some cases, the connection of one component to another may be a close connection where two or more components are operating on a single hardware platform. In other cases, the connections may be made over network connections spanning long distances. Each embodiment may use different hardware, software, and interconnection architectures to achieve the described functions.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiment <b>100</b> may represent a conventional computer device that may have various local storage devices. In a typical use scenario, a user may have a home computer and may purchase a digital camera. The user may begin taking pictures and may quickly fill up a hard disk or other storage device on the home computer with picture files. Because of the lack of storage space, the user may then purchase a hard disk or other storage device that may be attached by a Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection. Over time, the first USB storage device may become full, so another one may be added.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the scenario, each of the storage devices may be accessed through a file system on the home computer. In some cases, the various storage devices may be accessed through a drive letter, such as &#x201c;c:\&#x201d;, or as a directory or device within the file system. At some point in the scenario, the user may purchase a network storage device that may have a large amount of storage capacity. The contents of the USB storage devices may be moved to the network storage device and the home computer's file system may redirect any calls intended for the USB storage device to go to the network storage device instead. In many embodiments, a user may access the file system by using a file system browser.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the transfer of files and redirection may occur without any user intervention. In one such embodiment, the network storage device may detect a storage device on a client system and move files and redirect requests to the network storage device on an automatic basis. A set of policies may define conditions in which contents of locally attached storage devices may be moved to a network storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The file transfer and redirection process may be performed on removable storage devices. In some embodiments, the storage devices may be hot dockable, meaning that the storage devices may be added and removed while the client computer system may be operational. Some embodiments may only perform a file transfer on removable storage devices and may not perform a file transfer on fixed storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Examples of removable storage devices may include various solid state and hard disk storage devices. For example, a hard disk storage device may be removably connected using a USB connection. In another example, a solid state storage device, such as those used in cameras, cellular telephones, and other devices may be used. The removable storage devices may include any type of computer storage media.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The file transfer and redirection process may be initiated by a user. For example, an application may give the user a choice to select one or more storage devices to transfer to the network storage device. In one such embodiment, the user may be able to select a local storage device from a graphical user interface and right click or perform other operations to bring up a menu option from which the file transfer and redirection process may be started.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the files on the storage device may be made unavailable during the file transfer process. In such embodiments, the storage device may be hidden or may be locked from access. Such embodiments may check to determine that all of the files on the storage device are not being accessed by any application prior to transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The file transfer process may transfer all of the contents of the storage device. In some embodiments, the file transfer process may be a bit by bit copy of the storage device where all information on the storage device may be replicated on the network storage device. Such embodiments may copy every detail of the storage device onto the network storage device. Such embodiments may be useful in cases where hidden files, metadata, or other non-visible file related information may be transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other embodiments, the file transfer process may be a file by file transfer process. In such embodiments, each file may be transferred individually and may be recreated on the network storage device. Such embodiments may be useful in cases where any non-visible file related information may not be used on the network storage device. Other such embodiments may be useful in cases where the file system of the storage device may be different from the file system of the network storage device. For example, some small solid state storage devices used in cameras, cell phones, video cameras, or other devices may use one format for storing files on the device and a second format for storing on the network storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The file transfer process may preserve permissions and other metadata about the files. The permissions may be access permissions that may define read, write, and other access limitations. In some cases, the access permissions may define specific permissions for different users.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, a network storage device may create a virtual hard disk on which to store the files transferred from a local storage device. The virtual hard disk may be an expandable virtual hard disk, and may be expanded in size to accommodate additional files once the local storage device nears capacity. In such an embodiment, the expandable virtual hard disk may allow a user to continue to place files in the same directory structure as was used with the local storage device, but without the storage limitations of the local storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After files are moved from the local storage device to the network storage device, a redirection mechanism may be placed within the local file system to redirect any further read and write operations to the network storage device. In some embodiments, the redirection mechanism may be transparent to the user or applications that may access the files.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, removable storage devices may be accessed through a file system on a local device. The file system may be a set of directories or folders through which files of various types may be organized and accessed. In some cases, files in a removable storage device may be accessed within the file system as a folder or subfolder. In such an embodiment, a redirection mechanism may redirect access requests for contents of the folder to a volume on the network storage device that contains the files.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, a local storage device may be accessed through a letter drive. When the contents of the local storage device may be moved to the network storage device, the letter drive designator may be mapped or redirected to the corresponding volume on the network storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The network storage device may create a new logical volume for each storage device that may be moved. The network storage device may also create a name for each volume. In some embodiments, the name may be created from metadata derived from the local storage device. For example, the local storage device's manufacturer and model number may be used to generate a volume name on the network storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The network storage device may provide storage services to multiple client devices. For each client device, one or more volumes may be created to store files on a local device, then the various client devices may access the volumes over a network connection. In many embodiments, the network storage device may service multiple client devices simultaneously and in parallel. When servicing multiple client devices in parallel, each volume may be made available only to the client device for which it was created. In some such embodiments, the network storage device may allow an administrator to have access to all of the storage volumes on the network storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The network storage device may have additional services, such as backup, data redundancy, data consolidation, and other services that may be performed on various volumes stored on the network storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, a backup system may store a copy of the stored data in another location or on another device. The backup system may operate on all of the volumes stored on the network storage device, or on a subset of the volumes. In some embodiments, a user may be able to designate individual volumes for different types of backup operations. For example, a user may be able to identify some volumes for one type of backup and other volumes for a different type of backup. In some embodiments, the backup settings may be changed for complete volumes, folders or directories within a volume, for all of the data associated with a client device, or globally for all volumes including volumes from multiple storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">One type of backup operation may be a cloud based backup. A cloud based backup may have a backup storage that may be accessed through the Internet or other network connection. In many cases, the cloud based backup may be a remote backup where the backup storage may be off premises.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another type of backup operation may be a local backup, and may use a tape backup, optical storage, hard disk storage, or other storage mechanism to store a second copy of some or all of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The network storage device may provide data redundancy for some or all of the volumes. Data redundancy may place a volume's data on two or more different storage devices within the network storage device. Data redundancy may minimize the risk of losing data if one of the storage devices, such as a hard disk, were to fail within the network storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the data redundancy settings may be changed for complete volumes, folders or directories within a volume, for all of the data associated with a client device, or globally for all volumes including volumes from multiple storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Data consolidation may de-duplicate information or compact data within a volume or between volumes. One mechanism for de-duplication may be to identify blocks of data that are exactly the same and remove one of the blocks of data from storage, freeing a block, and compacting the overall size of the data on the network storage device. In some embodiments, a hash function may be performed on the blocks of data to compare the blocks of data and identify duplicates.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The data consolidation may be performed on multiple volumes. By comparing different volumes and removing duplicate blocks between volumes, a larger amount of space may be saved on the network storage device. In some such embodiments, the volumes from one client may be compacted using volumes from other clients. The overall compacting of the network storage device may be performed while keeping the access permissions and logical separation between the different volumes of different client devices.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The network storage device may provide other services on the data, including encryption, virus scanning, data integrity checking, or other services. In some embodiments, the various services may be changed for complete volumes, folders or directories within a volume, for all of the data associated with a client device, or globally for all volumes including volumes from multiple storage devices.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The client device <b>102</b> may have one or more external storage devices <b>118</b>. The external storage devices <b>118</b> may be hard disks, solid state storage devices, optical storage devices, or other storage devices. In many cases, the external storage devices <b>118</b> may be hot pluggable or hot swappable, meaning that the storage devices <b>118</b> may be added and removed while the device <b>102</b> is operational.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The software components <b>106</b> may include an operating system <b>120</b> on which various applications <b>122</b> and services may operate. An operating system may provide an abstraction layer between executing routines and the hardware components <b>104</b>, and may include various routines and functions that communicate directly with various hardware components.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The operating system <b>120</b> may have a file system <b>122</b>. The file system <b>122</b> may be a mechanism for accessing data on the various hardware storage devices, including storage devices <b>112</b> and <b>118</b>. The file system <b>122</b> may be used by applications <b>122</b> to locate executable and data files, and to create, delete, modify, edit, change properties, and perform other functions on various files.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, an operating system <b>120</b> may assign drive letters to different physical or logical storage devices. In such embodiments, a physical storage device may be assigned to a drive letter, directory, or other identifier within the file system <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Some storage devices may contain two or more logical volumes. Each logical volume may have a different identifier or location within the file system <b>122</b>. In such a case, the process of moving files and redirecting access to a network storage device may involve moving all of the logical volumes on the local storage devices, so that the process of moving files and redirecting access may result in the local storage device being freed up or available for repurposing.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, a network attached storage client application <b>126</b> may reside on the client device <b>102</b>. The client application <b>126</b> may communicate with the network storage device <b>130</b> and coordinate the volume creation on the network storage device <b>130</b>, movement of files, and configuration of a redirection mechanism. In some embodiments, a majority of the operations may be performed by the client application <b>126</b>, while in other embodiments, the network storage device <b>130</b> may perform a majority of the operations.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The network attached storage client application <b>126</b> may use a set of policies <b>127</b> to define when and how file transfer and redirection may be performed.
