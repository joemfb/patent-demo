<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the inventive subject matter relate generally to wagering game systems, and more particularly to a wagering game training tool for wagering game systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wagering game machines, such as slot machines, video poker machines and the like, have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally, the popularity of such machines depends on the likelihood (or perceived likelihood) of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing wagering game machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same (or believed to be the same), players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines, features, and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore, there is a continuing need for wagering game machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditionally, wagering game machines have been confined to physical buildings, like casinos (e.g., major casinos, road-side casinos, etc.). The casinos are located in specific geographic locations that are authorized to present wagering games to casino patrons. However, with the proliferation of interest and use of the Internet, some wagering game manufacturers have recognized that a global public network, such as the Internet, can reach to various locations of the world that have been authorized to present wagering games. Consequently, some wagering game manufacturers have created wagering games that can be processed by personal computing devices and offered via online casino websites (&#x201c;online casinos&#x201d;).</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">This description of the embodiments is divided into five sections. The first section provides an introduction to some embodiments, while the second section describes example wagering game machine architectures. The third section describes example operations performed by some embodiments and the fourth section describes example wagering game machines in more detail. The fifth section presents some general comments.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">This section provides an introduction to some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Wagering game systems offer wagering game players (&#x201c;players&#x201d;) entertainment value and the opportunity to win monetary value. In some embodiments, a wagering game system may offer players a wagering game training tool to improve their skill level in one or more wagering games. The wagering game system can offer the wagering game training tool via an online website (e.g., a dedicated training tool website, an online casino website, etc.), at kiosks and/or gaming machines in a casino floor, or as a downloadable client application that players can use in their personal gaming devices (e.g., personal computers and portable devices). The wagering game training tool may include an analysis mode where a player's skill level associated with a wagering game is determined. The wagering game training tool may also include a training mode where various training exercises are customized for the player, according to the results of the analysis mode, to improve the player's skill level, as will be further described below. In some embodiments, the wagering game training tool can provide training tool activity data to an online wagering game server, where the data for each player is organized and stored, e.g., in a player's wagering game account. The online wagering game server can offer the players access to their training tool activity data and other historical data via a network (e.g., the Internet). Furthermore, the online wagering game server can collect wagering game activity data associated with the wagering games that each player plays (e.g., both in brick and mortar and online casinos) and manage a gaming community results website where real-time result statistics, including wagering game leaderboards, are maintained and made available for the members of the gaming community. In some embodiments, the online wagering game server can also analyze the collected wagering game activity data and provide the analysis results to the wagering game training tool to further customize the training mode for the players. For example, the online wagering game server can determine variables in the state of play associated with the wagering games played by each player, and provide this information to the wagering game training tool to offer players customized training exercises which can simulate one or more of the identified state of play variables to improve the player's skills in a casino floor environment.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating an example of a wagering game training tool in a wagering game system, according to some embodiments. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the wagering game system (&#x201c;system&#x201d;) <b>100</b> includes an online wagering game server <b>150</b> and a plurality of gaming machines <b>160</b> connected via a communications network <b>155</b>.

In some embodiments, the online wagering game server <b>150</b> can connect to the casino network <b>180</b>, which may include additional casino network devices, such as wagering game servers, account servers, kiosks, or other devices (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The wagering game training tool can be implemented at the online wagering game server <b>150</b> and the player can access the wagering game training tool via the communications network <b>155</b> (e.g., the Internet) using a gaming device <b>160</b>. The wagering game training tool can also be implemented in a server in a casino network <b>180</b> and accessible via a gaming machine <b>160</b> on the casino floor. The wagering game training tool can further be implemented as a downloadable client application that the player can download to a gaming machine <b>160</b>, which is accessible whether the player is online or offline.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one implementation, at stage A, the wagering game training tool initiates an analysis mode associated with a wagering game for a player. For example, the wagering game training tool can initiate an analysis mode for a video poker game. During the analysis mode, the wagering game training tool instructs the player to start playing the wagering game so that the training tool can determine the skill level of the player.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">At stage B, the wagering game training tool determines when the player has played a predefined number of rounds of the wagering game. For example, the wagering game training tool determines when the player has played 100 rounds of a video poker game. It is noted, however, that the predefined number of rounds can programmable and can be any number of rounds necessary to determine the player's skill level during the analysis mode.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">At stage C, the wagering game training tool determines a skill level associated with the player for one or more areas of skill associated with the wagering game based on the predefined number of rounds played by the player. For example, the wagering game training tool can determine a skill level in areas of skill such as pattern recognition (e.g., playing card pattern recognition), speed of play (e.g., number of rounds played in a given time period), game strategies (e.g., whether to double down in blackjack), etc., as will be further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For instance, in one example, to determine the player's skill level in a pattern recognition area of skill, the wagering game training tool can determine how well the player recognized certain patterns associated with the wagering game (e.g., playing card patterns in a video poker game) during the predefined number of rounds. Additionally, the wagering game training tool can track the total amount of time the player takes to complete the predefined number of rounds, and consider the total amount of time when determining the player's skill level. In some implementations, the level of skill can be represented based on a scale from 1 to 10 or from 1 to 100. The scale for the level of skill can be translated to various skill ratings, e.g., &#x201c;novice&#x201d;, &#x201c;average&#x201d;, &#x201c;skilled&#x201d;, and &#x201c;expert&#x201d; skill levels.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">At stage D, the wagering game training tool identifies an area of skill where the skill level associated with the player is less than a predefined skill level. For example, the wagering game training tool may identify an area of skill where the player's skill level is below a 6 out of 10, or below an &#x201c;average&#x201d; skill rating. In one implementation, the predefined skill level associated with the wagering game training tool can be configured by the player to a desired skill level, e.g., the player can set the predefined skill level to a 6 out of 10, or at an &#x201c;average&#x201d; skill rating. In another implementation, the wagering game training tool can automatically set the predefined skill level based on the player's skill level, e.g., if the player is determined to have an &#x201c;average&#x201d; skill rating, the wagering game training tool can set the predefined skill level to a &#x201c;skilled&#x201d; skill rating.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At stage E, the wagering game training tool initiates a training mode including training exercises customized according to the identified area of skill to improve the player's skill level. For example, the wagering game training tool can provide the player training exercises that improve the player's pattern recognition skills, e.g., playing card player recognition skills in a video poker game, or the player's speed of play. The wagering game training tool can also initiate a training mode including training exercises customized according to two or more areas of skill in which the player has a skill level that is below a predefined skill level.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At stage F, the online wagering game server <b>150</b> receives training activity data associated with the player for the wagering game from one or more gaming machines <b>160</b>. In some examples, the training activity data can be data that indicates the customized training exercise created for the player during a training mode, the player's specific selections during training exercises, the player's performance during training exercise, the player's overall results in the training exercises, and other data gathered during training exercises. In some implementations, the online wagering game server <b>150</b> receives training activity data from one or more wagering game training tools of one or more gaming machines <b>160</b> which the player has used recently. For example, the player may have used a wagering game training tool at a kiosk in a casino floor, and the player may have also used a wagering game training tool on his mobile phone, e.g., in the hotel room after leaving the casino. In this example, both of these training tools can provide training activity data to the online wagering game server <b>150</b>. The online wagering game server <b>150</b> can also access training activity data associated with the wagering game training tool available online (e.g., accessible via the player's wagering game account). The online wagering game server <b>150</b> can aggregate training activity data from multiple sources and store the data in the player's wagering game account, so that it is accessible by the player at any time. In some embodiments, the training activity data can be accessed by any of the training tools in the system <b>100</b> to update and further customize training exercises for the player.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">At stage G, the online wagering game server <b>150</b> receives gaming activity data associated with the player for the wagering game from a casino, e.g., from a server in an online casino or a brick and mortar casino. In some examples, the gaming activity data can be data that indicates one or more of the wagering games played by the player, the player's specific selections during the wagering games, the player's performance during the wagering games, the player's overall results in the wagering games, and other game-related data. In some implementations, the online wagering game server <b>150</b> aggregates gaming activity data for the player from one or more casino networks <b>180</b> and one or more online casinos (e.g, the online casino implemented in the online wagering game server <b>150</b>). The online wagering game server <b>150</b> can aggregate the gaming activity data from multiple sources and store the data in the player's wagering game account. Furthermore, the online wagering game server <b>150</b> can update a community gaming results website based on the player's results in the rounds of the wagering game, as will be further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> describes some embodiments, the following sections describe many other features and embodiments.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Operating Environment</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">This section describes example operating environments and networks and presents structural aspects of some embodiments. More specifically, this section includes discussion about wagering game system architectures.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Wagering Game System Architectures</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a conceptual diagram that illustrates an example of a wagering game system architecture <b>200</b>, according to some embodiments. The wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can include an account server <b>270</b> configured to control player-related accounts accessible via wagering game networks. The account server <b>270</b> can manage player financial accounts (e.g., performing funds transfers, deposits, withdrawals, etc.) and player information (e.g., avatars, screen name, account identification numbers, social contacts, financial information, etc.). The account server <b>270</b> can also provide auditing capabilities, according to regulatory rules, and track the performance of players, machines, and servers. The account server <b>270</b> can include an account controller <b>271</b> configured to control information for player accounts. The account server <b>270</b> can also include an account store <b>272</b> configured to store information for the player accounts.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can include an online wagering game server <b>250</b> configured to control online wagering game content, provide wagering game results (e.g., random numbers), and communicate wagering game information, account information, and other information to and from a gaming machine <b>260</b>. The online wagering game server <b>250</b> can include a content store <b>252</b> containing content for presenting game results and other events on the gaming machine <b>260</b>. The online wagering game server <b>250</b> can also include an account manager <b>253</b> configured to control information related to player accounts. For example, the account manager <b>253</b> can provide wager amounts, game results amounts (e.g., win amounts), bonus game amounts, etc., to the account server <b>270</b>. The online wagering game server <b>250</b> can also include a communication unit <b>254</b> configured to communicate information from the server's components to the gaming machine <b>260</b>, other systems, devices, and networks (e.g., the casino network <b>280</b>). For example, the communication unit <b>254</b> can exchange information with community wagering game servers, account servers, community servers, social networking servers, file sharing servers, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The online wagering game server <b>250</b> may further include a wagering game management unit <b>255</b> configured to facilitate presentation of wagering games on the gaming machine <b>260</b>. For example, the wagering game management unit <b>255</b> can generate and provide game results to the gaming machine <b>260</b> for presentation on a display device of the gaming machine <b>260</b>. The wagering game management unit <b>255</b> can also generate random numbers and provide them to the gaming machine <b>260</b> so that the gaming machine <b>260</b> can generate game results.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The online wagering game server <b>250</b> may further include a community results manager <b>258</b> configured to aggregate gaming activity data associated with a plurality of players from one or more online casinos and one or more brick and mortar casinos. For example, the community results manager <b>258</b> can communicate with the wagering game management unit <b>255</b> to obtain gaming activity data for the online wagering games that are played by the players, and can communicate with the casino wagering game server <b>282</b> of the casino network <b>280</b> to obtain wagering game activity data for the wagering games that are played on the casino floor. In another example, the game management unit <b>255</b> can obtain the gaming activity data associated with the online wagering games and the casino network <b>280</b> and store the gaming activity data in each player's wagering game account, e.g., at the account server <b>270</b>, and also provide the gaming activity data to the community results manager <b>258</b>. The community results manager <b>258</b> may host a website for a gaming community that offers players an online resource for accessing their past game results and other gaming activity. The community results manager <b>258</b> may also aggregate all the gaming activity data for all the members of the gaming community and provide the gaming community an online resource to access gaming community statistics, including leaderboards for various wagering game categories. The community results manager <b>258</b> can provide awards and/or distribute promotional materials to the members of the gaming community that are at the top of the leaderboards in each of the wagering game categories.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The online wagering game server <b>250</b> may further include a training tool manager <b>256</b> configured to implement an online version of the wagering game training tool. The training tool manager <b>256</b> may also offer players the option to download a client version of the wagering game training tool for client devices. For example, players can download the client version of the wagering game training tool to their mobile devices and use the training tool on their mobile device whether they are online or offline. The training tool manager <b>256</b> can also aggregate training activity data for each player from various sources (e.g., online, client applications, casino, etc.) in order to offer players an online resource for accessing their past training tool activity. Additionally, the training tool manager <b>256</b> can provide the collected training activity data to the training tools used by the each player in the network <b>255</b> to update and further customize the training exercises presented to each player by each of the training tools.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can include a plurality of gaming machines <b>260</b> configured to communicate with the online wagering game server <b>250</b> to control and present online wagering games. For example, using a browser, each game machine <b>260</b> can present online wagering games on a display device (e.g., screen, monitor, etc.) of the game machine <b>260</b>. The gaming machines <b>260</b> can be various types of systems, e.g., a personal computer (PC), a mobile device, a laptop computer, a netbook, etc. Each gaming machine <b>260</b> can include a content controller <b>261</b> configured to manage and control content and presentation of the online wagering games on the gaming machine <b>260</b>. Each gaming device <b>260</b> can also include a content store <b>262</b> configured to store content to present on the gaming machine <b>260</b>. Each gaming device <b>260</b> may further include a presentation controller <b>263</b> configured to control the presentation of the online wagering games on the gaming machine <b>260</b>. The presentation controller <b>263</b> can include a web browser, browser plug-ins, and any other software and/or hardware suitable for presenting audio and video content. In some embodiments, the presentation controller <b>263</b> presents game results using content stored locally in the content store <b>262</b>. However, in some instances the presentation controller <b>263</b> may receive, from the server <b>250</b>, content for presenting game results, or the controller <b>263</b> may request particular content from other network devices. The gaming machine <b>260</b> can also include processing components <b>264</b> (e.g., microprocessor, memory, bus, etc.) configured to operate in concert with the gaming machine's other components. In one implementation, the processing components <b>264</b> may execute instructions associated with a wagering game training tool <b>265</b> that was downloaded from the online wagering game server <b>250</b> to initiate the training tool and allow players to use the training tool on the gaming machine <b>260</b> whether the players are online or offline.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> can also include a casino network <b>280</b> comprising a casino wagering game server <b>282</b> and a plurality of gaming machines <b>260</b>, e.g., wired and/or wireless casino floor wagering game machines. Similar to the online wagering game server <b>250</b>, the casino wagering game server <b>282</b> can include a content store, an account manager, a communication unit, and a wagering game management unit to control wagering game content, provide wagering game results, communicate wagering game information, account information, and other information to and from the one or more casino floor gaming machines <b>260</b>. The casino wagering game server <b>282</b> may also include a training tool manager configured to implement a wagering game training tool in the gaming machines <b>260</b> of the casino network <b>280</b>, similar to the online implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, each of the gaming machines <b>260</b> in the casino network <b>280</b> and the casino wagering game server <b>282</b> are configured to work together such that the gaming machine <b>260</b> can be operated as a thin, thick, or intermediate client. For example, one or more elements of game play may be controlled by the gaming machine <b>260</b> (client) or the casino wagering game server <b>282</b> (server). Game play elements can include executable game code, lookup tables, configuration files, game results, audio or visual representations of the game, game assets or the like. In a thin-client example, the casino wagering game server <b>282</b> can perform functions such as determining game results or managing assets, while the gaming machine <b>260</b> can present a audible/graphical representation of such outcome or asset modification to the players. In a thick-client example, the gaming machine <b>260</b> can determine game outcomes and communicate the outcomes to the casino wagering game server <b>282</b> for recording or managing a player's account. Similarly, in some examples, elements of the wagering game training tool implemented in the casino network <b>280</b> can be controlled by the gaming machine <b>260</b> (client) or the casino wagering game server <b>282</b> (server).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each component shown in the wagering game system architecture <b>200</b> is shown as a separate and distinct element connected via the communications network <b>255</b>. However, some functions performed by one component could be performed by other components. For example, the online wagering game server <b>250</b> can also be configured to perform functions of the account server <b>270</b>. Furthermore, the components shown may all be contained in one device, but some, or all, may be included in, or performed by multiple devices, as in the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or other configurations not shown.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">This section describes operations associated with some embodiments. In the discussion below, the flow diagrams will be described with reference to the block diagrams presented above. However, in some embodiments, the operations can be performed by logic not described in the block diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In certain embodiments, the operations can be performed by executing instructions residing on machine-readable storage media (e.g., software), while in other embodiments, the operations can be performed by hardware and/or other logic (e.g., firmware).

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The following discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> describe examples of a wagering game training tool configured to customize wagering game training exercises for players in a wagering game system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> describes an example mechanism for aggregating training and gaming activity data from various gaming sources in a wagering game system for a gaming community.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow diagram (&#x201c;flow&#x201d;) <b>300</b> illustrating operations for customizing training exercises for a player to improve the player's skill level in a wagering game of a wagering game system, according to some embodiments. The flow of <b>300</b> will be described with reference to the example system architecture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The flow diagram begins at block <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At block <b>302</b>, a gaming machine <b>260</b> initiates an analysis mode of a wagering game training tool associated with a wagering game for a player. For example, the gaming machine <b>260</b> presents the training tool on a display device of the gaming machine <b>260</b>, and initiates an analysis mode of the wagering game training tool. The wagering game training tool may be available in different forms, e.g., a downloadable client version, an online version, and an in-casino version. In one implementation, the gaming machine <b>260</b> can be a client device of the network <b>255</b> (e.g., a laptop, mobile phone, etc.) that includes a downloaded client version of the wagering game training tool. In this implementation, the client device can initiate the training tool in response to receiving input from the player to run the wagering game training tool (e.g., double-clicking an icon). In another implementation, the gaming machine <b>260</b> may be a client device on the network <b>255</b> that can access an online version of the wagering game training tool managed by the online wagering game server <b>250</b>. In this implementation, the client device can communicate with the online wagering game server <b>250</b> (e.g., request access to the training tool, provide log-in information, etc.) to cause the online wagering game server <b>250</b> to initiate the training tool at the gaming machine <b>260</b> (e.g., via a web browser). In a similar manner, a gaming machine <b>260</b> on the casino network <b>280</b> (e.g., a kiosk, wagering game machine, or other server-based gaming machine) can communicate with the casino wagering game server <b>282</b> to cause the server <b>282</b> to initiate an in-casino version of the wagering game training tool at the gaming machine <b>260</b>. The wagering game training tool may be associated with various types of wagering games, e.g., video poker, video blackjack, etc. During the analysis mode, the wagering game training tool instructs the player to play a predefined number of rounds of the wagering game so that the training tool can gather sufficient data to determine the skill level of the player. After block <b>302</b>, the flow continues at block <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At block <b>304</b>, the wagering game training tool determines when the player has played a predefined number of rounds of the wagering game. For example, the wagering training tool can determine when the player has played 100 rounds of the wagering game, e.g., a video poker game. It is noted, however, that in some implementations the predefined number of rounds can programmable, and/or the training tool can dynamically vary the predefined number of rounds depending on whether the training tool has gathered sufficient data to determine the player's skill level. After block <b>304</b>, the flow continues at block <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At block <b>306</b>, the wagering training tool determines a skill level associated with the player for one or more areas of skill associated with the wagering game based, at least in part, on the player's performance on the predefined number of rounds of the wagering game played by the player. In some implementations, the wagering game training tool can determine a skill level in areas of skill such as pattern recognition (e.g., playing card pattern recognition), and speed of play (e.g., number of rounds played in a given time period). For instance, in one implementation, to determine the player's skill level in a pattern recognition area of skill, the wagering game training tool can determine how well the player recognized certain patterns associated with the wagering game during the predefined number of rounds. For example, in a video poker wagering game, the wagering game training tool can determine how well the player recognized playing card patterns (e.g., playing card suit/rank combinations) in the playing cards that are deal to the player during each round. In one example, the wagering game training tool can compare the player's pattern recognition performance to an optimal pattern recognition level associated with the rounds the player played. In one example, the wagering game training tool can determine whether the player recognizes certain patterns in the playing cards dealt in each round based on how the player plays each round. For instance, if three cards of the same suit are dealt in one hand, the training tool can determine whether the player recognized the pattern of a potential flush (i.e., five cards of the same suit) based on how the player plays the hand, e.g., whether the player keeps the three cards of the same suit to pursue a flush. Similarly, the training tool can determine whether the player recognizes the pattern of a potential straight, or the pattern of a two-of-a-kind. In some implementations, to determine the player's skill level in a pattern recognition area of skill, the wagering game training tool can also track the total amount of time the player takes to complete the predefined number of rounds. In other words, in addition to the player's pattern recognition performance, the wagering game training tool can consider the total amount of time when determining the player's skill level. In one example, the wagering game training tool can determine an average total amount of time that a player should take to complete the predefined number of the wagering game. In this example, the wagering game training tool can compare the actual total amount of time the player takes to complete the predefined number of rounds to the average total amount of time. In some implementations, the player's pattern recognition performance can be weighed with the player's time/speed performance to determine the player's skill level in a pattern recognition area of skill. In some cases, a player may know the rules and therefore know which is the optimal hand to hold in a given round, however, the player may miss the best hand because they did not recognize the pattern of the playing cards. Also, in some cases, although the player recognizes the patterns of the playing cards that are dealt, the player may play the predefined number of rounds too slowly (e.g., compared to an average speed) to merit an above average skill rating. It is noted, however, that in other implementations the wagering game training tool can determine the player's skill level in a pattern recognition area of skill by other techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the wagering game training tool can determine the player's skill level in playing the wagering game optimally, or within a predefined performance range, at a certain speed of play. The predefined performance range can be a certain percentage from optimal play, e.g., 80% or 90% from optimal play may be considered an acceptable performance range. In one example, the training tool can identify at what speed the player can play the wagering game before the players starts making too many errors, e.g., the number of errors in a predefined number of rounds is greater than a threshold. The training tool can then determine a skill level associated with speed of play based on how fast a player can play the wagering game within certain acceptable limits. For time-based wagering games, even though the player may know the rules and may play at an optimal level at a slow speed of play, the player may perform poorly if the player spends too much time in each round of a time-based wagering game.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some implementations, the skill level of a player in a certain area of skill can be represented based on a scale from 1 to 10, or a scale from 1 to 100. In one implementation, the scale for the level of skill can be translated to various skill ratings, e.g., &#x201c;novice&#x201d;, &#x201c;average&#x201d;, &#x201c;skilled&#x201d;, and &#x201c;expert&#x201d; skill levels. For example, in a scale from 1 to 100, a skill level of 1-30 can be considered &#x201c;novice&#x201d;, a skill level of 31-70 can be considered &#x201c;average&#x201d;, a skill level of 71-85 can be considered &#x201c;skilled&#x201d;, and a skill level of 86-100 can be considered &#x201c;expert&#x201d;. It is noted, however, that in other implementations the skill level can be determined by other techniques, e.g., the skill level can be determined on various types of point systems.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some implementations, during the analysis mode, the wagering game training tool randomly generates the rounds of the wagering game. For example, in a video poker game, the training tool can randomly generate the playing cards that are dealt in each of the predefined number of rounds used to determine the player's skill. In other implementations, the training tool non-randomly generates the rounds of the wagering game. For example, in a video poker game, the training tool can non-randomly generate the playing cards that are dealt in each round. In other words, the training tool can non-randomly deal a certain combination of playing cards in each round to the player to purposely test the player's skill in one or more areas of skill associated with the wagering game. It is noted, however, that in some embodiments, during the analysis mode, the training tool may generate some rounds randomly and other rounds non-randomly. After block <b>306</b>, the flow continues at block <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At block <b>308</b>, the wagering game training tool identifies an area of skill associated with the wagering game where the player's skill level is less than a predefined skill level. For example, the wagering game training tool may identify an area of skill where the player's skill level is below a 6 out of 10, or below an &#x201c;average&#x201d; skill rating. As described above, the predefined skill level can be configured by the player, or the wagering game training tool can automatically determine the predetermined skill rating, e.g., based on the player's skill level. After block <b>308</b>, the flow continues at block <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At block <b>310</b>, the wagering game training tool initiates a training mode including training exercises customized according to the identified area of skill to improve the player's skill level. In one example, the wagering game training tool can provide the player training exercises that improve the player's pattern recognition skills. For example, to improve the player's playing card pattern recognition skills in a video poker game, the training tool may initiate a flash card mode (or visual mode), where the wagering game training tool rapidly and continuously presents hands of playing cards with a predetermined pattern to the player. The player can then provide an input that indicates whether the player detected the pattern of playing cards. During the training exercises, the training tool can non-randomly deal a certain pattern or combination of playing cards in each round to the player to purposely test the player's skill in pattern recognition. In one example, the wagering game training tool can generate the playing cards shown in rounds <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As illustrated, in round <b>401</b>, the training tool can generate a jack of diamonds, a three of hearts, a six of spades, a ten of diamonds, and a five of spades to determine whether the player recognizes a potential straight. In round <b>402</b>, the training tool can generate a jack of spades, a two of hearts, a king of spades, a ten of diamonds, and a 5 of spades to determine whether the player recognizes a potential flush. In each round, the player can either select a &#x201c;play&#x201d; button or a &#x201c;don't play&#x201d; button. In this example, the player selects the &#x201c;play&#x201d; button when the player detects a favorable pattern of playing cards that has a great chance of winning, or selects a &#x201c;don't play&#x201d; button when the player does not detect a favorable pattern of playing cards. In the flash card mode, immediately after the player selects one of the buttons, the training tool presents the next hand of playing cards. In some implementations, the flash card mode may provide the player a limited amount of time to recognize the pattern and make the selection. As the player improves their pattern recognition skills, the flash card mode can reduce the amount of time the player is provided to recognize the patter and make the selection. The flash card mode can also be configured to present the player two hands of playing cards, and the player can select which of the two hands the player would hold, or which of the two hands satisfies a predetermined condition or pattern (e.g., a flush). In some implementations, the training tool can further customize training exercises to focus on a specific area of pattern recognition that the player continuously makes mistakes. For example, based on the data from the analysis mode, the training tool may determine that the player regularly misses the pattern associated with a straight or a flush. Therefore, in this example, during the training exercises, the training tool may regularly test the player with combinations of player cards that are, or have a potential of being, a straight or a flush. In one example, the flash card mode can be configured to present the player a hand of playing cards and ask a specific question about the hand, e.g., is this hand a straight or a flush?, does this hand have a potential of being a straight or a flush?, etc. The player may select either a &#x201c;yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;no&#x201d; button and move to the next hand.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Furthermore, the wagering game training tool can provide the player training exercises that improve the player's speed of play. For example, to improve the player's speed of play in a video poker game, the training tool may initiate a time-based mode, which incorporates a timer in each round of the video poker game (e.g., as illustrated in rounds <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to limit the amount of time the player spends in each round. For example, as shown in round <b>403</b>, the timer may be set at 3 seconds for a skilled player, and as shown in round <b>404</b>, the timer may be set to 6 seconds for an average player. In some implementations, the player may be penalized each time the player does not finish the round within the given time. Instead of providing a timer for each round, the time-based mode may also be configured to provide players a predetermined amount of time to finish a predetermined number of rounds (e.g., finish 50 rounds in 5 minutes). The wagering game training tool can also initiate a training mode including training exercises customized according to two or more areas of skill in which the player has a skill level that is below a predefined skill level (e.g., combine pattern recognition training exercises with time-based training exercises, and/or add a timer to the pattern recognition exercises). After block <b>310</b>, the flow ends.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the wagering game training tool may be configured to re-evaluates the player's skill level after each session of training exercises and/or after each session where the player plays some rounds of the wagering game. In some examples, the wagering game training tool may wait to re-evaluate a player's skill level in one or more areas of skill associated with the wagering game until the player has finished a predefined number of training exercises, and/or until the player has played a predefined number of additional rounds of the wagering game. After re-evaluating the player's skill level, if the player has improved his skills, the wagering game training tool may modify the training exercises according to the player's new skill level. Also, the wagering game training tool may identify new areas of a wagering game where the player needs to improve their skills, and may customize training exercises to improve the player's skills in those areas. In other words, the training tool may continuously analyze the player's performance and skill level in a wagering game, and continuously adapt and customize training exercises to improve the player's skills in the wagering game.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is noted that besides helping to improve a player's skill level in one or more areas of skill associated with one or more wagering games, the wagering game training tool may also teach the rules/math associated with the wagering game to achieve optimal play. For example, for a video poker wagering game, the wagering game training tool can offer various modes that teach players that holding a first combination of playing cards has a greater probability of winning than holding a second combination of playing cards. In one example, the wagering game training tool can offer players an auto hold mode where the training tool automatically holds the best hand out of the cards that were dealt for optimal play. The wagering game training tool can also offer a warn mode where the training tool alerts the player when the cards the player holds are not the optimal hand. In the warn mode, the training tool can indicate the type of error (e.g., failed to recognize a straight or flush), the severity of the error (e.g., minor or major error), and also indicate the amount of money that may be lost due to the error. The wagering game training tool can offer a casino mode that allows the player to play as many rounds of the wagering game the player wants and then at the end it shows the results and evaluates the player's performance compared to optimal play. It is noted that the wagering game training tool can offer additional training tool modes for a video poker wagering game, e.g., a fixed card mode where the player can customize the cards that are dealt, a error log mode that allows the player to access a log of all the errors the player made playing the wagering game, a payback mode that shows the player the actual payback the player would have received in a play session, among others.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">At block <b>502</b>, the online wagering game server <b>250</b> may receive gaming activity data associated with a plurality of rounds of a wagering game played by a player online and at a casino floor. For example, the player may play the wagering game on a gaming machine of the casino network <b>280</b> (or multiple gaming machines in multiple casino networks), and the casino wagering game server <b>282</b> can provide the gaming activity data to the online wagering game server <b>250</b>. The game management unit <b>255</b> can then process and/or store the gaming activity data. In some examples, the gaming activity data can be data that indicates the wagering game played by the player, the player's specific selections during each round of the wagering game, the player's performance in each round of the wagering game, the player's overall results in the wagering game, variables in the state of play associated with the rounds of the wagering game that were played, and other game-related data. The game management unit <b>255</b> can also process and store gaming activity data associated with rounds of the wagering game that the player played online (e.g., in the online casino implemented at the online wagering game server <b>250</b>). After block <b>502</b>, the flow continues at block <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At block <b>504</b>, the online wagering game server <b>250</b> can access the gaming activity data associated with the player and compare the player's performance in the wagering game in the casino floor with the player's performance in the wagering game online. For example, the training tool manager <b>256</b> may read and analyze the gaming activity data to determine the player's skill in pattern recognition, the player's speed of play, the player's game strategy, the player's play in comparison to optimal play, and/or the player's overall results in the casino floor and online, and then compare the casino floor performance data to the online performance data. In other examples, the training tool manager <b>256</b> may compare the player's performance based on different or additional statistics, e.g., credits won in each round.

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At block <b>506</b>, the online wagering game server <b>250</b> determines that the player's wagering game performance difference in the casino floor is statistically significant compared to the player's wagering game performance online. For example, the training tool manager <b>256</b> can determine that the player's wagering game performance online is better than the player's wagering game performance in the casino floor. In one implementation, the performance difference is determined to be statistically significant if the performance difference online compared to in the casino floor varies by 5%. In another implementation, the performance difference is determined to be statistically significant if the performance difference online compared to in the casino floor varies by 10%, or another suitable percentage. Similarly, in some examples the player's performance at the casino floor may be determined to be better than the player's performance online. After block <b>506</b>, the flow continues at block <b>508</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At block <b>508</b>, the online wagering game server <b>250</b> determines, based on the received gaming activity data, one or more variables in the state of play associated with the rounds of the wagering game played at the casino floor compared to online. In one implementation, the training tool manager <b>256</b> determines the one or more variables in the state of play based on the received gaming activity data. For example, the gaming activity data can indicate some variables in the state of play in the casino floor such as noise, glare, peer pressure, alcohol consumption, hunger, time of day, number of hours in casino, issues with casino gaming machine interface, etc. In some implementations, information about the variables in the state of play at a gaming machine <b>260</b> is entered by the player at the gaming machine <b>260</b> in order to be included within the gaming activity data that is generated after game play. For example, when the player logs in, or prior to each game, the gaming machine <b>260</b> may ask the player a few questions about the state of play at the gaming machine <b>260</b>. In another example, the player can select certain buttons or options on the gaming machine interface to enter the state of play information.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At block <b>510</b>, the online wagering game server <b>250</b> customizes a training mode based on the one or more variables in the state of play to improve the player's performance at the casino floor. In one implementation, the wagering game training tool implemented by the training tool manager <b>256</b> customizes a training mode based on the one or more variables in the state of play. In some implementations, the wagering game training tool can customize training exercises which can simulate one or more of the identified state of play variables to improve the player's skills in a casino floor environment. For example, to simulate peer pressure of playing next to a friend that is a very good video poker player and/or a &#x201c;high roller&#x201d;, the wagering game training tool can split the screen and have the computer play in one of the screens playing at an expert level and betting max bet each round. In another example, to simulate peer pressure of a group of friends gathered around the player in the casino, the wagering game training tool can add background sounds of a group of people talking and cheering for the player while the player plays the wagering game. In yet another example, the wagering game training tool can simulate the distractions of casino noise and glare by adding casino sounds and making the display less visible, respectively, while the player plays the wagering game.
