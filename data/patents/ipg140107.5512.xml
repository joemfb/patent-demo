<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In some example embodiments, a system and method are illustrated to consolidate leads received from multiple user devices used by a single user. The system and method may include identifying a first plurality of leads received from one or more user devices as being submitted by a same user via the one or more user devices. The first plurality of leads may be directed to a listing provided by a lister. The first plurality of leads may be added to a lead group. Then, a second plurality of leads received from one or more users including the same user may be forwarded to the lister. The forwarding may include notifying the lister of a first count of the second plurality of leads. The first count may include the lead group counted as one lead.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The emergence of an online listing system (e.g., such as eBAY, Amazon, and Rent.com in which goods/services are offered to interested parties) has created new opportunities for a service provider to monetize transactions made between a user (e.g., a renter, a buyer, a prospective buyer, a mortgagor, etc.) and a lister (e.g., a landlord, a seller, a rental manager, a mortgagee, etc.) connected through the online listing system. It is important for the service provider to first identify when a transaction has been made between the user and the lister.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Numerous techniques exist for the service provider (e.g., an operator of the online listing system) to identify distinct users to allow payment of fees for each distinct users. In such a case, the service provider may also identify communications between a distinctive user and the lister when the user and the lister communicate via the Internet (e.g., through email, instant messenger, etc.). For example, the service provider can find the transaction by monitoring and/or reading emails between the user and the lister when they communicate with each other through emails sent to each other through the online listing system. In particular, the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/158,916 discloses an apparatus and method to mask users' (e.g., potential renters and listers) identities to each other and track communications (e.g., leads) between them using proxy contact information (e.g., proxy telephone number or a proxy e-mail address, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Once the transaction is found, the service provider can charge the user and/or the lister a transaction fee (e.g., such as a fee when a particular property has been rented through a website such as Rent.com). The existing software, prior to our invention, did not allow us to distinguish sufficiently to assure that lister is charged only for a first contact by a potential renter with respect to a rental listing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some example embodiments, a system and method are illustrated to consolidate leads received from multiple user devices used by a single user. The system and method may include identifying a first plurality of leads received from one or more user devices as being submitted by a same user via the one or more user devices. The first plurality of leads may be directed to a listing provided by a lister. The first plurality of leads may be added to a lead group. Then, a second plurality of leads received from one or more users including the same user may be forwarded to the lister. The forwarding may include notifying the lister of a first count of the second plurality of leads. The first count may include the lead group counted as one lead. More detailed explanation about the consolidating of the leads into the lead group is given below using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of a computer system for billing a lister based upon the number of leads received from potential renters <b>100</b> in accordance with an example embodiment. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a system view of an online listing system <b>109</b> associated with a mask table <b>114</b> and connected to a user (e.g., potential renter) <b>101</b> and a lister <b>104</b> through a network (e.g., Internet <b>102</b>) according to an embodiment. The user <b>101</b> communicates with the lister <b>104</b> through the Internet <b>102</b> (e.g., by accessing and searching on an online listing system such as Rent.com), in an example use scenario. In addition, the user <b>101</b> may directly communicate with the lister <b>104</b> offline through a telephone conversation (e.g., through a mask removal module <b>106</b>). The mask removal module <b>106</b> may reside anywhere in the telephone network (e.g., a circuit switched and/or IP network), and serve as a gateway for offline communications between the user <b>101</b> and the lister <b>104</b>. For example, the mask removal module <b>106</b> may reverse the encoding of a phone number that is &#x2018;masked&#x2019; or encoded by a mask module <b>110</b> of the online listing system <b>109</b>. More detailed description about the mask removal module <b>106</b> is described in the patent application publication US 2007/0003038 A1 (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A transaction center server <b>112</b> (e.g., a transaction center server associated with the online listing system <b>109</b>) may communicate with a billing module <b>108</b> and a mask module <b>110</b> connected to the transaction center server <b>112</b>. The transaction center server <b>112</b> may also be connected to a display device <b>118</b>, an input device <b>122</b>, and a mouse <b>120</b>, according to an embodiment illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>. The transaction center server <b>112</b> (e.g., a computer system) includes a network interface <b>124</b>, a disk controller <b>126</b>, a disk drive <b>136</b>, a display controller <b>128</b>, an I/O controller <b>130</b>, a processor <b>132</b> (e.g., a microprocessor), and a storage <b>134</b> (e.g., a hard drive, a dynamic random access memory, and/or a flash memory, etc.) connected to each other through a bus <b>138</b> according to an embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The I/O controller <b>130</b> connects the transaction center server <b>112</b> to the input device <b>122</b> and the mouse <b>120</b> according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. More detailed explanation about a general architecture for a computer system is given below using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The mask module <b>110</b> of the online listing system <b>109</b> may generate unique telephone extensions to identify different users (e.g., such as the user <b>101</b>) of the online listing system using an extension generator module <b>140</b>. A particular extension generated by the extension generator module <b>140</b> may be visible in each listing visited by the user <b>101</b> in the online listing system (e.g., each property visited by the user <b>101</b> in an online listing system for property rentals). Similarly, the mask module <b>110</b> may determine a proxy telephone number (e.g., a substitute phone number to mask an actual telephone number) for each listing posted in the online listing system <b>109</b> (e.g., every property posted by a rental manager on the online listing system).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">When the user <b>101</b> calls in connection with a particular listing, the mask module <b>110</b> may determine an identity of the user <b>101</b> dialing the proxy telephone number (e.g., by consulting a mask table <b>114</b>) based on an extension number entered by the user <b>101</b> (e.g., an extension number previously generated by an extension generator module <b>140</b> connected to the mask module <b>110</b>). Based on this identity determination, the mask module <b>110</b> may update data in the storage <b>134</b> associated with the billing module <b>108</b> (e.g., to track a particular call and later bill the lister <b>104</b> and/or the user <b>101</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The mask module <b>110</b> may consult a mask table <b>114</b> of the mask database <b>116</b> (e.g., the mask database <b>116</b> may be stored in the storage <b>134</b> and/or external to the transaction center server <b>112</b> in various embodiments). In addition, the mask module <b>110</b> may communicate with the mask removal module <b>106</b> and permit the mask removal module <b>106</b> to convert the proxy telephone number to an actual telephone number of the lister <b>104</b> and route a call from the user <b>101</b> to the lister <b>104</b>. The mask removal module <b>106</b> may then route the proxy telephone number to the lister <b>104</b> from the user <b>101</b> after the conversion is made according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A detailed view of the mask table <b>114</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> The mask table <b>114</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes a user-side data <b>400</b> (e.g., the user illustrated having a unique extension <b>1511</b>) and a lister-side data <b>402</b> (e.g., the lister illustrated as having a unique phone number 800-555-2100). The user-side data <b>400</b> includes actual user data <b>404</b> (e.g., actual phone numbers, email, and other information about a user such as the user <b>101</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and masked user data <b>406</b> (e.g., masked/proxy phone numbers, email, and other information about a user such as the user <b>101</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The masked user data <b>406</b> may be generated by the mask module <b>110</b> according to one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the lister-side data <b>402</b> includes actual lister data <b>408</b> (e.g., actual phone numbers, email, and other information about a lister such as the lister <b>104</b>), and a masked lister data <b>410</b> (e.g., masked/proxy phone numbers, email, and other information about a lister such as the lister <b>104</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The masked lister data <b>410</b> may also be generated by the mask module <b>110</b> according to one embodiment. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the mask table <b>114</b> may be used by the mask module <b>110</b> to convert actual contact information associated with the user <b>101</b> to masked information and/or vice-versa. In addition, mask table <b>114</b> may be used by the mask removal module <b>106</b> to convert a proxy telephone number associated with the lister <b>104</b> to an actual telephone number of the lister <b>104</b> and vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, the mask removal module <b>106</b> (e.g., may be in a circuit switched telephone network and/or in an IP network such as the Internet <b>102</b>) may reference the mask table <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to convert the proxy telephone number (e.g., as previously generated by the mask module <b>110</b>) of the lister <b>104</b> to an actual telephone number of the lister <b>104</b> based on a phone number entered. In addition, the mask removal module <b>106</b> may reference the mask table <b>114</b> to identify a particular user based on a code (e.g., an extension) entered by the lister <b>104</b> wishing to contact the user <b>101</b> via telephone according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the online listing system <b>109</b> may identify a lister response (e.g., a rental manager following up on a lead received through the online listing system) to the user <b>101</b> (e.g., a user of the online listing system such as a potential renter of an apartment) based on a code (e.g., the code may be an extension entered after dialing a masked user telephone number such as a proxy telephone number) entered by the lister <b>104</b> after dialing a proxy telephone number (e.g., a &#x2018;masked&#x2019; telephone number generated by the mask module <b>110</b> and substituting for the actual telephone number of the user <b>101</b>), according to an embodiment. In addition, the billing module <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may capture response history information when routing the proxy telephone number to the user <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some example embodiments, a timer module <b>113</b> (e.g., code executed by the processor <b>132</b> of the transaction center server <b>112</b>) may determine how long the lister <b>104</b> of the online listing system took to respond to an inquiry from the user <b>101</b>. The online listing system <b>109</b> may also record one or more telephone calls between the user <b>101</b> and the lister <b>104</b> based on a contract (e.g., a binding agreement) between the user <b>101</b> and the lister <b>104</b> with a proprietor of the online listing system (e.g., the online listing system <b>109</b>). The lister may be a rent manager, a landlord, a mortgage broker, or a merchant, according to various embodiments. In addition, the transaction center server <b>112</b> may provide to the billing module <b>108</b> a periodic log of telephone numbers dialed between users of the online listing system such as the user <b>101</b> and, other users of the online listing system <b>109</b> and the lister <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some example embodiments, a proxy telephone number generated by the mask module <b>110</b> is unique to a particular listing (e.g., a particular item or service offered for sale and/or lease) requested by the user <b>101</b>, and the extension number (e.g., a telephone extension number) is unique to the user <b>101</b>. The transaction center server <b>112</b> may send to the user <b>101</b> additional information about the particular listing based on the duration (e.g., amount of time) of the routed call. Every listing in the online listing system <b>109</b> may be associated with an item detail page (e.g., detailed information about a property for lease and/or sale) in the online listing system <b>109</b>. The user <b>101</b> may contact the lister <b>104</b> through the proxy telephone number and/or a website lead form on the item detail page.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The billing module <b>108</b> may validate a transaction (e.g., a successful lease and/or sale) between the user <b>101</b> and the lister <b>104</b> based on the call history information and/or the website lead form. The billing module <b>108</b> may validate the transaction by automatically scanning (e.g., through an optical character recognition method) the call history information and/or the web site lead form to determine whether a binding contract was formed between the parties (e.g., offer, acceptance, consideration). In some example embodiments, the billing module <b>108</b> may determine that there is more likely than not a binding contract formed between the parties, and on that basis an automatic signal is transmitted from the billing module <b>108</b> to an administrator of the online listing system <b>109</b> to follow up with the parties via telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The billing module <b>108</b> may also generate a justification to a bill (e.g., a transaction based charge) to at least one of the user and the lister based on any one or more of the call history information and/or the website lead form. In addition, the transaction center server <b>112</b> may convert an actual email address of the user <b>101</b> entered in the website lead form to a proxy email address, and transmit the proxy email address to the lister <b>104</b>. Furthermore, the mask module <b>110</b> of the transaction center server <b>112</b> may receive a call of the user <b>101</b> from multiple geographic sites (e.g., from the user's office and/or home location) prior to determining the identity of the user <b>101</b> dialing the proxy telephone number based on the extension number entered by the user <b>101</b>. In addition, the transaction center server <b>112</b> may generate the extension based on a logic algorithm having a checksum; and bill the lister (e.g., through the billing module <b>108</b>) according to the number of leads (e.g., phone calls or emails) received from one or more potential renters. More detailed explanation about the online listing system <b>109</b> is given below using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of functional units of the online listing system <b>200</b> in accordance with an example embodiment. Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is the online listing system <b>109</b>. The online listing system <b>109</b> comprises the billing module <b>108</b>, the transaction center server <b>112</b>, the mask module <b>110</b> and the mask removal module <b>106</b>. In some example embodiments, the mask removal module <b>106</b> may exist outside the online listing system <b>109</b> (e.g., in a circuit switched telephone network and/or in an IP network such as the Internet <b>102</b>). These modules are operatively coupled to one another. The billing module <b>108</b> may run a billing engine <b>230</b>. The transaction center server <b>112</b> may run a plurality of functional engines such as a setting engine <b>210</b>, a receiving engine <b>220</b>, a notifying engine <b>240</b>, a capturing engine <b>250</b> and a consolidating engine <b>270</b>, etc. Although the billing module <b>108</b> is shown as a separate module from the transaction center server <b>112</b>, the two modules may be implemented as a single module in some example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">If one or more listers <b>104</b> list their property listings on the online listing system <b>109</b>, the setting engine <b>210</b> may set a specified listing period for a respective lister. In some example embodiments, the listing period may be specified for each listing for the respective lister. The specified listing period may indicate how long the lister wants his property listings to be listed in the online listing system <b>109</b> under a current billing mechanism that is explained more in detail below. In other words, when the specified listing period ends, a different billing mechanism may be applied to the listings associated with the lister. An example of the different billing mechanism is described in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/346,754. In some example embodiments, the setting engine <b>210</b> may further consider the number of listings (e.g., the number of units listed in the online listing system <b>109</b>) to choose a billing mechanism to be used to the listings for the respective lister. In some example embodiments, if the listing period ends, the online listing system <b>109</b> may simply inactivate the listings associated with the lister.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The setting engine <b>210</b> may determine the specified listing period based upon designation (e.g., instruction) sent) from the lister. For example, the lister may designate three months as maximum period for the current billing mechanism to be applied. In some example embodiments, the setting engine <b>210</b> may display a plurality of predefined time periods (e.g., a week, a month and a year, etc.) and then receive a selection thereof from the lister via a user interface (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In some example embodiments, the setting engine <b>210</b> may additionally refer to previous transaction history for the lister to determine whether he is eligible for a reduced fee per lead or a bonus listing period at no extra charge. The online listing system <b>109</b> may be operatively coupled to a transaction database <b>260</b> to store the transaction history between the potential renters and the listers. In some example embodiments, the transaction database <b>260</b> may be the mask database <b>116</b>. In some example embodiments, the transaction database <b>260</b> may be coupled to the online listing system <b>109</b> remotely, for example, via the Internet <b>102</b>. Other suitable network, such as a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), may be used to couple the transaction database <b>260</b> to the online listing system <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some example embodiments, the setting engine <b>210</b> may change the specified listing period for the lister upon receipt of a request from the lister. For example, if the lister's budget for listing his properties is reduced for some reasons, then he may want to change the listing period accordingly and vice versa. Also, if the listed property is not available for rent any more (e.g., rented throughout other advertizing sources or the property owner or manager's decision not to rent, etc.), then the lister may need to stop listing the property in the online listing system <b>109</b>. In such cases, the setting engine <b>210</b> may receive the lister's request, for example, via the Internet <b>102</b> or a telephone network, and change the listing period according to the lister's request. In some example embodiments, the setting engine <b>210</b> may receive a valid identifier from the lister to verify his identification. The valid identifier may include the lister's financial information, such as credit card or bank account information.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once one or more properties are listed, one or more potential renters may access the online listing system <b>109</b> via the Internet <b>102</b> and search the listings. If a property listing matching their search preferences is found, the potential renters may try to contact corresponding listers using, for example, proxy contact information generated by the mask module <b>110</b> as described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In some example embodiments, the potential renters may send the corresponding listers leads in a form of a telephone call or email based upon the proxy contact information. The receiving engine <b>220</b> may check whether the listing period for the respective lister has not expired. If the listing period has not expired, then the receiving engine <b>220</b> may receive a number of leads sent by the potential renters and directed to a property listing associated with the corresponding listers. In some embodiments, the listing period may be checked by the billing engine <b>230</b> before counting leads received from the potential renters. The billing engine <b>230</b> will be explained in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The receiving engine <b>220</b> may also notify the lister of a receipt of the leads. In notifying the lister, the receiving engine <b>220</b> may indicate remaining listing period to the lister. Also, if the remaining listing period reaches one of specified threshold time point, the receiving engine <b>220</b> may send a message requesting an extension of the listing period to the lister. The receiving engine <b>220</b> may further represent the message in a different representation (e.g., different coloring or using different text size, etc.) according to a corresponding predefined threshold time point. For example, when the listing period for the lister is 90 days, if 85 days have passed so far, then the extension request message may be represented in a red color and/or large font size (e.g., size 14) while represented in a yellow color and/or normal font size (e.g., size 10) if 80 days have passed. In some example embodiments, the online listing transaction system <b>109</b> may run a notifying engine <b>240</b> separate from the receiving engine <b>220</b> for such notification purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When potential renters send leads (e.g., contacts in a form of a phone call or email) to listers and the listers respond to the leads, corresponding transaction history may be captured by the transaction center server <b>112</b> using, for example, the mask module <b>110</b> and the mask removal module <b>106</b>. More detailed explanation about capturing communication information between the potential renters and the listers are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/158,916. In some example embodiments, the transaction center server <b>112</b> may have a separate capturing engine <b>250</b> operatively coupled with the receiving engine <b>220</b> and the notifying engine <b>240</b>, to capture and manage the communication information between the potential renters and the listers.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">If the transaction history (e.g., sending and receiving leads) between the potential renters and the listers are captured by the transaction center server <b>112</b> (e.g., by the capturing engine <b>250</b>), the consolidating engine <b>270</b> may consolidate two or more of the leads received from the same potential renter into a lead group. The consolidating engine <b>270</b> may further associate a lead group identifier with the lead group and then present the lead group identifier to the lister. In some example embodiments, once consolidated, the consolidated group information may also be managed by the capturing engine <b>250</b> along with non-consolidated transaction history between the potential renters and the listers. In such a case, the billing module <b>108</b> may access the capturing engine <b>250</b> and/or the consolidating engine <b>270</b> to get the transaction information as necessary to bill the listers later (e.g., the total number of leads sent to each lister and the number of leads for the lister after consolidating, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When transactions between the potential renters and the listers (e.g., sending and responding to leads, etc.) are done, the billing engine <b>230</b> may bill each lister according to the number of leads received from the potential renters. In some example embodiments, the billing engine <b>230</b> may bill the respective lister for each listing associated with him. In billing the lister, the billing engine <b>230</b> may count the lead group as a single lead. In some example embodiments, the billing engine <b>230</b> may conduct the billing process on a basis of a specified periodic time. For example, the listers may be billed every day, week, month or year, etc. Also, the billing engine <b>230</b> may change the specified periodic time (e.g., week) to another specified periodic time (e.g., month) and vice versa as necessary (e.g., upon receipt of a corresponding request by the lister). In some example embodiments, the online listing system <b>109</b> may further set a specified listing period for a given property listing. In such a case, the billing engine <b>230</b> may check whether the listing period has expired before counting leads received from the potential renters.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When billing a lister, the billing engine <b>230</b> may also inactivate property listings associated with the lister. In some example embodiments, the billing engine may inactivate the property listings associated with the lister upon receipt of an inactivation request from the lister. For example, the lister may want to stop listing his properties on the online listing system <b>109</b> for some reasons. In such a case, the lister may send such a request to the online listing system <b>109</b> by simply pressing an &#x201c;Inactivation&#x201d; menu via the user interface (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In some example embodiments, the billing engine <b>230</b> may inactivate the property listings associated with the lister if the specified listing period has passed. In some example embodiments, if one or more property listings are inactivated, the billing engine <b>230</b> may further reactivate the inactivated property listings upon receipt of a corresponding indication from the lister. In such a case, the billing engine <b>230</b> may require the lister to deposit a predefined budget before allowing the reactivation request.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some example embodiments, a lead cap may be further set for the respective lister by the transaction center server <b>112</b> (e.g., by the receiving engine <b>220</b>). In such a case, the billing engine <b>230</b> may inactivate the property listing associated with the lister if the number of leads received from the potential renters reaches the lead cap. More detailed explanation about using the lead cap is described in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/346,754. In some example embodiments, the billing engine <b>230</b> may charge the lister only for the first lead received from each potential renter.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some example embodiments, the transaction center server <b>112</b> may not specify the listing period or the lead cap for the respective lister at all. The transaction center server <b>112</b> may then comprise the receiving engine <b>220</b>, the capturing engine <b>250</b> and the billing engine <b>230</b>. The receiving engine <b>220</b> may not check whether the listing period (and/or the lead cap) has been reached before receiving the lead sent from the potential renters and directed to the respective listers. In such a case, the online listing system <b>109</b> may list the listings and bill the respective listser under a given billing mechanism until it receives, for example, an inactivation request from the lister. It is noted that each of the engines described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be implemented by hardware (e.g., circuit), firmware, software or any combinations thereof. It is also noted that although each of the engines is described above as a separate module, the entire engines or some of the engines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be implemented as a single entity (e.g., module or circuit) and still maintain the same functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method used to bill a lister according to the number of leads received from potential renters <b>300</b> in accordance with an example embodiment. At operation <b>310</b>, a listing period may be set for a respective lister. In some example embodiments, the listing period may be specified for each listing for the respective lister. In some example embodiments, the listing period may be based upon designation (e.g., instruction) of an initial maximum period of listing received from the lister. In some example embodiments, the listing period may be changed upon receipt of a request from the lister. In some example embodiments, in setting the listing period for the respective lister, a valid user identifier may be received from the lister. The valid user identifier may include financial information (e.g., credit card information or bank account information, etc.) of the lister. In some example embodiments, in setting the listing period, the lister's previous transaction history may be used to determine whether the lister is eligible for a reduced fee per lead or free bonus period for listing.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At operation <b>320</b>, a number of leads may be received from one or more potential renters if the listing period has not expired. Each lead may be directed to a property listing associated with the lister. In some example embodiments, the receipt of the leads from the potential renters may be notified to the lister whose property listings the leads are directed to. In some example embodiments, the number of remaining listing period may be indicated to the lister in a notification to the lister. In some example embodiments, a message requesting an extension of the listing period may be sent to the lister along with the indication if the remaining listing period passes one of specified threshold time points (e.g., 80 or 90 days out of 100-day listing period). In some example embodiments, the message requesting an extension of the listing period may be represented in a different representation (e.g., different coloring or font size) according to a corresponding predefined threshold time point. For example, when the listing period for the lister is 100 days, if 90 days have passed so far, then the extension request message may be represented in a red color and/or large font size (e.g., size 14) while represented in a yellow color and/or normal font size (e.g., size 10) if 80 days have passed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At operation <b>330</b>, two or more of the leads received from the same potential renter may be consolidated into a lead group. The lead group may be further associated with a lead group identifier and then presented to the lister, for example, via the user interface of the lister. In some example embodiments, once consolidated, the consolidated group information may also be managed (e.g., by the capturing engine <b>250</b> and/or the consolidating engine <b>270</b>) along with non-consolidated transaction history between the potential renters and the listers. In such a case, the transaction information may be accessed (e.g., by the billing module <b>108</b> at the capturing engine <b>250</b> and/or the consolidating engine <b>270</b>) and used as necessary to bill the listers later. For example, the total number of leads sent to each lister and/or the number of lead groups may be referred to.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At operation <b>340</b>, the respective lister may be billed according to the number of leads received from the potential renters. In billing the lister, the consolidated lead group may be counted as a single lead. In some example embodiments, the billing may be done for each listing of the respective lister. In some example embodiments, the billing occurs on a basis of a specified periodic time (e.g., every week, month or year, etc.). The specified periodic time may be changed from one (e.g., week) to another (e.g., month), for example, upon receipt of a corresponding request from the lister. In some example embodiments, in billing the lister, the property listing associated with the lister may be inactivated upon receipt of an inactivation request from the lister. In some example embodiments, the property listing associated with the lister may be inactivated if the listing period has passed. In some example embodiments, if one or more property listings for the lister are inactivated, the inactivated property listing may be reactivated, for example, upon receipt of an indication from the lister that an extended listing period is designated. In such a case, the lister may be requested to deposit a predefined budget before allowed to reactivate the inactivated listings.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the listing period and/or the lead cap for the respective lister may not be specified. Then, it may not be checked whether the listing period (and/or the lead cap) has passed before the leads sent from the potential renters and directed to the respective listers are received. In such a case, the listings may be listed until, for example, an inactivation request is received from the lister. The lister may then be billed under a given billing mechanism until the inactivation of the listing.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some example embodiments, a lead cap may be further set for the respective lister by the transaction center server <b>112</b> (e.g., by the receiving engine <b>220</b>). In such a case, the property listing associated with the lister may be inactivated if the number of leads received from the potential renters reaches the lead cap. More detailed explanation about using the lead cap is described in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/346,754.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Example Database</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Some example embodiments may include the various databases (e.g., the mask database <b>116</b> and the transaction database <b>260</b>) being relational databases or in some example cases On Line Analytic Processing (OLAP)-based databases. In the case of relational databases, various tables (e.g., mask table <b>114</b>) of data are created and data is inserted into, and/or selected from, these tables using SQL or some other database-query language known in the art. In the case of OLAP databases, one or more multi-dimensional cubes or hypercubes containing multidimensional data from which data is selected or into which data is inserted using Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) may be implemented. In the case of a database using tables and SQL, a database application such as, for example, MYSQL&#x2122;, SQLSERVER&#x2122;, Oracle 8I&#x2122;, 10G&#x2122;, or some other suitable database application may be used to manage the data. Here, the case of a database using cubes and MDX, a database using Multidimensional On Line Analytic Processing (MOLAP), Relational On Line Analytic Processing (ROLAP), Hybrid On Line Analytic Processing (HOLAP), or some other suitable database application may be used to manage the data. These tables or cubes made up of tables, in the case of, for example, ROLAP, are organized into a RDS or Object Relational Data Schema (ORDS), as is known in the art. These schemas may be normalized using certain normalization algorithms so as to avoid abnormalities such as non-additive joins and other problems. Additionally, these normalization algorithms may include Boyce-Codd Normal Form or some other normalization, optimization algorithm known in the art.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">A Three-Tier Architecture</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some example embodiments, a method is illustrated as implemented in a distributed or non-distributed software application designed under a three-tier architecture paradigm, whereby the various components of computer code that implement this method may be categorized as belonging to one or more of these three tiers. Some example embodiments may include a first tier as an interface (e.g., an interface tier) that is relatively free from application processing. Further, a second tier may be a logic tier that performs application processing in the form of logical/mathematical manipulations of data inputted through the interface level, and that communicates the results of these logical/mathematical manipulations to the interface tier and/or to a backend or storage tier. These logical/mathematical manipulations may relate to certain business rules or processes that govern the software application as a whole. A third storage tier may be a persistent storage medium or non-persistent storage medium. In some example cases, one or more of these tiers may be collapsed into another, resulting in a two-tier architecture, or even a one-tier architecture. For example, the interface and logic tiers may be consolidated, or the logic and storage tiers may be consolidated, as in the case of a software application with an embedded database. This three-tier architecture may be implemented using one technology, or, as may be discussed below, a variety of technologies. This three-tier architecture, and the technologies through which it is implemented, may be executed on two or more computer systems organized in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other suitable configuration. Further, these three tiers may be distributed between more than one computer system as various software components.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Component Design</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Some example embodiments may include the above illustrated tiers and the processes or operations that make them up, as one or more software components. Common to many of these components is the ability to generate, use, and manipulate data. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components may be implemented by a computer system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component-oriented or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), JavaBeans (JB), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), or other suitable technique. These components may be linked to other components via various Application Programming interfaces (APIs), and then compiled into one complete server, client, and/or peer software application. Further, these APIs may be able to communicate through various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Distributed Computing Components and Protocols</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls used to implement one or more of the above-illustrated components across a distributed programming environment as distributed computing components. For example, an interface component (e.g., an interface tier) may reside on a first computer system remotely located from a second computer system containing a logic component (e.g., a logic tier). These first and second computer systems may be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other suitable configuration. These various components may be written using the above-illustrated object-oriented programming techniques, and can be written in the same programming language or a different programming language. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various components to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, a component written in C++ may be able to communicate with another component written in the Java programming language using a distributed computing protocol such as a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), or some other suitable protocol. Some example embodiments may include the use of one or more of these protocols with the various protocols outlined in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">A System of Transmission Between a Server and Client</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Some example embodiments may use the OSI model or TCP/IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client or between peer computer systems is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three-tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also contains port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer, and the data transmitted over a network such as the Internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), or some other suitable network. In some example cases, &#x201c;Internet&#x201d; refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP/IP, and additionally Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Systems Network Architecture (SNA), or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology) or structures.</p>
