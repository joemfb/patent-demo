<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of communications, and, more particularly, to coaxial cables and associated methods for making the coaxial cables.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Coaxial cables are widely used to carry high frequency electrical signals. Coaxial cables enjoy a relatively high bandwidth, low signal losses, are mechanically robust, and are relatively low cost. A coaxial cable typically includes an elongate inner conductor, a tubular outer conductor, and dielectric separating the inner and outer conductors. For example, the dielectric may be a plastic foam material. An outer insulating jacket may also be applied to surround the outer conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One particularly advantageous use of coaxial cable is for connecting electronics at a cellular or wireless base station to an antenna mounted at the top of a nearby antenna tower. For example, the transmitter and receiver located in an equipment shelter may be coupled via coaxial cables to antennas carried by the antenna tower. A typical installation includes a relatively large diameter main coaxial cable extending between the equipment shelter and the top of the antenna tower to thereby reduce signal losses. For example, CommScope, Inc. of Hickory, N.C. offers its CellReach&#xae; coaxial cable for such applications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In larger diameter coaxial cables, which are commonly used in cellular communication as described above, the elongate inner conductor can be tubular in shape. The tubular inner conductor may also surround an inner dielectric material. The inner conductor is typically manufactured by forming a flat layer or sheet of conductive material into a tube with a longitudinal seam and welding the seam to form a continuous joint. The outer conductor is also similarly manufactured by forming a flat layer or metal sheet into a tube with a longitudinal seam that is welded to form a continuous joint.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The high frequency currents carried by the coaxial cable are concentrated in only a small portion, radially outermost, of the inner conductor, and a correspondingly small radially innermost portion of the outer conductor. This characteristic is attributed to the electromagnetic phenomenon called the skin effect. Therefore, only the thin outer radial portion of the tubular inner conductor carries the high frequency currents. Conversely, the outer tubular conductor also carries the high frequency currents in the thin radially innermost portion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Bimetallic layers have been used for the inner and/or outer tubular conductors in a coaxial cable where a higher conductivity and more expensive metal is used to provide the radially outermost portion of an inner conductor, and is used to provide the radially innermost portion of the outer conductor. For example, the outermost layer of the inner conductor may include a relatively costly and highly conductive metal such as copper, and the inner layer of the inner conductor may include a less costly and less conductive metal, such as aluminum. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,717,493 B2 to Chopra et al. and U.S. Patent Application No. 2004/0118591 A1 to Bufanda et al. each discloses a coaxial cable with such bimetallic tubular inner conductors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Notwithstanding the benefits of a bimetal tubular inner conductor, there may be some shortcomings. For example, the manufacture of a bimetal tubular inner conductor usually involves some form of heat based welding, such as for example, conventional induction welding, to weld the seam to form a welded joint. Unfortunately, the two metals that form the bimetal tubular inner conductor usually have different melting temperatures. For example, copper and aluminum are commonly used as the outer and inner layers of the inner conductor, respectively. Copper has a melting point of 1100&#xb0; C. and a conductivity of 59.6&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>S&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, while aluminum has a lower melting point of 660&#xb0; C. and a lower conductivity of 37.8&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>S&#xb7;m<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. This disparity in melting points makes welding of the joint relatively difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In response to this particular shortcoming in manufacture of bimetal tubular inner conductors, coaxial cable manufacturers have developed a coaxial cable with a bimetal tubular inner conductor comprising an inlaid bimetallic layer, such as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,342,677 to Lee. This coaxial cable is more easily welded since only the inner metal layer is welded during manufacture of the bimetal tubular inner conductor. Nonetheless, the inlaid bimetal inner conductor is relatively costly to manufacture. Of course, similar considerations apply to the outer conductor of a coaxial cable. That is, a conventional bimetallic layer may be difficult to weld, and an inlaid bimetallic layer may be relatively expensive.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In view of the foregoing background, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a coaxial cable including an inner conductor fabricated using a less expensive tubular bimetallic layer that is also readily welded at its longitudinal seam.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This and other object, features, and advantages in accordance with the present invention are provided by a method for making a coaxial cable that may include an inner conductor, an outer conductor, and a dielectric material layer therebetween. The method may include forming the inner conductor by at least forming a bimetallic strip into a tubular bimetallic layer having a pair of longitudinal edge portions at a longitudinal seam, for example. The bimetallic strip may include an inner metal layer and an outer metal layer bonded thereto and coextensive therewith. Each of the longitudinal edge portions may be folded over. The method may also include forming a welded joint between adjacent portions of the folded over longitudinal edge portions and defining surplus material at the welded joint, for example. The method may further include removing the surplus material at the welded joint, and forming the dielectric material layer surrounding the inner conductor. The method may also include forming the outer conductor surrounding the dielectric material layer. Accordingly, a less expensive starting material may be used for the inner conductor, that is, for example, a simple bimetallic strip where both layers are coextensive, as compared to the more expensive inlaid bimetallic strip.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The outer metal layer may have a greater electrical conductivity than the inner metal layer. The inner metal layer may have a lower, melting temperature than the outer metal layer. For example, the inner metal layer may include aluminum, and the outer metal layer may include copper. The welded joint may be formed by high-frequency (HF) welding, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method may also include shaping each of the longitudinal edge portions. Shaping each of the longitudinal edge portions may include flattening the longitudinal edge portions at an interface therebetween, for example. Shaping may also include compressing each longitudinal edge portion. Additionally, the surplus material at the welded joint may be removed by skiving.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The tubular bimetallic layer may have a thickness in a range of about 0.005 to 0.050 inches. The outer metal layer may have a percentage thickness relative to an overall thickness of the tubular bimetallic layer in a range of about 1 to 30%, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The method may further include forming another dielectric material layer filling the tubular bimetallic layer. The method may further include forming an insulating jacket surrounding the outer conductor, for example.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout, and prime notation is used to indicate similar elements in alternative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, a coaxial cable <b>21</b> in accordance with the present invention is described. The coaxial cable <b>21</b> illustratively includes an inner conductor <b>23</b>, an outer conductor <b>25</b>, and a dielectric material layer <b>24</b> between the inner and outer conductors. The inner conductor <b>23</b> illustratively includes a tubular bimetallic layer <b>33</b> having a pair of opposing longitudinal edge portions at a longitudinal seam <b>27</b>. The tubular bimetallic layer <b>33</b> illustratively includes an inner metal layer <b>32</b> and an outer metal layer <b>31</b> bonded thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The tubular bimetallic layer <b>33</b> illustratively includes one of the opposing longitudinal edge portions comprising an end portion <b>61</b> of the inner metal layer <b>32</b> extending outwardly beyond the outer metal layer <b>31</b> and being folded over onto itself adjacent the outer metal layer and defining a non-joined interface <b>34</b> therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The outer metal layer <b>31</b> may have a higher electrical conductivity than the inner metal layer <b>32</b> to facilitate signal carrying ability at the skin depth, for example. The inner metal layer <b>32</b> may have a lower melting temperature and a lower cost than the outer metal layer <b>31</b>. The lower melting temperature of the inner metal layer <b>32</b> facilitates welding, for example. The inner metal layer <b>32</b> may comprise aluminum or any suitable metal as appreciated by a person skilled in the art, and the outer metal layer <b>31</b> may comprise copper or any suitable metal as appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The tubular bimetallic layer <b>33</b> may have a thickness in a range of about 0.005 to 0.050 inches, and the outer metal layer <b>31</b> may have a percentage thickness relative to an overall thickness of the tubular bimetallic layer <b>33</b> in a range of about 1 to 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown perhaps best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the longitudinal seam <b>27</b> illustratively includes a welded joint <b>63</b> between at least portions of the inner metal layer <b>32</b>. The coaxial cable <b>21</b> illustratively comprises another dielectric material layer <b>22</b> filling the tubular bimetallic layer <b>33</b> and an insulating jacket <b>26</b> surrounding the outer conductor <b>25</b>. Of course, welding may cause at least some portion of the non-joined interface <b>34</b> to become joined as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>, another embodiment is now described. In this embodiment of the coaxial cable <b>21</b>&#x2032;, those elements already discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> are given prime notation and most require no further discussion herein. This embodiment differs from the previous embodiment in that both of the opposing longitudinal edge portions illustratively include end portions <b>61</b>&#x2032;, <b>62</b>&#x2032; of the inner metal layer <b>32</b>&#x2032; extending outwardly beyond the outer metal layer <b>31</b>&#x2032; and being folded over onto themselves adjacent the outer metal layer and defining non-joined interfaces <b>34</b>&#x2032;, <b>54</b>&#x2032; therewith. Of course, welding may cause at least some portions of the non-joined interfaces <b>34</b>&#x2032;, <b>54</b>&#x2032; to become joined as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref>, another embodiment is now described. In this embodiment of the coaxial cable <b>21</b>&#x2033;, those elements already discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> are given double prime notation and most require no further discussion herein. This embodiment differs from the previous embodiment in that the opposing longitudinal edge portions illustratively include one end portion <b>61</b>&#x2033; of the inner metal layer <b>32</b>&#x2033; extending outwardly beyond the outer metal layer <b>31</b>&#x2033; and being folded at a right angle adjacent the outer metal layer and defining a non-joined interface <b>34</b>&#x2033; therewith. After welding, as shown perhaps best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a welded joint <b>63</b>&#x2033; is formed between the adjacent portions of the inner metal layer <b>32</b>&#x2033;.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9</figref>, another embodiment is now described. In this embodiment of the coaxial cable <b>21</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;, those elements already discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-7</figref> are given triple prime notation and most require no further discussion herein.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, another aspect relates to a method and associated apparatus <b>200</b> for making a coaxial cable <b>21</b> that may comprise the inner conductor <b>23</b> including tubular bimetallic layer <b>33</b>, outer conductor <b>25</b>, and dielectric material layer <b>24</b> therebetween. A dielectric material rod <b>212</b> and a supply reel <b>201</b> of the bimetallic strip with a pair of longitudinal edge portions are provided. The bimetallic strip may comprise an inner metal layer and an outer metal layer bonded thereto. The supply reel <b>201</b> of the bimetallic strip may be provided with at least one of the longitudinal edge portions with an end portion of the inner metal layer extending outwardly beyond the outer metal layer. Further, the supply reel <b>201</b> of the bimetallic strip may also be provided comprising the end portion folded over onto itself adjacent the outer metal layer and defining a non-joined interface therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the alternative, the supply reel <b>201</b> of the bimetallic strip may be fed into a trimmer/folder <b>202</b>, shown with dashed lines, which illustratively trims at least one of the longitudinal edge portions to provide an end portion of the inner metal layer extending outwardly beyond the outer metal layer. The trimmer/folder <b>202</b> may trim the metal layer using a diamond or other blade, or any other trimming techniques as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Further, the trimmer/folder <b>202</b> illustratively folds the end portion over onto itself adjacent the outer metal layer and defining a non-joined interface therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further and as discussed above, the outer metal layer may have a higher electrical conductivity than the inner metal layer. The inner metal layer may have a lower melting temperature than the outer metal layer. The inner metal layer may comprise aluminum or any suitable metal as appreciated by a person skilled in the art, and the outer metal layer may comprise copper or any suitable metal as appreciated by a person skilled in the art. The tubular bimetallic layer may have a thickness in a range of about 0.005 to 0.050 inches, and the outer metal layer may have a percentage thickness relative to an overall thickness of the tubular bimetallic layer in a range of about 1 to 30%.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The dielectric material rod <b>212</b> and the supply reel <b>201</b> of the bimetallic strip are fed into the tube former <b>203</b>, which illustratively forms the bimetallic strip into a tubular bimetallic layer having a pair of opposing longitudinal edge portions at a longitudinal seam to provide the inner conductor comprising a tubular bimetallic layer.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the dielectric material may be disposed inside the inner tube downstream from the tube former <b>203</b>, or thereafter using settable material as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,915,564. The output of the tube former <b>203</b> is then fed into the induction welder <b>204</b>, which illustratively welds the longitudinal seam to form a welded joint between at least portions of the inner metal layer. The output of the induction welder <b>204</b> is then fed into the dielectric extruder <b>205</b>, which illustratively forms the dielectric material layer surrounding the inner conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The output of the dielectric extruder <b>205</b> is then fed along with a supply reel <b>207</b> of the metallic strip into a second tube former <b>206</b>, which illustratively forms the outer conductor surrounding the dielectric material layer.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The output of the second tube former <b>206</b> is fed into a second induction welder <b>209</b>, which illustratively welds the outer conductor. The output of the second induction welder <b>209</b> is fed into the jacket extruder <b>210</b>, which forms an insulating jacket surrounding the outer conductor. The completed coaxial cable <b>21</b> is output from the jacket extruder <b>210</b> for take-up by a suitable take-up reel, not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other embodiments, the supply reel <b>201</b> of the bimetallic strip may be provided with at least one of the longitudinal edge portions with an end portion of the inner metal layer extending outwardly beyond the outer metal layer. Further, the supply reel <b>201</b> of the bimetallic strip may be provided comprising the end portion folded at a right angle adjacent the outer metal layer and defining a non-joined interface therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-21</figref> with reference to flow chart <b>300</b>, another aspect is related to a method for making a coaxial cable <b>121</b> that may include an inner conductor <b>123</b>, an outer conductor <b>125</b> and a dielectric material layer <b>124</b> therebetween. Starting at Block <b>302</b>, the method includes forming the inner conductor <b>123</b> by at least forming a bimetallic strip into a tubular bimetallic layer <b>133</b> having a pair of longitudinal edge portions <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> at a longitudinal seam <b>127</b>. The tubular bimetallic strip includes an inner metal layer <b>132</b> and an outer metal layer <b>131</b> that is bonded to the inner metal layer and coextensive therewith. The coextensive inner and outer metal layers <b>132</b>, <b>131</b> advantageously overcome shortcomings of a copper-inlay material, as the coextensive bimetallic strip is more readily available and has a reduced cost as compared to the copper inlay. Additionally, while the coaxial cable <b>121</b> includes smooth-well inner and outer conductors <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the inner and outer conductors may be corrugated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Illustratively, each of the longitudinal edge portions <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> is folded over (Block <b>304</b>). Each of the folded longitudinal edge portions <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> may be shaped, for example, compressed by progressive roll forming. For example, flat rolls <b>171</b>, may be used around the folded longitudinal edge portions <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> to form a bend of about 180 degrees, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> (Block <b>306</b>). Each of the longitudinal edge portions <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> may also be flattened by flat rolls <b>171</b> at an interface therebetween to further define each folded longitudinal edge portion, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for example, opposing folded longitudinal edge portions <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> may be rounded from the folding over. Each of the folded longitudinal edge portions <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> may be shaped by skiving (Block <b>308</b>) opposing ends of each of the longitudinal edge portions, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. Skiving each folded longitudinal edge portion <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> advantageously may flatten, by removing rounded portions of each opposing folded longitudinal edge portion, as illustrated perhaps best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Skiving may be performed using a diamond, carbide, or ceramic knife <b>172</b>, for example, and may be performed water-cooled or dry. Other skiving methods may be performed, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated, perhaps best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a welded joint <b>163</b> is formed (Block <b>310</b>) between adjacent portions of the folded over longitudinal edge portions <b>161</b>, <b>162</b>. The welded joint <b>163</b> may be formed by a high frequency weld, or other suitable welding technique, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The welded joint <b>163</b> and the folded over longitudinal edge portions <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> define surplus material <b>164</b> at the welded joint. The surplus material <b>164</b> is removed at the welded joint <b>163</b>. The surplus material <b>164</b> may be lifted by separation rolls <b>171</b> (Block <b>312</b>) and removed by a skiving knife (Block <b>314</b>) or a scarf knife, for example, as illustrated more particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Other surplus material <b>164</b> removal tools may be used, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After the surplus material <b>164</b> is removed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the inner metal layer <b>132</b> is exposed at the weld joint <b>163</b>. The amount of exposure of the inner metal layer <b>132</b> is controllable, and may be no wider than twice the thickness of the original bimetallic strip. However, other widths of inner metal layer <b>132</b> exposure may be contemplated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The method further includes forming the dielectric material layer <b>124</b> (Block <b>316</b>) surrounding the inner conductor <b>123</b>. The method also includes forming the outer conductor <b>125</b> (Block <b>318</b>) surrounding the dielectric material layer <b>124</b>. Another dielectric material layer <b>122</b> may be formed (Block <b>320</b>) filling the tubular bimetallic layer <b>133</b>. Also, an insulating jacket <b>126</b> surrounding the outer conductor <b>125</b> may be formed at Block <b>322</b> before finishing at Block <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further and as discussed above, the outer metal layer <b>131</b> may have a higher electrical conductivity than the inner metal layer <b>132</b>. The inner metal layer <b>131</b> may have a lower melting temperature than the outer metal layer <b>131</b>. The inner metal layer <b>132</b> may comprise aluminum or any suitable metal as appreciated by a person skilled in the art, and the outer metal layer <b>131</b> may comprise copper or any suitable metal as appreciated by a person skilled in the art. The tubular bimetallic layer <b>133</b> may have a thickness in a range of about 0.005 to 0.050 inches; and the outer metal layer <b>131</b> may have a percentage thickness relative to an overall thickness of the tubular bimetallic layer in a range of about 1 to 30%.</p>
