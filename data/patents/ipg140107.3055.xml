<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to housing manufacturing, particularly to a device housing having an improved seal and a method for manufacturing the device housing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many portable electronic devices includes a transparent panel assembled in a housing. When the housing is made of metal, the transparent panel is usually adhered to the metal housing. A cushion may be positioned around the transparent panel to protect the transparent panel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, it can be difficult to tightly bond the cushion to the metal housing. Thus, water, gas, or dust easily enters the housing through any clearances between the cushion and the metal housing. Additionally, the cushion is often manually positioned on the housing during manufacture, via application of viscose glue to the cushion followed by direct attachment thereof to the housing. Such process can reduce processing efficiency and increase production times and is prone to human error.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is room for improvement within the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, a housing <b>10</b> of a portable electronic device includes a transparent panel <b>20</b> and a metal housing body <b>40</b>. A filler <b>30</b> is molded between the transparent panel <b>20</b> and the metal housing body <b>40</b> for sealing the housing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The transparent panel <b>20</b> is configured for being received in the metal housing body <b>40</b>. The transparent panel <b>20</b> may be made of glass or plastic (e.g., acrylonitrile butadiene styrene(ABS)). The metal housing body <b>40</b> is substantially a metal frame, and includes a main body <b>41</b> and a flange portion <b>42</b> substantially perpendicularly extending from the main body <b>41</b>. In this embodiment, the metal housing body <b>40</b> is made of stainless steel, and may be formed by stamping or punching from a metal sheet. A clearance between the metal housing body <b>40</b> and the transparent panel <b>20</b> is in a range of about 0.4 mm to about 0.8 mm. In this embodiment, the clearance is 0.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The filler <b>30</b> is formed between the transparent panel <b>20</b> and the metal housing body <b>40</b> by injection molding. The filler <b>30</b> includes a first connecting portion <b>31</b>, a second connecting portion <b>33</b>, and a support portion <b>32</b> extending from the inside of the filler <b>30</b>. The first connecting portion <b>31</b> is narrower than the second connecting portion <b>33</b>, and is molded between the flange portion <b>42</b> and the panel <b>20</b>. The second connecting portion <b>33</b> is bonded to the main body <b>41</b>. The support portion <b>32</b> is bonded to the underside of the transparent panel <b>20</b>. The filler <b>30</b> can be formed by injection molding a moldable material. The moldable material can be any of polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). When the transparent panel <b>20</b> is made of plastic, the chosen material of the filler is different from the transparent panel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The transparent panel <b>20</b> is connected to the metal housing body <b>40</b> with the filler <b>30</b> for improving the sealing effect. Additionally, the support portion <b>33</b> supports the transparent panel <b>20</b>. This design can keep the transparent panel <b>20</b> secure and stably positioned on the housing body <b>40</b> for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A method for manufacturing the housing <b>10</b> is described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An injection mold is provided. The metal housing body <b>40</b> is positioned in a die chamber of the injection mold. The transparent panel <b>20</b> is received in the housing body <b>40</b>. The top surface of the transparent panel <b>20</b> is coplanar with the flange portion <b>42</b> of the housing body <b>40</b>. Molten material is injected into a clearance between the transparent panel <b>20</b> and the housing body <b>40</b> to form the filler <b>30</b> including the support portion <b>32</b>. After the injection molding process, the transparent panel <b>20</b> is tightly bonded with the metal housing body <b>40</b> to form the housing <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The transparent panel <b>20</b> and the housing body <b>40</b> are integrally formed together by the above method. The method for manufacturing the device housing <b>10</b> by injection molding increases processing efficiency and reduces production time. Additionally, the transparent panel <b>20</b> is stably positioned on the housing body <b>40</b> and has a good seal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is to be understood, however, that even through numerous characteristics and advantages of the present disclosure have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structure and function of the disclosure, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the disclosure to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms in which the appended claims are expressed.</p>
