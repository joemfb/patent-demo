<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a light emitting diode, more particularly to a light emitting diode with an optical adhesive present between an epitaxial film and a permanent substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional vertically structured light emitting diode (LED) <b>1</b> includes a permanent substrate <b>11</b>, an epitaxial film <b>12</b> disposed on the permanent substrate <b>11</b> and generating light when electricity is supplied, and a top electrode <b>14</b> disposed on the epitaxial film <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The permanent substrate <b>11</b> is electrically conductive and the electricity may be supplied to the epitaxial film by virtue of electrical connection between the permanent substrate <b>11</b> and the top electrode <b>14</b>. The permanent substrate <b>11</b> includes a base plate <b>111</b> and a reflective film <b>112</b> formed between the base plate <b>111</b> and the epitaxial film <b>12</b> for reflecting light.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The epitaxial film <b>12</b> is formed by growing epitaxially a gallium nitride series semiconductor material on an epitaxial substrate (not shown), and then is transferred to so as to be in ohmic contact with the permanent substrate <b>11</b> using a temporary substrate (not shown). The epitaxial film <b>12</b> includes p-doped and n-doped cladding layers <b>121</b>,<b>122</b>, and an active layer <b>123</b> that is formed between the p-doped and n-doped cladding layers <b>121</b>,<b>122</b>. A band gap exists between the p-doped and n-doped cladding layers <b>121</b>,<b>122</b>. When electricity is supplied to the epitaxial film <b>12</b>, recombination of electron-hole pairs occurs in the active layer <b>123</b>, thereby releasing energy in a form of light. In order to improve the light emitting efficiency of the LED <b>1</b>, an upper surface <b>124</b> of the epitaxial film <b>12</b> (i.e., an upper surface of the n-doped cladding layer <b>122</b>) is roughened so as to reduce full reflection of the light generated from the epitaxial film <b>12</b>. As a result, high proportion of the light generated from the active layer <b>123</b> can be directly emitted out of the LED <b>1</b> through the upper surface <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">During production of the LED <b>1</b>, the gallium nitride series semiconductor material is epitaxially grown on the epitaxial substrate, followed by doping to form the epitaxial film <b>12</b>. Thereafter, the permanent substrate <b>11</b> is wafer-bonded to the epitaxial film <b>12</b>, and the epitaxial substrate is removed to expose the upper surface <b>124</b> of the epitaxial film <b>12</b>, followed by roughening the upper surface <b>124</b> and disposing the top electrode <b>14</b> on the roughened upper surface <b>124</b> to obtain the LED <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the conventional LED <b>1</b>, because the epitaxial film <b>12</b> and the permanent substrate <b>11</b> are connected only by wafer bonding, the connecting surfaces between the epitaxial film <b>12</b> and the permanent substrate <b>11</b> should be sufficiently flat so that the epitaxial film <b>12</b> is tightly bonded to the permanent substrate <b>11</b>. Furthermore, in order to ensure a uniform ohmic contact between the permanent substrate <b>11</b> and the epitaxial film <b>12</b>, the wafer bonding process is required to be conducted at a temperature ranging from 200&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. As a result, the reflective film <b>112</b> of the permanent substrate <b>11</b> may have a degraded quality on account of the high temperature. Accordingly, the reflectivity of the reflective film <b>112</b> may be adversely affected and the light emitting efficiency of the LED <b>1</b> may be lowered.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a light emitting diode that can overcome the aforesaid drawbacks associated with the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, a light emitting diode of this invention comprises:</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Before the present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying preferred embodiments, it should be noted herein that like elements are denoted by the same reference numerals throughout the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a light emitting diode (LED) <b>2</b> according to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention includes an electrically conductive permanent substrate <b>21</b>, an epitaxial film <b>22</b>, an optical adhesive <b>23</b>, and a top electrode <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Electricity is supplied to the epitaxial film <b>22</b> through the permanent substrate <b>21</b> and the top electrode <b>24</b>. The permanent substrate <b>21</b> includes a base plate <b>211</b> and a reflective film <b>212</b> formed on the base plate <b>211</b> to have a reflective top surface <b>213</b>. Preferably, the base plate <b>211</b> is made of a metal or an alloy, and the reflective film <b>212</b> is made of an alloy or a metal that has a relatively high reflectivity, so that the permanent substrate <b>11</b> is thermally and electrically conductive and reflective. Accordingly, the permanent substrate <b>21</b> is capable of dissipating heat generated from the epitaxial film <b>22</b> and is capable of reflecting light. Alternatively, the reflective film <b>212</b> may be made of a lamination of dielectric layers having different refraction coefficients. Besides, the base plate <b>211</b> may be made of any thermally and electrically conductive composite material or semiconductor material suitable for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The epitaxial film <b>22</b> is disposed on the reflective top surface <b>213</b> of the reflective film <b>212</b> of the permanent substrate <b>21</b>, generates light when the electricity is supplied, and is formed by growing epitaxially a gallium nitride series semiconductor material on an epitaxial substrate <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), followed by transferring the same to the permanent substrate <b>21</b> using a temporary substrate <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 8</figref>). The epitaxial film <b>22</b> includes p-doped and n-doped cladding layers <b>221</b>,<b>222</b>, and an active layer <b>223</b> that is formed between the p-doped and n-doped cladding layers <b>221</b>,<b>222</b>. A band gap exists between the p-doped and n-doped cladding layers <b>221</b>,<b>222</b>. When electricity is supplied to the epitaxial film <b>22</b>, recombination of electron-hole pairs occurs in the active layer <b>223</b>, thereby releasing energy in a form of light. Preferably, the epitaxial film <b>22</b> has an upper surface <b>224</b> and a roughened lower surface <b>225</b>. In this preferred embodiment, the upper surface <b>224</b> is also roughened. The p-doped cladding layer <b>221</b> has the roughened upper surface <b>224</b>, and the n-doped cladding layer <b>222</b> has the roughened lower surface <b>225</b>. The roughened lower surface <b>225</b> has a roughness with a height of not less than 300 nm and a plurality of peaks <b>226</b> which are in ohmic contact with the reflective top surface <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The optical adhesive <b>23</b> is filled in a gap between the roughened lower surface <b>225</b> and the reflective top surface <b>213</b> and connects the epitaxial film <b>22</b> to the permanent substrate <b>21</b>. In this case, the optical adhesive <b>23</b> is light-transmissive, adhesive, and may refract or reflect the light generated from the epitaxial film <b>22</b> so that a traveling direction of the light toward the permanent substrate <b>21</b> may be changed substantially. Preferably, the optical adhesive <b>23</b> is a thermosetting adhesive. More preferably, the optical adhesive <b>23</b> is electrically conductive and is liquid at a temperature ranging from 180&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The top electrode <b>24</b> is made of an electrically conductive material and is disposed on the roughened upper surface <b>224</b> of the epitaxial film <b>22</b> and in ohmic contact with the epitaxial film <b>22</b>. Accordingly, the electricity may be supplied to the epitaxial film <b>22</b> through the permanent substrate <b>21</b> and the top electrode <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the electricity is supplied, current passes through the epitaxial film <b>22</b>. Because the epitaxial film <b>22</b> is bonded to the permanent substrate <b>21</b> through the peaks <b>226</b> that are randomly formed, the current passing through the epitaxial film <b>22</b> is forced to be shunted through the randomly formed peaks <b>226</b> to reach the permanent substrate <b>21</b>. Accordingly, photons (the light) may be generated through the photoelectric effect more evenly in the epitaxial film <b>22</b> so as to improve internal quantum efficiency of the LED <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When light is generated from the epitaxial film <b>22</b>, one portion of the light that is directly emitted to the roughened upper surface <b>224</b> is able to be transmitted therethrough in a relatively high proportion due to roughness of the same. Another portion of the light that is emitted to the roughened lower surface <b>225</b> is able to be transmitted therethrough in a relatively high proportion due to roughness of the same and then is reflected back to the roughened upper surface <b>224</b> by virtue of the optical adhesive <b>23</b> and the reflective film <b>212</b> of the permanent substrate <b>21</b>. Hence, the reflected light may pass through the roughened upper surface <b>224</b> in a relatively high proportion on account of the roughness of the same as well.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step <b>31</b>, the epitaxial film <b>22</b> is grown epitaxially over the epitaxial substrate <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In step <b>32</b>, the upper surface <b>224</b> of the epitaxial film <b>22</b> is roughened and then, the top electrode <b>24</b> is formed on the roughened upper surface <b>224</b> of the epitaxial film <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). By virtue of the roughened upper surface <b>224</b>, full reflection of the light generated from the epitaxial film <b>22</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In step <b>33</b>, the temporary substrate <b>42</b> is detachably attached over the roughened upper surface <b>224</b> of the epitaxial film <b>22</b> that is formed with the top electrode <b>24</b>, followed by removing the epitaxial substrate <b>41</b> to expose the lower surface <b>225</b> of the epitaxial film <b>22</b> that is opposite to the upper surface <b>224</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>34</b>, the lower surface <b>225</b> of the epitaxial film <b>22</b> is roughened (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) so that the roughened lower surface <b>225</b> has the roughness with the height of not less than 300 nm and the peaks <b>226</b>. In this preferred embodiment, the lower surface <b>225</b> is randomly roughened. Alternatively, by patterning the epitaxial substrate <b>41</b> before the step <b>31</b>, the lower surface <b>225</b> of the epitaxial film <b>22</b> may have a predetermined roughness after removal of the epitaxial substrate <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In step <b>35</b>, the roughened lower surface <b>225</b> of the epitaxial film <b>22</b> is disposed on the reflective top surface <b>213</b> of the permanent substrate <b>21</b>, and the optical adhesive <b>23</b> is filled in the gap between the roughened lower surface <b>225</b> of the epitaxial film <b>22</b> and the reflective top surface <b>213</b> of the permanent substrate <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In more detail, the permanent substrate <b>21</b> and the epitaxial film <b>22</b> are adhesively bonded to each other by an adhesive bonding process at the temperature ranging from 180&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>36</b>, the temporary substrate <b>42</b> is removed from the epitaxial film <b>22</b> to obtain the LED <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Since the connection between the permanent substrate <b>21</b> and the epitaxial film <b>22</b> and the ohmic contact between the peaks <b>226</b> of the roughened lower surface <b>225</b> with the reflective top surface <b>213</b> can be achieved using the optical adhesive <b>23</b> in a relatively low-temperature process, the conventional high-temperature wafer bonding process (200&#xb0; C.&#x2dc;400&#xb0; C.) is not necessary. Accordingly, the quality degradation problem suffered by the reflective film <b>112</b> in the prior art due to the high temperature wafer bonding process can be eliminated and the light emitting efficiency of the LED <b>2</b> of this invention can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">On the other hand, if the bonding strength between the permanent substrate <b>21</b> and the epitaxial film <b>22</b> is required to be at a strictly high extent, during the step <b>35</b>, the peaks <b>226</b> may be wafer-bonded to the reflective top surface <b>213</b> of the permanent substrate <b>21</b> in addition to the adhesive bonding process. Consequently, the ohmic contact between the peaks <b>226</b> and the reflective top surface <b>213</b> may be enhanced without the strict requirement directed to the flatness of the lower surface <b>225</b> and the reflective top surface <b>213</b> as required in the prior art, and thus, the cost for producing the LED <b>2</b> of this invention may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the second preferred embodiment of the LED <b>2</b> according to the present invention. The second preferred embodiment differs from the first preferred embodiment only in that the reflective top surface <b>213</b> has a plurality of protrusions <b>214</b> which are spaced apart from each other and in ohmic contact with the peaks <b>226</b> of the roughened lower surface <b>225</b>. Through the connection between the protrusions <b>214</b> (artificial roughness) made using a lithography process and the peaks <b>26</b> (random roughness) made using a roughening process, when the electricity is supplied, the current passes through the epitaxial film <b>22</b> in a more uniform way so that the quantum efficiency and the light emitting efficiency of the LED <b>2</b> may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The protrusions <b>214</b> may be formed by forming a plurality of raised portions on the base plate <b>211</b>, followed by forming the reflective film <b>212</b> on the base plate <b>211</b> in conformity with the topography of the same so that the protrusions <b>214</b> are formed by the raised portions and a portion of the reflective film <b>212</b>. Alternatively, the protrusions <b>214</b> may be formed by patterning the reflective film <b>212</b> on the base plate <b>211</b> so that the protrusions <b>214</b> are formed by the patterned reflective film <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the third preferred embodiment of the LED <b>2</b> according to the present invention. The third preferred embodiment differs from the first preferred embodiment only in that the LED <b>2</b> further includes a transparent conductive film <b>25</b> formed between the epitaxial film <b>22</b> and the top electrode <b>24</b>. In this preferred embodiment, the LED <b>2</b> is made by sputtering a transparent metal oxide (such as aluminum zinc oxides, indium tin oxides, fluorine tin oxides, etc.) on the roughened upper surface <b>224</b> to form the transparent conductive film <b>25</b>, followed by disposing the top electrode <b>24</b> on the transparent conductive film <b>25</b> so that the transparent conductive film <b>25</b> is in ohmic contact with the top electrode <b>24</b>. When the electricity is supplied, the current is transversely guided and dispersed by the transparent conductive film <b>25</b> and then passes through the epitaxial film <b>22</b>.
