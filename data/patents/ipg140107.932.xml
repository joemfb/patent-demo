<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CLAIM OF PRIORITY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application makes reference to, incorporates the same herein, and claims all benefits accruing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 from an application earlier filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on the 27 Jul. 2012 and there duly assigned Serial No. 10-2012-0082695.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a laminating device and a laminating method. More particularly, the invention relates to a laminating device and a laminating method for laminating a window on a display panel for displaying an image.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a display device which displays an image, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display has come into the spotlight in recent years.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, unlike a liquid crystal display (LCD), has a self-light emitting characteristic so that a separate light source is not required, and a thickness and a weight thereof may be reduced. Furthermore, because the OLED display has high quality characteristics such as low power consumption, high luminance, and high reaction speed, the OLED display is appropriate for use in a mobile electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, a touch sensor has been formed on a display panel such as an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display so as to manufacture a slim display module such as a smart phone, and a display panel array manufactured by laminating a window on a display panel by using a resin is supplied to display module manufacturers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the described technology and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The load sensor is provided on the rear side of the first plate corresponding to the sub-plate main bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another embodiment of the invention provides a method for laminating a window on a display panel displaying an image, including: providing a laminating device; providing the display panel on the first plate; providing the window on the second plate; applying a resin on the window; folding the folder to provide the window on the display panel with the resin therebetween; and pressurizing the second plate in a direction of the first plate to laminate the window on the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The applying of the resin on the window is performed when a thickness of the display panel and a thickness of the window are measured.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The laminating of the window on the display panel is performed when the thickness of the resin corresponding to an entire surface of the window is measured.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The laminating of the window on the display panel is performed when a load applied to the first plate is sensed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the embodiments, the laminating device and laminating method for easily laminating the window on the display panel by using a resin are provided.</p>
