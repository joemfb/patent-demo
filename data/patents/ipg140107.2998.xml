<p id="p-0097" num="0120">From the results shown in Table 2, it can be seen that the compound obtained in Synthesis Example 2 exhibits superior effects of inhibiting polymerization, as compared with 2,6-di-t-butyl-p-cresol and 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-dimethylaminomethylphenol, which are known as conventional polymerization inhibitors.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0098" num="0121">In a three-necked flask with a volume of 100 ml, equipped with a nitrogen gas inlet tube, a reflex condenser, a thermometer, and a stirrer, 25.8 g (0.204 mol) of allyl methacrylate, 0.2 g (platinum content=0.4 mmol) of a solution of a platinum-divinyltetramethylsiloxane complex, and 0.1 g of 1-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-4-methylpiperazine obtained in Synthesis Example 2 were placed. The mixture was heated to 80&#xb0; C., and 21.2 g (0.2 mol) of methyldimethoxysilane was added dropwise thereto. Subsequently, the mixture was stirred for 0.5 hours at 80&#xb0; C. In addition, 0.04 g of dibutylhydroxytoluene was added thereto. The reaction mixture was distilled under a reduced pressure of 1 mm Hg, and thereby, a fraction at 68 to 71&#xb0; C. was obtained. The obtained fraction was methacryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, and the amount thereof was 35.2 g (yield: 74.8%).</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Comparative Example 4</heading>
<p id="p-0099" num="0122">The same operations as described in Example 3 were carried out with the exception of using phenothiazine instead of 1-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-4-methylpiperazine obtained in Synthesis Example 2. As a result, when 3 g of methyldimethoxysilane was added dropwise thereto, the solution in the flask gelled. Therefore, the desirable compound (methacryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane) could not be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0123">From the results described in Example 3 and Comparative Example 4, it can be seen that the compound obtained in Synthesis Example 2 exhibits superior effects of inhibiting polymerization, as compared with phenothiazine, which is known as a conventional polymerization inhibitor.</p>
