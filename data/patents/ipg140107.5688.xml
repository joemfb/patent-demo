<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Geocoding architecture based on information retrieval. The geocoding information retrieval system operates on locations and geographic entities. The architecture uses parameters in addition to the query string, if available. The parameters provide contextual information that enables filtering and sorting the results. The additional parameters include market, culture, map view, and user location. A geocoding triage process uses the query and context information provided and output of a machine-learning parser to select the data-lookup geocoders for processing the query. A results processing component collects the results from the underlying data-lookup geocoders, merges the results into a single list after normalizing the scores, and then re-sorts the results list.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The Internet has made possible access to a wide variety of data and services. Websites entice users to take advantage of free services as a way of exposing the user to advertisements, which in turn, provide revenue to the host vendor. One example includes the free access and use of online mapping services for geographic locations. Such services are used extensively not only for online access but also for paid services in vehicles, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Geocoding is the process of assigning geographic identifiers such as coordinates to map features such as addresses, places, and other structures by way of software called a geocoder. This applies not only to addresses and places, but also to events or data that have a geographic component.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, conventional geocoding systems are based more on data retrieval techniques rather than information retrieval. A data retrieval system strives to retrieve all objects that satisfy clearly defined conditions such as in a regular expression or in a relational algebra expression. Data retrieval deals with data that has a well defined structure and semantics. In contrast, an information retrieval system usually deals with natural language text that is not always well structured and can be semantically ambiguous. To be effective, the information retrieval system must interpret the query to determine the user intent, which requires extraction of semantic and syntactic information, and then use this information to find relevant documents. The notion of relevance is central to information retrieval systems. Accordingly, the goal of the information retrieval system is to retrieve all documents which are relevant to a user query, while retrieving as few non-relevant documents as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The user interface for geocoding usually consists of separate fields of an address (e.g., address line, city, state, postal code, country, etc.). The values in these fields are usually used by a geocoder to perform hierarchical data lookups in order to obtain the potential matches. However, when given a single-line address that has the fields concatenated together, conventional geocoders perform poorly in that parsing of the string into individual fields is inaccurate. Some of the key problems include incorrect and optional usage of separators, various permutations of the individual fields, and missing fields. Parsing generally tends to be code-driven, rather than data-driven based on real-world logs, and follows a single code path to extract the individual fields. These fields are then sent to a geocoding data lookup engine to obtain the matches and return the matches back to the caller. The success of this approach is limited to well-formatted addresses that have all the individual fields, but tends to break down when there is an ambiguity or missing information in the query.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some novel embodiments described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview, and it is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate the scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosed embodiments employ an information retrieval approach for geocoding rather than a traditional data-lookup approach. This supports a more generic search system that gives the user the best answers possible (e.g., what/where, driving directions, traffic, weather, etc.) for the geographic information system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The geocoding information retrieval system operates on locations and geographic entities, and uses parameters in addition to the query string, if available. The parameters provide contextual information that enables filtering and sorting of the results. The additional parameters can include market, culture, map view, and user location, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A geocoding triage process uses the query, context information provided, and output of a machine-learning parser to select the data-lookup geocoders for processing the query. A results processing component collects the results from the underlying data-lookup geocoders, merges the results into a single list after normalizing the scores, and then re-sorts the results list.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The machine-learning based parsers are trained using real-world data to parse the query string into individual fields. When there is more than one parse result, the architecture will use the multiple results appropriately. Moreover, since the parsing is data-driven, it is not necessary to write a separate parser for each geographic region, and the parser is self-improving as it can be trained continuously with real world data.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles disclosed herein can be employed and is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The disclosed architecture addresses geocoding more as an information retrieval problem rather than a strict data retrieval problem. As compared to traditional information retrieval systems like web search engines that operate on web documents, a geocoding information retrieval system operates on locations and geographic entities.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Instead of taking the query string, performing a single parse on the string, and then conducting a data lookup, the architecture uses a number of additional parameters in addition to the query string, if available. These parameters provide contextual information that enable filtering and sorting the results appropriately. Some of the additional parameters include market, culture, map view, and user location.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In view of the disclosed architecture, geocoders that implement the common geocoder interface provided herein can be deployed by hosting the data and assemblies on a central server and thereby only make small changes to the configuration on the server. This integration process makes deployment of geocoding services for new markets easier. In addition to WS-* (a collection of web service specifications)/SOAP (simple object access protocol) service end points, the geocoding service exposes a number of lighter weight HTTP-based service end points that can output data as old XML (extensible markup language), JSON (JavaScript object notation), and other data formats.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, users are not required to specify a distinct data source. Internally, geocoding can be segregated by country and/or regions, but the user is not required to manually select a data source. Instead, the service will automatically select the best possibilities based on the information provided as part of a request.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Flexible parsing is provided in that the address parsing solution in the geocoding service does not require perfectly formatted input and does not assume that there is a single best parse. Instead, the geocoding architecture works with the best possibilities available and returns the best results. Intelligent geocoding is provided in that the geocoding service uses contextual information to increase the possibility of success.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Reference is now made to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding thereof. It may be evident, however, that the novel embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate a description thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring initially to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a computer-implemented geocoding system <b>100</b>. A triage component <b>102</b> is provided for receiving a query as a string, and parsing the string into a set of data-retrieval requests. A geocoding component <b>104</b> federates the data-retrieval requests to data geocoders <b>106</b>, the responses from which are passed to a results component <b>108</b> for processing the responses into a ranked list of results. A subset of the results can then be returned to a client, for example, that initiated the string.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The query received by the triage component <b>102</b> can include context information where the context information includes data such as market data, culture data, map view data and user location data. The market and/or culture data indicates the preferred geographic region and language settings. The map view data provides a geographic context of the current user view (e.g., center view, bounding polygon, direction of travel, side of the road, etc.). The user location data is based on the current approximate physical location of the user obtained from Wi-Fi, reverse IP lookup, cell phone data, and GPS (global positioning system), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The string can be received from different entities, but typically will be received from a client. The string can be part of a query of structured information or unstructured information such as natural language text.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Following are sample queries and associated responses. First, a query is provided that includes only the address line, with the map view providing the remaining context. For example, &#x201c;600 7 ave&#x201d; is a query, with the current map view indicating the context information as being downtown Seattle. The geocoder will infer the city from the map view and find the exact match of &#x201c;600 7 Ave, Seattle Wash.&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Second, a query is provided that includes only the address line, with the user location providing the remaining context. For example, &#x201c;600 7 ave&#x201d; is a query, with the user currently located somewhere in Seattle (map view can be anywhere). The geocoder will infer the city from the user location and find the match.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Third, is a query &#x201c;600 7 Ave Seattle Wash.&#x201d; is provided for a user with current map view of India. The geocoder will find the correct location even though the map view and user location were not helpful.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Fourth, an incorrectly formatted query is provided such as &#x201c;600, 7 Ave Seattle Wash.&#x201d; (e.g., a comma between the house number and street). The parser correctly recognizes &#x201c;600 7 ave&#x201d; as the address line and the correct location is found.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As a last example, a query is provided that includes a city having a name that exists in several different states, for example, &#x201c;Vancouver&#x201d;, with the current map view over SW Washington. The result will sort Vancouver, Washington, higher than Vancouver, British Columbia. However, the sort order can be changed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an alternative system <b>200</b> for geocoding using information retrieval. The system <b>200</b> includes a geocoding engine <b>202</b> that includes the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for processing queries from a client <b>204</b>. The geocoding engine <b>202</b> can be a centralized (and distributed) service that the client <b>204</b> accesses via a browser, for example. The client <b>204</b> issues a query to a query component <b>206</b> of the engine <b>202</b>. The query component <b>206</b> receives the query in the form of a string (structured and/or unstructured), adds context information to the query, and forwards the string and context information to the triage component <b>102</b> for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The triage component <b>102</b> can include a parser <b>208</b> that parses the string and context information into parse results. The parser <b>208</b> can use a classifier <b>210</b> (e.g., machine learning-based) to apply probability and/or statistical-based analysis to learn and reason about string characteristics (e.g., ambiguities, missing information, etc.) and results. The machine-learning based parser <b>208</b> can be trained using real-world data to parse the query string into individual fields. There is a high likelihood that there can be more than one parse result. The engine <b>202</b> will use the parse results appropriately. Additionally, since the parsing process is data-driven, it is not necessary to write a separate parser for each geographical region. Again, the parser <b>208</b> can be self-improving as due to continuous training with the real-world data.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The output of the triage component <b>102</b> includes data-retrieval requests that are passed to the geocoding component <b>104</b>. The triage component <b>102</b> uses the query and the context information (e.g., market data, culture data, map view data, and/or user location data) and the output of the parser <b>208</b> to select which of the data-lookup geocoders <b>106</b> to send the query. The requests can be optimized according to the characteristics of the underlying geocoders <b>106</b>. In other words, a request sent to a first geocoder could be formatted and/or processed differently than requests sent to a second geocoder.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The geocoding component <b>104</b> includes a parallel execution component <b>212</b> that federates the data-retrieval requests to the geocoders <b>106</b> for substantially concurrent execution. Data from the geocoders <b>106</b> is in the form of responses which are passed to the results component <b>108</b>. Responses that are received within a predefined time period are then processed and the results merged, and the top x results, where x is a positive integer, are selected from the merged list.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The results component <b>108</b> generates scores for the results, and the results are ranked based on the scores. The results component <b>108</b> normalizes static data-retrieval requests, and generates dynamic scores for the results based on multiple dimensions of relevance using at least one of context, data-retrieval possibilities, the static data-retrieval requests, or user personalization. The final list of ranked results <b>214</b> are then communicated to the caller (or client <b>204</b>) for presentation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The classifier <b>210</b> employs machine learning and reasoning (MLR) which facilitates automating one or more features by updating the parser <b>208</b> based on incoming data. The subject architecture (e.g., in connection with parsing) can employ various MLR-based schemes for carrying out various aspects thereof. For example, a process for determining when to define an end of a term in the query can be facilitated via an automatic classifier system and process.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector, x=(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3</sub>, x<sub>4</sub>, . . . , x<sub>n</sub>, where n is a positive integer), to a class label class(x). The classifier can also output a confidence that the input belongs to a class, that is, f(x)=confidence (class(x)). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or other statistical analysis (e.g., one factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to maximize the expected value to one or more people) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, terms &#x201c;to infer&#x201d; and &#x201c;inference&#x201d; refer generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system, environment, and/or user from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic&#x2014;that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs that splits the triggering input events from the non-triggering events in an optimal way. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, for example, various forms of statistical regression, na&#xef;ve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and other statistical classification models representing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of methods used to assign rank and/or priority.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As will be readily appreciated from the subject specification, the architecture can employ classifiers that are explicitly trained (e.g., via a generic training data) as well as implicitly trained (e.g., via observing user behavior, receiving extrinsic information). For example, SVM's are configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus, the classifier(s) can be employed to automatically learn and perform a number of functions according to predetermined criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary high-level overview of a geocoding system <b>300</b> for geocoding in accordance with the disclosed architecture. The system <b>300</b> is composed of two major parts: a geocoding service <b>302</b> and the geocoding manager <b>304</b>. The service <b>302</b> handles most of the common tasks required of all services via a platform common component <b>306</b>, which component <b>306</b> provides security, logging and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The service <b>302</b> also performs request validation. Once the service <b>302</b> has determined the service request is valid (VALID REQUEST), the service <b>302</b> hands the request (VALID REQUEST) off to the manager <b>304</b>. The manager <b>304</b> performs at least triage, geocoding, and results management. The manager <b>304</b> executes the request (TRIAGE REQUEST) through the triage component <b>102</b> to receive a triage response (TRIAGE RESPONSE), and also executes the request (EXECUTION REQUEST) through the parallel execution component <b>212</b> for geocoding and return of the data-retrieval possibilities (EXECUTION RESPONSE). The manager <b>304</b> aggregates the responses from the triage component <b>102</b> and execution component <b>212</b>, and passes these responses (INPUT RESPONSES) to the results component <b>108</b> for grading based on at least ranking and scoring. Data needed for scoring and ranking can be passed along with the input responses to the results component <b>108</b>. Finally, the results (scored and sorted) are packaged into a single response (FINAL RESPONSE) that is returned to the caller (e.g., a client).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a more detailed diagram <b>400</b> of aspects associated with the triage component <b>102</b>. Generally, the triage component <b>102</b> extracts country and/or region information from the query input (whether an unstructured query string or a structured address) and context information, and inputs the country and/or region information into weighting function (e.g., by request context type) to generate the list of ranked country/region information. Initially, the triage component <b>102</b> passes the query (QUERY) to a query optimizer component <b>402</b> for processing to generate an optimized query (OPTIMIZED QUERY) for further processing by the triage component <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If available for a given country/region, the triage component <b>102</b> passes an address parse request (ADDRESS PARSE REQUEST) to the parser component <b>208</b> for parsing the scrubbed query into a structured address. The parser <b>208</b> performs validation of the address via a verifier component <b>404</b>. The verifier <b>404</b> receives the address, country and/or region, and returns a valid or invalid address response to the parser <b>208</b>. The parser <b>208</b> then sends an address parse response (ADDRESS PARSE RESPONSE) to the triage component <b>102</b>. The country/regions, and the query or the structured address (if available and considered valid) are used to generate geocoding commands for individual geocoders to consume.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a more detailed diagram <b>500</b> of aspects associated with the parallel execution for geocoders. The manager <b>304</b> sends an execution request to the execution component <b>212</b>, the request including one or more geocoding commands (received from the query triage process) associated with an implementation of a geocoder <b>502</b>. In other words, the commands can be different for different geocoders. The execution component <b>212</b> executes the commands thereby dispatching multiple geocodes in parallel to one or more geocoder implementations, remote or local. The geocoder <b>502</b> returns a response to the execution component <b>212</b> within a maximum time set for geocoding. The responses are then returned to the manager <b>304</b> in a parallel execution response.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a more detailed diagram <b>600</b> of aspects associated with results processing. Results processing by the results component <b>108</b> can include scoring, ranking, and weighting based on predetermined rules. The manager <b>304</b> passes the input responses (and data needed for scoring and sorting) received from triage and parallel execution to a ranking component <b>602</b> for ranking and scoring. The output of the ranking component <b>602</b> includes geocoding results and data for rules processing, if needed, which output is passed to a scoring component <b>604</b> for results scoring. Similarly, the output of the scoring component <b>604</b> includes geocoding results and data for rules processing, if needed, which output is passed to a weighting component <b>606</b> for weight assignment to different rules.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Similarly, the output of the weighting component <b>606</b> includes geocoding results and data for rules processing, if needed, which output is passed to a scoring rules component <b>608</b> for adjusting the result score based on defined logic in the rule. The output of the scoring rules component <b>608</b> is a geocoding result with an updated score, which is passed back through the weighting component <b>606</b> for updating, through the scoring component <b>604</b> for updating, through the ranking component <b>602</b> for updating, and then to the manager <b>304</b> as a final single response with scored and sorted results.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ranking component <b>602</b> takes the geocoding responses returned from geocoding and scores the results based on various pieces of data available. These pieces of data can include request context, the original input (query or structured address), the results of the query triage process, a geocoding command that returned a given result, and internal rank and score of the geocoder. Different rules (scoring rules) can give a geocoding result a personalized score. These scores can then be aggregated into a composite score that is based on the weights given to various rules. The composite score will then be used to determine which results to return.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a method of geocoding based on data retrieval. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the one or more methodologies shown herein, for example, in the form of a flow chart or flow diagram, are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance therewith, occur in a different order and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all acts illustrated in a methodology may be required for a novel implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At <b>700</b>, a query string is received accompanied by context information. At <b>702</b>, the string is parsed into parse results. At <b>704</b>, data-retrieval requests are created based on the parse results. At <b>706</b>, the requests are federated to data-lookup geocoders. At <b>708</b>, responses from the geocoders are merged into a ranked list of results. At <b>710</b>, a set of results from the ranked list of results is selected and returned for processing. The set of results can be returned to a client, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a method of query parsing and classification for geocoding. At <b>800</b>, a query string and context information are received, the query parsed into parse results based on machine learning and the context information. At <b>802</b>, the parse results are sent to the triage component. At <b>804</b>, the address is sent to a verifier to validate the address. At <b>806</b>, a validation response is returned to the triage component. At <b>808</b>, a set of data-retrieval requests is created for execution by geocoders based on specific geocoder requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a method of parallel execution of data-retrieval requests. At <b>900</b>, a set of data-retrieval requests is created for a first geocoder based on specific requirements of the first geocoder. At <b>902</b>, a set of data-retrieval requests is created for a second geocoder based on specific requirements of the second geocoder. At <b>904</b>, the sets of requests are sent to the respective geocoders in parallel for concurrent execution by the first and second geocoders. At <b>906</b>, the geocoder responses are returned and aggregated into a final response. Although described in the context of two geocoders, it is to be appreciated that there can be more than two geocoders from which to select and to perform concurrent execution.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a method of scoring and ranking in accordance with the geocoding architecture. At <b>1000</b>, geocoding results are received in responses from the geocoders. At <b>1002</b>, scoring rules are applied to the results to generate scores. At <b>1004</b>, weights then can be applied to different scores. At <b>1006</b>, the weighted scores are aggregated into a composite score. At <b>1008</b>, the composite score is assigned to the geocoding result that spawned the scores. At <b>1010</b>, this process is repeated for all geocoding results in all geocoding responses.
