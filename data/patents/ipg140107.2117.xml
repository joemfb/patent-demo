<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to electrical energy systems such as fuel cells, electrolyzer cells, and sensors, and, in particular, to solid oxide fuel cells, solid oxide electrolyzer cells, solid oxide sensors, and components of any of the foregoing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Solid oxide fuel cells, otherwise known as ceramic fuel cells, present an environmentally friendly alternative to mainstream electrical energy production processes involving the combustion of fossil fuels. Solid oxide fuel cells enable the catalytic conversion of chemical energy stored in hydrogen into electrical energy without the concomitant release of greenhouse gases. The generation of electrical current by a solid oxide fuel cell using a hydrogen fuel results in the production of water as opposed to the production carbon dioxide, nitrous oxides, and/or sulfur dioxides associated with the combustion of fossil fuels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to hydrogen, solid oxide fuel cells are operable to function on a wide variety of fuel sources. Fuel sources in addition to hydrogen include hydrocarbons such as methane, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Hydrocarbon fuel sources are reformed into hydrogen for use with solid oxide fuel cells. Hydrocarbon reforming can be administered prior to entry into the fuel electrode or can be administered at the fuel electrode of a solid oxide fuel cell. The ability to function on a wide variety of fuels distinguishes solid oxide fuel cells from other fuel cells which lack the ability to operate on various fuels. Furthermore, the ability of solid oxide fuel cells to administer hydrocarbon feedstock reformation frees such fuel cells from the limitations associated with hydrogen production and distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, solid oxide fuel cells operate at high temperatures ranging from about 800&#xb0; C. to 1000&#xb0; C. As a result of high operating temperatures, solid oxide fuel cells require the use of exotic materials which can withstand such operating temperatures. The need for exotic materials greatly increases the costs of solid oxide fuel cells, making their use in certain applications cost-prohibitive. Moreover, high operating temperatures often induce grain growth in the various component layers of a solid oxide fuel cell, including the electrolyte. Grain growth can reduce ion conductivity through the electrolyte thereby degrading the efficiency of the solid oxide fuel cell. High operating temperatures additionally exacerbate stresses caused by differences in coefficients of thermal expansion between component layers of a solid oxide fuel cell. Differences in coefficients of thermal expansion between component layers of a solid oxide fuel cell can lead to cracking at interfaces of the layers as well as within the layers. Differences in coefficients of thermal expansion between the air electrode and the electrolyte, for example, can lead to cracking at the electrode-electrolyte interface and within the electrode and/or electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In certain circumstances, a solid oxide fuel cell can operate &#x201c;in reverse&#x201d; to electrolyze water into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas by inputting electrical energy. In other circumstances, a solid oxide electrolyzer cell can be designed primarily for use as a hydrolyzer, generating hydrogen and oxygen for later use. In still other circumstances, an electrolyzer cell can be used for other purposes, such as extraction of metal from ore and electroplating. In conventional electrolyzers, electrical energy is lost in the electrolysis reaction driving the diffusion of ions through the electrolyte and across the distance between the electrodes. Also, the ability to conduct electrolysis at higher temperatures would improve the efficiency of the electrolysis. However, at higher temperatures, electrolyzers face similar thermal stresses and cracking caused by differences in coefficients of thermal expansion between component layers of the solid oxide electrolyzer cell. Accordingly, better matching of coefficients of thermal expansion is desired for electrolyzer cells.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A lambda sensor is a device typically placed in the exhaust stream of an internal combustion engine to measure the concentration of oxygen. That measurement allows regulation of the richness or leanness of the fuel/air mixture flowing into the engine. If the fuel/air stream contains too much oxygen, the quantity &#x3bb; is greater than 1, and the mixture is too lean. If the fuel/air stream contains too little oxygen, then &#x3bb;&#x3c;1 and the mixture is too rich. &#x3bb; equals 1, the ideal situation, when the mixture contains a stoichiometrically equivalent concentration of oxygen and hydrocarbon to allow for complete combustion. A lambda sensor positioned in the exhaust stream detects the amount of oxygen in the combustion products, thereby providing feedback regarding richness or leanness. Lambda sensors and other sensors rely on the diffusion of oxygen anions (O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>) and other ions through barrier materials in ways similar to the manner in which oxygen anions diffuse through a solid electrolyte of a solid oxide fuel cell. Moreover, given the high operating temperature of lambda sensors and similar devices, sensors face thermal stresses, cracking, and delamination issues similar to those facing fuel cells and electrolyzers. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention provide for improved sensor technology by addressing mismatching of coefficients of thermal expansion, among other reasons.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing problems and disadvantages associated with the high operating temperatures of solid oxide cells, it would be desirable to provide solid oxide cells that can demonstrate lower operating temperatures. In addition, providing solid oxide cells and components that better tolerate higher temperatures would be advantageous. Moreover, the efficiency losses due to the thickness of electrolytes make thinner electrolytes desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, &#x201c;solid oxide cell&#x201d; means any electrochemical cell that contains at least one metal oxide, and refers to, for example, solid oxide fuel cells, solid oxide electrolyzer cells, cells that can operate as a fuel cell and an electrolyzer cell, and solid oxide sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One method of lowering operating temperatures of solid oxide cells is to increase the efficiency of oxygen transport across the solid electrolyte. Since oxygen transport efficiency decreases linearly with electrolyte thickness, the thinner the electrolyte layer, the higher the efficiency of oxygen transport. Thus, the thinner the electrolyte, the higher the operating efficiency of the solid oxide cell will be. A thinner electrolyte layer also can lower the operating temperature of a solid oxide cell.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some embodiments of the present invention provide electrolyte in the form of an ultra-thin yet fully dense film having a thickness less than 1 micron. A thickness less than 1 &#x3bc;m represents a reduction in thickness of 2-3 orders of magnitude over many existing ceramic electrolyte constructions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, by lowering the operating temperature of a solid oxide cell, less exotic and easier-to-fabricate materials can be utilized in the construction of the cell leading to lower production costs. Thus, some embodiments of the present invention provide solid oxide cells and components thereof employing simpler, less-expensive materials than the current state of the art. For example, if the operating temperature of a solid oxide cell can be lowered, then metals can be used for many different components such as electrodes and interconnects. At these lower operating temperatures, metals have more desirable mechanical properties, such as higher strength, than ceramics. In addition, this higher strength can allow metal components also to have a higher degree of porosity. Current ceramic electrode materials allow for porosity levels in the range of 30% to 40%. Incorporating higher porosity levels in ceramic materials renders them too structurally weak to support cell construction. However, through the use of certain metals or metal carbides, the porosity of an electrode can be provided in the higher range of 40% to 80% and yet retain sufficient mechanical strength for cell construction. Some embodiments of the present invention provide an electrode having a porosity ranging from about 40% to about 80%.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Lower production costs in addition to lower operating temperatures provide the opportunity for solid oxide cells to find application in a wider variety of fields. Additionally, lower operating temperatures reduce degradative processes such as those associated with grain growth and variances in coefficients of thermal expansion between dissimilar component layers of the cell. Accordingly, some embodiments provide means and methods for reducing at least one degradation process in a solid oxide cell.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further embodiments of the present invention apply conformal nano-scale surface treatments to porous metal substrates so that the pore size can be reduced to either micron- or submicron-dimensions; thus, the increase in the active surface area of an electrode component results in an increase in the efficiency of the electrode by as much as an order of magnitude.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still other embodiments produce a desirable surface catalytic effect. For example, by using a process of some embodiments of the present invention, thin films of metal oxides and pure metals (or other metal compounds) can be formed on the exposed pore surfaces of electrodes to produce more chemically active sites at triple phase boundaries where either fuel-gas (as in the case of the anode electrode) or gaseous oxygen (as in the case of the cathode electrode) come into contact with the solid (yet porous) electrodes in a fuel cell.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other embodiments provide methods of making solid oxide cells and components thereof. Current methods of making solid oxide fuel cells involve the sintering of ceramic and/or metal powders. High sintering temperatures during fabrication of various components, such as the electrolyte, can result in excessive grain growth as well as compound problems associated with variances in coefficients of thermal expansion. Furthermore, sintering provides little control over the ability to vary the composition of an electrolyte or electrode as a function of the thickness of the electrolyte or electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a solid oxide fuel cell comprising an air electrode, a fuel electrode, an electrolyte interposed between the air electrode and the fuel electrode, and at least one electrode-electrolyte transition layer. In other embodiments of the present invention, an electrode-electrolyte transition layer is interposed between an electrode and the electrolyte. An electrode-electrolyte transition layer, in some embodiments, is interposed between the air electrode and the electrolyte. In other embodiments, an electrode-electrolyte transition layer is interposed between the fuel electrode and the electrolyte. In a further embodiment, a solid oxide fuel cell comprises a first electrode-electrolyte transition layer interposed between the air electrode and electrolyte and a second electrode-electrolyte transition layer interposed between the fuel electrode and the electrolyte. In one embodiment, a solid oxide fuel cell does not comprise an electrode-electrolyte transition layer, and an abrupt interface exists between an electrode and electrolyte. Even other embodiments provide more than one electrode-electrolyte transition layer.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, in order to reduce problems and disadvantages associated with variances in coefficients of thermal expansion between electrodes and electrolytes of solid oxide cells and to increase ionic conductivities, electrolytes of certain embodiments of the present invention comprise compositional gradients. An electrolyte of a solid oxide cell, in one embodiment, comprises a region proximal to an electrode and a region distal to the electrode, wherein the region proximal to the electrode comprises a greater amount of electrode material than the region distal to the electrode. An electrode, for example, comprises La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>MnO<sub>3 </sub>[lanthanum strontium doped manganite (LSM)]. The region of the electrolyte proximal to the electrode comprises greater amounts of LSM in comparison with the region of the electrolyte distal from the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An electrolyte of a solid oxide cell, in another embodiment, comprises a plurality of metal oxide layers. Metal oxide layers of the electrolyte proximal to an electrode comprise a greater amount of electrode material than metal oxide layers of the electrolyte distal to the electrode. An electrode, for example, comprises La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>MnO<sub>3 </sub>[lanthanum strontium doped manganite (LSM)]. Metal oxide layers of an electrolyte proximal to the electrode, in one embodiment, comprise greater amounts of LSM in comparison with metal oxide layers of the electrolyte distal from the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Incorporating greater amounts of electrode material in an electrolyte region or electrolyte layers proximal or adjacent to the electrode in a solid oxide cell establishes a compositional gradient in the electrolyte. Such a compositional gradient can permit an electrolyte region or electrolyte layers proximal to the electrode to demonstrate a coefficient of thermal expansion which better matches the coefficient of thermal expansion of the electrode. As a result, disparities in coefficients of thermal expansion between the electrode and the electrolyte can be reduced or eliminated leading to a more stable solid oxide cell.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In view of this, in some embodiments, a solid oxide cell comprises a first electrode comprising a first material and an electrolyte comprising a first region proximal to the first electrode and a second region distal to the first electrode, wherein the first region of the electrolyte comprises a greater amount of the first material than the second region of the electrolyte.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In order to reduce problems and disadvantages associated with variances in coefficients of thermal expansion between electrode and electrolytes of solid oxide cells, electrodes, in some embodiments of the present invention, comprise compositional gradients. An electrode, in one embodiment, comprises a region proximal to the electrolyte and a region distal to the electrolyte, wherein the region proximal to the electrolyte comprises a greater amount of electrolyte material than the region of the electrode distal to the electrolyte.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition to variances in coefficients of thermal expansion, some of the solid oxide cells of the present invention also address fuel, air, and other reactant delivery mechanisms by providing electrodes comprising porosity and optionally, porosity gradients. For example, electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells may be porous in order to allow the ingress of air and fuel to the electrolyte and the egress of other gases produced or not consumed by the fuel cell. In one embodiment, a solid oxide cell comprises a solid electrolyte disposed on a first electrode, the first electrode comprising a first region proximal to the solid electrolyte and a second region distal to the electrolyte, wherein the first region has a porosity less than the second region. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the first region of the electrode has a porosity that is greater than the second region of the electrode. One embodiment provides a porous electrode having a first region adapted to be proximate to electrolyte having pores of approximately 200 nm in diameter, and a second region adapted to be distal to the electrolyte having pores of approximately 10-15 &#x3bc;m in diameter. The two regions can be any suitable thickness. For example, the first region can be 200 nm thick, and the second region can be about 1 &#x3bc;m thick. The thicknesses of the two (or more, if desired) regions balance the mechanical strength of the porous electrode with the movement of reactant and product gases through the electrode. If the electrode is too thin, then it may be too brittle. If it is too thick, movement of gas through the electrode may hinder cell operation.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">The present invention provides solid oxide cells and methods of making and using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">In some embodiments, solid oxide cells of the present invention demonstrate lower operating temperatures. Lowering the operating temperature of solid oxide cells enables the cells to be constructed from less expensive materials thereby rendering their production more cost friendly. In addition to cost savings, solid oxide cells having lower operating temperature can find application in a wider variety of fields. Furthermore, lower operating temperatures reduce stress on the individual components of the cell thereby reducing the onset of degradation pathways (such as cracking or delamination) that result from variances in coefficients of thermal expansion among dissimilar types of materials that comprise the component layers&#x2014;or that result from excessive grain growth arising from exposure to high process (&#x201c;sintering&#x201d;) or operating temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">Furthermore, it would be desirable to lower the operating temperature of a solid oxide cell so that metals (instead of ceramics) can be used for electrode substrate construction. Metals generally have a higher level of mechanical strength, so they can also have a higher porosity and yet maintain an adequate degree of structural strength that is needed for the solid oxide cell's integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">Current ceramic electrode materials allow for porosity levels in the range of 30% to 40%. When these porosity levels are exceeded, structural (i.e. mechanical) strength becomes too weak to support cell construction.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">However, by using certain types of metals or metal carbides, the porosity of an electrode can be increased to a range of 40% to 80%. And yet, these porous metallic materials still retain sufficient mechanical strength to allow cell construction.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">It would additionally be desirable to apply conformal nano-scale surface treatments or thin films onto these porous metallic materials. These conformal surface treatments reduce the pore-size to either micron- or submicron-sized dimensions. With the addition of these surface treatments, the active surface area of an electrode component can increase the efficiency of the thus-treated electrode by as much as an order of magnitude.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071">This is particularly true if the surface treatments or thin films also exhibit a surface catalytic effect in addition to the efficiency improvements of modified surface area noted above. The catalytic effect of the surface treatments or thin films, in some embodiments, can be adjusted to enhance operating efficiency of the solid oxide cell and, thus, to lower operating temperature. In other embodiments, solid oxide cells of the present invention demonstrate greater tolerance for high operating temperatures. That greater tolerance enables such cells to be constructed from less expensive materials, and may increase service lifetime. The increased tolerance for high operating temperatures stems from the greater matching of coefficients of thermal expansion available to at least some embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">In still other embodiments, solid oxide cells exhibit increased operational efficiency due to decreased electrolyte thicknesses. Thinner electrolytes allow for lower energy losses due to ion diffusion through the electrolyte. Some embodiments of the present invention include a solid oxide electrolyte having a thickness of 100-1000 times thinner than ceramic electrolytes made according to conventional methods.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">I. Solid Oxide Cells Useful as Fuel Cells</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a solid oxide fuel cell comprising an air electrode, a fuel electrode, an electrolyte interposed between the air electrode and the fuel electrode, and at least one electrode-electrolyte transition layer. In some embodiments of the present invention, an electrode-electrolyte transition layer is interposed between an electrode and the electrolyte. An electrode-electrolyte transition layer, in some embodiments, is interposed between the air electrode and the electrolyte. In other embodiments, an electrode-electrolyte transition layer is interposed between the fuel electrode and the electrolyte. In a further embodiment, a solid oxide fuel cell comprises a first electrode-electrolyte transition layer interposed between the air electrode and the electrolyte and a second electrode-electrolyte transition layer interposed between the fuel electrode and the electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">Turning now to components that can be included in solid oxide fuel cells, solid oxide fuel cells of the present invention comprise an air electrode. The air electrode of a solid oxide fuel cell operates as a cathode to reduce oxygen molecules thereby producing oxygen anions for subsequent transport through the electrolyte. In some embodiments, an air electrode comprises p-type semiconducting oxides such as lanthanum manganite (LaMnO<sub>3</sub>). Lanthanum manganite can be doped with rare earth elements, such as strontium, cerium, and/or praseodymium to enhance conductivity. In one embodiment, an air electrode comprises La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>MnO<sub>3 </sub>[lanthanum strontium doped manganite (LSM)]. In another embodiment, an air electrode comprises lanthanum strontium ferrite or lanthanum strontium cobaltite or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075">Air electrodes, according to some embodiments of the present invention, are porous. In one embodiment, an air electrode has a porosity ranging from about 5% to about 30%. In another embodiment, an air electrode has a porosity ranging from about 10% to about 25% or from about 15% to about 20%. In a further embodiment, an air electrode has a porosity greater than about 30%. An air electrode, in some embodiments, has a porosity ranging from about 30% to about 60% or from about 40% to about 80%. In one embodiment, an air electrode has a porosity greater than about 80%.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076">A lower operating temperature allows non-ceramic materials such as metals and metal carbides to be used. Since these materials generally possess higher levels of mechanical or structural strength at the lower operating temperatures, they can have higher levels of porosity than either ceramics (such as the LSM that can be used for cathodes) or cermets (such as mixtures of nickel and zirconia that can be used for anodes).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0077">Metallic materials also tend to be easier to fabricate; and, they do not require high process (or &#x2018;sintering&#x2019;) temperatures. Such high process temperatures can result in detrimental micro-structural grain growth, which can occur both in previously processed ceramic and in the metallic components of the fuel cell.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0078">Additionally, films for surface modification of air electrodes can have any desired thickness. In one embodiment, a thin film applied to an air electrode has a thickness ranging from about 10 nm to about 1 micron. In another embodiment, an air-electrode-film has a thickness ranging from about 10 nm to about 50 nm, from about 50 nm to about 750 &#x3bc;m, from about 50 nm to about 500 nm, from about 500 nm to about 500 &#x3bc;m, from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 350 &#x3bc;m, or from about 10 &#x3bc;m to about 200 &#x3bc;m. In a further embodiment, an air electrode has a thickness ranging from about 50 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0079">These thin films are used in some embodiments to modify the surface of porous air electrodes (cathodes) that, themselves, can be composed of porous metals or metal carbides. By using a non-ceramic porous material (such as a metal or metal carbide) as the body (or substrate) onto which a thin film is applied, many of the adverse structural and processing conditions of ceramic materials (such as high sintering temperatures) can be avoided. In addition, the operating efficiency of a solid oxide fuel cell comprised of these metallic and metallic carbide materials can also be significantly enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0080">In addition to an air electrode, a solid oxide fuel cell comprises a fuel electrode. A fuel electrode, in some embodiments, comprises one or more metal oxides combined with one or a plurality of catalytic materials.

In a further embodiment, a fuel electrode has a porosity greater than about 40%. A fuel electrode, in some embodiments, has a porosity ranging from about 40% to about 80%. In still other embodiments, a fuel electrode has a porosity greater than about 80%.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082">Additionally, the films used to treat the surface of fuel electrodes (or anodes) can have any desired thickness. In one embodiment a fuel electrode film has a thickness ranging from about 10 nm to about 1 micron. In another embodiment, the thickness of the film applied to the surfaces of a fuel electrode has a thickness ranging from about 50 nm to about 2 microns; or, from about 500 nm to about 1.5 microns; or, from about 750 nm to about 1 micron.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083">An electrolyte for solid oxide cells, for example interposed between the fuel electrode and the air electrode in some embodiments, comprises one or a plurality of layers of one or more metal oxides. In some embodiments, metal oxides suitable for electrolyte layers comprise zirconium oxides combined with various transition and/or rare earth metals, including, but not limited to, scandium, yttrium, erbium, ytterbium, europium, gadolinium, or dysprosium, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, a metal oxide suitable for one or more layers of an electrolyte comprises zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) or yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) Zr<sub>(1-x)</sub>Y<sub>x</sub>O<sub>[2-(x/2)]</sub>, x=0.08-0.11.

<p id="p-0082" num="0087">Layers of an electrolyte, in some embodiments, are constructed independently and without reference to one another. As a result, a plurality of electrolyte layers can display the same compositional construction or different compositional constructions. Thus, for example, a compositional gradient can be introduced into an electrolyte in the following manner. An electrode material is chosen, such as, for example, LSM. An electrolyte material is also chosen, such as, for example, YSZ. To make the YSZ electrolyte, as will be further explained below, metal compounds containing yttrium and zirconium and possibly others will be applied to the surface of the electrode and converted into the corresponding metal oxides. This application and conversion can be repeated to form more than one layer of electrolyte on the electrode. Accordingly, metal compounds corresponding to the material of the electrode can be included in the applying step forming the first layers of the electrolyte. In this example, lanthanum compounds, strontium compounds, manganese compounds, and combinations thereof can be applied to the electrode surface along with the yttrium compounds and zirconium compounds, to impart a concentration of species corresponding to the electrode material in the electrolyte. As subsequent layers of electrolyte are formed, the concentration or amount of lanthanum compounds, strontium compounds, manganese compounds, and combinations thereof applied to the electrode (more accurately, to the previously-formed layer(s) of electrolyte) are decreased. If desired, the concentration of species corresponding to the electrode material in the electrolyte can be decreased to zero in subsequent layers of electrolyte, or the compositional gradient can assume any desired profile across the electrolyte. The species corresponding to the electrode material in the electrolyte can be any suitable species in any suitable dispersion, such as, for example, metal oxides, ionic impurities, solid solutions, distinct domains, and the like.</p>

An electrode-electrolyte transition layer comprises both electrode and electrolyte materials.

<p id="p-0094" num="0099">Some embodiments of the present invention provide solid oxide electrolyzer cells or a component thereof comprising at least one metal oxide. In certain embodiments, the at least one electrolyzer cell or a component thereof is substantially identical in manufacture and composition as the fuel cells and components described above.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0100">In some of those embodiments of the present invention where the same cell can function as an electrolyzer cell and alternately as a fuel cell simply by reversing the flow of electrons, the cathode of the electrolyzer corresponds to the fuel electrode of the fuel cell; and the anode of the electrolyzer corresponds to the air electrode of the fuel cell. Those of ordinary skill in the art recognize that oxidation occurs at the anode, and reduction occurs at the cathode, so the name of a given electrode may differ depending on whether the cell is operating as an electrolyzer or as a fuel cell.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101">In other embodiments, electrons flow in the same direction, regardless of whether the cell is electrolyzing or producing electricity. This can be accomplished, for example, by supplying oxygen anions to a given electrode in electrolysis mode, and alternately supplying hydrogen to the same electrode in fuel cell mode. Such an electrode will function as the oxidizing anode in either mode.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102">Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention provide a solid oxide electrolyzer cell, comprising at least one first electrode, at least one second electrode, and at least one electrolyte interposed between the first electrode and the second electrode. The cell optionally contains at least one electrode-electrolyte transition layer, at least one composition gradient, at least one porosity gradient, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the at least one electrolyte is made by applying a metal compound composition to a substrate, and converting at least some of the metal compound composition to at least one metal oxide.</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">providing at least one solid oxide cell comprising at least one first electrode, at least one second electrode, and at least one metal oxide interposed between the at least one first electrode and at least one second electrode;</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">contacting the at least one first electrode with at least one reactant; and</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">supplying electrical energy to the at least one first electrode and the at least one second electrode thereby causing the at least one reactant to undergo electrochemical reaction to yield the at least one product.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0104">The skilled electrochemist will appreciate that a complete circuit is necessary for electrical energy to cause electrochemical reaction. For example, at least one ion may traverse the metal oxide electrolyte to complete the electrical circuit at the second electrode. Moreover, at least one second product may be formed at the second electrode due to electrochemical reaction. Therefore, some embodiments further provide for contacting the at least one second electrode with at least one second reactant, thereby causing the at least one second reactant to undergo electrochemical reaction to yield at least one second product. Contacting an electrode and supplying electrical energy can occur in any suitable order. In a continuous process, electrical energy supply is maintained while additional reactant(s) enter the cell and product(s) are removed.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0105">Any suitable reactant can be supplied to an electrode for electrochemical reaction. Suitable reactants include, but are not limited to, water such as, for example, pure water, fresh water, rain water, ground water, salt water, purified water, deionized water, water containing at least one ionic substance, brine, acidified water, basified water, hot water, superheated water, steam, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, nitrous oxides, sulfur oxides, ammonia, metal salts, molten metal salts, and combinations thereof. Ionic substances include those substances that release at least one ion when placed in contact with water, and include, but are not limited to, salts, acids, bases, and buffers. Reactants, and for that matter, products, can be in any suitable form, including solid, liquid, gas, and combinations thereof. Solid reactants and/or solid products lend themselves to batch processes, although suitable methods for removing a solid product from a cell can be employed. Fluid reactants and products can appear in either batch or continuous processes. Optionally, heat energy is applied to the reactant, the product, at least one electrode, the at least one metal oxide, the cell, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0106">Some embodiments provide at least one sacrificial electrode. A sacrificial electrode itself reacts in the electrolysis process, and is thereby consumed or rendered unreactive as the reaction proceeds. For example, a zinc electrode can be consumed in a suitable solid oxide cell reaction, yielding Zn<sup>2+</sup> and two electrons per mole of zinc consumed. In another example, an electrode can become coated and thereby rendered unreactive by solid product forming on its surface. The unreactive electrode can be removed from the cell, and the product extracted from the electrode, or the product can be used on the electrode in another process. The electrode then can be regenerated, recycled, or discarded. Alternatively, a sacrificial electrode can be made to gradually insert into a cell at a rate consistent with the rate at which the electrode is consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0107">A reactant undergoing electrochemical reaction can be oxidized and/or reduced, and chemical bonds may form and/or break. For example, when water undergoes electrolysis, hydrogen-oxygen bonds break, H<sup>+</sup> is reduced to H<sup>0</sup>, O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>is oxidized to O<sup>0</sup>, and H<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>form, in some circumstances. Hydrogen peroxide and other species may form in other circumstances. The skilled artisan will appreciate that many electrode half reactions can be substituted so that any variety of anions, cations, and other species may result from electrochemical reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0108">In one embodiment, water containing NaCl can be electrolyzed to form hydrogen gas and NaOH at the cathode, and chlorine gas at the anode, in the so-called chlor-alkali process:

<br/>
A solid oxide cell arranged to carry out that reaction, in some embodiments, provides water containing a high concentration of NaCl (for example, saturated) to a first electrode that will act as an anode, and provides water to a second electrode that will act as a cathode. The cell also provides liquid effluent collection to remove the depleted NaCl solution from the anode, and NaOH-containing water from the cathode. The cell further provides gas effluent collection to remove chlorine gas from the anode and hydrogen gas from the cathode. Optionally, the hydrogen and chlorine can be subject to electrochemical reaction to release the electrochemical energy stored by the foregoing electrolysis, or they can be used for other industrial processes, such as the synthesis of sodium hypochlorite.
</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0109">The present invention also provides methods for storing electrochemical energy. In some embodiments, at least one reactant is supplied to at least one electrode of a solid oxide cell, the at least one reactant undergoes one or more electrochemical reactions and yields at least one fuel, thereby storing electrochemical energy. The electrochemical reaction may also yield other products, such as cations, anions, and other species, some of which may form at a second electrode of the solid oxide cell that completes an external circuit. At least one first electrode and at least one second electrode are separated by at least one metal oxide electrolyte in the solid oxide cell. The fuel can be subjected to energy conversion processes such as reverse electrochemical reaction in a fuel cell or battery, combustion, and the like to release the stored electrochemical energy.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0110">In one embodiment, electrochemical energy is stored by providing a reactant to at least one cathode; reducing the reactant at the at least one cathode to release at least one anion and at least one fuel; storing the at least one fuel; transporting the at least one anion through at least one metal oxide electrolyte to at least one anode; and oxidizing the at least one anion. Optionally, the oxidized anion is stored as well, separately from the stored fuel. Thus, in one embodiment, water in a suitable form is supplied to a cathode, at which it is reduced to hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen anion (O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup>); the hydrogen is collected and stored, while the oxygen anion diffuses through a solid metal oxide electrolyte to an anode where the oxygen anion is oxidized to oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). Optionally, in the foregoing non-limiting example, the oxygen is collected and stored as well.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0111">When desired, the stored hydrogen can be fed to any suitable fuel cell, including but not limited to the cell that produced the hydrogen, and the hydrogen can be oxidized to release the stored electrochemical energy. Any suitable gas can be fed to the air electrode of the fuel cell, such as, for example, the optionally-stored oxygen, other oxygen, other oxygen-containing gas such as air, and combinations thereof. Alternatively, the stored hydrogen can be combusted with oxygen to propel a rocket, drive a piston, rotate a turbine, and the like. In other embodiments, the stored hydrogen can be used in other industrial processes, such as petroleum cracking.</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0124">Further embodiments of the present invention provide a sensor comprising at least two electrodes separated by at least one metal oxide that functions as a solid electrolyte. In some of those embodiments, the voltage difference between the at least two electrodes corresponds to the concentration of the analyte being detected at one of the electrodes. A first electrode functions as a reference electrode, and is exposed to a reference environment. Suitable reference environments include, but are not limited to, air, vacuum, standard solutions, and environments of known or controlled composition. In some embodiments, the reference environment is formed by arranging one or more materials that substantially isolate the reference electrode from the environment being measured. The second electrode is exposed to the environment being measured. Optionally, the second electrode comprises one or more catalytic materials. In some embodiments, at least one catalytic material is chosen from platinum, palladium, rhodium, nickel, cerium, gold, silver, zinc, lead, ruthenium, rhenium, and combinations thereof. In operation, the first and second electrodes are placed in electrical communication with one or more devices that can measure, for example, the voltage difference, the current, the resistance, or combinations thereof, between the two electrodes. Such devices are known in the art. Optionally, heat or cooling can be supplied to one or both electrodes, the electrolyte, or combinations thereof. Heat or cooling can come from any suitable source, such as, for example, one or more electrical resistance heaters, chemical reaction, thermal fluid in thermal communication with the sensor, the measured environment, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0125">In some embodiments, a reference voltage is supplied to the electrodes, and the current needed to maintain the reference voltage corresponds to the concentration of the analyte being measured. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,235,171, describes two-electrode hydrogen sensors comprising barium-cerium oxide electrolyte. The '171 patent also indicates that various other metal oxides also function as electrolytes in hydrogen sensors, including selenium cerium oxides, selenium cerium yttrium oxides, and calcium zirconium oxides, which conduct protons, and oxygen anion conductors. The '171 patent is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0126">In other embodiments, a gas permeable porous platinum measuring electrode is exposed to a measured environment that contains a partial pressure of oxygen. At least one metal oxide, such as, for example, yttria-stabilized zirconia, separates the measuring electrode from a gas permeable porous platinum reference electrode that is exposed to air. The voltage difference, current, or both between the electrodes can be measured and correlated to the difference of partial pressure of oxygen between the measured environment and air. In some embodiments, the measured environment is an exhaust stream from the combustion of hydrocarbons.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0127">In still other embodiments, at least two pairs of electrodes appear, wherein at least one metal oxide separates the electrodes in each pair. One of the two pairs functions as a reference cell, while the other of the two pairs functions as a measuring cell, in some embodiments. Further embodiments provide, in a first pair of electrodes, a reference electrode exposed to a reference environment and a Nernst electrode exposed to the measured environment. At least one metal oxide that functions as a solid electrolyte is situated between the reference electrode and the Nernst electrode.

The inner pump electrode and the Nernst electrode are exposed to the environment to be measured optionally through a diffusion barrier. In operation, an external reference voltage is applied across the pump electrodes. The current needed to maintain the reference voltage across the pump electrodes provides a measure of the analyte concentration in the measured environment. For a conventional broadband lambda sensor containing such a pair of electrodes, see U.S. Pat. No. 7,083,710 B2, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Optionally, a sensor of the present invention is adapted to electrically communicate with control circuitry that smoothes operation of the sensor before the sensor has achieved standard operating conditions, such as temperature. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,177,099 B2, which is also incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0128">Thus, certain embodiments of the present invention provide so-called narrow band sensors such as lambda sensors that fluctuate between lean and rich indications. Other embodiments provide broadband sensors such as lambda sensors that indicate the partial pressure of oxygen, and thereby the degree of leanness or richness of an air-fuel mixture.</p>

For another example, a sensor may comprise a plurality of reference electrodes. In another example, a sensor may comprise, or be adapted to electrically communicate with, a standard electrode or other device providing information useful to the operation of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0130">In still other embodiments of the present invention, a sensor is made by applying at least one metal compound to a substrate, and converting at least some of the at least one metal compound to at least one metal oxide.

Also, metal compounds containing at least one metal atom and combinations of two or more ligands can function as metal compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0131">In some embodiments, the at least one sensor or at least one component thereof can be made in any suitable manner. For example, the at least one metal oxide can be formed on any suitable substrate. Such substrates include, but are not limited to, one or more metals, plastics, ceramics, cermets, semiconductors, insulators, metal oxides, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the substrate is an electrode. At least one metal oxide is formed on the substrate by applying at least one metal compound to the substrate, and converting at least some of the at least one metal compound to at least one metal oxide. In some embodiments, the at least one metal compound is fully converted to at least one metal oxide. Certain embodiments provide porous substrates, while others provide non-porous substrates. Still other embodiments provide fluid-permeable substrates, while others provide substrates that are substantially impermeable to fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0132">In some embodiments, a plurality of metal oxide layers are formed on the substrate. In one embodiment, for example, a method of making a sensor or at least one component thereof comprises forming a plurality of metal oxide layers on the substrate, wherein each layer of metal oxide is formed on a preceding layer by applying a metal carboxylate composition to the preceding layer, the metal carboxylate composition comprising at least one metal salt of a carboxylic acid. The metal carboxylate composition is subsequently converted to at least one metal oxide, for example, by exposing the metal carboxylate composition to heat. In still other embodiments, the at least one metal compound comprises one or more of catalytic materials, nanoparticles, substrate materials, and the like. Yet other embodiments provide one or more concentration gradients, porosity gradients, transition layers, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0133">Some embodiments of the present invention provide metal oxides that are permeable to ions such as O<sup>2&#x2212;</sup> ions. Other embodiments provide metal oxides that may not necessarily be permeable to ions. Still other embodiments provide metal oxides that are permeable to ions, but such permeability is not required for the function of the metal oxide in the embodiment. For example, in certain embodiments, a metal oxide functions as a solid electrolyte in a gas sensor, allowing diffusion of ions during operation of the gas sensor. In other embodiments, a metal oxide functions as a structural element of the gas sensor. In still other embodiments, a metal oxide functions as both a solid electrolyte and a structural element of the gas sensor. In still other embodiments, one or more metal oxides are used alone or in combination, for one or more functions in a gas sensor.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">IV. Solid Oxide Cells Comprising Compositional Gradients and Porosity Gradients</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0134">In order to reduce problems and disadvantages associated with variances in coefficients of thermal expansion between electrodes and electrolytes of solid oxide cells and to increase ionic conductivities, electrolytes of some embodiments of the present invention comprise compositional gradients. An electrolyte of a solid oxide cell, in one embodiment, comprises a region proximal to an electrode and a region distal to the electrode wherein the region proximal to the electrode comprises a greater amount of electrode material than the region distal to the electrode. An electrode, for example, comprises La<sub>1-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>MnO<sub>3 </sub>[lanthanum strontium doped manganite (LSM)]. The region of the electrolyte proximal to the electrode comprises greater amounts of LSM in comparison with the region of the electrolyte distal from the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0135">In another embodiment, an electrolyte of a solid oxide cell comprises a plurality of metal oxide layers. Metal oxide layers of the electrolyte proximal to the electrode comprise greater amounts of electrode material than metal oxide layers of the electrolyte distal to the electrode. An electrode, for example, comprises a porous metal or metal carbide body (or substrate) onto which a thin film surface treatment has been applied and that consists of a material suitable for use as the air electrode (cathode) of a solid oxide fuel cell (such as LSM). Metal oxide layers of an electrolyte proximal to the electrode, in one embodiment, comprise greater amounts of LSM in comparison with metal oxide layers of the electrolyte distal from the electrode. Incorporating greater amounts of electrode material in electrolyte layers proximal or adjacent to the electrode in a solid oxide cell establishes a compositional gradient among the electrolyte layers. Such a compositional gradient can permit layers proximal to the electrode to demonstrate a coefficient of thermal expansion that better matches the coefficient of thermal expansion of the electrode. As a result, disparities in coefficients of thermal expansion between the electrode and the electrolyte can be reduced or eliminated leading to a more stable solid oxide cell. Reducing the variances in coefficients of thermal expansion between solid oxide cell component layers can reduce or inhibit degradative pathways such as electrode and/or electrolyte cracking as well as electrode/electrolyte delamination. Reduction or inhibition of these pathways results in a more stable and efficient cell.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0136">In view of enhanced stabilities provided by a compositional gradient, in some embodiments, a solid oxide cell comprises a first electrode comprising a first material and an electrolyte comprising a first region proximal to the first electrode and a second region distal to the first electrode, wherein the first region of the electrolyte comprises a greater amount of the first material than the second region of the electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0137">In another embodiment, comprising a porous metal (or metal carbide) body (or substrate) onto which a thin film surface treatment has been applied and that comprises a first material, and an electrolyte comprising a plurality of layers of an electrolyte material, the layers of the electrolyte material proximal or adjacent to the first electrode further comprise a greater amount of the first material of the first electrode than layers of the electrolyte distal or spaced apart from the first electrode. The first material of the first electrode and the plurality of electrolyte layers, according to some embodiments of the present invention, can comprise any of the materials suitable for use as electrodes and/or electrolytes. Moreover, the first electrode and plurality of electrolyte layers can display any of the physical parameters, such as thickness, porosity, and average grain size, recited for electrodes and/or electrolytes hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0138">Additionally, in order to reduce problems and disadvantages associated with variances in coefficients of thermal expansion between electrode and electrolytes of solid oxide cells, electrodes, in some embodiments of the present invention comprise compositional gradients. An electrode, in one embodiment, comprises a region proximal to the electrolyte and a region distal to the electrolyte, wherein the region proximal to the electrolyte comprises a greater amount of electrolyte material than the region of the electrode distal to the electrolyte. In another embodiment, an electrode of a solid oxide cell comprises a plurality of layers. Layers of the electrode proximal to the electrolyte comprise a greater amount of electrolyte material than layers of the electrode distal to the electrolyte. A solid oxide cell, in some embodiments, comprises a first electrode comprising a plurality of layers of a first material and an electrolyte comprising an electrolyte material disposed on the first electrode, wherein layers of the first material proximal or adjacent to the electrolyte further comprise a greater amount of the electrolyte material than layers of the first material distal or spaced apart from the electrolyte.</p>

Additionally, the electrolyte and plurality of electrode layers can display any of the physical parameters, such as thickness, porosity, and average grain size, recited for electrodes and/or electrolytes hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0140">In addition to variances in coefficients of thermal expansion, solid oxide fuel cells of some embodiments of the present invention also address fuel, air, reactant, and product delivery and removal mechanisms by providing electrodes comprising porosity gradients. Electrodes of solid oxide fuel cells are optionally porous in order to allow the ingress of air and fuel to the electrolyte and the egress of other gases produced or not consumed by the fuel cell. Similarly, electrodes of cells other than fuel cells may be porous, to allow for introduction of one or more reactants, and removal of one or more products, from the electrode. In one embodiment, a solid oxide cell comprises a solid electrolyte disposed on a first electrode, the first electrode comprising a first region proximal to the solid electrolyte and a second region distal to the electrolyte, wherein the first region has a porosity less than the second region. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the first region of the electrode has a porosity that is greater than the second region of the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0141">Moreover, in another embodiment, a solid oxide cell comprises a first electrode comprising a plurality of layers of a first material and an electrolyte disposed on the first electrode, wherein layers of the first material proximal to the electrolyte have porosities less than layers of the first material distal to the electrolyte. In one embodiment, for example, layers of the first material proximal to the electrolyte have a porosity ranging from about 5 percent to about 10 percent while layers of the first material distal to the electrolyte have a porosity ranging from about 40 to about 70 percent. Alternatively, in another embodiment, layers of the first material proximal to the solid electrolyte have porosities greater than layers of the first material distal to the solid electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0142">Establishing a porosity gradient among a plurality of layers of an electrode permits the electrode to better match the porosity of the electrolyte without producing a pore structure within the electrode that is unduly restrictive to air, fuel, reactant, or product flow. Porosity can be controlled by any suitable method, such as, for example, by including particles such as nanoparticles in the compositions used to manufacture an electrode or electrolyte, pore-forming agents that release gas during manufacture, substances that can be dissolved, melted, or sublimed and thereby removed after a given layer has been manufactured, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, one or more organic compounds such as corn starch can be included in the composition, which organic compounds are burned away upon sintering in the presence of oxygen to leave a porous structure upon cooling. A porosity gradient is established by including an increasing or decreasing amount of pore-forming agent in the compositions used to form subsequent layers of electrode or electrolyte, for example.</p>

Connections between an interconnect and an electrode can adopt any suitable form. In some embodiments, the same piece of metal (or metal carbide, cermet, or other material) forms the substrate for the electrode and for the interconnect; in such embodiments, the portion of the metal that engages in the electrochemical reaction in the cell is the electrode portion, while the portion of the metal providing communication outside the cell is the interconnect portion. In other embodiments, electrical contact between the interconnect and the electrode are made with any suitable connection, such as, for example, welding, stamping, melt fusion, mechanical connections such as bolts or rivets, conductive paints such as silver paint, sputtered metals, and conductive adhesives, as well as combinations thereof. Such connections can be made before, during, or after formation of metal oxides as described herein.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0160">In some embodiments of interconnects of the present invention, a substrate-coating transition layer is interposed between the substrate and the coating. A substrate-coating transition layer comprises both substrate and coating materials. By comprising both substrate and coating materials, the substrate-coating transition layer, in some embodiments, is operable to reduce disparities in coefficients of thermal expansion between the substrate and the metal oxide coating of the interconnect. Reducing such disparities can have an inhibitory effect on degradative pathways such as cracking or delamination between the substrate and metal oxide coating. Moreover, a substrate-coating transition layer provides increased stability by anchoring the metal oxide coating to the electrode.</p>

The resulting porous material is suitable for use as a cathode in a fuel cell embodying aspects of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0262">A two-inch diameter, approximately 2 mm thick LSM disc having an average pore size of about 15 &#x3bc;m and porosity of about 30% was formed in accordance with the foregoing procedure and polished with diamond paste to a roughness of approximately 1 &#x3bc;m. The polished surface was held against a 0.1 L volume vacuum chamber opening with an O-ring, and a vacuum was applied to measure the rate at which vacuum is lost through the porous electrode. A pressure of no less than 1200 mtorr was measured in the vacuum chamber, whereupon a valve between the vacuum chamber and a vacuum pump was closed. The pressure in the vacuum chamber returned rapidly to ambient pressure. See Table 1.</p>
<heading id="h-0029" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<heading id="h-0030" level="1">First Five Layers of YSZ Electrolyte with YSZ Nanoparticles and Powder</heading>
<p id="p-0256" num="0263">A viscous composition was made as follows. First, a liquid composition containing yttrium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate (15 molar % based on Y) and zirconium (IV) 2-ethylhexanoate (85 molar % based on Zr) was made. Then, one part of the liquid composition by weight was mixed with one part of YSZ nanoparticles having an average particle size of 50-100 nm; one part of the liquid composition was mixed with one part of YSZ powder having an average particle size of about 1 &#x3bc;m; and one part of the liquid composition was mixed with one part of YSZ powder having an average particle size of about 45 &#x3bc;m. All three mixtures were combined to form the viscous composition.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0264">The LSM electrode from Example 1 was wetted on the polished surface with the viscous composition. The wet electrode was placed in a room-temperature electric furnace in air and the oven was heated to 450&#xb0; C. Once the oven reached 450&#xb0; C. in about 15 minutes, the oven was turned off, taking another 15 minutes to cool back to room temperature. The cooled electrode, now coated with a layer of YSZ electrolyte was subjected to the vacuum loss test described in Example 1. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that including the YSZ nanoparticles and powder in the composition applied to the surface of the electrode helps close the pores at the surface of the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0265">Four more layers of the YSZ electrolyte with the YSZ nanoparticles and powder were formed by applying the viscous composition to the cooled electrode, heating and cooling the electrode as described above, and repeating. After each applying, heating and cooling, the electrode was subjected to the vacuum loss test described in Example 1.</p>

<p id="p-0259" num="0266">The room-temperature electrode of Example 2 was coated repeatedly with a liquid composition containing yttrium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate (15 molar % based on Y) and zirconium (IV) 2-ethylhexanoate (85 molar % based on Zr) (and no nanoparticles or powder). After each application of the liquid composition, the electrode was heated and cooled as described in Example 2, and tested for vacuum loss as described in Example 1.</p>

From the foregoing data, it is believed that approximately thirty coats of YSZ electrolyte applied as set forth in Examples 1-3 should be sufficient for certain solid oxide cell embodiments of the present invention. Other embodiments may require more or fewer coats. Still other embodiments may tolerate faster, or require slower, leak rates.
</p>
<heading id="h-0035" level="1">EXAMPLE 5</heading>
<heading id="h-0036" level="1">Forming Solid Oxide Fuel Cell</heading>
<p id="p-0263" num="0270">An electrode having several coats of electrolyte as made according to Examples 1-3 can be assembled into a cell with a porous nickel-YSZ cermet electrode. The Ni-YSZ electrode can be purchased or manufactured as explained in Example 1. Ni-YSZ cermet powders are also available from American Elements. A Ni-YSZ disk having 2&#x2033; diameter and approximately 2 mm thickness can be placed onto a LSM disk having 20-40 layers of YSZ electrolyte coated thereon as described in Examples 2-3, along with an application of the liquid composition described in Example 3 on the YSZ. Then the Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSM sandwich is heated as described in Example 2. Upon heating, the liquid composition will form additional YSZ that will bond the Ni-YSZ disk to the YSZ electrolyte and LSM electrode. The bonded sandwich can be assembled into a fuel cell adapted to supply a hydrogen-containing gas to the Ni-YSZ electrode to act as an anode, and to supply an oxygen-containing gas to the LSM electrode to act as a cathode. Interconnects connecting the anode and cathode to external wiring are adapted to complete the electrical circuit. When the fuel cell is heated to 800&#xb0; C. and the hydrogen-containing gas and oxygen-containing gas are supplied, the cell should produce electricity, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
