<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An auto-zero amplifier includes a main amplifier for amplifying an input signal; the main amplifier receives an offset-correction signal for cancelling an offset at a first common-mode level of the input signal. At the first common-mode level, the offset-correction signal is based on a first value stored using a first offset-storage element. When a change is detected in the input common-mode from the first level to a second level, the first offset-storage element is switched out and a second offset-storage element, having a second value based on the second common-mode level, is switched in.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/506,857, filed on Jul. 12, 2011, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention generally relate to auto-zero amplifiers and, in particular, to auto-zero amplifiers that compensate for large steps in their input common-mode level.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current-sensing amplifiers output a voltage proportional to an input current. They may use a resistor to convert the input current into a corresponding voltage, which is then amplified. Among many other applications, current-sensing amplifiers may be used for motor and solenoid control in, for example, automotive power-steering and adaptive-suspension systems, industrial-process control, and medical applications. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate diagrams of solenoid <b>100</b> and motor control <b>150</b> applications, respectively. In such applications, the input <b>102</b> receives a pulse-width modulated waveform <b>104</b> that toggles between (for example) &#x2212;2 V and 24 V, 48 V, or 80 V. The rising and falling time of the transitions of the input <b>102</b> may be as small as approximately 10 nS, and the frequency of the input <b>102</b> may be as great as approximately 20 kHz. A current-sensing amplifier <b>106</b> in such applications may be judged on the offset (i.e., a difference between real and expected output values), drift (i.e., a change in output values despite constant input values), and common-mode step response of its output. Ideally, the amplifier <b>106</b> produces a result based on the difference between its inputs, regardless of the actual values of the inputs (i.e., their common-mode level); in practice, however, the output of the amplifier <b>106</b> may change at different common-mode levels of its inputs. For example, if the amplifier <b>106</b> is tuned to remove an offset at a first common-mode level, the tuning may need to be adjusted at a second common-mode level to remove a new offset introduced by the new common-mode level.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The common-mode step response of the amplifier <b>106</b> may be especially important in applications having large changes in the input common mode voltage; while the amplifier <b>106</b> is recovering from the change in input common mode voltage, the output of the amplifier may not be valid due to the new offset induced by the new common-mode level. Thus, a long settling time of the amplifier <b>106</b> (and thus the large error during that period of time) may seriously degrade the dynamic performance of the amplifier <b>106</b>. In addition, such amplifiers typically have an unacceptably large DC offset, offset drift, and poor CMRR, thus making them unsuitable for precision applications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to improve the DC precision of the amplifier, an auto-zero technique may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of a &#x201c;ping-pong&#x201d; auto-zero amplifier <b>200</b>. It has two input paths <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> disposed in parallel: each path <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> includes a main amplifier <b>206</b>, an auxiliary differential pair <b>208</b> to correct the offset of the main amplifier, and a pair <b>210</b> of offset-storage capacitors. The offset-storage capacitors <b>210</b> sample the voltage on the outputs <b>212</b> of the main amplifiers <b>206</b> and feed the samples back, via the auxiliary differential pairs <b>208</b>, to tuning the main amplifiers <b>206</b> to correct any offset therein. Each path <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> may be calibrated periodically and alternatively, in accordance with, for example, an auto-zero clock, so that the offset-correction voltage is refreshed periodically. In other words, while one path <b>202</b> is amplifying the input signal, the other path is calibrating itself, and vice-versa. Such an auto-zero amplifier <b>200</b> may achieve very low DC offset, offset drift, and high DC CMRR.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It may take a relatively long time, however, for a traditional auto-zero amplifier to recover (i.e., cancel a new offset) after a step in the input common-mode voltage and, during recovery, the output of the amplifier may be invalid. An offset in an amplifier may result from a mismatch between devices' transconductance and/or mismatching between devices' output impedance. The degree of mismatching may be affected by device bias current, MOSFET drain-to-source voltage and back-gate bias voltage, and/or bipolar transistor collector-to-emitter voltage. All of these factors may be affected by input common mode voltage. Because the amplifier typically has different offsets at different common-mode voltages, and thus requires different offset-correction voltages to correct these offsets, this long recovery time hinders the accuracy of the amplifier. The recovery time varies significantly: it may depend on the unpredictable timing relationship between the auto-zero cycle and input common mode step and/or the auto-zero clock frequency, which varies with temperature and process corner. In other words, if a sudden step in the input common-mode voltage occurs at a first time t<sub>0 </sub>and creates an offset in the output of the auto-zero amplifier, it may not be corrected until a later time t<sub>1 </sub>during the next auto-zero cycle. The times t<sub>0 </sub>and t<sub>1</sub>, and the length of time between them, may be unknown and unpredictable. Although the auto-zero frequency may be increased to reduce the length of such time, nevertheless, due to the discrete nature of auto-zero operation, the amplifier is still unable to start the settling process immediately after a common mode input step. Furthermore, in practice, the settling time of the auto-zero calibration loop, power consumption, switch charge injection, etc., may limit how fast the auto-zero frequency can be. Other techniques used to improve the DC accuracy of a current-sensing amplifier, such as chopper stabilization, have the same drawbacks due to, for example, the long settling time of a capacitor in an internal filter.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a common-mode step response <b>300</b> of a traditional ping-pong auto-zero amplifier as a function of time <b>302</b> (in microseconds). An input common-mode voltage <b>304</b> toggles between a wide common-mode range (in this example, between &#x2212;2 V <b>306</b> and 80 V <b>308</b>, but the invention is not limited to these values); an auto-zero control logic signal <b>310</b> toggles between high <b>312</b> and low <b>314</b> values to enable and disable two paths of a ping-pong amplifier (such as the paths <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). When the control signal <b>310</b> is at logic high <b>312</b>, a first ping-pong main amplifier is in auto-zero mode and the a second ping-pong main amplifier is in the signal path; conversely, when the control signal <b>310</b> is at logic low <b>314</b>, the second ping-pong main amplifier is in auto-zero mode and the first ping-pong main amplifier is in the signal path. The output <b>300</b> of the overall amplifier is, in this example, configured to have a gain of 20.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the settling times <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> of the output <b>300</b> in response to the transitions in the common-mode input <b>304</b> may be long and unpredictable. For example, at approximately 29 uS, the common-mode voltage <b>304</b> steps from 80 V down to &#x2212;2V, and a large offset appears at the amplifier output <b>300</b>; this offset persists until approximately 35 uS. The offset persists for so long because of the timing of the input step <b>304</b> and the auto-zero control <b>310</b>. Between 29 uS and 30 uS, the first ping-pong main amplifier is in the signal path; its offset-correction voltage was calibrated, during its auto-zero mode, at a common-mode voltage of 80 V. Between 26.5 uS and 30.5 uS, the second main amplifier is in auto-zero mode. At 29 uS, however, the common-mode input <b>304</b> suddenly changes, which also changes the offset of the first and second main amplifiers. Between 29 uS and 30.5 uS, a very large error <b>320</b> (e.g., &#x3e;150 mV) appears at the output <b>300</b> due to the sudden offset change of the first main amplifier resulting from the large change in the common-mode level of the input <b>304</b>. During the same time, the second main amplifier also tries to find the new offset-correction voltage for the new common mode level; it has only 1.5 uS to do so, however. The second main amplifier does thus not have enough time to settle to the correct offset-correction voltage by the end of its auto-zero cycle. At 30.5 uS, the second main amplifier switches from auto-zero mode into the signal path, producing an undesirable offset <b>322</b> (e.g. a bump riding on the output <b>300</b>) between approximately 30.5 uS and 35 uS. The output <b>300</b> finally settles at its correct value at 35 uS, after the first main amplifier is in auto-zero mode at &#x2212;2V between 30.5 uS to 35 uS and then switches back into the signal path. The total common mode step recovery time is thus 6 uS. The next common-mode step happens at 54 uS; in this case, the overall recovery time is about 4 uS for similar reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, existing current-sensing amplifiers may not properly handle large steps in input common mode voltage. A need therefore exists for a cost-effective and precise way to compensate for large and/or fast changes in an input common-mode voltage.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In general, various aspects of the systems and methods described herein include improving the settling time of an auto-zero amplifier. An offset-storage device (e.g., a capacitor for a single-ended implementation, a capacitor pair for a differential implementation, or a digital-register array if a corresponding offset-correction voltage has been converted into a digital format by analog to digital converters) is used for steady-state operation. One or more additional offset-storage devices are connected via a switching and control network to the offset-correction circuit; at least one additional offset-storage device (e.g., capacitor, capacitor pair, or digital resister array) is charged to a voltage corresponding to a level of the input common mode voltage after a step therein. The additional offset-storage device is switched to replace the steady-state offset-storage device after a step in the input voltage is detected and thereby settles the voltage of the amplifier more quickly. The amplifier may be an auto-zero amplifier or any other amplifier that may be subjected to an input common-mode voltage having large steps and that implements either an internal auto-offset adjustment or externally applied adjustment. Furthermore, the offset adjustment is not limited to implementation in the analog domain. In one embodiment, the offset corresponding each common mode input level may be converted to a digital format by an analog-to-digital converter, stored in digital register arrays, and converted back into analog to cancel the offset of the amplifier by a digital-to-analog conversion circuit. In other embodiments, the output of the amplifier may be converted to one or more digital signals, and the offset-correction may be done completely in the digital domain with digital register arrays that store an offset-correction voltage corresponding to each common mode input level during calibration mode.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, a system for improving common-mode response of an auto-zero amplifier includes a first offset-storage element for storing a first value corresponding to a first common-mode level of an input signal and a second offset-storage element for storing a second value corresponding to a second common-mode level of the input signal. A main amplifier amplifies the input signal; it receives an offset-correction signal, generated based on the first value, for cancelling an offset at the first common-mode level. Control logic detects a transition in the input signal from the first common-mode level to the second common-mode level, and a switch (upon detection of the transition) severs a first connection to the first offset-storage element and creates a second connection to the second offset-storage element, thereby generating the offset-correction signal using the second value instead of the first value.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In various embodiments, the first and second offset-storage elements are capacitors or digital registers. The switch may sever and create the first and second connections immediately upon detection of the transition when the main amplifier is in a signal-path mode and/or during a next transition of an auto-zero clock when the main amplifier is in an auto-zero mode. The auto-zero amplifier may be a ping-pong auto-zero amplifier. The main amplifier, first and second steady-state offset-storage elements, control logic, and switch may comprise one of two paths in the ping-pong auto-zero amplifier; the system may further include a second path comprising a second main amplifier, second first and second offset-storage elements, a second control logic, and a second switch. An auto-zero clock may be used for switching between the first path and the second path.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A third offset-storage element may store a third value corresponding to the first common-mode level of the input signal; the control logic may detect a second transition in the input signal from the second common-mode level back to the first common-mode level, and the switch may sever the first or second connections and create a third connection to the third offset-storage element. An auxiliary differential pair may generate the offset-correction signal in accordance with the values of the first or second offset-storage elements.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The system may further include (i) a first auxiliary differential pair for generating the offset-correction signal, in accordance with the value of the second offset-storage element, for low-to-high transitions of the common-mode level of the input signal and (ii) a second auxiliary differential pair for generating the offset-correction signal, in accordance with a value of a third settling offset-storage element, for high-to-low transitions of the common-mode level of the input signal. A third auxiliary differential pair may generate the offset-correction signal, in accordance with the value of the first offset-storage element, during a steady-state of the common-mode level of the input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, a method for improving common-mode response in an auto-zero amplifier includes generating an offset-correction signal for correcting an offset in a main amplifier; the offset-correction signal depends at least in part on a first value corresponding to a first common-mode level of an input signal. A change in the common-mode level of the input signal from the first common-mode level to a second common-mode level is detected, and (upon detection) the first value is switched for a second value previously stored for the second common-mode voltage level, thereby modifying the offset-correction signal. The modified offset-correction signal is applied to the main amplifier to thereby cancel a new offset introduced by the change in the common-mode level.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In various embodiments, the method further includes (i) detecting a second change in the input common-mode level of the signal input from the second common-mode level back to the first common-mode level, (ii) switching, in response to the detected second change, the first or second value with a third value previously stored for the first common-mode voltage level; and (iii) applying the modified offset-correction signal to the main amplifier to thereby cancel a new offset introduced by the second change in the common-mode level. The switching may occur immediately after detecting the change if the main amplifier is in a signal-path mode or after a next transition in an auto-zero clock if the main amplifier is in an auto-zero mode. The second offset-storage element may be disconnected prior to the input common-mode voltage changing from the second voltage level. The first and second values may be stored in capacitors or digital registers, and the second value may be stored prior to the detected change. The storing of the second value may occur during an auto-zero mode.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One embodiment of the present invention may be used in a ping-pong auto-zero amplifier. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an auto-zero amplifier <b>400</b> that receives input signals <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> and provides an output signal <b>406</b> via an output stage <b>408</b>. Auto-zero switches <b>410</b> select one of a first amplifier <b>412</b> and a second amplifier <b>414</b>; while one amplifier <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> is in the signal path, the other amplifier <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> is in auto-zero mode. Each amplifier <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> has a offset calibration circuit <b>416</b>, <b>418</b> that includes control logic and switches <b>420</b> and capacitor pairs CB <b>422</b>, CA <b>424</b>, and CC <b>426</b>. The output of the control logic and switches <b>420</b> is applied to an auxiliary differential pair <b>428</b> and fed back to the amplifiers <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first pair of offset-storage capacitors CB <b>422</b> may be used for steady-state operation in a manner similar to the capacitors in a traditional ping-pong auto-zero amplifier. A second pair of offset-storage capacitors CA <b>424</b> may be used to improve the amplifier settling behavior after the common mode steps from low voltage to high voltage, for instance, from &#x2212;2V to 80V or vice versa. A third pair of offset-storage capacitors CC <b>426</b> may be used to improve the amplifier settling behavior after the common mode steps from high voltage to low voltage, for instance, from 80V to &#x2212;2V. The control logic and switches <b>420</b> detect the common-mode voltage before and after the step and switch in or out the capacitors CA, CB, CC appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The step in the common-mode voltage may occur either when the first amplifier <b>412</b> is in auto-zero mode or when it is in the signal path, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate each of these cases, respectively. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> pertain only to the first amplifier <b>412</b>, the principles embodied therein may be applied to the second amplifier <b>414</b> or any other amplifiers built in accordance with the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, at time t<sub>0</sub>, the common-mode voltage <b>504</b> steps up from &#x2212;2V to 80V; at this time, the first amplifier <b>412</b> is in auto-zero mode (in accordance with the auto-zero clock <b>502</b> being high). The first amplifier <b>412</b> transitions to being in the signal path at time t<sub>1 </sub>when the auto-zero clock <b>502</b> falls low. Because the common-mode voltage <b>504</b> has changed, so too does the offset of the first amplifier <b>412</b>; because the time duration from t<sub>0 </sub>is t<sub>1 </sub>is unpredictable (i.e., there is no relationship or dependency between the transitions in the clock <b>502</b> and input common mode <b>504</b>), the auto-zero loop may not have enough time to settle. Therefore, CB <b>422</b> alone may not remove the amplifier offset corresponding to a common-mode voltage of 80 V at t<sub>1</sub>. If, however, CA <b>424</b> has previously stored the offset-correction voltage corresponding to an 80 V common-mode voltage, then at time t<sub>1 </sub>CB <b>422</b> may be switched out and CA <b>424</b> switched in. At time t<sub>2</sub>, the auto-zero clock <b>502</b> rises again, and the first amplifier <b>412</b> again enters auto-zero mode. At this time, both CA <b>424</b> and CB <b>422</b> may be switched in. By time t<sub>3</sub>, the offset-correction voltage in CA <b>424</b> is refreshed and ready for the next low-to-high common-mode transient. Once CB <b>422</b> is switched in at time t<sub>2</sub>, it may stay switched in until the next common-mode step occurs, regardless of the present mode of the first amplifier <b>412</b>. During this time, CB <b>422</b> may function in a manner similar to the normal offset-storage capacitor in a traditional auto-zero amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">After time t<sub>3</sub>, CA <b>424</b> may be switched out until the common-mode steps down and steps back to 80 V again; in another embodiment, it is switched out during only the auto-zero periods because, during this period, voltage in the offset-storage capacitors may be disturbed. In either case, CA <b>424</b> is switched out from the auto-zero loop before the common-mode voltage changes again (at time t<sub>7</sub>) so that its sampled voltage is not corrupted by the new common-mode voltage. The common mode steps from high to low at time t<sub>7</sub>. At this time, the first amplifier <b>412</b> is also in the auto-zero mode. CB <b>422</b> and CC <b>426</b> may be switched in and out in the same manner as CB <b>422</b> and CA <b>424</b>, where CC <b>426</b> stores the offset correction voltage for the common mode of &#x2212;2V.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The step in the input common-mode voltage may also occur while the first amplifier <b>412</b> is in the signal path, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The common-mode level <b>506</b> steps from low to high at time t<sub>0</sub>. Before t<sub>0</sub>, the system switches in only CC <b>426</b> and CB <b>422</b> or only CB <b>422</b>. After the step in the common-mode level, the offset of the first amplifier <b>412</b> changes. The offset-correction voltage stored in CC <b>426</b> and CB <b>422</b>, which corresponds to the previous common-mode level, is unable to fully correct the offset of the main amplifier at the new level. Therefore, at time t<b>0</b>, CC <b>426</b> and CB <b>422</b> are switched out and CA <b>424</b> is switched in; CA <b>424</b> has been previously sampled to store the offset correction voltage corresponding to a common-mode level of 80 V. The common-mode level steps down at time t<sub>7 </sub>when, as described above, the first amplifier <b>412</b> is in the signal path. At this time, CC <b>426</b> is switched in and the other capacitors CA, CB <b>424</b>, <b>422</b> are switched out. Thus, the discrete nature of the auto-zero scheme and its limited intrinsic CMRR no longer degrade the common-mode step response.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exemplary common-mode step response <b>602</b>, with respect to an input common-mode level <b>604</b> and an auto-zero clock <b>606</b>, using the auto-zero architecture of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows one embodiment of a common-mode detection circuit <b>700</b>; in this circuit, the common-mode input voltage <b>702</b> is scaled down by two resistors <b>704</b>, <b>706</b> and compared with a reference voltage <b>708</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the above-described embodiments, one auxiliary differential pair having three pairs of capacitors is used for offset correction for each main amplifier. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is a diagram of such an auxiliary differential pair <b>802</b>, showing its use of each of three pairs of capacitors <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, <b>808</b> (via a switching network <b>810</b>) and a main amplifier <b>812</b>. Note that the connections in the switching network <b>810</b> represent merely the relationship between the auxiliary amplifier <b>802</b> and the capacitors <b>804</b>, <b>806</b>, <b>808</b>, and are not intended to illustrate the actual switching circuits in the network <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other embodiments, one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, two auxiliary differential pairs <b>814</b>, <b>816</b> may be used with a main amplifier <b>818</b> (i.e., a total of four auxiliary differential pairs are used in the full circuit). A first auxiliary pair <b>814</b> may be used to improve the low-to-high common-mode step response (using, e.g., a first capacitor pair <b>820</b>) and a second auxiliary pair <b>816</b> may be used to improve the high-to-low transient (using, e.g., a second capacitor pair <b>822</b>). The two auxiliary pairs <b>814</b>, <b>816</b> may share a third pair of capacitors <b>824</b> for steady-state operation. In an alternative embodiment, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the two differential pairs <b>814</b>, <b>816</b> have their own, separate steady-state capacitors <b>824</b><i>a</i>, <b>824</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In other embodiments, one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, three auxiliary differential pairs <b>826</b>, <b>828</b>, <b>830</b> may be used with a main amplifier <b>832</b>. Each auxiliary pair <b>826</b>, <b>828</b>, <b>830</b> may have its own offset-storage capacitor pair <b>834</b>, <b>836</b>, <b>838</b>. A first auxiliary pair <b>826</b> improves the low-to-high common-mode step response with a first capacitor pair <b>838</b>, a second auxiliary pair <b>828</b> improves the high-to-low transient using a second capacitor pair <b>836</b>, and a third auxiliary pair <b>830</b> uses a third capacitor pair <b>834</b> for steady-state operation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A method <b>900</b> for improving common-mode step response in an auto-zero amplifier is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In first steps <b>902</b>, <b>904</b>, <b>906</b>, first, second, and third values are sampled and/or stored at various common-mode levels (e.g., two or more levels). As explained above, if the input common mode is at a first level and a change to a second level is anticipated, and least one value has already been stored that corresponds to the second level (during, e.g., the last time the input common-mode was at the second level). In a second step <b>908</b>, an offset-correction signal is generated for correcting an offset in the main amplifier; this offset-generation signal may be generated using the first value stored on, e.g. the steady-state capacitors CB described above. The input signal is monitored (using, e.g., the control logic described above) for a change to a second level (step <b>910</b>) and, once that change is detected, the first value is switched (step <b>912</b>) for the second value using, e.g., the switches described above. The switch may occur immediately after detection of the change (if, for example, the main amplifier is in a signal-path mode) or at the next time the main amplifier exits auto-zero mode to enter signal-path mode (i.e., the next time the auto-zero clock transitions) if the main amplifier is in auto-zero mode. The offset-correction signal is then modified (step <b>914</b>) accordingly and applied (step <b>916</b>) to the main amplifier to correct the new offset.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Steps <b>902</b>-<b>916</b> describe the detection and correction of a single transition in an input common-mode level; the current invention is capable, however, of detecting and correcting any number of transitions. For example, the input common-mode level may toggle, at known or unknown intervals in time, between two levels; the preceding discussion may be extended, as one of skill in the art will understand, to apply to ongoing monitoring and correction of an input common-mode level. For example, after the first transition is detected (step <b>910</b>), a second transition back to the first common-mode level may be detected (step <b>918</b>). A third value, which was previously stored (step <b>906</b>) is then switched (step <b>920</b>) for the first and/or second value (whichever one, or both, is currently being used). The offset-correction signal is again modified (step <b>922</b>) and applied (<b>924</b>) to correct the new offset.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described above, the method <b>900</b> describes correcting an offset in one path of an auto-zero amplifier; as one of skill in the art will understand, the method <b>900</b> may be applied to the other half of the amplifier. In accordance with an auto-zero clock, the main amplifier in a first half of the auto-zero amplifier may be in an auto-zero mode (and thus sampling one or more of the first, second, and third values) while the other main amplifier is in a signal-path mode (and thus actively amplifying an input signal).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The methods described above store the offset-correction voltage in capacitors; the current invention, however, is not limited to any particular method of storage. For example, the offset-correction voltage may also be converted to digital format by an analog-to-digital converter; in this embodiment, digital register arrays may be used as offset-storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the above embodiments, the common-mode level steps up and down between only two levels (e.g., &#x2212;2 V to 24 V, &#x2212;2 V to 40 V, or &#x2212;2 V to 76 V). In other embodiments, the common-mode level steps up and down between more than two (e.g., eight) different levels; in these embodiments, more than two (e.g., eight) extra offset-storage devices are used to store the offset-correction voltage for each common-mode level, and the offset-storage devices may be switched in and out in accordance with the methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Certain embodiments of the present invention were described above. It is, however, expressly noted that the present invention is not limited to those embodiments, but rather the intention is that additions and modifications to what was expressly described herein are also included within the scope of the invention.
