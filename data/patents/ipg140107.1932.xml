<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a US National Phase application claiming priority to International Application Serial No. PCT/EP09/62603 having an International Filing Date of Sep. 29, 2009, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method of controlling the operation of an electrostatic precipitator, which is operative for removing dust particles from a process gas and which comprises at least one collecting electrode and at least one discharge electrode, with regard to the conditions of the process gas from which the dust particles are to be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention further relates to a device which is operative for controlling the operation of an electrostatic precipitator.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the combustion of a fuel, such as coal, oil, peat, waste, etc., in a combustion plant, such as a power plant, a hot process gas is generated, such process gas containing, among other components, dust particles, sometimes referred to as fly ash. The dust particles are often removed from the process gas by means of an electrostatic precipitator, also called ESP, for instance of the type illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,502,872.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A combustion plant normally comprises a boiler in which the heat of the hot process gas is utilized for generating steam. The operating conditions of the boiler may vary from time to time depending on the degree of fouling on the heat transfer surfaces, the type and amount of fuel supplied, etc. The varying conditions in the boiler will cause varying conditions of the process gas that leaves the boiler and enters the ESP. The U.S. Pat. No. 4,624,685 describes an attempt to account for the varying process gas conditions in the control of an ESP. The flue gas temperature is accounted for as it has been found, in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 4,624,685, that a higher temperature will result in a higher volumetric flow, the power of the ESP being controlled in accordance with the measured temperature to account for the varying volumetric flow of the process gas. Hence, an increased flue gas temperature is considered as corresponding to an increased volumetric flow requiring an increased power to the ESP.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Operating an ESP in accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 4,624,685 may be successful in the sense that emission limits can be coped with at varying conditions of the process gas. However, the electrical strain on the electrical components of the ESP tends to be quite high.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a method of operating an electrostatic precipitator, ESP, by means of which method the life of the electrostatic precipitator, and in particular its electrical components, can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is achieved by a method of controlling the operation of an electrostatic precipitator, which is operative for removing dust particles from a process gas and which comprises at least one collecting electrode and at least one discharge electrode, with regard to the conditions of the process gas from which the dust particles are to be removed, said method being characterized in comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">utilizing a control strategy for a power to be applied between said at least one collecting electrode and said at least one discharge electrode, said control strategy comprising controlling, directly or indirectly, at least one of a power range and a power ramping rate,</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">measuring the temperature of said process gas,</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">selecting, when said control strategy comprises controlling the power range, a power range based on said measured temperature, an upper limit value of said power range being lower at a high temperature of said process gas, than at a low temperature of said process gas,</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">selecting, when said control strategy comprises controlling the power ramping rate, a power ramping rate based on said measured temperature, said power ramping rate being lower at a high temperature of said process gas, than at a low temperature of said process gas, and</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">controlling the power applied between said at least one collecting electrode and said at least one discharge electrode in accordance with said control strategy.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">An advantage of this method is that the control of the power applied between at least one collecting electrode and at least one discharge electrode is made to depend on the flue gas temperature. Thus, at higher temperatures in the process gas, the power control can be performed in a manner which causes less wear to the electrical components of the electrostatic precipitator.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to one embodiment of the present invention a relation between the process gas temperature, and the power applied between said at least one collecting electrode and said at least one discharge electrode is utilized when selecting said power range and/or said power ramping rate. An advantage of this embodiment is that the power range and/or the power ramping rate can be varied more or less continuously as a function of the temperature of the process gas. In some cases it may be preferable to utilize a relation that also accounts for the removal efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one embodiment of the present invention said control strategy comprises controlling a power ramping rate. The power ramping rate often has a significant impact on the frequency of power cuts. Thus, controlling the power ramping rate in view of the temperature of the process gas tends to decrease the wear on the electrical equipment of the ESP significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one embodiment of the present invention said control strategy comprises controlling both the power range and the power ramping rate. An advantage of this embodiment is that it provides for a large decrease in the strain on the electrical equipment of the ESP, compared to the prior art method.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one embodiment of the present invention said control strategy comprises applying at least two different power ramping rates during one and the same ramping sequence. One advantage of this embodiment is that it becomes possible to introduce more power into to the electrostatic precipitator. Preferably, an initial power ramping rate of said at least two different power ramping rates is higher than at least one following power ramping rate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one embodiment of the present invention said control strategy comprises applying at least two different power ranges during one and the same ramping sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A further object of the present invention is to provide a device which is operative for controlling the power supply of an electrostatic precipitator in such a manner that the life of the electrostatic precipitator, and in particular its electrical equipment, is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">This object is achieved by means of a device for controlling the operation of an electrostatic precipitator which is operative for removing dust particles from a process gas and which comprises at least one collecting electrode and at least one discharge electrode, with regard to the conditions of the process gas from which the dust particles are to be removed, said device being characterized in comprising:</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic side view and illustrates a power plant <b>1</b>, as seen from the side thereof. The power plant <b>1</b> comprises a coal fired boiler <b>2</b>. In the coal fired boiler <b>2</b> coal is combusted in the presence of air generating a hot process gas in the form of so-called flue gas that leaves the coal fired boiler <b>2</b> via a duct <b>4</b>. The flue gas generated in the coal fired boiler <b>2</b> comprises dust particles, that must be removed from the flue gas before the flue gas can be emitted to the ambient air. The duct <b>4</b> conveys the flue gas to an electrostatic precipitator, ESP, <b>6</b> which with respect to the flow direction of the flue gas is located downstream of the boiler <b>2</b>. The ESP <b>6</b> comprises what is commonly referred to as a first field <b>8</b>, a second field <b>10</b>, and a third field <b>12</b>, arranged in series, as seen with respect to the flow direction of the flue gas. The three fields <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> are electrically insulated from each other. Each of the fields <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> is provided with a respective control device <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> controlling the function of a respective rectifier <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each of the fields <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> comprises several discharge electrodes and several collecting electrode plates, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the interest of maintaining clarity of illustration therein, only illustrates one discharge electrode <b>26</b> and one collecting electrode plate <b>28</b> of the first field <b>8</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> it is schematically illustrated how the rectifier <b>20</b> applies power, i.e., voltage and current, between the discharge electrodes <b>26</b> and the collecting electrode plates <b>28</b> of the first field <b>8</b> to charge the dust particles that are present in the flue gas. After being so charged, the dust particles are collected on the collecting electrode plates <b>28</b>. A similar process occurs in the second and third fields <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>. The collected dust is removed from the collecting electrode plates <b>28</b> by means of so-called rapping devices, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and is finally collected in hoppers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A duct <b>36</b> is provided that is designed to be operative for forwarding flue gas, from which at least part of the dust particles have been removed, from the ESP <b>6</b> to a stack <b>38</b>. The stack <b>38</b> releases the flue gas to the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A temperature sensor <b>40</b> is operative for measuring the temperature in the flue gas that is conveyed in the duct <b>4</b>. The temperature sensor <b>40</b> sends a signal, which contains information about the measured flue gas temperature, to the plant control computer <b>42</b>. The plant control computer <b>42</b> sends, in its turn, signals containing information about the measured flue gas temperature to each of the control devices <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. The control devices <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> controls the operation of the respective rectifiers <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> in accordance with principles that will be explained in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram, and illustrates one of the findings upon which the present invention is based. The y-axis of the diagram illustrates the voltage applied, by means of the rectifier <b>20</b>, between the discharge electrodes <b>26</b> and the collecting electrode plates <b>28</b> of the first field <b>8</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The x-axis of the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the temperature in the flue gas as measured by means of the temperature sensor <b>40</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates three curves, each corresponding to a fixed dust particle removal efficiency of the first field <b>8</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> these curves correspond to 60%, 70%, and 80% dust particle removal efficiency of the first field <b>8</b>. As could be expected a higher removal efficiency requires a higher voltage. It has now been found, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, that the power, and, hence, the voltage required to achieve a certain removal efficiency is lower at a higher flue gas temperature, than at a lower flue gas temperature. Thus, for example, the voltage V<b>1</b>, which is required to obtain 60% removal efficiency at a first temperature T<b>1</b>, is higher than the voltage V<b>2</b> which is required to obtain that same removal efficiency at a second temperature T<b>2</b>, which is higher than the first temperature T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The removal of dust particles in the electrostatic precipitator <b>6</b> depends, among other things, on the extent of the electrical corona generated around the discharge electrodes <b>26</b>. A certain removal efficiency of dust particles corresponds to a certain extent of the corona. One possible explanation to the behaviour illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that the voltage required to generate a corona of a certain extent at a high flue gas temperature is lower than the voltage required to generate a corona of that same extent at a low flue gas temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a power control method in accordance with a prior art technique. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the power control of a first field is illustrated, but it will be appreciated that in accordance with the prior art method a similar technique would be applied for all fields of an electrostatic precipitator.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the control device controlling the rectifier of the first field controls the voltage within a set voltage range VR. The voltage range VR has a lower level V<b>0</b> and target voltage level VT. The control device urges the rectifier to apply a starting voltage, being the voltage V<b>0</b>, and to then increase the voltage at a certain voltage ramping rate RR, being the derivative of the voltage curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The objective of the control method in accordance with the prior art is to a apply the voltage level V<b>0</b> and to increase the voltage at the voltage ramping rate RR to reach the target voltage level VT, the intended path of the voltage being indicated by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, at a voltage VS a spark-over occurs between the discharge electrodes and collecting electrode plates and the control device may urge the rectifier to cut the power. After a short period of time, e.g., 1-30 ms, the control device urges the rectifier to apply the voltage V<b>0</b> and to increase the voltage again, in accordance with the voltage ramping rate RR, with the objective of reaching the target voltage VT. It will be appreciated that the voltage VS at which the rate of spark-overs reaches its limit will vary over time, due to varying operating conditions as regards load of dust particles, etc., of the electrostatic precipitator.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is based on the finding illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, i.e., that the temperature of the flue gas influences the power required to achieve a sufficient dust particle removal efficiency. In the embodiment illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the power applied by the rectifier <b>20</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is controlled indirectly by controlling the voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a first step, the latter being illustrated as <b>50</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the temperature of the flue gas is measured, e.g., by means of the temperature sensor <b>40</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In a second step, the latter being illustrated as <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a voltage range is selected based on the temperature as measured in the first step. In a third step, the latter being illustrated as <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a voltage ramping rate is selected based on the temperature as measured in the first step. In a fourth and final step, the latter being illustrated as <b>56</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the voltage applied by the rectifier, e.g. the rectifier <b>20</b>, between the discharge electrodes <b>26</b> and the collecting electrode plates <b>28</b> is controlled in accordance with the selected voltage range and the selected voltage ramping rate. Furthermore, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by means of a loop, the flue gas temperature is then measured again and a new voltage range and a new voltage ramping rate is selected. The frequency of selecting new voltage ranges and new voltage ramping rates can be set based on the expected stability of the flue gas temperature. For some plants it might be sufficient to select new voltage ranges and new voltage ramping rates once every hour, while other plants may require much more frequent selection of voltage ranges and voltage ramping rates, due to the temperature of the flue gas fluctuating at a high frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be appreciated that the control method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> could be applied to each of the control devices <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, or to only one or two of them.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates schematically how a target voltage value can be selected based on the flue gas temperature. The curve illustrated in the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> reflects the desired dust removal efficiency, i.e., 70%. At a temperature T<b>1</b> of, e.g., 150&#xb0; C. a target voltage value VT<b>1</b> is selected, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At a temperature T<b>2</b> of, e.g., 200&#xb0; C. a target voltage value VT<b>2</b> is selected, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The target voltage value VT<b>2</b> selected at the temperature T<b>2</b> is, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, lower than the target voltage value VT<b>1</b> selected at the temperature T<b>1</b>, such temperature T<b>1</b> being lower than the temperature T<b>2</b>. Based on the selected target voltage value a voltage range is selected. The voltage range at the temperature T<b>1</b> could be selected to start at a lower voltage V<b>0</b>, and to end at the selected target voltage value VT<b>1</b>. The voltage range at the temperature T<b>2</b> could be selected to start at the same lower voltage V<b>0</b>, and to end at the selected target voltage value VT<b>2</b>. Hence, the voltage range will be more narrow at the temperature T<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates schematically how a voltage ramping rate value can be selected based on the flue gas temperature. The curve illustrated in the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> reflects empirically found suitable values of voltage ramping rate vs. flue gas temperature. The voltage ramping rate value describes the rate of increasing the voltage in the selected voltage range. The unit of the voltage ramping rate is volts/second. At a temperature T<b>1</b> of, e.g., 150&#xb0; C. a voltage ramping rate value RR<b>1</b> is selected, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. At a temperature T<b>2</b> of, e.g., 200&#xb0; C. a voltage ramping rate value RR<b>2</b> is selected, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The voltage ramping rate value RR<b>2</b> selected at the temperature T<b>2</b> is, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, lower than the voltage ramping rate value RR<b>1</b> selected at the temperature T<b>1</b>, such temperature T<b>1</b> being lower than the temperature T<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the power control method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention and at a temperature T<b>1</b> of, e.g., 150&#xb0; C. Again, the power applied by means of the rectifier <b>20</b> is controlled indirectly by controlling the voltage. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the voltage control of the first field <b>8</b> is depicted, but it will be appreciated also the second and third fields <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> could be controlled in accordance with a similar principle.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the control device <b>14</b> controlling the rectifier <b>20</b> of the first field <b>8</b> controls the voltage within the selected voltage range VR<b>1</b>, such voltage range extending from the lower voltage V<b>0</b> and up to the selected target voltage value VT<b>1</b>, the selection of which has been described hereinbefore with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The control device <b>14</b> urges the rectifier to apply a starting voltage, being the lower voltage V<b>0</b>, and to increase the voltage at the selected voltage ramping rate value RR<b>1</b>, the selection of which has been described hereinbefore with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The objective of the control device <b>14</b> is to increase the voltage at the voltage ramping rate value RR<b>1</b> to reach the target voltage value VT<b>1</b>, the intended path of the voltage being indicated by broken arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. However, at a voltage around the value VS<b>1</b> a spark-over occurs between the discharge electrodes <b>26</b> and the collecting electrode plates <b>28</b> and the control device <b>14</b> may urge the rectifier <b>20</b> to cut the power. After a short period of time, e.g., 1-30 ms, the control device <b>14</b> urges the rectifier <b>20</b> to apply the voltage V<b>0</b> and to increase the voltage again, in accordance with the voltage ramping rate value RR<b>1</b>, with the objective of reaching the target voltage VT<b>1</b>. During a time t, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, totally three cycles of cutting the voltage occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates the power control method in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention and at a temperature T<b>2</b> of, e.g., 200&#xb0; C. As in the case illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the power applied by the rectifier <b>20</b> is controlled indirectly by means of controlling the voltage. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> the voltage control of the first field <b>8</b> is depicted, but it will be appreciated also the second and third fields <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> could be controlled in accordance with a similar principle.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> the control device <b>14</b> controlling the rectifier <b>20</b> of the first field <b>8</b> controls the voltage within the selected voltage range VR<b>2</b>, such voltage range extending from the lower voltage V<b>0</b> and up to the selected target voltage value VT<b>2</b>, the selection of which has been described hereinbefore with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The control device <b>14</b> urges the rectifier <b>20</b> to apply a starting voltage, being the lower voltage V<b>0</b>, and to increase the voltage at the selected voltage ramping rate value RR<b>2</b>, the selection of which has been described hereinbefore with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The objective of the control device <b>14</b> is to increase the voltage at the voltage ramping rate value RR<b>2</b> to reach the target voltage value VT<b>2</b>, the intended path of the voltage being indicated by a broken arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. However, at a voltage around the value VS<b>2</b> a spark-over occurs between the discharge electrodes <b>26</b> and the collecting electrode plates <b>28</b> and the control device <b>14</b> may urge the rectifier <b>20</b> to cut the power. After a short period of time, e.g., 1-30 ms, the control device <b>14</b> urges the rectifier <b>20</b> to apply the voltage V<b>0</b> and to increase the voltage again, in accordance with the voltage ramping rate value RR<b>2</b>, with the objective of reaching the target voltage VT<b>2</b>. During a time t, being that same time as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, less than two cycles of cutting the voltage occurs, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">From a comparison between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> it can be seen that the higher temperature T<b>2</b>, as is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, causes fewer cycles of cutting the power to occur per unit of time, compared to the number of cycles of cutting the power at the lower temperature T<b>1</b>, as is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The effect is that at the higher temperature T<b>2</b> the mechanical and electrical strain on the rectifier <b>20</b> and the other electrical equipment is reduced, thereby increasing the life of the electrostatic precipitator <b>6</b>. Furthermore, the electrical energy supplied to the field <b>8</b>, such electrical energy supply being proportional to the voltage multiplied by the time, i.e., being proportional to the area under the voltage curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, increases due to the fewer power cuts. The increased electrical energy supplied at the flue gas temperature T<b>2</b> increases the removal efficiency of the electrostatic precipitator.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Hence, by accounting for the flue gas temperature in the control of an electrostatic precipitator it is possible to increase the effectiveness of such control and to reduce the wear on the mechanical and electrical components by decreasing the number of spark-overs and by minimising the risk of arcing. The total power input may also increase, leading to an increased dust particle removal efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In accordance with this embodiment the flue gas temperature is accounted for only in the selection of the voltage ramping rate value, but not in the selection of the voltage range, the latter being kept constant, independently of the flue gas temperature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates the situation at a high temperature, T<b>2</b>. The selected target voltage value VT<b>1</b> and the selected voltage range VR<b>1</b> would be the same as when operating at a low temperature, compare the situation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The voltage ramping rate value RR<b>2</b> at the high temperature T<b>2</b> has been selected based on the diagram shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. When comparing the voltage curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> with that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> it is clear that the number of power cuts and the supplied electrical energy is rather similar in those two cases. However, the voltage range VR<b>1</b> of the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is wider than the voltage range VR<b>2</b> of the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and this may, in some situations, lead to an increased electrical strain on the rectifier <b>20</b> when operating in accordance with the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, compared to operating in accordance with the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a further alternative embodiment of the present invention. The situation depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, i.e., the power control has been adapted to a high temperature of, e.g., 200&#xb0; C. by utilizing a power ramping rate which is lower than that which is utilized at a lower flue gas temperature. The difference compared to the situation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is that the voltage ramping rate is not constant during the entire ramping phase. Hence, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the voltage ramping rate is initially rather high, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> by means of a voltage ramping rate A. Then the voltage ramping rate is decreased, as indicated by a voltage ramping rate B. Finally, the voltage ramping rate is again increased, as indicated by a final voltage ramping rate C. One advantage of varying the voltage ramping rate during one and the same sequence is that more power may be introduced in the electrostatic precipitator, since the high initial voltage ramping rate A rather quickly brings the power to a high level. Then this high power level is maintained for a rather long period of time during the low voltage ramping rate B. Finally, the high voltage ramping rate C makes it possible to reach the spark-over situation rather quickly. It will be appreciated that the ramping rate within one and the same sequence can be varied also in other ways to achieve other effects.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to a further alternative embodiment it is possible to vary the selected voltage range VR<b>2</b> during one and the same ramping sequence to improve the control of the amount of power introduced into the electrostatic precipitator. Hence, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the selected voltage range VR<b>2</b> could have a first value during the initial part of the ramping sequence. During a later part of the ramping sequence the selected target voltage value could be increased from VT<b>2</b> to VT<b>2</b>&#x2032; forming a new selected voltage range VR<b>2</b>&#x2032; which is wider than the initial selected voltage range VR<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Hence, it is possible to vary either the voltage ramping rate or the voltage range, or to vary both the voltage ramping rate and the voltage range during one and the same ramping sequence, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In the latter case the selection of the voltage ramping rate and the selection of the voltage range during one and the same ramping sequence could either be dependent or independent of each other.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It will be appreciated that numerous variants of the embodiments described above are possible within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Above it has been described, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref>, that the power applied by the rectifier, such power being the product of the current and the voltage applied, is controlled indirectly by means of controlling the voltage applied, i.e., by means of controlling the voltage range and/or the voltage ramping rate. At the same time the current may be kept constant, or may vary. In the latter case, the current would normally increase at the same time as the controlled parameter, i.e., the voltage, increases, thus resulting in the power, being the product of the current and voltage, increasing. It will be appreciated that other alternatives are also possible. One such alternative is to control the power applied by the rectifier indirectly by means of controlling the current range and/or the current ramping rate, in accordance with similar principles as have been described hereinbefore with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref> concerning the voltage range and the voltage ramping rate. Still further, it would also be possible to control the power indirectly by controlling the voltage and the current simultaneously, i.e., by controlling the voltage and current ranges and/or the voltage and current ramping rates. In accordance with a still further embodiment it would also be possible to have the controller <b>42</b> controlling the power directly, i.e., by controlling the power range and/or the power ramping rate in accordance with similar principles as have been described hereinbefore with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-10</figref> concerning the voltage range and the voltage ramping rate. Hence, the power could either be controlled directly or indirectly, such indirect controlling comprising controlling the voltage and/or the current.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Hereinbefore it has been described that the temperature of the flue gas is measured in the duct <b>4</b> upstream of the electrostatic precipitator <b>6</b>. It will be appreciated that the flue gas temperature can be measured in other locations as well, for example in the duct <b>36</b> or even inside the electrostatic precipitator <b>6</b> itself. The important issue is that the measurement must give a relevant indication of the conditions as regards the flue gas temperature inside the electrostatic precipitator <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Hereinbefore it has been described, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref> and <b>10</b>, that both the voltage range and the voltage ramping rate can be selected based on the flue gas temperature. Furthermore, it has been described hereinbefore, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, that only the voltage ramping rate can be selected based on the flue gas temperature, the voltage range being constant, independently of the flue gas temperature. It will be appreciated that it would also be possible, as a still further alternative, to only select the voltage range based on the flue gas temperature, and to keep the voltage ramping rate constant, independently of the flue gas temperature. Hence, it is possible to select the voltage ramping rate, or the voltage range, or both, with regard to the flue gas temperature at which the electrostatic precipitator <b>6</b> is operating. This applies in a similar manner to cases in which the current is controlled instead of, or together with, the voltage, and to cases in which the power is controlled directly. Thus, a power ramping rate, or a power range, or both, may be selected with regard to the flue gas temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described hereinbefore, each of the control devices <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is operative for receiving a signal containing information about the flue gas temperature, and to select a power range and a power ramping rate accordingly. As one alternative a central unit, such as the plant control computer <b>42</b>, could be operative for receiving the signal containing information about the flue gas temperature, and to select the power range, and/or the power ramping rate, which are then distributed to each of the control devices <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While the present invention has been found to be effective for most types of dust particles, it has been found to be particularly efficient for so-called low resistivity dusts, i.e., dusts having a bulk resistivity of less than 1*10E10 ohm*cm, as measured in accordance with, e.g., IEEE Std 548-1984: &#x201c;IEEE Standard Criteria and Guidelines for the Laboratory Measurement and Reporting of Fly Ash Resistivity&#x201d;, of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc, New York, USA.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It has been described hereinbefore that the target voltage value is selected based on the flue gas temperature, and that the selected target voltage value is utilized for selecting a voltage range within which the voltage is controlled. In the examples described hereinbefore a lower voltage V<b>0</b> of the selected voltage ranges has always been fixed, independently of the flue gas temperature. It will be appreciated, however, that it is possible to select also the lower limit, i.e., the lower voltage V<b>0</b>, of the voltage range based on an operating parameter, such as the measured flue gas temperature. In the latter case the lower voltage V<b>0</b> of the respective voltage range could be lower at higher flue gas temperatures than at lower flue gas temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">To summarize, a method of controlling the operation of an electrostatic precipitator <b>6</b> comprises utilizing a control strategy for a power to be applied between at least one collecting electrode <b>28</b> and at least one discharge electrode <b>26</b>, said control strategy comprising controlling, directly or indirectly, a power range and/or a power ramping rate. The temperature of said process gas is measured. When said control strategy comprises controlling the power range, a power range VR<b>1</b>, VR<b>2</b> is selected based on said measured temperature, an upper limit value VT<b>1</b>, VT<b>2</b> of said power range being lower at a high temperature T<b>2</b> of said process gas, than at a low temperature T<b>1</b>. When said control strategy comprises controlling the power ramping rate, a power ramping rate RR<b>1</b>, RR<b>2</b> is selected based on said measured temperature, said power ramping rate being lower at a high temperature T<b>2</b> of said process gas, than at a low temperature T<b>1</b>. The power applied between said at least one collecting electrode <b>28</b> and said at least one discharge electrode <b>26</b> is controlled in accordance with said control strategy.</p>
