<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to devices for administering, delivering, injecting or dispensing substances, and to methods of making and using such devices. More particularly, it relates to such devices, including, for example, injection devices, injection pens, etc., for dispensing medicinal substances, such as insulin or hormones, in selected amounts or doses. More particularly, the present invention relates to an injection device with a volume for accommodating a product or substance for administration, with a piston to act upon the product within the volume, and with a stopper which can be arranged between the end of the piston facing the product and the product within the volume.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various infusion devices that provide for retention of an inserted stopper via a thread or an overpressure valve are known. Such known devices are relatively expensive to manufacture and pose safety risks due to awkward handling requirements. It some embodiments, the present disclosure aims to at least partially eliminate disadvantages associated with such known devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to an injection device with a retention or retaining feature for an inserted stopper which is relatively easy to construct and, which, therefore is less expensive relative to known devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, the present invention comprises an injection device comprising a volume or substance containing space for accommodating a substance or product to be administered, a piston for acting upon the product within the volume, and a stopper which can be arranged between an end of the piston facing the product and the product within the volume, wherein the piston includes a piston head configured to be sealed in a gas-tight manner, the piston head being separate from the stopper such that a negative pressure or vacuum region can be developed between the piston head and the stopper.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, the present disclosure is directed to an injection device that is easy to handle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment of the present invention, a piston is provided with a piston head which can be sealed in a gas-tight manner and which is separate from the stopper such that a negative pressure or vacuum region can be developed between the piston head and the stopper.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the stopper retention may therefore be effected by generating a negative pressure or a vacuum. While the stopper is moved forward in the usual way by the piston head, the negative pressure region or vacuum region between the stopper and the piston head prohibits an unintended movement of the stopper, since the negative pressure in the intermediate space would be intensified by a movement of the stopper without a participating movement of the head. Thus, an unintended separate movement of the stopper is either substantially reduced or damped or, if low forces or forces that are not too great act on the stopper, such unintended movements are prevented from the outset.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, if a patient is connected via a conventional injection device and an associated infusion set to a supply, different forces can act on the stopper. These potential forces include a negative pressure in the environment relative to the pressure in the volume of the injection device, and the hydrostatic pressure caused by the height difference between the puncture site of the infusion set on the body of the patient and the injection device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, additional frictional forces may arise between the volume wall of the injection device and the stopper. These frictional forces can vary greatly, such that genuinely reproducible administration parameters are not available. While in one injection device the stopper may experience no unintended displacement at relatively high forces, which are exerted on it by the environment, in other similarly designed injection devices an unintended displacement can easily occur in the same environment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, the negative pressure or vacuum region provided between the stopper and the piston head may make available a range of forces in order to secure the stopper against the attacking forces, so as to be able to avoid an unintended administration of a medicament or product.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the piston head comprises a sealing lip which extends about the full circumference and which provides a gas-tight seal with respect to the volume wall. In this way, the piston head can be moved to and fro, allowing a vacuum or negative pressure region to develop between the stopper and the piston head. On the other hand, it is also possible to design the piston head with a sufficiently exact fit without sealing lip, such that it can provide a seal with respect to the volume wall in order to be able to develop a negative pressure or a vacuum between the stopper and the head.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, if a sealing lip is provided, the latter can advantageously have a predetermined leakage arrangement counter to the direction of insertion of the piston head. In an illustrative embodiment, when the piston head is pushed into the volume, the sealing lip is able to snap round counter to the direction of insertion of the piston head and thus cause a leakage by which air or gas inside the free volume can escape, i.e. until the piston head hits the stopper. If, after the head has hit the stopper, the piston head is then pulled, a negative pressure region is set up, the sealing lip being suitably designed on its outer circumference such that it can provide a sealing action. The sealing lip can be provided, for example on the edge or near the edge of its side facing toward the stopper, with a structure, for example a radially extending groove structure, which does not extend through the sealing lip in the axial direction of the sealing lip or of the piston head.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, to generate the vacuum between the stopper and the piston head, it does not have to be necessary to pull on the piston head, i.e. no reverse movement of the piston head is needed to generate the vacuum. A folding around of the sealing lip may be needed to release the piston head from the stopper, since in this way air can flow into the space and the vacuum is thus lost or the connection between stopper and piston head broken.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, it is also possible for the piston rod, on which the piston head is secured, to be designed in such a way that the overpressure occurring upon insertion of the piston head can escape through it. For example, the piston rod can be made partly hollow or can be designed with an inner conduit that is able to open and close, such that an overpressure can escape via the piston rod. After the overpressure has escaped, the conduit is closed, for example by means of a stopper, a valve, a film or the like, such that upon subsequent loading of the stopper or of the piston head an unintended displacement of the stopper can be avoided by the developing low pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the piston head may be designed with another type of sealing arrangement, for example a separate or integrally formed O-ring. This O-ring is then also able to provide a seal with respect to the wall of the volume.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, in one embodiment, such a head or a head per se according to the present invention can also be designed with at least one valve. Such a valve can be provided, for example, in the form of a one-way valve, i.e. the valve opens when the piston head is inserted into the volume, such that an overpressure can escape. After the overpressure has escaped or when the piston rod is pulled, the one-way valve closes and a vacuum can be developed between the head and the stopper, which, as has been explained above, can perform its positive effects. The valve can prevent air from flowing into the vacuum. In this way, displacement, however small, of the stopper can result in a negative pressure in the volume, which acts against potentially attacking forces such as negative pressure in the environment or hydrostatic pressure forces. The greater the unintended displacement of the stopper away from the piston, the greater is the counterforce that is built up by the negative pressure and that moves the piston back to the starting position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the valve arrangement can also be in the form of a two-way valve, in particular when the latter is designed with different trigger pressures. Thus, the trigger pressure upon insertion of the piston head can be set lower than the trigger pressure upon withdrawal of the piston head. The trigger pressure upon withdrawal and the retention force to be applied thereby is greater than the maximum potential environmental tensile forces acting on the stopper.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this way, in some embodiments, it is possible for a reusable injection device having the features according to the present invention to be made easy to reuse. When the higher pressure of the two-way valve has been overcome, the piston head can be pulled out using the piston rod, and the volume or substance containing area can be cleaned to be able to reuse the whole device according to the present invention. It is also possible to dispose of the volume with the stopper after emptying or after use and to use another volume or container with fresh product or medicament or the like and to use the same piston head, optionally after a cleaning procedure, e.g. in a new volume or with a new ampoule.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the stopper can be formed with a cavity that is located in the axial direction of the stopper opposite the piston head to favor the inverting movement of the sealing lips, wherein the negative pressure region is formed between head and stopper.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, two valves corresponding to the abovementioned two-way valve can also be dimensioned and provided separately, instead of a single two-way valve with the aforementioned features.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment of a valve arrangement for the device according to the present invention, a through-opening of a valve is closed with a membrane which can be moved freely or with limited freedom in the air or gas outlet direction, while the membrane is supported in the air inlet direction. By the support in the air inlet direction, a sealing contact for membrane support can be achieved, i.e. to the environment of the valve opening, such that a sufficient negative pressure or vacuum pressure can be developed between the stopper and the piston head.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the present invention, it has been found that a smaller negative pressure or vacuum region between piston head and stopper leads to a greater retention force for the stopper, which acts against unintended displacement of the stopper. The table below provides examples of retention forces (F) upon displacement (dX) of the stopper, with the piston head stationary.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is to be appreciated that the parameters and parameter values shown above are provided by way of illustration only and that the parameters and parameter values may be varied as suitable in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the retaining force, which can be effected according to the present invention by the vacuum or corresponding negative pressure that can be developed between the stopper and the head, may also depend on other parameters, for example the cross section of the ampule, i.e. the cross section of the volume with the product to be administered, and the volume of the negative pressure or vacuum region prior to displacement of the piston head, this volume being designated as V<sub>0</sub>. The pressure p<sub>0 </sub>in the negative pressure or vacuum region prior to displacement may also play a role. In one embodiment, the air in the negative pressure or vacuum region is able to escape easily when the head is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, if the stopper in a device according to the present invention is displaced by a distance dX shown in the table, a volume V<sub>error </sub>of a medicament or the like is accidentally administered to the patient. The stopper can only be displaced here unintentionally if the pressure in the front part of the liquid path for delivering the medicament or the product is lower than the pressure in the negative pressure or vacuum region. This lower force can occur in the front part of the liquid path on account of forces that act on the overall force diagram, for example the negative pressure in the environment or the hydrostatic pressure in the whole infusion set. Moreover, to ensure that the stopper moves forward, the stopper friction also has to be overcome.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The table provided above has been drawn up on the premise that the cross-sectional surface area of the volume container the product or substance to be delivered amounts to approximately 80 mm<sup>2</sup>, wherein a negative pressure in the environment of the device according to the present invention is in a range of &#xb1;150 mb, which can result in an additional force of &#xb1;1.2 Nmax. The hydrostatic pressure can be approximately &#xb1; 0.8 N with 1 m liquid column in the infusion set. Accordingly, in one embodiment, if the retaining forces, which can be applied by the negative pressure or vacuum region between the piston head and the stopper, at least slightly exceed the attacking forces varying in an area, the unintended displacement and thus an unintended administration of a medicament cannot take place.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be appreciated that any of the embodiments, features, functions and/or structures described herein may be used cooperatively and/or to complement each other.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With regard to fastening, mounting, attaching or connecting components of the present invention, unless specifically described as otherwise, conventional mechanical fasteners and methods may be used. Other appropriate fastening or attachment methods include adhesives, welding and soldering, the latter particularly with regard to the electrical system of the invention, if any. In embodiments with electrical features or components, suitable electrical components and circuitry, wires, wireless components, chips, boards, microprocessors, inputs, outputs, displays, control components, etc. may be used. Generally, unless otherwise indicated, the materials for making the invention and/or its components may be selected from appropriate materials such as metal, metallic alloys, ceramics, plastics, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>depicts a product, substance or medicament <b>12</b> accommodated within a containing volume <b>14</b> that is able to deliver the medicament <b>12</b> to a patient via a delivery means, e.g. an infusion set <b>22</b>. At the lower end of the volume <b>14</b>, which may be a cylindrical ampoule, a stopper <b>16</b> is accommodated in the interior thereof, said stopper <b>16</b> providing a liquid-tight and air-tight seal with respect to the wall of the volume <b>14</b>. Adjacent to the stopper <b>16</b> there is a piston head <b>18</b>, on which a piston rod <b>20</b> is centrally mounted. The overall configuration may have a cylinder symmetry, but can configured in any shape. The piston head <b>18</b> is in direct contact with the stopper <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>depicts the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, whereby a force has been applied to the piston rod <b>20</b>. The piston head <b>18</b> has thus been drawn away from the stopper <b>16</b>, and a negative pressure or vacuum region <b>24</b> has developed between the piston head <b>18</b> and the stopper <b>16</b>, which region, for purposes of illustration, is shown larger than it would actually be.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>shows one embodiment of a head or piston head <b>18</b> on which a stopper <b>16</b> is once again mounted. A lip or sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a </i>is arranged about the full circumference of the piston head. This sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a </i>can perform its sealing action between the head <b>18</b> and the wall of the volume <b>14</b>. The arrangement of the sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a </i>about the full circumference can be seen better still from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b</i>. The piston rod can be designed with a thread such that, by rotation of the piston rod <b>20</b> designed as a threaded rod, the piston head <b>18</b> can be driven forward, or, by rotation in the opposite direction, the piston head <b>18</b> can be drawn back. The sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a </i>provided about the full circumference can perform its sealing function in each case.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts insertion of a piston head into an injection device in various operating stages, according to some embodiments of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>depicts the piston head <b>18</b> outside the volume <b>14</b>, and the sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a </i>therefore not yet in contact with the inner surface of the wall of the volume <b>14</b>. A region <b>23</b> indicates that that there is still an air volume <b>14</b> here within the volume <b>14</b>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>, the piston head <b>18</b> is now inserted into the volume <b>14</b>, and the sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; now deforms counter to the direction of advance of the piston rod <b>20</b>. In this state of deformation, the sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; is permeable only to gas outflow, such that the air can escape from the volume <b>23</b>. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c</i>, the piston head finally comes into contact with the stopper <b>16</b>, and the advance movement of the piston head <b>18</b> ends in this position. The sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, deformed in its open position, has now let almost all of the air out of the region <b>23</b>, which is now no longer present. In this state of deformation, the sealing lip is tight against entry of air into the vacuum region.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">After the emptying and for removal of the volume, the piston rod <b>20</b> is pulled according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>d</i>, specifically counter to the direction of insertion. As soon as the tensile force exceeds a critical value, the sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; snaps round from its position oriented counter to the direction of insertion according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>d </i>and into a position according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>e</i>. The sealing lip <b>18</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; now provides a nonsealing surface for air flowing into the vacuum region and thus permits release of the piston head from the stopper.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a stopper <b>16</b><i>a </i>shaped in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The geometry of the stopper <b>16</b><i>a </i>is such that the sliding of the stopper into the volume generates much lower forces than its withdrawal. This permits reliable and simple removal of the piston head. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the head comes from below to bear partially on the stopper <b>16</b><i>a</i>, while the product that is to be administered is stored above the stopper.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the stopper <b>16</b><i>a </i>can have one or more radial indentations <b>16</b><i>b </i>to reduce the friction between the wall of the volume <b>14</b> and the stopper <b>16</b><i>a</i>. An additional sealing action can also be applied via edges between the indentations <b>16</b><i>b </i>and the wall of the volume <b>14</b>. A cavity <b>16</b><i>c </i>can be provided in the stopper facing the piston head <b>18</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) in order to aid the development of the negative pressure region <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>shows an alternative form of the piston head <b>18</b> with piston rod <b>20</b>. As shown, one or more valve arrangements <b>30</b> may be built into the head. The valve arrangements <b>30</b> may be one-way valves or two-way valves. A sealing action is made available by an integrally formed or separately provided O-ring seal <b>18</b><i>a</i>. The position of the valve <b>30</b> can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, as well as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, which depicts a first valve <b>30</b> and a second valve <b>30</b>&#x2032;. For example, with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the first valve <b>30</b> may be active in a first direction, and the second valve <b>30</b>&#x2032; may be active in a second direction, which is generally opposite the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is of course also possible to make the piston rod <b>20</b> hollow and to permit escape of air from the vacuum or negative pressure region <b>24</b> at its upper end simply by means a stopper or a closure piece or other suitable sealing arrangement, in order then to close the flow path through the rod <b>20</b> to make available the desired vacuum or the desired negative pressure region <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a valve arrangement in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, the valve arrangement being inexpensive to produce and yet able to fulfil the desired function. The surrounding wall of the head <b>18</b> can be seen according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>. The head is provided with a hole, which here represents a valve opening. The valve <b>30</b>, which can correspond to the valve according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, has a valve opening <b>30</b><i>a</i>. The valve opening <b>30</b><i>a </i>is sealed by a membrane <b>30</b><i>b</i>, wherein the membrane is adhesively bonded on the left-hand side to the valve head for example, or is secured by a securing structure or feature <b>30</b><i>c</i>. On the opposite side, the valve membrane <b>30</b><i>b </i>is in contact with a contact seal <b>30</b><i>d </i>which, for example, can be made of silicone, rubber or plastic. In a starting state according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, the valve film or valve membrane <b>30</b><i>b</i>, held by a securing means <b>30</b><i>c</i>, bears on the contact seal <b>30</b><i>d </i>and will close the opening <b>30</b><i>a </i>in the rest position.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">If the valve head is now inserted into the volume <b>14</b>, the valve membrane <b>30</b><i>b </i>according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c </i>is deflected by the overpressure within the air or gas volume <b>23</b>, and the air can escape from the hollow space between the stopper <b>16</b> and the head <b>18</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>c </i>and <b>6</b><i>d</i>, the valve membrane <b>30</b><i>b </i>previously in contact with the contact seal <b>30</b><i>d </i>lifts away from the contact seal <b>30</b><i>d</i>, for example by pretensioning of the valve membrane <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The outlet deformation <b>40</b> for the valve membrane <b>30</b><i>b </i>thus permits the desired function, which is intended to permit the escape of an overpressure between the head <b>18</b> and the stopper <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After the air has escaped, and as soon as the valve head <b>18</b> is pulled, an overpressure acts from outside on the valve membrane <b>30</b><i>b </i>according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>e </i>and <b>6</b><i>f</i>, which leads to a sealing or closing deformation <b>40</b>&#x2032; for the valve membrane <b>30</b><i>b</i>. The desired low-pressure region or vacuum region <b>24</b> can now be made available between the head <b>18</b> and the stopper <b>16</b>.</p>
