<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aspects of the present invention generally relate to a sheet feeding device and an image forming apparatus, and specifically to a device that separates and feeds sheets by blowing an air to the sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the related art, an image forming apparatus, such as a printer or a copying machine, includes a sheet feeding device that feeds sheets one by one loaded in a tray that supports a plurality of sheets. As the sheet feeding device, an air feeding method is known that blows air to an edge of a sheet bundle supported in the tray to float a plurality of sheets while loosening the sheets, and draws the sheet onto a suction conveyance belt disposed at the upper side to feed the sheet one by one. This technology has been discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,575,231.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the meantime, a conveying method is discussed that separately conveys sheets one by one at a predetermined interval by a sheet feeding unit, while partially overlaying the sheets being conveyed. In this conveying method, the sheets are continuously conveyed by a conveyance belt and fallen at the downstream side of the conveyance belt. A delivery belt and a pressing roller are provided in an apparatus employing this conveyance method. The delivery belt receives and further conveys the fallen sheets. The pressing roller presses a leading edge of the sheet which is inclined between the conveyance belt and delivery belt.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the conveying method that uses these belts, the delivery belt is driven at a sufficiently slower speed than the conveyance belt. Therefore, a sheet is conveyed in a state where a trailing edge of a preceding sheet is hanging on the conveyance while a leading edge thereof is hanging on the delivery belt such that a leading edge of a subsequent sheet is overlaid with the trailing edge of the preceding sheet. This technology is discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 11-217148.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As described above, since the sheets are conveyed to overlay with each other in a stable state owing to the pressing roller that presses the leading edge of the sheet, it is possible to increase a conveyance amount of sheets in a unit time without increasing a driving speed of the roller or the belt in a conveyance path. Further, by suppressing the driving speed to be low, it is further possible to satisfy a certain performance even when a small size and low speed actuator is used as a driving source. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the increase in the cost, an operation noise, and power consumption to be low even when the actuator is driven at a high speed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, when the feeding unit of the air feeding method in the related art and a conveyance unit that conveys sheets to overlay with each other are combined, after separately delivering the sheets one by one from the feeding unit, the conveyance unit conveys sheets in an overlaid state to improve productivity. In this case, in order to improve the productivity by increasing a conveyance amount of the sheets, even though the conveyance amount of sheets is increased by the overlay conveyance in the conveyance unit, a feeding speed in the feeding unit that delivers the sheet to the conveyance unit goes up in proportion to a quantity of production. Therefore this method may not contribute to the lowering of the speed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">If a mechanism which conveys the sheets by the air feeding method while overlaying with each other is provided in the conveyance path, a size of the entire sheet feeding device becomes larger. Further, in order to perform overlay conveyance, two conveying speeds need to be provided, which may make apparatus control complicated.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to aspects of the present invention, a sheet feeding device and an image forming apparatus are capable of reducing a feeding speed without lowering a production quantity of sheets with a simple configuration and improving sheet conveying efficiency while the sheets are fed to overlay with each other by an air feeding method.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of the present invention, a sheet feeding device includes an elevatable tray that supports a sheet, an air blowing unit that blows air toward the sheet supported by the tray to float the sheet, a suction conveyance member that draws and conveys the sheet floated by driving the air blowing unit, a negative pressure generation part that has a suction opening that applies a negative pressure for sheet suction to the suction conveyance member, a shutter member that moves between a closing position where the suction opening in an upstream side in the sheet feeding direction is partially closed and an open position where the suction opening is opened, and a controlling unit that is, in a driving state of the negative pressure generation part, configured to control the shutter member to follow a preceding sheet that is drawn onto the suction conveyance member, to move to a downstream side in the feeding direction to close the suction opening, and return to the open position at a predetermined timing to draw the sheets onto the suction conveyance member in a state where an upstream edge of the preceding sheet in the feeding direction and a downstream edge of the subsequent sheet in the feeding direction are overlaid by a predetermined amount in a driving state of the negative pressure generation part.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> includes first and second sheet feeding devices <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> at upper and lower sides. In the sheet feeding devices <b>311</b> and <b>312</b>, sheet storages <b>11</b> and <b>11</b> that store a sheet bundle and suction conveyance mechanisms <b>51</b> and <b>51</b> that feed the sheets stored in the sheet storages <b>11</b> and <b>11</b> are provided. In this exemplary embodiment, the suction conveyance mechanisms <b>51</b> and <b>51</b> use an air feeding method and feed the sheet while an endless belt is drawing the sheet at the time of a sheet feeding operation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Here, the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> sequentially feeds and conveys the sheets in each of the sheet storages <b>11</b> and <b>11</b> in an overlaid state according to sheet request information from the main body <b>300</b>. Further, the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> conveys a leading sheet to a conveyance sensor <b>50</b> which is disposed in a transfer part transferring a sheet to the image forming apparatus <b>300</b>A. The sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> notifies the main body <b>300</b> that sheet delivery is ready after the conveyance is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The main body <b>300</b> receives the notification that delivery is ready, from the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> and notifies a delivery request to the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b>. The sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> sequentially conveys the overlaid sheets to the main body <b>300</b> for every notification of the delivery request. In this case, a sheet conveying speed in the main body <b>300</b> is two times or higher than that in the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b>. The main body <b>300</b> separately draws sheets from the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> so as to separate the sheets one by one to sequentially form an image.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">At a time when a leading edge of the sheet delivered from the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> reaches a conveyance roller nip disposed at a most upstream side of the main body <b>300</b>, the sheets are separately drawn by the conveyance roller of the main body <b>300</b> one by one and discharged. The sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> completes the feeding operation at a time when the number of overlaid sheets requested by the main body <b>300</b> is fed and conveyed. The sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> completes the operation and enters a stand-by state after separately drawing and discharging the overlaid sheet group by the main body <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sheet conveyed by the suction conveyance mechanism <b>51</b> of the first sheet feeding device <b>311</b> is fed to the main body <b>300</b> through a first conveyance part <b>317</b> and a joint conveyance part <b>319</b>. The sheet conveyed by the suction conveyance mechanism <b>51</b> of the second sheet feeding device <b>312</b> is fed to the main body <b>300</b> through a lower conveyance part <b>318</b> and the joint conveyance part <b>319</b>. A conveyance stepping motor (not illustrated) is provided in each of the conveyance parts <b>317</b> to <b>319</b> and a conveyance control part (not illustrated) controls the motors to rotate the conveyance roller of each of the conveyance parts to feed the sheet. The driving of the stepping motor of each of the conveyance parts is mechanically transmitted to rotate the conveyance roller of each part to convey the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">On a top surface of the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b>, an escape tray <b>101</b> that forcibly discharges a sheet in an abnormal state caused by double feeding or jam is disposed. A full load detection sensor <b>102</b> is provided to detect a full load of the sheet discharged to the escape tray <b>101</b>. Further, a plurality of displacement sensors is provided for a pair of rollers on the conveyance path of the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> to detect the passage of the leading edge and the trailing edge of the sheet on the conveyance path.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A switching member <b>310</b> operates to select a conveyance path <b>390</b> leading to the escape tray <b>101</b> when the abnormal state of the sheet is detected and operates to select a conveyance path <b>381</b> leading to an image forming part <b>307</b> when a sheet is in a normal state. When the sheet is in the abnormal state, the sheet S is discharged to the escape tray <b>101</b>. In contrast, when the sheet is in the normal state, an image forming operation is performed based on image data received by the image forming part <b>307</b> from when the sheet is detected by an image reference sensor <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A feeding operation is performed by the suction conveyance mechanisms <b>51</b> and <b>51</b> provided in each of the feeding units. A plurality of fans, which will be described below, is provided in the suction conveyance mechanisms <b>51</b> and <b>51</b> to control the sheet air-feeding. At the time of the feeding operation of the suction conveyance mechanisms <b>51</b> and <b>51</b>, the fan is controlled to blow air between the sheets S in the sheet storages <b>11</b> and <b>11</b> from the downstream side of the conveying direction.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the sheets S are loosened, the sheets are drawn to a suction conveyance belt <b>21</b> by the suction from a suction opening <b>34</b><i>a</i>. The suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>is disposed inside the suction conveyance belt <b>21</b>, which has an endless belt shape as will be described below. Sheets are fed and conveyed while a part of a preceding sheet is overlaid with a part of a subsequent sheet. The suction conveyance belt <b>21</b> constitutes a suction conveyance member that draws the sheet S floated by driving of an air blowing unit <b>29</b> to convey the sheet. Details of the overlay conveying operation of the suction conveyance mechanisms <b>51</b> and <b>51</b> will be discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The main body <b>300</b> forms an image on the sheet S fed by the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b>. On the top surface of the main body <b>300</b>, the manipulation part <b>302</b> is provided to allow the user to set an operation of the image forming apparatus <b>300</b>A (image forming system). Further, a reader scanner <b>303</b> is disposed above the main body <b>300</b> to read an original image. The main body <b>300</b> includes the image forming part (sheet processing part) <b>307</b> which serves as an image forming unit. The image forming unit includes a photosensitive drum <b>353</b>, a laser scanner unit <b>354</b>, a development part <b>352</b>, and an intermediate transfer belt <b>355</b>, a fixing part <b>308</b>, and a reversing conveyance part <b>309</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the main body <b>300</b>, after receiving the sheet from the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b>, the conveyance part is controlled to convey the sheet. The image forming part <b>307</b> performs the image forming operation based on the received image data from when the image reference sensor <b>305</b> detects the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">At the time of image forming operation, if the image reference sensor <b>305</b> detects the sheet, a semiconductor laser (not illustrated) in the laser scanner unit <b>354</b> is controlled to be turned on/off and also the intensity of the semiconductor laser is controlled. Further, the scanner motor that controls a polygon mirror (not illustrated) to be rotated is subjected to control. Thus, the laser light is radiated on the photosensitive drum <b>353</b> based on the image data and a latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum <b>353</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, in the development part <b>352</b>, toner is fed from a toner bottle <b>351</b> to develop the latent image on the photosensitive drum <b>353</b> and the developed toner image is primarily transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>355</b> from the photosensitive drum <b>353</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thereafter, the toner image which is transferred onto the intermediate transfer belt <b>355</b> is secondarily transferred onto the sheet to form a toner image on the sheet. Just before the secondary transfer position, a registration control part <b>306</b> is provided. The registration control part <b>306</b> corrects a skew of the sheet which is placed just before the transfer position. Further, the registration control part <b>306</b> controls the sheet conveyance to minutely adjust the toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt <b>355</b> and a position of the leading edge of the sheet to match with each other without stopping the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, after the secondary transferring, the sheet is conveyed to the fixing part <b>308</b>, where heat and pressure are applied to the toner to be fixed on the sheet. Further, after the fixing, if the image is continuously printed (formed) on a rear surface of the sheet or the front and rear surfaces of the sheet are inversed, the sheet is conveyed to the reversing conveyance part <b>309</b>. Further, when the printing is completed, the sheet is conveyed to the sheet processing device <b>304</b> at the downstream side.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The sheet processing device <b>304</b> is connected to the downstream side of the image forming apparatus <b>300</b>A to perform desired processing (bending, stapling, or punching) set in the manipulation part <b>302</b> by the user on the sheet discharged from the main body <b>300</b>, on which the image is formed. Thereafter, the sheets are sequentially output to any one of discharging trays <b>360</b> as a resultant to be provided to the user. The sheet processing device <b>304</b> constitutes a sheet processing part which is a post-processing part that performs post processing on the sheet on which the image is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, a schematic configuration of the first and second feeding devices <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> of the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view illustrating a configuration of the second sheet feeding device <b>312</b> in the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b>. The first sheet feeding device <b>311</b> has a configuration similar to the second sheet feeding device <b>312</b>. Therefore, the description of the configuration of the first sheet feeding device <b>311</b> may be substituted by the description of the second sheet feeding device <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sheet storage <b>11</b> disposed in the second sheet feeding device <b>312</b> has a tray <b>12</b> on which a plurality of sheets S is loaded (that is, the tray <b>12</b> is elevatable while supporting the sheets S). The sheet storage <b>11</b> has a trailing edge regulating plate <b>13</b> that regulates a trailing edge which is disposed at an upstream edge in a sheet feeding direction (a horizontal direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).

The sheet storage <b>11</b> further includes slide rails <b>15</b> and <b>15</b> provided at upstream and downstream sides in the sheet feeding direction.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A sheet trailing edge pressing part <b>18</b> is provided above the trailing edge regulating plate <b>13</b> which is slidable up and down and rotatable as a pressing member. The trailing edge regulating plate <b>13</b> presses the trailing edge of the uppermost sheet Sa to separate the sheets. The sheet trailing edge pressing part <b>18</b> also serves as a trailing edge surface detection sensor <b>18</b> which is provided in a position of the trailing edge regulating plate <b>13</b> facing a sheet surface.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The trailing edge surface detection sensor <b>18</b> is disposed in the position of the trailing edge regulating plate <b>13</b> facing the sheet surface. The trailing edge surface detection sensor <b>18</b> moves along a sheet surface in an arrow I direction (vertical direction) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and detects a paper surface height when the sheet S is floated by a blowing fan <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The sheet storage <b>11</b> can be pulled out from the sheet feeding unit <b>301</b> by a slide rail <b>15</b>. If the sheet storage <b>11</b> is pulled out to a front side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tray <b>12</b> descends to a predetermined position to replenish or exchange the sheet. Further, a suction conveyance mechanism <b>51</b> of the sheet air-feeding type that separately feeds the sheets S one by one is disposed above the sheet storage <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The suction conveyance mechanism <b>51</b> includes a suction conveyance part <b>23</b>, the air blowing unit <b>29</b>, and a draw roller pair <b>42</b>. The suction conveyance part <b>23</b> draws and conveys the sheet S loaded in the tray <b>12</b>. The air blowing unit <b>29</b> floats and loosens an upper portion of the sheet bundle on the tray to separate the sheets S one by one. The air blowing unit <b>29</b> blows the air toward the sheets S supported in the tray <b>12</b> to float the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The suction conveyance part <b>23</b> has the suction conveyance belt <b>21</b> that rotates in a counter-clockwise direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> wound around a pair of belt driving rollers <b>41</b> and <b>41</b>.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the suction conveyance mechanism <b>51</b> is in a state where a JOB is instructed by the user and the feeding operation is started according to sheet request information from the image forming apparatus <b>300</b>A. Upper sheets Sa, Sb, and Sc among the sheets in the sheet storage <b>11</b> are loosened at regular intervals by the blowing air (arrow C) by the air blowing unit <b>29</b>. Here, the height of the sheets is managed to stably loosen the upper sheets and an air volume of the blowing air is controlled according to the detected height of the trailing edge surface detection sensor <b>18</b> disposed in the trailing edge regulating plate <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A separation air in the arrow D direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is also controlled to be synchronized with the blowing air (arrow C) by the air blowing unit <b>29</b>. The suction fan <b>36</b> of the suction conveyance mechanism <b>51</b> starts driving following the driving of the blowing fan <b>32</b> and discharges the suction air in the arrow F direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. The duct opening/closing member <b>37</b> closes the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and waits for a predetermined time until the suction fan <b>36</b> becomes stable and the sheets are stably loosened by the blowing air. Further, the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> is fully accommodated within the belt guide part <b>27</b> and positioned in an outer periphery waiting position of the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a</i>. In this case, the belt driving roller <b>41</b> and the draw roller pair <b>42</b> are in a stopped state.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Continuously, in the suction conveyance mechanism <b>51</b>, after a predetermined time elapses, the duct opening/closing member <b>37</b> rotates in the arrow J direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> to generate a negative pressure from the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>for the sheet. Thus, the uppermost sheet Sa is drawn onto a portion of the suction conveyance belt <b>21</b> which faces the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a</i>. Simultaneously with the rotation of the duct opening/closing member <b>37</b> in the arrow J direction, the belt driving roller <b>41</b> is driven to start the rotation of the suction conveyance belt <b>21</b> in the arrow direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> and start the rotation of the draw roller pair <b>42</b> in the arrow direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Therefore, the uppermost sheet Sa drawn onto the suction conveyance belt <b>21</b> is delivered toward the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the uppermost sheet Sa is continuously conveyed and the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> moves in the arrow H direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> at a time when a distance between the trailing edge of the uppermost sheet Sa and an outer periphery of the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>in the upstream side in the conveying direction becomes a distance y. That is, driving of the belt driving motor <b>200</b> starts so that the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> protrudes along the opening portion opening/closing guide <b>202</b> in the arrow H direction. In this case, a moving speed Vh of the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> in the arrow H direction is equal to a feeding speed Vs of the preceding sheet Sa and controlled to show a relationship of Vh=Vs.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Continuously, the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> moves to protrude in the same direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> temporally stops at a position x in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, and then returns to the arrow K direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> when the belt driving motor <b>200</b> reversely drives the belt.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the trailing edge of the uppermost sheet Sa which is continuously delivered is conveyed by a distance corresponding to y to the position of x.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> returns to the outer periphery of the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>to be in an open position, so that the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>is opened to the sheet Sb which is subsequent to the uppermost sheet Sa and a negative pressure is applied to the sheet Sb. Thus, a portion of the trailing edge of the uppermost sheet Sa corresponding to the distance x, and a portion of the subsequent sheet Sb corresponding to a distance x from a leading edge of the subsequent sheet Sb which abuts on the leading edge regulating plate <b>25</b> by the distance x from the upstream side to the outer periphery of the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>are simultaneously drawn onto the suction conveyance belt <b>21</b>.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the preceding sheet Sa and the immediately subsequent sheet Sb are partially overlaid and delivered through the suction conveyance belt <b>21</b> and the draw roller pair <b>42</b> to be continuously conveyed to the downstream conveyance roller.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Finally, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the positional relationship of the sheet Sb (preceding sheet in this case) and a subsequent sheet Sc is substantially similar to the positional relationship illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. Therefore, the continuous sheet feeding operations from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> are repeated. Therefore, the sheet feeding conveyance operation in an imbricate state where the sheets are partially overlaid is continuously performed.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this timing chart, in the horizontal axis, as passing periods of the sheets, a passing period of the uppermost sheet Sa, a passing period of the subsequent sheet Sb, and a passing period of another subsequent sheet Sc are represented.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">That is, as known from the waveform example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a portion where one sheet of each of the uppermost sheet Sa, the subsequent sheet Sb, and the other subsequent sheet Sc is fed, a portion where two overlaid sheets are fed, and their changing points are detected.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A plurality of displacement sensors <b>43</b> which is provided on the conveyance path following the suction conveyance mechanism <b>51</b> also monitors the sheet conveyance state.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, control of the overlaid sheet feeding/conveyance by the CPU <b>1</b> according to the exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described. However, this description is made by appropriately referring to the state of the suction conveyance mechanism <b>51</b> during the feeding operation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>4</b>A to <b>6</b>C. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an operation of the sheet feeding device according to the exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The various sheet information (size, grammage, surface property) stored in the tray <b>12</b> by the user is input and set through the manipulation part <b>302</b> by the user to be stored in the storage unit <b>3</b>.

<p id="p-0093" num="0092">First, in step S<b>1</b>, if the CPU <b>1</b> receives the feeding signal, the CPU <b>1</b> refers to the sheet information (sheet and JOB information) of a target feeding unit from the storage unit <b>3</b>.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The feeding speed Vs varies depending on the surface property or the grammage of the sheet. For example, if a sheet conveying speed of a general sheet which is a high-quality paper (whose grammage is 80 g/m<sup>2</sup>) is V<b>1</b>, the speed may be reduced to V<b>1</b>&#xd7;50% in a case of a thick paper that is a high-quality paper (whose grammage is 200 g/m<sup>2</sup>). Further, in a case of a coated paper whose sheet surface is processed like a coated paper (whose grammage is 200 g/m<sup>2</sup>), the speed is reduced to V<b>1</b>&#xd7;33%. This value is determined by the result of study in the image forming apparatus <b>300</b>A in advance and stored in the storage unit <b>3</b> in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The movement speeds Vh and Vk of the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> according to the above value are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 6C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The opening portion opening/closing timer Th is calculated based on a length S of the sheet size of the sheet information in the conveying direction and calculated and determined by the following equation:

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In this equation, z indicates a conveyance distance from the outer periphery of the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to a detection position of the displacement sensor <b>43</b> disposed in the draw roller pair <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, in step S<b>3</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> inputs a control signal into the suction fan driving circuit <b>40</b> in the target feeding unit to drive the suction fan <b>36</b>.

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In step S<b>5</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> waits for a predetermined time until the distance between the surface position of the uppermost sheet Sa and the suction conveyance belt <b>21</b> is a B&#x2032; position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> by the air blowing and the stable surface position is detected by the trailing edge paper surface detection sensor <b>18</b>.

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In step S<b>23</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> inputs a control signal to the pullout motor driving circuit <b>47</b> to stop the pullout motor <b>45</b> and also stop the draw roller pair <b>42</b>. Further, in step S<b>24</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> inputs a control signal to the driving circuit <b>3000</b> to inversely drive the belt driving motor <b>200</b> and move back the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> from a protruded position (open position) to an initial position (closing position). In step S<b>25</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> stops the belt driving motor <b>200</b> after completely returning the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> to the initial position and completes the processing flow.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the above-described exemplary embodiment, the overlaid amount of the preceding sheet and the subsequent sheet at the time of suction conveyance is adjusted by the CPU <b>1</b> at a timing of when the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> opens the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>from the closed state soon after the displacement sensor <b>43</b> detects the leading edge of the preceding sheet. Therefore, the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> is driven to switch the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>between the closing position and the open position with a simple configuration. Therefore, it is possible to draw and convey the sheets in an imbricate with a stable overlaid amount.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In other words, based on the timing corresponding to the preceding sheet Sa which is being conveyed, the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> at the open position simply returns from the temporal closing position to the open position so that the overlaid sheets may be fed with a stable overlaid amount. Therefore, it is possible to lower the feeding speed and improve the sheet conveyance efficiency without lowering the sheet productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Thus, even in the image forming apparatus having a comparatively short sheet conveyance path from the position of the tray <b>12</b> to the image forming position, the sheet may be overlaid to start the conveyance from the suction conveyance unit (suction conveyance part). Therefore, it is possible to achieve high productivity while lowering the feeding speed. As a result, it is possible to feed and convey the sheet with a low power consumption and a low operation noise.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> which is a flowchart of an operation under the control of the CPU <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">An image forming system according to the secondary exemplary embodiment has a similar schematic configuration to the configuration of the first exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Therefore, the description of the second exemplary embodiment will be omitted. Further, a brief configuration of sheet feeding devices <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> and a circuit block configuration view of feeding units in the sheet feeding devices <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> according to the second exemplary embodiment are similar to the configuration of the first exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Therefore, the description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Here, steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>10</b> and S<b>11</b> to S<b>25</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> in this exemplary embodiment are substantially similar to the steps according to the first exemplary embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (step S<b>2</b> is slightly different). To the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, steps S<b>30</b> to S<b>35</b> are added. Therefore, in this exemplary embodiment, steps S<b>30</b> to S<b>35</b> will be mainly described.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Specifically, in step S<b>2</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> determines the feeding speed (sheet conveying speed) Vs, movement speeds Vh and Vk which are opening speeds of the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b>, an opening portion opening/closing timer Th, and a target overlapping time To based on sheet&#x2022;JOB information obtained in step S<b>1</b>. The feeding speed Vs, the movement speeds Vh and Vk, and the opening portion opening/closing timer Th are the same as described in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The target overlapping time refers to a time corresponding to the overlaid amount of the trailing edge of the preceding sheet and the leading edge of the subsequent sheet. In this exemplary embodiment, the target overlapping time is set to correspond to the overlaid amount of 50 mm. Steps S<b>3</b> to S<b>10</b> are similar to those in the first exemplary embodiment and thus the description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Continuously, in step S<b>10</b>, if the leading edge of the sheet is detected by the displacement sensor <b>43</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> starts to count the opening portion opening/closing timer Th determined in step S<b>2</b>. The output <b>9</b> for one sheet and the output <b>10</b> for two sheets of the COMP converter <b>5</b> that converts the output of the displacement sensor <b>43</b> are input to the ASIC <b>2</b> and the output results are monitored by the CPU <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">When the displacement by the leading edge of the sheet is detected by the displacement sensor <b>43</b> in step S<b>10</b>, if the displacement is the change point (referred to as ON) of the output <b>10</b> for two sheets from one sheet to two sheets (Yes in step S<b>30</b>), in step S<b>31</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> starts to count an overlapping time timer Ts. In step S<b>32</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> waits until the change point (referred to as OFF) of the output <b>10</b> for two sheets from two sheets to one sheet is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The CPU <b>1</b> stops counting the overlapping time timer Ts at a timing of when OFF of the output <b>10</b> for two sheets is detected and determines the overlapping time timer Ts. After determining the overlapping time timer Ts, in step S<b>33</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> stores the determined Ts value in the storage unit <b>3</b> and then clears the overlapping time timer Ts to be 0. The determined overlapping time timer Tx is an overlapping time corresponding to a distance and a time corresponding to an amount of overlaid sheets when the sheets are actually conveyed. In order to compare the determined overlapping time timer Tx with a target overlapping time To, in step S<b>34</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> reads the overlapping time timer from the storage unit <b>3</b> to compare the overlapping time timer with the target overlapping time. The comparison is performed as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b1;=(<i>To&#x2212;Ts</i>), and a correction value &#x3b1; is determined.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">If the correction value &#x3b1; is negative, it indicates that the conveyance of the subsequent sheet is delayed compared with the preceding sheet as to a target sequence and thus the overlaid amount is smaller than a target amount. Further, if the correction value &#x3b1; is positive, it indicates that the conveyance of the subsequent sheet is faster than that of the preceding sheet as to a target sequence and thus the overlaid amount is larger than the target amount.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The correction value &#x3b1; is determined and then stored in a predetermined address area of the storage unit <b>3</b>. In step S<b>35</b>, the CPU <b>1</b> adds the correction value &#x3b1; to the opening portion opening/closing timer Th determined in step S<b>10</b> to update the corrected opening portion opening/closing timer Th as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Th=Th+&#x3b1;. Hereinafter, the flow in step S<b>11</b> is similar to that in the first exemplary embodiment and thus the description will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As described above, the difference of the opening portion opening/closing timer Th from the target value whenever the sheets are fed (every sheet feeding) is detected as the correction value &#x3b1; and the correction value &#x3b1; is added to the opening portion opening/closing timer Th to correct Th. Therefore, a distance y&#x2032; corresponding to y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> in the first exemplary embodiment will be as follows: y&#x2032;=y+Vs&#xd7;&#x3b1;. As described above, y&#x2032; is corrected to appropriately change a suction timing of the subsequent sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Here, if a timing of when the correction value &#x3b1;=0 is y, when the correction value &#x3b1; is negative, y&#x2032;&#x3c;y. Therefore, the suction starting timing of the subsequent sheet becomes earlier so that the overlaid amount is increased by the amount smaller than the target value, which makes a correction to obtain an appropriate amount. In contrast, if &#x3b1; is positive, y&#x2032;&#x3e;y and the suction starting timing of the subsequent sheet becomes later so that the overlaid amount is decreased by the amount larger than the target value, which makes a correction to obtain an appropriate amount.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">According to the above-described exemplary embodiment, a substantially similar effect to the first exemplary embodiment is obtained. Further, the opening portion opening/closing timing is controlled to maintain the constant overlaid amount between the preceding sheet and the subsequent sheet. Therefore, it is possible to feed the sheets with the more stable overlaid amount of the sheets. Accordingly, it is possible to achieve high productivity while lowering the feeding speed and to feed and convey the sheet with a low power consumption and a low operation noise.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">According to this exemplary embodiment, the correction value &#x3b1; is added to the opening portion opening/closing timer Th to correct the opening/closing sequence of the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a</i>. Further, the suction timing of the subsequent sheet with respect to the preceding sheet is changed to control the overlaid amount between the sheets to be constant. Therefore, if an element that feedbacks the correction value &#x3b1; is reflected to a movement speed Vh when the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> is closed, and a movement speed Vk when the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> is open, the similar effect may be obtained. Further, it is obvious that the similar effect may be obtained even when the feeding speed (sheet conveying speed) Vs is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, in this exemplary embodiment, the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> is moved from the upstream side in the conveying direction maintaining a certain distance y from the trailing edge of the preceding sheet Sa while it is synchronized with the feeding speed Vs. However, when the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>is closed from the direction perpendicular to the conveying direction in an amount equivalent to the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>closed by the opening portion opening/closing belt <b>201</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> or applying of the suction force in a corresponding portion of the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>is stopped by the shutter, the similar effect may also be obtained. However, this is limited to a case when a degree of the suction force in the corresponding portion of the suction opening <b>34</b><i>a </i>does not cause stable drawing of the subsequent sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In the first and second exemplary embodiments, an example in which the present invention is applied to the sheet feeding devices <b>311</b> and <b>312</b> that supply the sheet to the image forming unit is described. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the present invention may be applied to an inserter. In this case, a sheet on which an image is formed may be supplied to the sheet processing device <b>304</b> (sheet processing part) or another sheet may be supplied between sheets which are disposed between the image forming unit and the sheet processing device <b>304</b> and conveyed with an image formed thereon by the image forming unit.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all modifications, equivalent structures, and functions.</p>
