<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/158,836, entitled ADAPTIVE TRACKING STEPS FOR TIME AND FREQUENCY TRACKING LOOPS, and filed on Mar. 10, 2009, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">I. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates generally to wireless communications systems, and more particularly to methods for adaptive controls for time and frequency tracking in wireless communications systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">II. Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as voice, data, and so forth. These systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., bandwidth and transmit power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems including E-UTRA, and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) communication system effectively partitions the overall system bandwidth into multiple (N<sub>F</sub>) subcarriers, which may also be referred to as frequency sub-channels, tones, or frequency bins. For an OFDM system, the data to be transmitted (i.e., the information bits) is first encoded with a particular coding scheme to generate coded bits, and the coded bits are further grouped into multi-bit symbols that are then mapped to modulation symbols. Each modulation symbol corresponds to a point in a signal constellation defined by a particular modulation scheme (e.g., M-PSK or M-QAM) used for data transmission. At each time interval that may be dependent on the bandwidth of each frequency subcarrier, a modulation symbol may be transmitted on each of the frequency subcarriers. Thus, OFDM may be used to combat inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency selective fading, which is characterized by different amounts of attenuation across the system bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, a wireless multiple-access communication system can concurrently support communication for multiple wireless terminals that communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link may be established via a single-in-single-out, multiple-in-signal-out or a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The aforementioned systems and protocols are often subject to extreme changes in conditions. Such conditions include &#x201c;urban canyon&#x201d; situations where in one portion of a city conditions might be ideal and when moving behind a building, conditions may be poor. Fixed or non-optimized tracking gains were used for the tracking loops in many of these systems. The problem with fixed tracking is that time and/or frequency tracking is either too slow for urban canyon or too fast and jittery for high geometry, line of site/sight stationary Internet connections, for example. Thus, single tracking step/gains are not optimal for either case. A sub-optimal solution is possible for voice connections but can promote obvious unrealized capacity gain for Internet (e.g., streaming, download) connections. Legacy frequency tracking loops/time tracking loops (FTL/TTL) structure employs a fixed loop gain regardless of the channel conditions. This loop gain, however, was designed for the worst case of very low geometry. In high geometry or good signal conditions, such fixed setting of loop gain for worst case is not optimal for such conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the claimed subject matter. This summary is not an extensive overview, and is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Systems and methods provide adaptive tracking steps for time and frequency tracking loops in wireless communications equipment. Signal conditions are automatically analyzed to determine present signal quality for a given location of a device. For instance, it may be determined that a device is in a given high geometry location and respective tracking gains for time or frequency loops can be automatically decreased. In a low geometry situations where signal conditions are detected as poor, time or frequency loop gains can be automatically increased. Such adaptive adjustments to detected conditions are controlled in a smooth and incremental manner via adaptive step control. This type of control enables time or frequency loop gains to be automatically tracked to the detected conditions while minimizing overshoot (e.g., going past desired gain positions) and optimizing the wireless receiver in view of the detected conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the claimed subject matter may be employed and the claimed subject matter is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Systems and methods are provided to facilitate wireless communications. In one aspect, a wireless communications method is provided. The method includes analyzing one or more channel condition parameters from a wireless communication and automatically adjusting a frequency tracking loop gain or a time tracking loop gain in view of the channel condition parameters. The channel condition parameters can be based on an energy of pilot chip versus noise and total interference parameter (Ecp/Nt), for example.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system <b>100</b> provides adaptive tracking for time and frequency tracking loops for a wireless communications network <b>110</b>. The system <b>100</b> includes one or more base stations <b>120</b> (also referred to as a node, evolved node B&#x2014;eNB, serving eNB, target eNB, femto station, pico station) which can be an entity capable of communication over the wireless network <b>110</b> to various devices <b>130</b>. For instance, each device <b>130</b> can be an access terminal (also referred to as terminal, user equipment, mobility management entity (MME) or mobile device). The device <b>130</b> can include an adaptive tracking component <b>140</b> (or components) that analyze geometry parameters or channel conditions <b>150</b> to facilitate automated step adjustments for variances in received wireless signals. The user equipment <b>130</b> can analyze geometry conditions <b>154</b> on location and during motion of the equipment from one location to another. It is noted that although not shown, the base station <b>120</b> (or other wireless nodes on the network <b>100</b>) can also include adaptive tracking. As shown, the base station <b>120</b> communicates to the station <b>130</b> via downlink <b>160</b> and receives data via uplink <b>170</b>. Such designation as uplink and downlink is arbitrary as the device <b>130</b> can also transmit data via downlink and receive data via uplink channels. It is noted that although two components <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> are shown, that more than two components can be employed on the network <b>110</b>, where such additional components can also be adapted for signal processing described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In general, the system <b>100</b> provides adaptive tracking steps for time and frequency tracking loops in wireless communications equipment <b>130</b>. Signal conditions are automatically analyzed to determine present signal quality for a given location of a device. For instance, it may be determined that a device is in a given high geometry location and respective tracking gains for time or frequency loops can be automatically decreased. In a low geometry situations where signal conditions are detected as poor, time or frequency loop gains can be automatically increased. Such adaptive adjustments to detected conditions are controlled in a smooth and incremental manner via adaptive step control. This type of control enables time or frequency loop gains to be automatically tracked to the detected conditions while minimizing overshoot (e.g., going past desired gain positions) and optimizing the wireless receiver in view of the detected conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one aspect, the system <b>100</b> dynamically changes frequency tracking loop/time tracking loop (FTL/TTL) gains depending on detected channel conditions. For example, Ecp/Nt can be employed as a metric to the channel condition and automated changes can be adjusted for FTL/TTL gains. It is noted that Ecp/Nt is used to incorporate the cell-loading effect and is but one of many parameters that can be analyzed to dynamically adjust gains.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In general, mobile devices <b>130</b> constantly undergo some type of fading. The devices are seldom stationary when a voice or data call is activated. Even if the device <b>130</b> is used for hand-free mode, cars are moving or the surroundings are moving and thus the environment changes continually. With the Internet usage, however, more and more mobile phones can enter a quasi-stationary mode when the surrounding is relatively stationary. This prompts the need for the optimization for the extreme case when the phone or device <b>130</b> is enjoying high capacity due to its vicinity to the base station <b>120</b> and the stationary connection. As will be shown in more detail below, gain step sizes should be kept at the minimum for this scenario to realize the most benefit. The other common operation environment is urban canyon where the dynamic environment favors larger tracking steps. High Doppler also falls into a similar category.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The system <b>100</b> can account for DL (Down Link) power, tracking loop errors (when and if available), Ecp/Nt, Ec/Io, Doppler (when and if available), and so forth to automatically determine the optimum step sizes for the tracking loops for the next slot or frame time. Although the system can be employed for wireless traffic processing, the system can also be integrated into a searcher component as will be described in more detail below. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) parameter can be employed as a metric that drives the optimization mechanism in the adaptive tracking component <b>140</b>. Two common SNR metrics, Ecp/Nt and Ecp/Io are slightly different. By definition, Ecp/Nt, is a pilot energy over noise plus interference ratio and Ecp/Io, is the pilot energy over the total receive energy. Ecp/Nt is more indicative of the capacity and Ecp/Io is more indicative of the current transmission efficiency and both parameters are useful metrics for optimal system design and improvement.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another aspect, the system <b>100</b> can be employed to implement a wireless communications method. This includes analyzing one or more geometry parameters from a wireless communication and determining one or more channel conditions based in part on the geometry parameters. This also includes automatically adjusting a frequency tracking loop gain or a time tracking loop gain in a wireless receiver in view of the determined channel conditions or geometry parameters. The channel conditions are based in part on an energy of pilot chip versus total receive energy parameter (Ecp/Io), a signal to noise ratio (SNR), or can be based on a pilot energy over noise plus interference ratio (Ecp/Nt), for example. The channel conditions or geometry parameters can also be based on downlink power, uplink power, tracking loop errors, detected urban conditions, or Doppler parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method includes incrementally increasing or decreasing step gain parameters based in part on the channel conditions or the geometry parameters. This includes automatically adjusting the frequency tracking loop gain or the time tracking loop gain in accordance with a demodulator component. Similarly, the method includes automatically adjusting the frequency tracking loop gain or the time tracking loop gain in accordance with a searcher component. In another aspect, the method or system includes automatically adjusting the frequency tracking loop gain or the time tracking loop gain in accordance with a rake, an equalizer, or a finger component. This can include analyzing operating conditions including high geometry, low geometry, or stationary, and optimizing gains in a rake or an equalizer in view of the operating conditions. Another aspect includes analyzing a channel status indicator (CSI) to optimize a feedback rate for a multiple-in, multiple-out (MIMO) system. This can also include analyzing geometry conditions to determine optimal time tracking loop gains or analyzing geometry conditions to determine optimal frequency tracking loop gains. The method includes analyzing time or frequency deviation to determine optimal loop gains or adjusting a time tracking loop to mitigate rake timing fluctuations or adjusting a frequency tracking loop to optimize a channel impulse response (CIR). As can be appreciated, other components or parameters can also be optimized according to the adaptable step gains described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Before proceeding, it is noted that the system <b>100</b> can be employed with an access terminal or mobile device, and can be, for instance, a module such as an SD card, a network card, a wireless network card, a computer (including laptops, desktops, personal digital assistants (PDAs)), mobile phones, smart phones, or any other suitable terminal that can be utilized to access a network. The terminal accesses the network by way of an access component (not shown). In one example, a connection between the terminal and the access components may be wireless in nature, in which access components may be the base station and the mobile device is a wireless terminal. For instance, the terminal and base stations may communicate by way of any suitable wireless protocol, including but not limited to Time Divisional Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), FLASH OFDM, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), or any other suitable protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Access components can be an access node associated with a wired network or a wireless network. To that end, access components can be, for instance, a router, a switch, or the like. The access component can include one or more interfaces, e.g., communication modules, for communicating with other network nodes. Additionally, the access component can be a base station (or wireless access point) in a cellular type network, wherein base stations (or wireless access points) are utilized to provide wireless coverage areas to a plurality of subscribers. Such base stations (or wireless access points) can be arranged to provide contiguous areas of coverage to one or more cellular phones and/or other wireless terminals.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an example high-level system <b>200</b> is illustrated where adaptive tracking can be employed. For purposes of brevity, not every component in the system <b>200</b> is described in detail. A multi-antenna input <b>210</b>, <b>212</b> is shown at block <b>214</b> where the respective inputs and associated processing may include RF/analog front-ends <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, baseband/receiver filter components <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, automatic gain control circuits <b>224</b>, <b>226</b>, and signal sampling memories <b>228</b>, <b>230</b>. A rake component <b>240</b> can include finger components <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>, an equalizer <b>246</b>, and a combiner <b>248</b>. The rake component <b>240</b> is one possible location for the adaptive tracking described herein. Another possible location for adaptive tracking includes a searcher component <b>250</b>. Other components in the system <b>200</b> include de-interleaver components <b>260</b>, decoders <b>262</b>, buffers <b>264</b>, and media layer processing circuits <b>266</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Through the extracting of system information, the mobile device can determine the operating condition as high or low geometry, dynamic, or relatively stationary, for example. The information assists optimizing the Rake as well as Equalizer performance. It can also serve for better and efficient CSI (Channel Status Indicator) feedback rate for MIMO system. The systems described herein can be error-rated to provide an adaptive step size similar to echo cancellation or with normalized step size or gain. This improves both Rake and Equalizer performance, for example. Thus, the subject systems and methods focus on capacity regardless of the environment. For instance, the systems described herein will operate well in urban canyon conditions when the distance from user equipment to NodeB is fairly close but the drop-off is sharp. The urban canyon condition and others cause alternating low geometry and high geometry scenarios and promote rapid changes in operating environment, where adaptive tracking is employed to achieve optimal performance overall in view of such conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an alternative circuit example <b>300</b> is illustrated that can employ adaptive tracking The circuit <b>300</b> illustrates an example modulator/demodulator architecture that can employ adaptive tracking In one aspect, adaptive tracking components (frequency and/or time tracking components) can be located in a DemFront <b>310</b> (Demodulator Front) DFE, which consists of an FFE (Finger front end) <b>312</b> and a CPP (Common Pilot Processor) <b>314</b>. The FFE <b>312</b> processes Pn position and time tracking, frequency error correction via rotator, and descrambling unit. The CPP <b>314</b> processes common pilot signal processing functions such as pilot filtering, frequency tracking loop (FTL) for rotator, time tracking loop (TTL), and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) filtering.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The CPP <b>314</b> also feeds other DemFront <b>310</b> parts such as a modem digital signal processor (MDSP) <b>316</b> with filtered outputs, enabling demodulation, CQI estimation, finger management, and so forth. Adaptive tracking steps improves the overall receiver performance and channel efficiency, thus the user experience as well by optimizing the TTL and FTL performance. As can be appreciated, other components can integrate adaptive tracking features such as in a searcher component <b>320</b>, for example. Other components in the circuit <b>300</b> include radio frequency (RF) processors <b>330</b>, low noise amplifiers <b>332</b>, D/A and A/D converters <b>334</b> and <b>336</b> respectively, receiver front ends <b>338</b>, automatic gain controls <b>340</b>, transmitter components <b>350</b>, other demodulator components <b>360</b>, and a general processor such as an advanced RISC (reduced instruction set) machine (ARM) <b>370</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another aspect, the circuit <b>300</b> can be provided as a communications apparatus. The apparatus includes a demodulator component (e.g., DemFront <b>310</b>) to determine one or more channel condition parameters from a wireless communication. The apparatus includes a finger component (e.g., FFE <b>312</b>) to analyze time tracking parameters or frequency error parameters in accordance with the channel condition parameters. The apparatus also includes a common pilot processor (e.g., CPP <b>314</b>) to automatically adjust a frequency tracking loop gain or a time tracking loop gain in a wireless receiver in view of the time tracking parameters, the frequency error parameters, or the channel condition parameters. The common pilot processor can be operatively coupled to a modem digital signal processor (MDSP) with filtered outputs, where the MDSP enables demodulation, channel quality estimation, or finger management, for example. The communications apparatus can include a searcher component (e.g., <b>320</b>) to adjust the frequency tracking loop gain or the time tracking loop gain in the wireless receiver. The communications apparatus can also include a radio frequency (RF) processor (e.g., <b>330</b>), a low noise amplifier (e.g., <b>332</b>), an automatic gain control (e.g., <b>340</b>), a transmitter component (e.g., <b>350</b>), or a general processor (e.g., <b>370</b>) to adjust the frequency tracking loop gain or the time tracking loop gain in the wireless receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> illustrate graphs that demonstrate how adaptive tracking steps can be selected and determined. As demonstrated in simulation and lab testing, it was discovered that the relation between the timing jitter (measured in standard deviation) and the time tracking loop (TTL) TC (time constant). Two measurement points were taken for high and low geometry respectively to derive the optimal curve. There exists a trade-off between the standard deviation of timing jitter and a time constant (TC). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates this case when the geometry is very low, i.e., &#x2212;11 dB. Based on this analysis, the default gain has been set to 4096 (=2^12). Now, if the same logic is applied to the high geometry of 15 dB, the plots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are generated.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Note that timing jitter is very low compared with that of the low-geometry case. Based on the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, select the TTL loop gain that minimizes the timing jitter as much as possible while maintaining the time constant similar to that of the low-geometry case. For example, select 256(=2^8) in this channel condition. The optimal time constant between and around the two geometries can be extrapolated and interpolated to cover the operating geometries. A similar analysis leads one to select 1024 FTL loop gain for &#x2212;11 dB geometry and 64 for 15 dB geometry, for example. Similar procedures are provided in interpolation and extrapolation to cover the operating geometries. The previous analysis are for &#x2212;11 dB and 15 dB geometries. In the following section, sweep the geometry from &#x2212;11 dB to 15 dB and calculate the appropriate loop gains. The following criteria are used to determine suitable loop gains.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Loop gain selection criteria (criterion <b>1</b>): Select the loop gain that minimizes the time/frequency jitter as much as possible while satisfying the following conditions:

    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a line <b>610</b> of the combined and calculated TTL/FTL gains based on criteria <b>1</b> above, where the loop gains are limited to the integer exponentials of 2. Note that the FTL gain is set to a factor of four lower than the TTL gain at any portion of the line <b>610</b> (e.g., if TTL gain is set to 4096 on line <b>610</b> then FTL gain is set to 1024 at same point of line <b>610</b>). Due to the implementation preference, a linear formula is used instead of a look-up table. The relationship turned out to be pretty linear in a log-log domain, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, where dotted line <b>710</b> represents TTL gain and dashed line <b>720</b> represents FTL gains.

<p id="p-0044" num="0045">Lower TTL loop gains can be applied for Rake to avoid timing jitter. The TTL typically plays a more dominant role in the Rake than the Equalizer. Lower FTL loop gains can be applied for Equalizer to improve CIR estimate thus less FTL jitter, whereas the TTL is less relevant. The optimal step size makes a difference in the receiver performance while operating in high geometry conditions. The major benefit of a 3G network is the capacity as it allows for download in high data rates while in high geometry. The improvement is significant in the user experience as well as the channel efficiency. This improvement is particularly significant for applications like streaming media delivering such as audio, video, or television, for example.</p>

For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram.

<p id="p-0059" num="0060">As noted previously, the adaptive tracking steps can be automatically or dynamically adjusted for time and frequency racking loops in a wireless communications network. Signal conditions are automatically analyzed to determine present signal quality for a given location of a device. For instance, it may be determined that a device is in a given high geometry location and respective tracking gains for time or frequency loops can be automatically decreased. In a low geometry situations where signal conditions are detected as poor, time or frequency loop gains can be automatically increased in an incremental or step-wise manner (e.g., increase gain in increments of 1 or 2 db). Such adaptive adjustments to detected conditions are controlled in a smooth and incremental manner via adaptive step control. This type of control enables time or frequency loop gains to be automatically tracked to the detected conditions while minimizing overshoot (e.g., going past desired gain positions) and optimizing the wireless receiver in view of the detected conditions.</p>
