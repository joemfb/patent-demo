<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/272,560, filed Oct. 13, 2011 (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,519,756), which claims priority to U.S. Provisional App. No. 61/406,953 filed Oct. 26, 2010, each of which is incorporated herein by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to phase locked loop (PLL) circuits and in particular to circuitry for detecting when the output of the PLL has locked onto a reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Phase locked loops (PPLs) are widely used in communications electronics and digital electronics. In wireless products, PLLs are typically used to generate high speed system clocks. When the electronics for a PLL are powered up, it can take on the order of tens of microseconds for the frequency of the PLL output signal to become stable. A lock detector circuit is typically provided to detect when the frequency of the PLL output signal has settled. The lock detector can generate a lock signal that can be used by the system for clock gating.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical PLL circuit configuration is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The main blocks of a PLL circuit <b>100</b> typically include a phase frequency detector <b>112</b>, a charge pump <b>114</b>, a low-pass filter <b>116</b>, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) <b>118</b>, and a feedback counter <b>120</b>. The phase frequency detector <b>112</b> detects the difference in phase and frequency between a reference signal (clock) F<sub>ref </sub>and a feedback signal (clock) F<sub>fb</sub>, and generates an &#x201c;up&#x201d; (U) or a &#x201c;down&#x201d; (D) control signal based on whether the frequency of the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>(feedback frequency) is lagging or leading the frequency of the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>(reference frequency).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The phase frequency detector <b>112</b> outputs these &#x201c;up&#x201d; and &#x201c;down&#x201d; signals to the charge pump <b>114</b>. If the charge pump receives an &#x201c;up&#x201d; signal, current is driven into the low-pass filter <b>116</b>. Conversely, if the charge pump <b>114</b> receives a &#x201c;down&#x201d; signal, current is drawn from the low-pass filter <b>116</b>. The low-pass filter <b>116</b> converts these signals to a control voltage (a DC level) that is used to control the VCO <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Based on the control voltage, a PLL output signal F<sub>o </sub>of the VCO <b>118</b> oscillates at a higher or lower frequency, which affects the phase and frequency of the feedback signal F<sub>fb</sub>. Thus, if the phase detector <b>112</b> produces an &#x201c;up&#x201d; s signal, then the frequency of PLL output signal F<sub>o </sub>increases. A &#x201c;down&#x201d; signal decreases the frequency of the PLL output signal F<sub>o</sub>. The output of the VCO <b>118</b> stabilizes once the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>have the same phase and frequency. When the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>are aligned, the PLL output signal F<sub>o </sub>is referred to variously as &#x201c;locked,&#x201d; &#x201c;locked to the reference signal,&#x201d; and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A divide-by-N counter <b>120</b> may be inserted in the feedback loop to increase an amplitude of the PLL output signal F<sub>o </sub>above the reference signal F<sub>ref</sub>. The PLL output signal F<sub>o </sub>is equal to N times the reference signal F<sub>ref</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A lock detector <b>102</b> compares the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>to determine when a lock condition has occurred. A lock signal is output when the lock condition has occurred.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further illustrates a simple timing chart. When power is applied to the circuitry at time t<b>0</b>, the frequency of the PLL output signal F<sub>o </sub>begins to increase. During a period of time between t<b>0</b> and t<b>1</b>, the PLL frequency is not unstable and cannot be used by the system. At time t<b>1</b>, the PLL frequency has stabilized, but typically a period of time (t<b>2</b>&#x2212;t<b>1</b>) is allowed to pass to ensure that the PLL output signal F<sub>o </sub>has fully settled. Accordingly, during the period of time between t<b>0</b> and t<b>2</b>, the lock signal remains &#x201c;LO&#x201d;. At time t<b>2</b>, the lock signal goes &#x201c;HI&#x201d; to signify that the PLL output signal F<sub>o </sub>is ready to clock the system logic.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a conventional implementation for the lock detector <b>102</b> which determines signal lock based on the rising edges of the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and the feedback signal F<sub>fb</sub>. The lock detector comprises two flip flop circuits, such as the flip flops <b>202</b> and <b>204</b>. The reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>is delayed by an inverted delay line <b>206</b>, and the delayed signal F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032; feeds into the flip flop <b>202</b>. The feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>clocks the flip flop <b>202</b>. Similarly for the flip flop <b>204</b>, the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>is delayed by an inverted delay line <b>208</b>, and the delayed signal F<sub>fb</sub>&#x2032; feeds into the flip flop <b>204</b>. The feedback signal F<sub>ref </sub>clocks the flip flop <b>204</b>. The outputs of the flip flops <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> feed into NAND gate <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A timing circuit <b>212</b> comprises a capacitor <b>222</b> that is charged by a current source <b>224</b>. So long as transistor <b>228</b> remains in the OFF condition, then after a certain amount of time proportional to I/C, where I is the current and C is the capacitance, the capacitor <b>222</b> will charge to a voltage level (i.e., a threshold voltage level) sufficient to trigger a buffer <b>228</b> and output a signal that constitutes the lock detect signal. The transistor <b>228</b> is controlled by the output of the NAND gate <b>210</b>. During power up, the phase between the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>will vary until the feedback signal attains a lock with the reference signal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a timing diagram of the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>is illustrated for the lock condition. In this and subsequent figures, the shaded areas in the timing diagrams represent prior output states (&#x201c;HI&#x201d; or &#x201c;LO&#x201d;) that depend on the previous phase relation of the signals F<sub>ref </sub>and F<sub>fb</sub>. The flip flops <b>202</b> and <b>204</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are clocked on the rising edges of F<sub>fb </sub>and F<sub>ref </sub>respectively. Accordingly, the flip flops will latch respective inverted signals F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032; and F<sub>fb</sub>&#x2032; delayed by &#x3c4; (the propagation delay of inverted delay lines <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>). As can be seen, in the lock condition depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the rising edges of the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>are aligned. The flip flop outputs Q<sub>202 </sub>and Q<sub>204 </sub>are &#x201c;HI&#x201d;, and consequently the output of NAND gate <b>210</b> is &#x201c;LO&#x201d;. Thus, the transistor <b>228</b> is OFF and will remain in the OFF state so long as the lock condition exists, allowing the capacitor <b>222</b> to continue charging and the lock detect signal asserted.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a timing diagram is illustrated for a &#x201c;no lock&#x201d; condition where the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>are not in phase. The timing diagram shows that the output of flip flop <b>202</b> is &#x201c;LO&#x201d; because of the timing of the rising edge of F<sub>fb </sub>relative to the inverted and delayed reference signal F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032;. Accordingly, the NAND gate <b>210</b> is &#x201c;HI&#x201d; for this condition. The transistor <b>228</b> is turned ON and consequently the capacitor <b>222</b> does not charge.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a timing diagram is illustrated for a &#x201c;no lock&#x201d; condition, where the phase relation between the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>create a condition at time t<sub>x </sub>that causes the NAND gate <b>210</b> to incorrectly outputs a &#x201c;LO&#x201d; logic level. The &#x201c;LO&#x201d; output of the NAND gate <b>210</b> turns OFF the transistor <b>228</b>, allowing the capacitor <b>222</b> to charge and the lock detect signal to erroneously assert.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous examples and specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present disclosure as defined by the claims may include some or all of the features in these examples alone or in combination with other features described below, and may further include modifications and equivalents of the features and concepts described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A lock detector circuit in accordance with principles of the present disclosure can provide an indication of a lock condition between a reference signal and a target signal. In some embodiments, the reference signal may be a reference signal in a phase locked loop (PLL) circuit and the target signal may be a feedback signal in a feedback loop of the PLL circuit. An example of a PLL circuit is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The lock detector circuit in accordance with principles of the present disclosure, however, can be used in any circuitry where it is desired to determine if one signal (e.g., the target signal) has achieved a lock with another signal (e.g., the reference signal).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in some embodiments, a lock detector <b>600</b> may comprises flip flops <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, and <b>608</b>. As will become clear later on, the flip flops <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> constitute a dual edge-triggered detector. Similarly, flip flops <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> also constitute a dual edge-triggered detector. In the particular embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the flip flops <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, and <b>608</b> are D-type flip flops. It will be appreciated, however, that other types of flip flops may be substituted.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The lock detector <b>600</b> receives a reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and a target signal F<sub>target</sub>, and may output a lock detect signal. The reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>feeds into an inverted delay line <b>610</b>. The inverted delay line <b>610</b> is associated with a propagation delay t. The output of the inverted delay line <b>610</b> is an inverted signal F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032;, which is delayed relative to the incoming reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>by an amount based on the propagation delay &#x3c4;. The inverted signal F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032; feeds into flip flops <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. The flip flops <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> are clocked by the target signal F<sub>target</sub>. In particular, the flip flop <b>602</b> is configured with a non-inverting clock input, and thus is triggered by the rising edges of the target signal F<sub>target</sub>; while the flip flop <b>604</b> is configured with an inverting clock input, and so is triggered on the falling edges of the target signal.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The target signal F<sub>target </sub>feeds into an inverter <b>612</b> for detection, in addition to serving as a trigger. In some embodiments, the inverter <b>612</b> may have substantially the same propagation delay &#x3c4; as inverter <b>610</b>. The output of the inverter <b>612</b> is an inverted signal F<sub>target</sub>&#x2032;, which is delayed relative to the incoming target signal F<sub>target </sub>by an amount proportional to r. The inverted signal F<sub>target</sub>&#x2032; feeds into flip flops <b>606</b> and <b>608</b>. The flip flops <b>606</b> and <b>608</b> are clocked by the reference signal F<sub>ref</sub>. The flip flop <b>606</b> is configured with a non-inverting clock input, and thus is triggered on the rising edges of the reference signal F<sub>ref</sub>. The flip flop <b>608</b> is configured with an inverting clock input, and thus is triggered on the falling edges of the reference signal F<sub>ref</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It can be appreciated that any suitable means for detecting and holding a level of the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>in synchrony with the rising edge and falling edge of the target signal F<sub>target </sub>may be used in place of the flip flops <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. Likewise, any suitable means for detecting and holding a level of the target signal F<sub>target </sub>in synchrony with the rising edge and falling edge of the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>may be used in place of the flip flops <b>606</b> and <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the lock detector <b>600</b> may further include a NAND gate <b>614</b> for receiving outputs Q<sub>604 </sub>and Q<sub>608 </sub>of respective flip flops <b>604</b> and <b>608</b>. An output of NAND gate <b>614</b> feeds into an input of an AND gate <b>616</b>. The outputs Q<sub>604 </sub>and Q<sub>608 </sub>represent levels, respectively, of the inverted and delayed signals F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032; and F<sub>target</sub>&#x2032; detected on the falling edges of signals F<sub>target </sub>and F<sub>ref</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The AND gate <b>616</b> receives input from flip flops <b>602</b> and <b>606</b>, in addition to input from NAND gate <b>614</b>. The output Q<sub>602 </sub>from flip flop <b>602</b> and the output Q<sub>606 </sub>from flip flop <b>606</b> feed into AND gate <b>616</b>. The outputs Q<sub>602 </sub>and Q<sub>606 </sub>represent levels, respectively, of the inverted and delayed signals F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032; and F<sub>target</sub>&#x2032; detected on the rising edges of signals F<sub>target </sub>and F<sub>ref</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the lock detector <b>600</b> may further include a timing circuit <b>618</b>. The timing circuit <b>618</b> operates for a given amount of time T from an initial state, and then asserts a signal at an output <b>618</b><i>a</i>. The timing circuit <b>618</b> may include a reset line <b>618</b><i>b </i>that resets the timing circuit to the initial state, thus restarting the timing operation from that initial state. In some embodiments, the amount of time T may be configurable. The output of AND gate <b>616</b> is connected to the reset line <b>618</b><i>b </i>of the timing circuit <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, the timing circuit <b>618</b> may comprise a counter <b>622</b>. For example, the counter <b>622</b> may count from an initial state of zero to some maximum count value. It will be appreciated that any of numerous implementations for a counter may be employed. An output of the counter <b>622</b> may serve as the output <b>618</b><i>a </i>of the timing circuit <b>618</b>. For example, the output may be asserted when the counter has reached its maximum count value. The counter <b>622</b> includes a reset input <o ostyle="single">R</o> (the figure shows an inverting reset input) that is connected to the reset line <b>618</b><i>b </i>of the timing circuit <b>618</b>, which in turn is connected to the output of AND gate <b>616</b>. When the reset input <o ostyle="single">R</o> is asserted by the AND gate <b>616</b>, the counter <b>622</b> resets to the initial state and restarts the counting sequence; e.g., starts counting from zero.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The counter <b>622</b> may be clocked using the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>and may be configured to assert a signal at its output after a maximum count value has been reached. Accordingly, the counter <b>622</b> can be configured to run for a suitable amount of time T by appropriately configuring the maximum count value. In some embodiments, the maximum count value may be programmable and hence the amount of time T can be programmed. In other embodiments, the maximum count value may be a fixed value.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, in another embodiment, the lock detector <b>600</b> may employ a timing circuit <b>618</b>&#x2032; that is implemented with firmware comprising executable program code executing on a suitable digital processing unit <b>622</b>&#x2032;, such as a general purpose IO (GPIO) processor. The reset line <b>618</b><i>b </i>and the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>may be connected to input pins of the GPIO processor <b>622</b>&#x2032;. The output <b>618</b><i>a </i>may be connected to an output pin of the GPIO processor <b>622</b>&#x2032;. The firmware can be programmed to respond to signals on the input pins to output a signal on the output pin to behave in the same manner as discussed above for timing circuit <b>618</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Operation of the lock detector <b>600</b> may be explained in connection with a timing diagram. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a timing diagram for the lock condition, where the target signal F<sub>target </sub>is locked to (i.e., in phase with) the reference signal F<sub>ref</sub>, will be discussed. In this and subsequent figures, the shaded areas in the timing diagrams represent prior output states of the flip flops that depend on the previous phase relation of the signals F<sub>ref </sub>and F<sub>target</sub>. However, since the figures do not show the details of the waveforms for F<sub>ref </sub>and F<sub>target</sub>, the prior output states of the flip flops are not known and hence shaded.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The output Q<sub>604 </sub>is &#x201c;LO&#x201d; when the flip flop <b>604</b> is triggered by the falling edge of the target signal F<sub>target </sub>because the signal level of the inverted signal F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032; is &#x201c;LO&#x201d; at the time of the trigger. Likewise, the output Q<sub>608 </sub>is &#x201c;LO&#x201d; when the flip flop <b>608</b> is triggered by the falling edge of the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>because the signal level of the inverted signal F<sub>target</sub>&#x2032; is &#x201c;LO&#x201d; at the time of the trigger. Consequently, the output of NAND gate <b>614</b> is &#x201c;HI&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The output Q<sub>602 </sub>is &#x201c;HI&#x201d; when the flip flop <b>602</b> is triggered by the rising edge of the target signal F<sub>target </sub>because the signal level of the inverted signal F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032; is &#x201c;HI&#x201d; at the time of the trigger. Likewise, the output Q<sub>606 </sub>is &#x201c;HI&#x201d; when the flip flop <b>606</b> is triggered by the rising edge of the reference signal F<sub>ref </sub>because the signal level of the inverted signal F<sub>target</sub>&#x2032; is &#x201c;HI&#x201d; at the time of the trigger. Since all three inputs to the AND gate <b>616</b> are &#x201c;HI&#x201d;, the AND gate asserts a &#x201c;HI&#x201d; level on the reset line <b>618</b><i>b </i>of the timing circuit <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since the reset input of the counter <b>622</b> is an inverted input, the counter does not reset and continues to count at rate based on the frequency of the clock signal, which in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is the reference signal F<sub>ref</sub>. When a period of time based on the maximum count value has passed, the counter <b>622</b> will assert a signal (e.g., &#x201c;HI&#x201d; level) on the output <b>618</b><i>a </i>of the timing circuit <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It can be appreciated that the period of time can be adjusted depending on how much time is desired to determine that a lock condition has been achieved. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, during power up, the feedback signal F<sub>fb </sub>(i.e., the target signal) may enter into a period where its frequency fluctuates above and below the reference frequency (signal F<sub>ref</sub>), and hence a lock has not been achieved. The period of time provided by the counter <b>622</b>, therefore, should be long enough to avoid a false positive lock indication during those fluctuations.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It will be appreciated that timing charts similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be used to arrive at the conclusion that other &#x201c;no lock&#x201d; (out of phase) conditions between F<sub>ref </sub>and F<sub>target </sub>will cause the timing circuit <b>618</b> to be held in a reset state. Thus, an out of phase condition between F<sub>ref </sub>and F<sub>target </sub>places the timing circuit <b>618</b> in reset and prevents it from timing out. The timing circuit <b>618</b> is enabled only when the F<sub>target </sub>is locked with F<sub>ref</sub>, where the timing circuit <b>618</b> can time out so that lock detect signal can be asserted, thus indicating that the target signal F<sub>target </sub>is deemed to be locked to the reference signal F<sub>ref</sub>. Consider, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> which shows a timing diagram of the lock detector <b>600</b> for the phase relation between F<sub>ref </sub>and F<sub>target </sub>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As can be seen from the figure, the output of the AND gate <b>616</b> is &#x201c;LO&#x201d;, which will hold the counter <b>622</b> in reset.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a timing diagram of the lock detector <b>600</b> for the &#x201c;no lock&#x201d; situation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, where a conventional lock detector gave a false positive indication of a lock. As shown in the figure, at time t<sub>x </sub>the output of AND gate <b>616</b> outputs &#x201c;LO&#x201d; when the falling edge of the target signal F<sub>target </sub>clocks the inverted signal F<sub>ref</sub>&#x2032;. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, &#x201c;LO&#x201d; logic level at the output of AND gate <b>616</b> resets the counter <b>622</b> in the timing circuit <b>618</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the AND gate <b>616</b> will maintain a &#x201c;LO&#x201d; output for the given phase relationship between F<sub>ref </sub>and F<sub>target</sub>, and thus will hold the counter <b>622</b> in reset. Consequently, where this no lock situation would have resulted in a false positive lock indication using the conventional lock detector <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a lock detector in accordance with principles of the present disclosure will correctly indicate a no lock situation (e.g., by not asserting the lock detect signal).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the lock detector <b>600</b> employs a timing circuit <b>618</b> comprising a counter <b>622</b>, which in some embodiments is a digital circuit. In other embodiments, a lock detector in accordance with principles of the present disclosure may employ an analog-based timing circuit. Thus in some embodiments, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a lock detector <b>1000</b> may include an analog timing circuit <b>1018</b>. For example, the timing circuit <b>1018</b> may employ a circuit similar to the circuit <b>212</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The initial state of the timing circuit <b>1018</b> may be a fully discharged capacitor <b>1022</b>. When the capacitor <b>1022</b> charges to a level above a trigger level of the buffer <b>1024</b>, the buffer will assert a signal that constitutes the lock detect signal. The timing circuit <b>1018</b> may be reset to the initial state when the output of AND gate <b>616</b> asserts a signal that turns ON transistor <b>1026</b> to discharge the capacitor <b>1022</b>. The charge time of the capacitor <b>1022</b> is proportional to the current flow I into the capacitor and the capacitance of the capacitor. The timing diagrams discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> apply to timing of the lock detector <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The digital counter such as the counter <b>622</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> uses smaller components (and thus is more efficient in terms of area) and may consume less power than the analog counterpart. The digital counter is more easily configurable. For example, the time can be varied by removing or adding counting stages (typically a flip flop) to the counter <b>622</b> without significant impact silicon area. Nonetheless, it will be appreciated that a lock detector in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure may employ the analog-based timing circuit <b>1018</b> instead of a digital circuit.</p>
