<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Certain examples disclosed herein relate generally to boost devices, for example, boost devices configured to provide radio frequencies. More particularly, certain examples relate to boost devices that may be used to provide additional energy to an atomization source, such as a flame or a plasma.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Atomization sources, such as flames, may be used for a variety of applications, such as welding, chemical analysis and the like. In some instances, flames used in chemical analyses are not hot enough to vaporize the entire liquid sample that is injected into the flame. In addition, introduction of a liquid sample may result in zonal temperatures that may provide mixed results.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Another approach to atomization is to use a plasma source. Plasmas have been used in many technological areas including chemical analysis. Plasmas are electrically conducting gaseous mixtures containing large concentrations of cations and electrons. The temperature of a plasma may be as high as around 6,000-10,000 Kelvin, depending on the region of the plasma, whereas the temperature of a flame is often about 1400-1900 Kelvin, depending on the region of the flame. Due to the higher temperatures of the plasma, more rapid vaporization, atomization and/or ionization of chemical species may be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Use of plasmas may have several drawbacks in certain applications. Viewing optical emissions from chemical species in the plasma may be hindered by a high background signal from the plasma. Also, in some circumstances, plasma generation may require high total flow rates of argon (e.g., about 11-17 L/min) to create the plasma, including a flow rate of about 5-15 L/min of argon to isolate the plasma thermally. In addition, injection of aqueous samples into a plasma may result in a decrease in plasma temperature due to evaporation of solvent, i.e., a decrease in temperature due to desolvation. This temperature reduction may reduce the efficiency of atomization and ionization of chemical species in some contexts.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Higher powers have been used in plasmas to attempt to lower the detection limits for certain species, such as hard-to-ionize species like arsenic, cadmium, selenium and lead, but increasing the power also results in an increase in the background signal from the plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Certain aspects and examples of the present technology alleviate some of the above concerns with previous atomization sources. For example, a boost device is shown here as a way to assist other atomization sources, such as flames, plasmas, arcs and sparks. Certain of these embodiments may enhance atomization efficiency, ionization efficiency, decrease background noise and/or increase emission signals from atomized and ionized species.</p>

<p id="p-0156" num="0155">It will be apparent to the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, that the exemplary electronic features, components, tubes, injectors, RF induction coils, boost coils, flames, plasmas, etc. shown in the figures are not necessarily to scale. For example, certain dimensions, such as the dimensions of the boost devices, may have been enlarged relative to other dimensions, such as the length and width of the chamber, for clarity of illustration and to provide a more user-friendly description of the illustrative examples discussed below. In addition, various shadings, dashes and the like may have been used to provide a more clear disclosure, and the use of such shadings, dashes and the like is not intended to refer to any particular material or orientation unless otherwise clear from the context.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The boost devices disclosed here represent a technological advance. Methods and/or devices including at least one boost device have numerous and widespread uses including, but not limited to, chemical analysis, chemical reaction chambers, welders, destruction of radioactive waste, plasma coating processes, vapor deposition processes, molecular beam epitaxy, assembly of pure light sources, low UV measurements, etc. Additional uses will be readily recognized by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In accordance with certain examples (&#x201c;certain examples&#x201d; being intended to refer to some examples, but not all examples, of the present technology), atomization devices, spectrometers, welders and other devices disclosed below that include one or more boost devices may be configured with suitable shielding to prevent unwanted interference with other components included in the devices. For example, boost devices may be contained within lead chambers to shield other electrical components from the radio frequencies generated by the boost devices. In some examples, one or more ferrites may be used to minimize or reduce RF signals that might interfere with electronic circuitry. Other suitable shielding materials may be implemented including, but not limited to, aluminum, steel, and copper enclosures, honeycomb air filters, filtered connectors, RF gaskets and other RF shielding materials that will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In accordance with certain examples, boost devices disclosed here may take numerous forms, such as, for example, a coil of wire electrically coupled to a radio frequency generator and/or radio frequency transmitter. In other examples, boost devices may include one or more circular plates or coils in electrical communication with a RF generator. In some examples, the boost device may be constructed by placing a coil of wire in electrical communication with a radio frequency generator. The coil of wire may be wrapped around a chamber to supply radio frequencies to the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Suitable RF generators and transmitters will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, and exemplary RF generators and transmitters include, but are not limited to, those commercially available from ENI, Trazar, Hunttinger and the like. In some examples, the boost devices may be in electrical communication with a primary RF generator, such as an RF source used to power a primary induction coil. That is, in certain examples, the devices disclosed herein may include a single RF generator that is used to power both a primary energy source, e.g., an atomization source such as a plasma, as well as one or more boost devices. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a boost device can be understood to be one or more secondary RF energy sources, that, for example, may be coupled to a RF generator that may also be coupled to one or more primary RF energy sources.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In accordance with certain examples, devices disclosed herein may include one or more stages. For example, a device may include a desolvation stage that removes liquid solvent from a sample, an ionization stage that may convert atoms to ions and/or one or more excitation stages that may provide energy to excite atoms. The boost devices disclosed herein may be used in any one or more of these stages to provide additional energy.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In accordance with certain examples, an example of a boost device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this example, a boost device <b>200</b> is shown coiled around a chamber <b>205</b>. The boost device <b>200</b> includes radio frequency coils <b>210</b> electrically coupled to an RF generator <b>215</b>. The boost device <b>210</b> is configured to provide radio frequency signals into the chamber <b>205</b>. The exact frequency and power may vary depending on numerous factors including, but not limited to, the desired effect, the configuration of the chamber, etc. In certain examples, the boost device provides signals at a frequency of about 25 MHz to about 50 MHz, more particularly about 35 MHz to about 45 MHz, e.g., about 40.6 MHz. In other examples, the boost device provides signals at a frequency of about 5 MHz to about 25 MHz, more particularly about 7.5 to about 15 MHz, e.g., about 10.4 MHz. In yet other examples, the frequency ranges from about 1 kHz to about 100 GHz. For example, at lower frequencies the energy may be inductively coupled with the use of load coils or induction coils, such as those described in commonly owned U.S. application Ser. No. 10/730,779, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. At most frequencies, the energy may be capacitively coupled using plates or conductive coatings. At high frequencies, helical resonators or cavities may be used. Other suitable frequencies will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, for various applications. In certain examples, the boost device may provide radio frequencies at a power of about 1 Watt to about 10,000 Watts, more particularly about 10 Watts to about 5,000 Watts. In other examples, the boost device provides radio frequencies at a power of about 100 Watts to about 2,000 Watts. In examples where a plasma is formed in a small capillary, such as a GC capillary tube using a dry gas, then a power of 1 watt or less may be used. If a large secondary chamber, e.g., having dimensions similar to a large fluorescent light tube, and high solvent loads are used, then powers as large as 10,000 watts or higher may be desirable to provide the desired results. Other suitable powers will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure. Suitable devices for providing radio frequency signals include, but are not limited to, radio frequency transmitters commercially available from numerous sources such as ENI, Trazar, Hunttinger and Nautel, and radio frequency circuits such as Impedance Matching Networks from ENI, or Trazar. Suitable circuitry for generating radio frequencies will be readily selected and/or designed by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure. In some examples, two or more radio frequency coils are used with each radio frequency coil being tuned to the same frequency or a different frequency and/or providing radio frequencies at the same power or a different power. Other configurations will be selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In accordance with certain examples, the boost devices disclosed here may be configured to provide additional energy to &#x201c;boost&#x201d; or increase the energy already present in a chamber, such as the chamber of an atomization device that includes an atomization source. As used here, &#x201c;atomization device&#x201d; is used in the broad sense and is intended to include other processes that may take place in the chamber, such as desolvation, vaporization, ionization, excitation, etc. Atomization source refers to a heat source that is operative to atomize, desolvate, ionize, excite, etc. species introduced into the atomization source. Suitable atomization sources for various applications will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, and exemplary atomization sources include, but are not limited to, flames, plasmas, arcs, sparks, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory or by this example, understanding of certain aspects may be had with reference to the introduction of a liquid sample. As liquid sample is introduced into an atomization device, an atomization source within the chamber may rapidly cool, due to desolvation. That is, a material amount of energy may be used to convert the liquid solvent into a gas, which may result in a decrease in temperature (or other loss of energy) of the atomization source. A result of this cooling is that less energy may be available to atomize, ionize and/or excite any species that were dissolved in the solvent. Using certain embodiments of boost devices disclosed here, additional energy may be provided to enhance atomization and/or ionization of any species present in the introduced sample and, in certain examples, the additional energy may be used to excite atoms and/or ions present in a sample. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory or application or this one embodiment, atomization device <b>300</b> includes a chamber <b>305</b> that is surrounded by an induction coil <b>310</b> in communication with a radio frequency generator <b>315</b>. Atomization source is shown in a first state <b>320</b> and is contained within chamber <b>305</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the radio frequency generator <b>315</b> is turned off such that no radio frequencies are provided to radio frequency coils <b>310</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, when radio frequency generator <b>315</b> is turned on, radio frequencies are provided to chamber <b>305</b>, which results in conversion of the atomization source from the first state <b>320</b> to a second state <b>330</b>. A result of application of radio frequencies to chamber <b>305</b> is the extension of the atomization source along the axial and/or radial lengths of the chamber to provide an increased effective area of energy for atomizing, ionizing and exciting a sample.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In accordance with certain examples, an additional example of adding energy to enhance atomization and/or ionization of chemical species is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a high frequency source <b>250</b>, which may be, for example, a 2.54 gigahertz magnetron, may be configured to be electrically coupled with a power supply <b>252</b> and a waveguide adapter <b>254</b>. An electrical lead <b>256</b> provides electrical communication between a waveguide adapter <b>254</b> and a circulator <b>258</b>, which itself may be electrically coupled to a coaxial resistor load <b>260</b>, e.g., a 50 ohm load. The circulator <b>258</b> is in electrical communication with a microwave cavity <b>262</b>, which is operative to provide radio frequencies into a chamber <b>264</b>, which passes through the microwave cavity <b>262</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the high frequency source <b>250</b> is turned off so that no radio frequencies are transmitted to the microwave cavity <b>262</b> or the chamber <b>264</b> and the atomization source remains in a first state <b>266</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, when the high frequency source <b>250</b> is turned on, radio frequencies are provided to the chamber <b>264</b>, which results in conversion of atomization source from a first state <b>266</b> to a second state <b>268</b>. A result of application of radio frequencies to the chamber <b>264</b> is the extension of the atomization source along the axial and/or radial lengths of the chamber to provide an increased effective area of energy for atomizing, ionizing and exciting a sample. Suitable commercially available devices for implementing the configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, and illustrative microwave generators and power supplies are commercially available from Aalter Reggio Emlia (Italy), illustrative coaxial resistors are commercially available from Bird Electronic Corp. (Solon, Ohio), and illustrative circulators are commercially available from National Electronics (Geneva, Ill.). Illustrative waveguide adapters may be fabricated, for example, using cross-bar mode transducers, which are commercially available from numerous sources, and by reference to numerous publications, such as, for example, the &#x201c;ITT Reference Data for Radio Engineers (Sixth Edition)&#x201d; section under &#x201c;Waveguides and Resonators.&#x201d; Microwave cavities may be commercially obtained from numerous sources or will be readily fabricated by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, and optionally with the guidance of C. J. M. Beenakker, <i>Spectrochimica Acta</i>, Vol. 31B, pp. 483 to 486 Pergamon Press 1976.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In accordance with certain examples, the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, may be able to extend the length of an atomization source by a selected or suitable amount. In certain examples, the length of the atomization source may be extended by using the boost devices. As one example, the atomization source may be extended by at least about three times its normal length along a longitudinal axis of a chamber using a boost device as disclosed herein. In other embodiments, the atomization source may be extended by at least about five times its normal length along the longitudinal axis of the chamber or at least about ten times it normal length along the longitudinal axis of the chamber using a boost device as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In accordance with certain examples, the boost devices may be operated in a pulsed or continuous mode. As used here pulsed mode refers to providing radio frequencies in a non-continuous manner by providing radio frequencies followed by a delay before any subsequent radio frequencies are provided to the chamber. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, channel A represents radio frequencies provided to a chamber, such as chamber <b>205</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Channel B represents the time intervals in which any resulting signal is measured from the chamber, using, for example, a detector such as those discussed herein. The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is based on sampling of a detectable signal when radio frequencies are not provided. Without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory or this example, by sampling any detectable signal during periods where no radio frequencies are provided, higher signal-to-noise values may be achieved. It is possible, however, to sample a detectable signal from a species during periods where radio frequencies are provided. For example and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, in a continuous mode, the radio frequencies are provided continuously and any resulting signal may be monitored continuously or intermittently. It will be within the ability of the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, to collect suitable signals during and/or between applications of radio frequencies using the boost devices disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">In accordance with certain other examples, an additional example of a boost device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a boost device <b>400</b> includes a support or plate <b>405</b>, a first electrode <b>410</b> and a second electrode <b>420</b> each mounted to support <b>405</b>. Each of the first electrode <b>410</b> and the second electrode <b>420</b> may be configured to receive a chamber within the interior of the electrodes. The support or plate <b>405</b> may be electrically coupled to a radio frequency transmitter or generator to provide radio frequencies to the first electrode <b>410</b> and the second electrode <b>420</b>. In this example, the first electrode <b>410</b> and the second electrode <b>420</b> may be operated at the same frequency or may be individually tuned to provide different frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In certain examples, the first electrode <b>410</b> may be operated with a radio frequency of about 10 MHz to about 2.54 GHz, and in other examples the second electrode <b>420</b> may be operated with a radio frequency of about 100 kHz to about 2.54 GHz. In other examples, the first electrode <b>410</b> may be operated with radio frequencies from about 10 MHz to about 200 MHz, and second electrode <b>420</b> may be operated with radio frequencies from about 100 kHz to about 200 MHz. The first electrode <b>410</b> and the second electrode <b>420</b> may take the form of the induction coil shown below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> or the induction coils discussed in commonly assigned patent applications U.S. Ser. No. 10/730,779, filed on Dec. 9, 2003, and entitled &#x201c;ICP-OES and ICP-MS Induction Current,&#x201d; the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. For the first electrode <b>410</b> and for the second electrode <b>420</b>, radio frequencies from about 20 MHz to about 500 MHz may be provided using, for example, helical resonators, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> and is discussed in more detail below. In some examples, the first electrode <b>410</b> and the second electrode <b>420</b> may be operated using radio frequencies from about 500 MHz to about 5 GHz using a microwave cavity or resonant cavity, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. In certain examples, capacitive coupling of energy may also be used in place of second electrode <b>420</b>; an example of this configuration is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> and is described in more detail below. Other suitable radio frequencies and powers will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In accordance with certain examples, an example of an atomization device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Atomization device <b>500</b> includes a chamber <b>505</b>, a flame source <b>510</b>, and a boost device <b>520</b>. The boost device <b>520</b> is electrically coupled to support <b>530</b>, which itself may be electrically coupled to radio frequency transmitter or generator or both (not shown). The chamber <b>505</b> may be constructed of suitable materials, such as quartz, and may include a cooling tube or jacket (not shown) to surround the chamber to reduce the temperatures experienced by the boost device. In this example, the flame source <b>510</b> may be any suitable flame, such as a methane/air flame, a methane/oxygen flame, hydrogen/air flame, a hydrogen/oxygen flame, an acetylene/air flame, an acetylene/oxygen flame, an acetylene/nitrous oxide flame, a propane/air flame, a propane/oxygen flame, a propane/nitrous flame, a naphtha/air flame, a naphtha/oxygen flame, a natural gas/nitrous flame, a natural gas/air flame, a natural gas/oxygen flame and other flames that may be generated using a suitable fuel source and a suitable oxidant gas. Such flames may generally be created by introducing fuel and oxygen in selected ratios and igniting the mixture with a spark, arc, flame or the like. The exact temperature of the flames may vary depending on the fuel and oxidant gas source and depending on the distance from the burner tip. For example, the highest flame temperatures are typically found slightly above the primary combustion zone with lower temperatures in the interconal region and in the outer cone. In at least certain examples, the temperature of at least some portion of the flame may be at least about 1700&#xb0; C. For example, a natural gas/air flame may have a temperature of about 1700-1900&#xb0; C., whereas a natural gas/oxygen flame may have a temperature of about 2700-2900&#xb0; C. and a hydrogen/oxygen flame may have a temperature of about 2550-2700&#xb0; C. Without wishing to be limited thereby, flame sources may be efficient at desolvation in some applications, but inefficient at atomization and ionization due to relatively low temperatures. Using the boost devices disclosed here, however, the efficiency of ionization and/or atomization may be increased using flame sources, such as hydrogen/oxygen flames, in combination with a boost device. For example, using one or more boost devices disclosed here in combination with a hydrogen/oxygen flame, it may be possible to achieve the benefits of having a high heat capacity of a flame for desolvation and (e.g., followed by) extreme plasma temperatures for greater excitation. This result is advantageous for several reasons including, but not limited to, reduced operating costs, simpler design, less RF noise, better signal-to-noise ratios, etc., although not every embodiment will meet or address one or more of these advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">In addition, a flame may tolerate increased sample loading while leaving the RF power from the boost device available for sample ionization. To minimize the spectral background of the flame while maintaining high gas purity, a &#x201c;water welder&#x201d; may be used to decompose any produced water to its elements of hydrogen and oxygen. Suitable water welders are commercially available, for example, from SRA (Stan Rubinstein Assoc.) or KingMech Co., LTD. The flame (in certain embodiments) also preferably should not present significant additional background signal than the background observed with the desolvation of aqueous samples. The person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to design suitable atomization devices including flame sources and boost devices.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In accordance with certain examples, when using the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a fluid sample may be introduced into the flame to desolvate the sample. Desolvation may (in certain embodiments) be accomplished by spraying the species into the chamber in the form of a fine mist. Suitable devices for creating mists of species include nebulizers such as those commercially available from J. E. Meinhard Assoc. Inc or CPI International. A fluid sample may be introduced into a nebulizer and may be mixed with an aerosol carrier gas, such as argon, neon, etc. The carrier gas nebulizes the liquid sample droplets to provide finely divided droplets that may be carried into the atomization device. Other suitable devices for delivering samples to the atomization device will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, and illustrative devices include, but are not limited to, a concentric nebulizer, a cross-flow nebulizer, an ultrasonic nebulizer and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In accordance with certain examples, as sample is introduced through a nebulizer into the atomization device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, fluid may be vaporized from the sample by a flame or a primary plasma. Chemical species in the sample may be atomized and/or ionized using the energy produced by the flame or the primary plasma. To increase the efficiency of atomization and/or ionization, the boost device may be used to provide radio frequencies to chamber <b>505</b>. Boost device may be configured to provide additional energy such that energy lost due to desolvation is restored by the boost, and, in certain examples, the total energy in the chamber exceeds the amount of energy present when only a flame or primary plasma is used. Such additional energy increases the amount of species that are atomized and/or ionized, which increases the number of species available for detection. In certain examples, atomization devices including the boost devices disclosed here may allow for the use of reduced amounts of sample due to the higher efficiency of atomization and ionization.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Another example of an atomization device is disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Atomization device <b>600</b> includes a chamber <b>605</b>, a flame or primary plasma <b>610</b>, and a boost device <b>620</b>. The boost device <b>620</b> includes a support <b>630</b>, which may be electrically coupled to a radio frequency transmitter or generator (not shown). In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the boost device <b>620</b> has been positioned downstream from the flame or primary plasma <b>610</b> in the &#x201c;ionization region&#x201d; of chamber <b>605</b>. As used here, for illustrative purposes only, the ionization region refers to the region of a chamber where signal is measured or detected. For example and again for illustrative purposes only, region <b>650</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is referred to in some instances herein as the desolvation region and region <b>660</b> is referred to in some instances herein as the ionization region. It will be understood by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, however, the desolvation may occur at least to some extent in the ionization region and detection of chemical species may occur at least to some extent in the desolvation region depending on the exact configuration of the device, and it will also be understood by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, that there need not be fixed or discrete boundaries that separate the desolvation and ionization regions. As sample is introduced into the flame or primary plasma <b>605</b>, the flame or primary plasma <b>605</b> desolvates, atomizes, ionizes and/or excites the sample. The atomized and/or ionized sample may be carried downstream toward boost device <b>620</b> using for example an assist or carrier gas such as nitrogen gas, argon gas, etc. The atoms and ions may not be excited when exiting the desolvation region and in certain embodiments provide little or no detectable signal. Using boost device <b>620</b>, atomized and/or ionized sample that enters the ionization region may be excited to provide a detectable signal. For example, atoms and ions may be excited by the radio frequencies introduced by boost device <b>620</b> such that optical emission occurs, which may be detected using suitable detectors as discussed in more detail below. It will be within the ability of the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, to position boost devices at suitable positions along a chamber to provide a desired result such as, for example, atomization, ionization or excitation.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In accordance with certain examples, an example of an atomization device using an electrothermal atomization source is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. An atomization device <b>700</b> includes a chamber <b>705</b>, an electrothermal atomizer <b>710</b>, a boost device <b>720</b> and a radio frequency generator <b>730</b>. Electrothermal atomizers, such as graphite tubes or cups, atomize sample by first evaporating liquid from the sample at a relatively low temperature (e.g., about 1200&#xb0; C.) and then ashing the sample at a higher temperature (e.g., about 2000-3000&#xb0; C.), which results in atomization of the sample. The atomized sample may be carried down chamber <b>705</b> using a carrier gas, such as argon, nitrogen, etc., and may be excited for detection using the boost device <b>720</b>. The person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to design atomization devices with electrothermal atomizers and boost devices.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In accordance with certain examples, an example of an atomization device using a plasma is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. An atomization device <b>800</b> includes a chamber <b>805</b>, a plasma <b>810</b>, and a boost device <b>820</b>. The boost device <b>820</b> includes a support which may be in electrical communication with a radio frequency generator <b>830</b>. Without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory, plasmas suffer less than flames from interferences, such as oxide formation, because of the higher temperatures of the plasmas. In addition, spectra may be obtained from a plurality of sample species under a single set of conditions, which allows for measurement of many species simultaneously. The higher temperatures in the plasmas may also provide improved detection limits and be useful for detection of non-metal species. A plasma may be created when a gas, such as argon, is excited and/or ionized to form ions and electrons, and in certain instances cations. The ions may be maintained at high temperatures by using an external power source, such as a DC electrical source. For example, two or more electrodes may be positioned around high temperature argon ions and electrons to provide current between the electrodes to maintain the plasma temperature. Other suitable power sources for sustaining plasmas include, but are not limited to, radio frequency induction coils, such as those used in inductively coupled plasmas, and microwaves, such as those used in microwave induced plasmas. For convenience purposes only, an inductively coupled plasma device is described below, but the boost devices disclosed herein may be readily used with other plasma devices.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, inductively coupled plasma device <b>900</b> includes chamber <b>905</b> comprising three or more tubes, such as tubes <b>910</b>, <b>920</b> and <b>930</b>. The tube <b>910</b> is in fluid communication with a gas source, such as argon, and a sample introduction device. The argon gas aerosolizes the sample and carries it into the desolvation and ionization regions of a plasma <b>940</b>. The tube <b>920</b> may be configured to provide tangential gas flow throughout the tube <b>930</b> to isolate plasma <b>940</b> from the tube <b>930</b>. Without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory, gas is introduced through inlet <b>950</b>, and the tangential flow acts to cool the inside walls of center tube <b>910</b> and centers plasma <b>940</b> radially. Radio frequency inductions coils <b>960</b> may be in electrical communication with a radio frequency generator (not shown) and are configured to create plasma <b>940</b> after the gas is ionized using an arc, spark, etc. The person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to select or design suitable plasmas including, but not limited to inductively coupled plasmas, direct current plasmas, microwave induced plasmas, etc., and suitable devices for generating plasmas are commercially available from numerous manufacturers including, but not limited to, PerkinElmer, Inc., Varian Instruments, Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.), Teledyne Leeman Labs, (Hudson, N.H.), and Spectro Analytical Instruments (Kleve, Germany). An exemplary device for providing radio frequencies is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. A helical resonator <b>970</b> comprises an RF source <b>972</b>, an electrical lead <b>974</b>, which typically is a coaxial cable, configured to provide electrical communication with a coil <b>976</b> in a resonant cavity <b>978</b>. The resonant cavity <b>974</b> with the coil <b>978</b> may be configured to receive a chamber. In certain examples, radio frequencies from about 20 MHz to about 500 MHz may be provided using, for example, helical resonators. Exemplary dimensional information for construction of helical resonators may be found, for example, in the International Telephone and Telegraph, <i>Reference Data for Radio Engineers</i>. Fifth Edition. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, after creation of plasma <b>810</b> using, for example atomized and ionized argon and radio frequency induction coils <b>860</b>, sample may be introduced into the plasma <b>810</b>. Without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory or this example, desolvation of the sample may reduce the temperature of the plasma and may result in lesser amounts of energy available for atomization and ionization. The boost device <b>820</b> may be used to provide radio frequencies to boost the energy in the plasma to increase the efficiency of atomization and ionization. For example, the boost device <b>820</b> may be positioned such that the energy in the desolvation region <b>840</b> is increased to promote more efficient desolvation which may provide more atoms and ions to generate a detectable signal in the ionization region <b>850</b>. It will be within the ability of the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, to design atomization devices including plasmas and boost devices to enhance desolvation, atomization, ionization and excitation.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">In accordance with certain examples, another example of an atomization device including a plasma is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. An atomization device <b>1000</b> includes a chamber <b>1005</b>, a plasma <b>1010</b>, and a boost device <b>1020</b>. The boost device <b>1020</b> includes a support <b>1030</b>, which may be in electrical communication with a radio frequency transmitter or generator (not shown). The atomization device <b>1000</b> also includes radio frequency induction coils <b>1035</b> which are constructed and arranged to maintain plasma <b>1010</b>, which is shown as a torus. In this example the boost device <b>1020</b> is positioned downstream from a desolvation region <b>1040</b> in an ionization region <b>1050</b>. Introduction of a sample into plasma <b>1010</b> may result in a decrease in plasma temperature as energy in the plasma is used to desolvate the sample. This temperature decrease may reduce the efficiency of ionization and atomization and may reduce the number of ions and atoms that are excited. Using the boost device <b>1020</b>, ions and atoms that travel down the chamber <b>1005</b> to the ionization region <b>1050</b> may be excited. For example, radio frequencies at about 11 MHz and at a power of about 1.2 kilowatts may be provided to an analytical region <b>1050</b> to excite atoms and ions present in the ionization region. The excited atoms may be detected using suitable methods such as optical emission spectroscopy. The ionization region may be extended almost indefinitely by placing one or more boost devices along the ionization region of chamber <b>1005</b>. As discussed further below, the boost devices may be configured in stages and may be individually tuned to different frequencies and/or powers. The person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to detect excited ions and atoms using the atomization devices disclosed here along with suitable optics, detectors and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In accordance with certain examples, the signal originating from excited atoms and/or ions may be viewed or detected at least two ways. An example of the ionization region of a chamber, such as those used in the atomization devices disclosed here, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>. Any signal from a chamber <b>1105</b> may be viewed in at least one of two directions&#x2014;axially or radially. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, when monitored or detected radially, signal from the chamber <b>1105</b> may be monitored in one or more planes parallel to the radius of the chamber <b>1105</b>. For example, in an instrument configured to measure optical emissions radially, a detector may be positioned to detect signals that are emitted in the direction of arrow X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, when detected or monitored axially, signal from the chamber <b>1105</b> may be monitored or detected in one or more planes parallel to the axis of the chamber. For example, in an instrument configured to measure optical emissions axially, a detector may be positioned to detect signals that are emitted in the direction of arrow Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>. It will be recognized by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, that axial and radial detection are not limited to optical emissions but may be used to detect signals from numerous other analytical techniques including absorption, fluorescence, phosphorescence, scattering, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In accordance with certain examples, an atomization device that includes at least two boost devices is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. An atomization device <b>1200</b> may include a chamber <b>1205</b> and a radio frequency induction coil <b>1210</b> configured to generate a plasma <b>1215</b>. The atomization device <b>1200</b> may also include a first boost device <b>1220</b> in electrical communication with a support <b>1230</b> and a second boost device <b>1240</b> in electrical communication with a support <b>1250</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a first boost device <b>1230</b> and a second boost device <b>1250</b> are positioned in the ionization region of the chamber <b>1205</b> to provide additional energy to excite atoms and ions present in the ionization region. The boost devices <b>1230</b> and <b>1250</b> may be configured to provide the same or different frequency of radio frequencies. For example, each of boost devices may be configured to provide radio frequencies of about 15 MHz and at a power of about 1000 Watts. The boost devices <b>1230</b> and <b>1250</b> may independently provide radio frequencies in either pulsed or continuous modes. For example, the boost device <b>1230</b> may provide radio frequencies in a pulsed mode while the boost device <b>1250</b> may provide radio frequencies continuously. In the alternative, the boost device <b>1230</b> may provide radio frequencies continuously while the boost device <b>1250</b> may provide radio frequencies in a pulsed mode. In other examples, both of boost devices <b>1230</b> and <b>1250</b> may provide radio frequencies continuously, or both of boost devices <b>1230</b> and <b>1250</b> may provide radio frequencies in a pulsed mode. It will be within the ability of the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, to provide radio frequencies in a selected manner or mode using multiple boost devices. While the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> includes two boost devices positioned in the ionization region of chamber <b>1205</b>, in certain examples one of the boost devices may be positioned in the desolvation region with the second boost device positioned in the ionization region. In yet other examples, both of the boost devices may be positioned in the desolvation region. Additional configurations for arranging two or more boost devices along a chamber will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In accordance with certain examples, a chamber comprising a manifold or interface is disclosed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, a chamber <b>1300</b> comprises a manifold or interface <b>1305</b> in contact with a chamber cavity <b>1310</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, the interface <b>1305</b> includes a small opening or a port <b>1320</b> configured to receive sample. The port <b>1320</b> may take numerous sizes and forms. In certain examples, the port may be circular and have a diameter of about 0.25 mm to about 25 mm, more particularly about 4 mm. In other examples, the port may be rectangular with length and width measurements each about 0.25 mm to about 4 mm. Other port shapes, such as rhomboidal, trapezoidal, triangular, octahedral, etc., and port sizes will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure. In certain examples, the port may be positioned centrally, such as the position of port <b>1320</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, whereas in other examples, the port may be positioned at any selected region or area of the interface. In examples where the port is positioned at the center of the interface, the discharge from the atomization source may be blocked, or partially blocked, by the interface. Without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory or this example, blockage of the discharge may lower the detection limit due to removal, or reduction, of background signal from the discharge, which may increase the signal-to-noise ratio. This result may be achieved with both axial and radial detection of signals from the chamber <b>1300</b>. Also, the working pressure of the boosted discharge may have some effect on the spectral emission quality, and may be optimized for the specific operating conditions based on sample, hardware, detection schemes, etc. An example of one way to control the working pressure of the secondary chamber is by controlling the exit gas flow rate and selecting the interface port size. Another example is to select the port diameter and directly control the exit gas pressure. Another example may be to have a higher exhaust flow and provide an additional bleed gas into the chamber. The exact pressure and power may vary depending on numerous factors including, but not limited to, the desired effect, the configuration of the chamber, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In accordance with certain examples, the chamber <b>1300</b> may include a vacuum pump (not shown) that may be operative to draw sample through the port <b>1320</b> into the secondary chamber for detection. In certain examples, the interface may be configured with a side port or outlet that is in fluid communication with the second chamber. A vacuum pump may be coupled to the side port to draw sample into the chamber <b>1300</b>. In other examples, sample diffuses or flows into the secondary chamber, because the pressure in the secondary chamber may be less than the pressure in the atomization source chamber. For example, pressures in chambers including flames are higher than atmospheric pressure due to the high flow rates of gases introduced into the chamber. Pressures in plasmas may be higher than atmospheric pressure due to the high flow rates of gases through the chamber. In certain examples, the pressure of the chamber with the interface is approximately atmospheric pressure such that atoms and ions may flow down a pressure gradient from the high pressure chamber where atomization and/or ionization has occurred to a lower pressure chamber, e.g., where excitation may occur through the use of a boost device as disclosed herein. The person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to construct suitable chambers with interfaces for receiving and/or detecting atoms and ions generated using one or more atomization sources.</p>

Examples using a single radio frequency generator, e.g. a single RF source, may allow for operation of the radio frequency induction coil and boost device at different inductances to tailor or to tune the radio frequency induction coil or boost device or both for a particular region or area of the device. A specific example of this configuration is described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96B</figref>. Even though a single radio frequency generator may be used, the induction coil and the boost device may be designed for different plasma impedances in each region with respect to its location. For example, the inductance value of the induction coil and the boost device may be different to provide devices having different properties and performance characteristics. In other examples, the properties of the induction coil and the boost device may be varied by varying the diameter, coupling or shape of each of the induction coil and the boost device.

The detection device <b>2230</b> may be positioned ninety degrees from incident light <b>2212</b> from the light source <b>2210</b> to minimize the amount of light from the light source <b>2210</b> that arrives at the detection device <b>2230</b>. Fluorescence, phosphorescence and Raman emissions may occur in 360 degrees so the positioning of the detection device <b>2230</b> to collect light emissions is not critical. The atomization device <b>2205</b> may be any of the atomization devices discussed herein and other atomization devices configured with at least one boost device. The atomization device <b>2205</b> may be configured to provide atoms and ions to the sample chamber <b>2220</b> through the tube <b>2222</b> which may be in fluid communication with the sample chamber <b>2220</b>. An optical chopper <b>2215</b> may be used where it is advantageous to pulse the light source <b>2210</b>. Where the light source is a pulsed laser, the chopper <b>2215</b> may be omitted. As atomized and/or ionized sample enters into the sample chamber <b>2220</b>, the light source <b>2210</b> excites one or more electrons into an excited state, e.g., into an excited singlet state, and the excited atom may emit photons as it decays back to a ground state, Where the excited atom decays from an excited singlet state to the ground state with resultant emission of light, fluorescence emission is said to occur, and the maximum emission signal is typically red-shifted when compared to the wavelength of the excitation source. Where the excited atom decays from an excited triplet state to the ground state with resultant emission of light, phosphorescence emission is said to occur, and the maximum emission wavelength of phosphorescence is typically red-shifted when compared to the fluorescence maximum emission wavelength. For Raman spectroscopy, scattered radiation may be monitored and the Stokes or anti-Stokes lines may be monitored to provide detection of the sample. The emission signal may be collected using the detection device <b>2230</b>, which may be, for example, a monochromator with suitable optics such as prisms, echelle gratings and the like. The detection device <b>2230</b> provides a signal to the optional amplifier <b>2240</b> for amplification of the signal, which may then be viewed using the display <b>2250</b>. In examples, where the signal is sufficiently strong for detection, the optional amplifier <b>2240</b> may be omitted. In certain examples, the display <b>2250</b> is part of a computer or data acquisition system for analysis of the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In accordance with certain examples, the sample chamber conditions may be varied depending on whether it is desirable to measure fluorescence, phosphorescence or Raman scattering. For many chemical species, the rate constant for internal conversion and/or fluorescence is typically much greater than the rate constant for phosphorescence and, as a result, either non-radiative emission or fluorescence emission dominates. By varying the sample conditions, it may be possible to favor phosphorescence, or scattering, over fluorescence. For example, the sample chamber <b>2220</b> may include a matrix or solid support, e.g., silica, cellulose, acrylamide, etc., that atoms and/or ions may be adsorbed to or trapped in. In other examples, the sample chamber <b>2220</b> may be operated at reduced temperatures, e.g., 77 Kelvin, such that atoms and ions entering into the sample chamber <b>2220</b> may be frozen in a matrix. For at least certain species, immobilization of the species in a matrix may result in increased intersystem crossing to populate triplet energy levels, which may favor phosphorescence emission over fluorescence emission. It will be within the ability of the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, to select suitable sampling conditions for monitoring fluorescence, phosphorescence and Raman scattering.</p>

<p id="p-0207" num="0206">In accordance with certain examples, a spectrometer configured for measurement in the low UV and that includes a boost device is provided. As used herein &#x201c;low UV&#x201d; refers to measurements taken at or around 90-200 nm or less. At wavelengths of less than about 200-210 nm, oxygen in the optical path may absorb emitted light (in the case of an OES device) or may absorb light used to excite atoms and ions (in the case of an AS device). This absorption by the oxygen may prevent detection of emission lines of atoms, such as chlorine, that emit in the low UV range. By using a boost device with an OES device or with an AS device, low UV measurements may be obtained by eliminating any oxygen present in the optical path. This result may be accomplished, for example, by coupling a first chamber, or a second chamber, to the spectrometer. For example, a first chamber may be used to contain the atomization source, and an interface may be used to draw atomized sample into a second chamber. The second chamber may include a boost device. The second chamber may be in fluid communication with a window or aperture on the spectrometer such that the optical path of the spectrometer is sealed off from any outside air or oxygen. The optical path may be purged with a gas that does not absorb in the low UV, e.g., nitrogen, such that light emissions in the low UV, or light absorptions using low UV, are not interfered with by oxygen. In certain examples, the device includes a boost device optically coupled to a window on a spectrometer such that substantially no oxygen or air exists in the light path of the spectrometer. In certain examples, the device may be configured for optical emission such that light emissions in the low UV may be detected.

In certain examples, the detector may be optically coupled to a chamber comprising a boost device such that light emissions or absorptions in the chamber may be detected. In some examples, the chamber may also be optically coupled to a light source, e.g., a UV light source such as a laser, arc lamp or the like, such that light may be provided to the chamber to detect the presence of species that absorb the low UV light.

<p id="p-0228" num="0227">In accordance with additional examples, a device for optical emission spectroscopy (OES) that includes an inductively coupled plasma and a boost device is disclosed. In certain examples the OES device includes a first chamber comprising the inductively coupled plasma and a second chamber with at least one boost device for exciting atoms or species. Without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory, in a conventional OES device, the analyte may be diluted by at least about 20:1 with a carrier gas. This dilution results in lower sensitivity and/or requires the use of more concentrated samples to detect the species. The second chamber in certain OES devices may be configured to extract atomized and ionized species to avoid the dilution effect caused by the carrier gas. For example, the second chamber may include a suitable interface or manifold such that sample from the interior portion of the plasma plume in the first chamber may be drawn into the second chamber and the carrier gas and cooling gas circulating near the outer portions of the first chamber may be removed. This process may result in concentrating the sample in the second chamber. For example, the OES device may be configured such that sample introduced into the second chamber may be diluted by less than about 15:1 with carrier gas, more particularly by less than about 10:1 with carrier gas, e.g., the sample may be diluted by less than about 5:1 with carrier gas. Such concentrating of sample in the second chamber due to less dilution with carrier gas may provide increased emissions which may provide improved detection limits. For example, the sample may be at least about 2-4 times more concentrated in the second chamber than in the first chamber. In addition, the flame or primary plasma background signal may be removed from axial viewing by placing an optical stop or filter between the first and second chamber. This may result in further improvement of detection limits to at least about 5-fold lower than detection limits obtained using ICP-OES devices without second chambers including a boost device. The exact improvement in the detection limit will depend on numerous factors including the size of the orifice or port in the manifold or interface, the amount of sample drawn into the second chamber, the length of the second chamber, the number of boost devices used in the second chamber, etc. It will be within the ability of the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure to select and design suitable ICP-OES devices including second chambers with boost devices.</p>

<p id="p-0258" num="0257">In accordance with certain examples, a light source is provided. An illustrative light source is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. The light source <b>3300</b> includes an atomization device <b>3310</b>, a boost device <b>3320</b> in electrical communication with RF source <b>3330</b> and a sample inlet <b>3340</b> for introducing a chemical species that may emit light when excited. A sample containing a single chemical species, or in certain examples, multiple chemical species, may be introduced into the atomization device <b>3310</b> and excited using the atomization device <b>3310</b> and/or the boost device <b>3320</b>. In examples where a single species is used, e.g., where substantially pure sodium ions dissolved in water are introduced into the atomization device <b>3310</b>, a single wavelength of light may be emitted as excited sodium atoms decay.

<p id="p-0259" num="0258">In accordance with certain examples, an atomization device that includes a microwave source or microwave oven is disclosed. For illustrative purposes only and without limitation, an exemplary atomization device including a microwave source is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. The atomization device <b>3400</b> includes an atomization source <b>3410</b> within a microwave oven <b>3420</b>. A sample inlet <b>3430</b> may be configured to introduce sample into the atomization source <b>3410</b>. Without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory, microwave oven <b>3420</b> may be operative to provide microwaves to atomization source <b>3410</b> which may promote ionization efficiency and/or may be used to excite atoms and ions. Typical microwave ovens use an absorption cell as the oven cavity, and a microwave launcher and magnetron tube as an RF source. The microwave launcher may be a small section of wave guide which mounts the magnetron tube forming the mode of propagation. This launches the RF energy into the oven or absorption cell. This RF energy may reflect off of the walls of the oven until it is absorbed and dissipated as heat. Because the oven is an unstructured cavity, it exhibits voltage maxima and nodes as constructive and destructive reflections collide. When the RF voltage in the standing maxima exceeds the ionization potential of the constituent atoms in the atomization source and the population of free ions and electrons is sufficient to allow for RF circulating currents to form, a plasma may form in the plume of the atomization source, dramatically raising the temperature of the atomization source. The atomization source <b>3410</b> may be any of the atomization sources disclosed herein, e.g., flames, plasmas, arcs, sparks and other suitable atomization sources that will be readily selected by the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure. When the atomization source is a flame, the benefits of having both the high heat capacity of a flame needed for efficient desolvation and the extreme plasma temperatures needed for great excitation may be achieved. The flame would tolerate greatly increased sample loading while leaving the RF power available for sample atomization and ionization. For example, when the microwave oven <b>3420</b> is turned on, a plasma plume may be formed, or in the case where the atomization source is a plasma, the plasma source may be extended. RF energy, including microwave energy, may be used as a boost source that can be directly coupled with a flame to not only dramatically increase the temperature of flame combustion but to actually change the nature of the resulting combination of both a flame and a plasma discharge. A microwave cavity or resonator may be used in place of the microwave oven to ensure a continuous, well structured, and controlled discharge. The plasma plume may be used for any one or more of the applications discussed herein, e.g., chemical analysis, welding, in a spectrometer, etc. It will be within the ability of the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, to implement atomization devices including atomization sources with microwave ovens.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">In accordance with certain examples, the boost devices disclosed herein may be adapted for use in plasma displays. Without wishing to be bound by any particular scientific theory, plasma displays operate using noble gases and electrodes. Noble gases, such as xenon and neon, are contained within microstructures or cells positioned between at least two glass plates. On both sides of each microstructure or cell are long electrodes. A first set of electrodes, referred to as the address electrodes, are arranged to sit behind the microstructures along the rear or back glass plate and are arranged vertically on the display. Transparent glass electrodes are mounted on top of the microstructures along the front glass plate and are arranged horizontally on the display. The transparent glass electrodes typically are surrounded by a dielectric material and are covered with a protective layer, such as magnesium oxide, for example. The boost devices disclosed here may be adapted for use with plasma displays to enhance or increase ionization of the noble gases. For example, in a typical plasma display, the noble gas in a particular microstructure or cell is ionized by charging the electrodes that intersect at that microstructure. The electrodes are charged thousands or millions of times per second, charging each microstructure in turn. As intersecting electrodes are charged, a voltage differential is created between the electrodes such that an electric current flows through the noble gas in the microstructure. This current creates a rapid flow of charged particles, which stimulates the noble gas atoms and/or ions to release ultraviolet photons. The ultraviolet photons in turn cause phosphors coated on the display to emit visible light. By varying the pulses of current flowing through the different microstructures, the intensity of each sub-pixel color may be increased or decreased to create hundreds of different combinations of red, green and blue. In this way, the entire spectrum of colors may be produced. In certain examples, miniaturized boost devices may be included that surround a portion or all of each microstructure. For example, each microstructure in a plasma display may be surrounded with a boost device to increase the rate of ionization of the noble gases and/or to increase the efficiency at which the noble gases release ultraviolet photons. The boost from the boost device may be provided, e.g., in a continuous or pulsed mode, prior to, during or subsequent to charging of the electrodes. It may be desirable to provide RF shielding to each microstructure so that surrounding microstructures are not affected by RF supplied to any particular microstructure. Such shielding may be accomplished using suitable materials and devices, including, but not limited to, ground-planes and Faraday shields.</p>

Phys. 37 (7 Jun. 2004) 1537-1534, and other microplasmas, such as those used to join fiber optical cables, are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,118,618 and 5,024,725.</p>

For example, the single use device may include a battery or fuel cell to provide sufficient power to a detector to measure the amount of light emitted from excited lead atoms and to provide sufficient power to the boost device. The device may display the reading on an LCD screen or other suitable display to provide an indication of the lead levels.

The boost device supply control <b>4010</b> was used as the power supply and control for the boost device. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the plasma excitation source <b>4050</b> and boost device excitation source <b>4020</b> were located on a plate in the center of the atomization device <b>4000</b>. The plate used was a 1.5 foot by 2 foot optical bench purchased from the Oriel Corporation (Stratford, Conn.). Each of plasma excitation source <b>4050</b> and boost device excitation source <b>4020</b> were mounted to a large aluminum angle bracket mounting the source above and at right angles to the plate. Slots were milled into the brackets allowing for lateral adjustment before securing to the plate. The plasma sensor was mounted in an aluminum box that may be positioned for viewing the plasma. The plasma sensor wiring was modified to shutdown both the plasma and boost device excitation sources in the event that the plasma was extinguished. Emergency off switch <b>4040</b> was remotely mounted in an aluminum box that could be brought close to the operator. AC and DC power, and the plasma sensor wiring was placed under table <b>4070</b>. Many safety features found in a conventional ICP-OES device were removed to allow operation of this setup, and there was no protection provided to the operator from hazardous voltages, or RF and UV radiation. This setup was operated remotely inside of a vented shielded screen room with separate torch exhaust. This open frame construction offered ease of setup between experiments. Using the setup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, it was possible to evaluate the performance enhancement in each experiment visually by using an yttrium sample and comparing the blue (ion) and red (atom) emission regions and the intensities of these regions or by using a sodium sample.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, primary excitation source was configured with an external 24 V/2.4A DC power supply <b>4110</b> made by Power One (Andover, Mass.). Ferrites <b>4120</b>, <b>4122</b>, <b>4124</b>, <b>4126</b> and <b>4128</b> were added to prevent RF radiation from interfering with the electronics and the computer. An ignition wire <b>4130</b> was extended from the original harness with high voltage wire and a plastic insulator to reach the torch and prevent arcing.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37-39</figref>, a boost device power supply and control box <b>4200</b> was configured with meters <b>4210</b> and <b>4220</b>, a power control knob <b>4230</b> and an RF on/off switch <b>4240</b>. The boost device power supply and control box <b>4200</b> was constructed to manually control the power to the boost device excitation source in configurations where the boost device was positioned around a single chamber device (see Example 3 below) or in configurations where the boost device was positioned around a second chamber in fluid communication with the first chamber (see Example 4 below). The control box <b>4200</b> contained the same type of 3 kW DC supply <b>4250</b>, Corcom line filter <b>4270</b>, solid state relay, and RF Interface board <b>4260</b> as found in the shipping version of the Optima 4000 generator, commercially available from PerkinElmer, Inc., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. A 48 V DC supply <b>4280</b> was not used. An external 24 V DC supply <b>4110</b> was used instead (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>). Meters <b>4210</b> and <b>4220</b> were wired to measure the output voltage and current from the 3 kW DC supply <b>4250</b>. A hand wired control board allowed for rapid fabrication. The layout of the hand wired control board used is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> and a schematic of the board is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42-44</figref> shows wire <b>4310</b> from an RF Interface board <b>4340</b> on the plasma source control box that drove solid state relay <b>4320</b> located in the boost device excitation source box (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>). The actual wiring for this plasma sense line is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. Power for the boost control box <b>4200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>) was tapped into from the 220 V AC line cord of the repackaged Optima 4000 generator <b>4060</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, an optical plasma sensor <b>4410</b> was located above a plasma source <b>4420</b> and a boost device <b>4430</b>. The optical plasma sensor <b>4410</b> had a small hole (about 4.5 mm in diameter) drilled through the aluminum box and mounting bracket to allow the light from the plasma to fall on the optical plasma sensor <b>4410</b>. Optical plasma sensor <b>4410</b> protected the plasma source and the boost source by shutting them down in the event that the plasma was accidentally extinguished. All of the generator functions including primary plasma ignition, gas flow control, power setting and monitoring were performed under manual control. For automated operation, a computer control using standard WinLab&#x2122; software, such as that commercially available on the Optima 4000 instruments and purchased from the PerkinElmer, Inc., could be used. After the primary plasma was ignited, the secondary boost power <b>4240</b> was switched on and manually controlled with the power control potentiometer <b>4230</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>). Many other safety features were defeated to allow operation of this setup, and there was no protection provided to the operator from hazardous voltages, hazardous fumes, or RF and UV radiation. However, the person of ordinary skill in the art, given the benefit of this disclosure, will be able to implement suitable safety features to provide a safely operating device and operating environment.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46 and 47</figref>, a manually controlled hardware setup is shown. The manually controlled hardware performs identically to the computer controlled hardware described above, so the common components in this setup such as the plasma and boost supplies and RF sources will not be described in detail. DC power sources <b>4510</b> and <b>4520</b> were used to power the protection circuitry for both plasma source <b>4540</b> and boost device source <b>4550</b>. DC power sources <b>4530</b> included four 1500 watt switching supplies. Two of the supplies were operated in parallel for a total of 3000 watts for the primary plasma RF source and the boost RF source.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, the hardware setup for Example 3, which may be operating using either the manually or the computer controlled system, is shown. Ignition arc ground return wire <b>4610</b> was a piece of number 18 gauge solid copper wire located near the end of the plasma torch and connected to grounded plate <b>4615</b> that the RF sources were mounted to. Wire <b>4610</b> provided a conductive path for the high voltage ignition arc to travel from the igniter assembly, through the center of the torch, traveling through the conductive argon gas and completing this path to ground. The quartz torch was similar to the Optima 3000XL torch (part number N0695379 available from PerkinElmer, Inc.) but the outside body of the torch was lengthened by 2 inches to capture the extended plume region of the boosted plasma. Solid brass coil extensions <b>4620</b> were added. These extensions extended the arms 1 3/16 inches and were &#x215d; inch in diameter with &#xbc; inch NPS (National Pipe Straight) thread on one side and a #4 metric tapped hole at the coil end. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> shows a boost device <b>4625</b> that used a 17&#xbd; turn coil of number 18 gauge solid copper wire, but a 9&#xbd; turn coil of number 14 gauge solid copper wire provided better performance. The turns of a secondary source <b>4630</b> were evenly spaced and did not touch each other or coil <b>4635</b> of plasma source <b>4640</b>, or extend past the end of the torch. Example 3 described below used the standard parts such as those found in the Optima 3000XL torch mount and sample introduction system. These included an igniter assembly <b>4650</b>, a torch mount <b>4660</b>, a 2 mm bore alumina injector <b>4670</b>, a cyclonic spray chamber <b>4680</b>, a Type C Concentric Nebulizer <b>4690</b>, and a peristaltic pump <b>4695</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48 and 49</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>, a plasma was operated in a typical normal mode of operation using the extended torch described above, with the boost device turned off and with 1300 watts of power to generate the plasma, with 1.2 L/minute of nebulizer gas flow with 500 ppm of yttrium, with 15 L/minute of plasma gas (argon), and with 0.2 L/minute of auxiliary gas flow (also argon). The plasma was operated with all of the same conditions, but with the boost device power on at about 800 watts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>). The enhancement of the ionization region of the yttrium sample was clearly observed (blue region in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>) with the boost device on.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-62</figref>, the hardware setup used in Example 4, a two chamber device (described below), is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> shows an Optima 3000XL sample introduction system <b>4710</b> which was similar to the system previously described in detail above. The setup used the standard unmodified Optima 3000XL torch and a torch bonnet <b>4755</b>, but the torch bonnet <b>4755</b> was installed on the back side of a load coil <b>4760</b>, and aided to center the torch in the load coil <b>4760</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>). A primary RF source <b>4720</b> used a standard Optima 4000 load coil and fittings, available from PerkinElmer, Inc., but had the plastic faceplate removed. Water cooled heat sinks <b>4775</b> and <b>4776</b> were used with a brass front mounting block <b>4730</b> and a back mounting block <b>4732</b>, which were purchased from Wakefield Engineering (Pelham, N.H.) part number 180-20-6C and were 6 inch square heat sinks. These heat sinks were modified by cutting them in half and adding additional mounting holes. The waterlines of each half were rejoined with short pieces of tubing and hose clamps. All of the water cooled heat sinks were placed in a series water path and tied to a NesLab CFT-75 Chiller that was purchased from the former NesLab Instruments Inc. in Newington, N.H., which is now Thermo Electron Corp. in Waltham, Mass. Brass mounting blocks <b>4730</b> and <b>4732</b> were cooled by sandwiching them between each half of the heat sink and bolted to Newport 360-90 mount <b>4750</b>. This setup was used for both the front and rear mounting blocks <b>4730</b> and <b>4732</b>, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53 and 54</figref>). A perspective view of the brass front mounting <b>4730</b> block is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>. This block was a simple brass rectangular block which was 5.8&#x2033; high by 1.6&#x2033; wide and &#xbd;&#x2033; deep, with the center hole tapped for the &#xbd; inch NPT Swaglok fitting <b>4734</b>. The block was tapped shallow enough that the Swaglok fitting <b>4734</b> did not protrude past the front of the mounting block. Four perimeter holes <b>4862</b>, <b>4864</b>, <b>4866</b> and <b>4868</b> were for mounting interface plate <b>4860</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>). The holes were clearance holes in the block and plate for use with #8-32 screws, lock washers, and nuts. The size of center hole orifice <b>4870</b> in interface plate <b>4860</b> may be varied to control the working pressure for a given flow rate. The size of the orifice hole <b>4870</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> that was used was 0.155&#x2033; inches (3.94 mm) in diameter. Rear mounting block <b>4732</b> may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57 and 58</figref>. This block was identical to the front block with the exception of the addition of side vacuum port <b>4792</b>, and the fact that a &#xbd;&#x2033; NPT tap was shallower so that Swaglok fitting <b>4794</b> did not completely block side vacuum fitting <b>4792</b>. Side vacuum port <b>4792</b> was also tapped shallow enough to prevent the &#xbc;&#x2033; Swaglok vacuum fitting <b>4792</b> from protruding and blocking the insertion of the larger Swaglok fitting <b>4794</b>. A rear quartz viewing window <b>4796</b> was held in place with a binder clip <b>4798</b> obtained from Office Depot (Delray Beach, Fla.). Any small air leaks at window <b>4796</b> did not have any effect on the performance. An axial viewing spectrometer <b>4740</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>) was setup to capture the emission down the length of a quartz tube <b>4815</b>. Quartz tubing <b>4815</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>) was purchased from Technical Glass Products (Painesville Township, Ohio) and was 10&#xbc;&#x2033; long and was sized for &#xbd;&#x2033; compression fittings. It was found that brass fittings would cause less stress fractures of the quartz than stainless steel fittings. Brass ferrules were substituted for stainless steel ferrules in front mounting block <b>4732</b> and Teflon ferrules were used in the rear mounting block <b>4734</b>. Boost device <b>4820</b> used a load coil of 14&#xbd; turns of &#x215b;&#x2033; copper tubing. The tubing oxidized quickly if not cooled, but oxidation did not hamper performance substantially. For ease of use, the coils of boost device <b>4820</b> were not cooled and were terminated in bare crimp ring lugs and mounted with #4 metric hardware onto the coil extensions described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">A side vacuum port <b>4792</b> was connected with 20 feet of &#xbc;&#x2033; ID BEV-A-LINE tubing to either small 12V DC Sensidyne vacuum pump <b>4910</b> (part number C120CNSNF60PC1 and commercially available from Sensidyne in Clearwater, Fla.) and Brooks 0-40SCFH air flow meter <b>4912</b> with needle valve as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> (used on the computer controlled system), or to a Porter Instrument Company B-1187 0-20 liters/minute flow meter and needle valve assembly (not shown) and Trivac S25B vacuum pump <b>4920</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> (used on the manual controlled system). The vacuum system used on the manual controlled system had a much higher capacity than what was desired.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref>, plasma <b>4950</b> was operated at 1300 watts with the boost device off using the setup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53 and 54</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62A</figref> shows plasma <b>4950</b> operating at 1300 watts with 15 L/minute of argon plasma gas, 1.2 L/minute of nebulizer gas flow with 500 ppm of sodium, and 0.2 L/min of auxiliary argon gas flow in the primary discharge. The boost device power was approximately 800 watts at a frequency of 20 MHz, and the flow rate into the second chamber was a low flow of about 1-2 L/min. In operation, the nebulizer gas flow was increased above that which is used in typical ICP operation. By raising the desolvation bullet to extend past the end of the torch to reach the sampling hole in the interface, not only is the available portion of sample increased but it is possible to capture the concentrated sample without it being diluted by mixing with the high flow rate of the plasma gas. The plasma gas may be allowed to escape by the gap between the primary discharge and the interface of the secondary chamber. The gas flow through the interface may be controlled and adjusted for best operation. By keeping the flow of the gas into the secondary chamber close to the same flow rate of the nebulizer, then just the concentrated sample may be carried into the secondary chamber. The interface of the secondary chamber has the added benefit of effectively blocking the background emission of the primary discharge. It is also possible to add an additional photon stop after the sample orifice to block the majority of or all of the primary discharge background light. It would also be possible to view off axis to prevent any of the primary background light from being viewed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62B</figref> is an enlarged view of the secondary chamber seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62A</figref> for a comparative view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62C</figref> shows a previous version of the secondary chamber (slightly shorter chamber and a few more turns of the boost device) operating at the same gas flow, sample, and primary discharge conditions, but using about 400 watts of boost power. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62D</figref> is also a previous version of the secondary chamber (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62C</figref>) with the same gas flow, and primary discharge conditions, but with a trace amount of yttrium (about 1-10 ppm) in water and using about 400 watts of boost power.</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Optical Emission using an ICP and Boost Device</heading>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>, a picture of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) source suitable for use in performing optical emission spectroscopy or mass spectroscopy is shown. An ICP source <b>5000</b> includes hollow injector <b>5010</b> to introduce aerosolized sample into a plasma <b>5020</b>, such as an RF induced argon plasma, contained in torch glassware <b>5030</b>. The ICP source <b>5000</b> also includes RF induction coils <b>5040</b>. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>, an axial viewing window <b>5050</b> may be used to monitor axial emission <b>5060</b>, and radial viewing window <b>5070</b> may be used to monitor radial emission <b>5080</b>. As discussed above, by viewing axially, detection limits may be improved by a factor of 5 to 10 times or more.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>, a schematic of an ICP containing a species that emits light is disclosed. ICP <b>5100</b> includes those components discussed above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref>. Sample is atomized into a fine aerosol mist before it passes into injector <b>5105</b> and into the plasma. High current torus discharge region <b>5110</b> of the plasma is the brightest background region of the plasma. Desolvation region <b>5120</b> of the sample is where solvent is removed from the injected sample. Ionization region <b>5130</b> is the useful region of the plasma where the atomized and/or ionized sample will emit light. The emitted light may be viewed axially <b>5140</b> or may be viewed radially <b>5150</b>. When yttrium is used as a sample, the blue emission may be about 5 times longer when viewed axially as compared to when viewed radially. Not only is the blue emission longer, but it is also brighter in the lower regions of the plasma; hence a greater than 5&#xd7; improvement in signal may be realized with axial viewing For radial viewing on the other hand, a region must be selected where there is high signal to background noise. The signal continues to get brighter as the viewing gets closer to the induction plates, but the background emission from the torus discharge increases faster than the signal as the viewing region approaches the induction plates. Hence the optimum radial viewing region is typically about 15 mm from the last induction plate. The torus discharge is &#x201c;lifesaver&#x201d; shaped with a hole in the middle. The axial viewing captures the ion emission of the sample but looks through the center of the torus discharge, thereby maximizing the ion emission and minimizing the background emission.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> shows an ICP including a boost device. An ICP <b>5200</b> includes a tube <b>5205</b>, a torch <b>5210</b>, an RF induction coil <b>5220</b>, a boost device <b>5225</b> and a shear gas <b>5230</b>. The shear gas <b>5230</b> is operative to terminate the plasma beyond the end of tube <b>5205</b>. ICP <b>5200</b> generates a plasma <b>5235</b> which may be used to desolvate an introduced sample. A desolvation region <b>5240</b> of the plasma <b>5235</b> provides energy to remove liquid from the sample. An ionization region <b>5250</b> is the region where excited sample may emit light. By switching on a boost device <b>5225</b>, the emission region may be extended, or emission may become more intense, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, a second configuration of an ICP including a boost device is shown. An ICP <b>5300</b> includes a torch <b>5310</b>, an extended quartz tube <b>5320</b>, an RF induction coil <b>5330</b> and a primary ICP RF source <b>5340</b>. The ICP <b>5300</b> also includes a boost device <b>5350</b> which is in electrical communication with RF source <b>5360</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>, emission <b>5410</b> is present when the boost device <b>5350</b> is &#x201c;off&#x201d; so that no boost is provided. When RF source <b>5360</b> is switched &#x201c;on&#x201d; to provide radio frequencies to the boost device <b>5350</b>, emission signal <b>5420</b> results. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, using the boost device <b>5350</b> with the RF source <b>5360</b> the emission region from a sample may be extended, which may provide increased levels of signal for detection.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>, as a sample is introduced into a plasma and when the boost device is off, plasma discharge <b>5610</b> surrounds sample emission <b>5620</b> and the hole in injector tube <b>5630</b> is still visible through sample emission <b>5620</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>, as a sample is introduced into a plasma and when boost device is on, emission <b>5710</b> from the sample overpowers the plasma discharge and the intensity of emission <b>5710</b> increases so that the injector tube may no longer be seen through the sample emission.</p>

<p id="p-0289" num="0288">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, a picture of an inductively coupled plasma source that was assembled is shown.

The plasma source was so bright that the emission could not be viewed without the optical attenuating aide of a piece of welding glass. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref> shows the optical emission of the yttrium through the piece of welding glass. A desolvation region <b>6110</b> (the reddish-pink region) is often referred to as a &#x201c;bullet&#x201d; due to its shape. As solvent droplets evaporate, the sample was left as microscopic salt particles. An ionization region <b>6120</b> was the region where the sample was ionized and emitted at its characteristic wavelength(s), which in this example where yttrium was used was blue light having a wavelength of about 371.029 nm. A high current discharge region <b>6130</b> of the plasma <b>6020</b> was the brightest background region of the plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, the effect of boost power on path length was demonstrated.

When boost device <b>6440</b> was turned on to provide radio frequencies of about 10.4 MHz and at a power of about 800 Watts, the blue yttrium emission region extended over 5-fold longer than that observed without the boost device and the intensity of the yttrium emission also increased. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> shows a perspective view of the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref> an axial view of the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</figref>, when the emission of the device assembled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> was viewed axially through a piece of welding glass and with boost device <b>6440</b> off, primary discharge <b>6610</b> and an injector <b>6620</b>, and an injector hole <b>6625</b> may still be observed through yttrium emission <b>6630</b>. When boost device was switched on at a power of about 800 Watts and a frequency of about 10.4 MHz, the blue yttrium emission became so intense that the primary discharge and the injector could not be observed. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83</figref>). With boost device <b>6440</b> turned on, the yttrium emission saturated a camera detector, even when a second piece of welding glass was placed between the camera detector and the yttrium emission.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</figref>, to determine if the boost device increased the plasma discharge background signal, water was aspirated through the device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</figref> shows the signal from aspirated water when boost device <b>6440</b> was turned off, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref> shows the signal from the aspirated water when boost device <b>6440</b> was turned on at a power of about 800 Watts and at a frequency of about 10.4 MHz.

<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 86-88</figref>, a device <b>7000</b> included first chamber <b>7010</b> for generation of an inductively coupled plasma, as described above in Example 1. First chamber <b>7010</b> included induction coils <b>7012</b>. A device <b>7000</b> also included a second chamber <b>7020</b> with a boost device <b>7022</b>. The second chamber <b>7020</b> included an interface <b>7024</b> which was configured with an orifice <b>7026</b> for introducing atoms and ions from the first chamber <b>7010</b> into the second chamber <b>7020</b>. An interface <b>7024</b> was configured to separate the small volume of ionized sample gas from the larger volume of plasma gas which was used to form the plasma discharge and to cool the torch glassware. This configuration preserved the concentration of the sample which otherwise was diluted as it mixed with the plasma gas. The interface <b>7024</b> also separated the plasma discharge signal from the emission signal in the second chamber, and the coupling of energy from the induction coils <b>7012</b> and energy from the boost device <b>7022</b>. The interface <b>7024</b> also eliminated the high background light from the plasma discharge when viewing of the sample signal in the second chamber. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</figref> shows an axial view of the orifice <b>7026</b> looking from first chamber <b>7010</b> towards the interface <b>7024</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88</figref> shows a top view looking down on interface <b>7024</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref> shows an axial view of the orifice <b>7026</b> looking from second chamber <b>7020</b> towards interface <b>7024</b>. Orifice <b>7026</b> had a circular cross-section with a diameter of about 0.155 inches (3.94 mm). The distance between the surface of the manifold and the end of first chamber <b>7010</b> was about 3 mm. Unlike certain manifolds used in ICP-MS, the interface used in this example was for a completely different purpose and under completely different operating conditions. The interface used here separated multiple discharges, the orifice hole was much larger than that used in ICP-MS, and the pressure at the back of the interface was much higher, typically close to atmospheric. In contrast, ICP-MS manifolds are used to separate the ICP source from the spectrometer, whereas interface <b>7024</b> was part of device <b>7000</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</figref>, vacuum pump <b>7040</b> and flow meter <b>7042</b> with a needle valve were used to draw atoms and ions from the first chamber <b>7010</b> into the second chamber <b>7020</b>. Vacuum pump was coupled to the second chamber <b>7020</b> through an inlet positioned at the opposite end of the second chamber <b>7020</b> from the interface <b>7024</b>, as discussed above in Example 1. The needle valve was used to control the flow rate of sample that was drawn into the second chamber <b>7020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</figref>, a primary discharge <b>7110</b> from an ICP torch <b>7120</b> is shown. An emission signal <b>7130</b> from 200 ppm of sodium was yellow/orange in color. A boost device <b>7140</b> was a coil of &#x215b; inch copper tubing (6.5 turns) in electrical communication with RF source <b>7150</b> and was placed around a second chamber <b>7160</b>. A power of about 100 Watts and radio frequencies of about 30 MHz were used to excite the sodium atoms in the second chamber <b>7160</b>. It was possible to vary the temperature of the regions of the emission signal <b>7130</b> in the second chamber <b>7160</b> by varying the power supplied to the boost device <b>7140</b>. An interface <b>7170</b> acted as a light shield blocking the bright primary background emission from being viewed when viewing the emission signal <b>7130</b> in the second chamber <b>7160</b>. The interface <b>7170</b> also successfully prevented the sample from being diluted with the plasma gas.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92</figref>, an 18.5 turn boost device <b>7210</b> was used to extend the emission path length relative to the emission path length shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</figref>. The remaining components of the device were the same as those described above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</figref>. A power of about 300 Watts and radio frequencies of about 20 MHz were supplied to the boost device <b>7210</b>. The path length was extended along the entire length of the boost device <b>7210</b> to provide an emission signal <b>7220</b> from 200 ppm of sodium that was aspirated into the device. This result was consistent with extension of path length by using a boost device with additional coils. Air leaks were experienced with the early stage version of hardware depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 91</figref>, <b>92</b> and <b>93</b>. It was found that the silicone O-Ring that was used to seal the glass chamber with the copper interface failed due to the high temperature of the interface. This problem was fixed in later developed versions of the hardware by replacing the silicone O-Ring with metal compression fittings.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref>, the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92</figref> was used to test the effect of boost device power on emission signal intensity. A power of about 800 Watts and radio frequencies of about 20 MHz were supplied to the 18.5 turn boost device <b>7210</b>. An emission signal <b>7310</b>, from 200 ppm of sodium that was aspirated into the device, was more intense than emission signal <b>7220</b>. This result was consistent with an increase in emission intensity with increasing boost power.</p>

<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Boosted Flame Discharge</heading>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94</figref>, a flame source <b>7410</b> was positioned inside a microwave oven <b>7420</b> that was off. The flame source <b>7410</b> was a cylindrical paraffin candle having dimensions of about 1.5 inches diameter by about 2 inches high. The microwave oven <b>7420</b> was a standard Tappin (1000 Watt) microwave oven which was obtained from Scalzo-White Appliances (New Milford, Conn.). The microwave oven <b>7420</b> used an absorption cell as the oven cavity, and a microwave launcher and magnetron tube as an RF source. The flame source <b>7410</b> was lit and placed &#xbc; of the way into the microwave oven <b>7420</b>. The fan of the microwave oven was blocked by a cardboard sheet covering the vent entering the absorption cell area to prevent any plasma plume from being disturbed and to maintain the maximum amount of ions and electrons present in the flame region. The microwave was turned on high. As the flame source <b>7410</b> rotated on the on the turnstile, bright plasma <b>7510</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</figref>) would form as the candle passed through the standing voltage maxima. The flame source <b>7410</b> returned to a regular flame in the voltage nodes where the RF excitation was a minimum. This result was consistent with there being enough free ions and electrons generated in a flame to allow for further ionization from external radio frequencies supplied by the microwave oven. As discussed above, RF energy, including microwave energy, may be used as a source of boost energy to greatly increase the temperature of a flame discharge.</p>

<heading id="h-0020" level="1">Single RF Source</heading>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96A</figref>, a device <b>9600</b> was assembled using a single RF source <b>9610</b> to power a primary induction coil <b>9620</b> and a boost device <b>9630</b>. This example used the same manually controlled hardware setup as described above except that only the primary RF source was used, a continuous ignition arc source (Solid State Spark Tester BD-40B purchased from Electro-Technic Products (Chicago, Ill.)) was used in place of the standard ignition source, and the plastic faceplate was removed from the standard RF source (a single Optima 4000 generator). A boost device <b>9630</b> was made by wrapping 9 turns of &#x215b;&#x2033; refrigerator grade copper tubing around extended quartz torch <b>9640</b>. The extended quartz torch was the same torch as described above in the Example 1. The boost device of this example was terminated with un-insulated crimp ring lugs. Since this setup was used for a short term investigation, no cooling of the boost device was used. Due to the lack of cooling, the coil turned black from the heat very quickly. For short term use, this discoloration did not significantly affect the performance.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">In operation, the primary plasma formed in the boost region of the torch (high impedance region). By applying a continuous ignition arc, the plasma moved into the region of the primary two-turn induction coil <b>9620</b> (low impedance region). Once the plasma transitioned into the low impedance region of the two-turn coil, the continuous ignition arc was removed. After removal of the ignition arc, the plasma remained and operated stably in the two-turn load coil region, and power from the boost coil added additional excitation energy to the sample emission region of the plasma (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref> showing a close-up view of optical emission of 1000 ppm of Yttrium shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96C</figref>, a single RF source may also be used to power coils in a configuration implementing an interface. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96C</figref>, an RF source <b>9660</b> powers primary induction coil <b>9662</b> and boost device <b>9664</b>. Primary induction coil surrounds first chamber <b>9666</b>, whereas boost device <b>9664</b> surrounds secondary chamber <b>9668</b>. Interface <b>9670</b> is positioned at one end of secondary chamber <b>9668</b> and is configured to draw sample from primary chamber <b>9666</b> into secondary chamber <b>9668</b>. A vacuum pump <b>9672</b> may be used to control the pressure in the secondary chamber. The interface <b>9670</b> may also have a small aperture to help control the flow of sample and the pressure of the chamber. This configuration simplifies construction of atomization devices including boost devices and provides the advantages obtained using an interface.</p>

<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 98A-98C</figref>, a spectrometer configured with a boost device and configured for optical emission measurements in the low UV is shown. The device shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98B</figref> is configured to exclude substantially all air or oxygen from the optical path such that emission lines having wavelengths in the low UV may be detected. In existing ICP-OES configurations a shear gas nozzle extinguishes the end of the plasma. There is about a 0.5 inch space between the end of the plasma and the beginning of the transfer optics where air or oxygen may absorbs light, e.g., low UV light (see arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98A</figref>). The shear gas may be used to prevent melting of the transfer optics and to prevent damage to the aperture or the window located on the spectrometer.</p>
