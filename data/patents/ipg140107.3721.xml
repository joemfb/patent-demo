<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to an in-vivo sensing system and more specifically to a wearable antenna assembly that facilitates an improved wireless communication between a swallowed in-vivo device and an extra-body receiver or data recorder.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In-vivo measuring systems are known in the art. Some autonomous capsule like in-vivo devices, which traverse the gastrointestinal (GI) system, may include an imaging sensor, or imager, for imaging (e.g., capturing images or taking pictures of) the interior of the GI system. An in-vivo device may include one or more imagers and/or sensors of other types (e.g., pH sensor, pressure sensor, temperature sensor, etc.), and/or various types of tools (e.g., micro electro-mechanical system, or &#x201c;MEMS&#x201d;), for example to perform surgical operations in vivo and/or to administer medication in the GI system, for example from a container contained in an in-vivo device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While in operation (e.g., after swallowing), an in-vivo device may wirelessly exchange data with an external (extra-body) receiver. For example, the in-vivo device may wirelessly transmit data (e.g., sensory data; e.g., image data pertaining to captured images) to the external receiver, and the external receiver may wirelessly transmit instructions back to the in-vivo device, for example instructions which depend on data transmitted from the in-vivo device. For example, the in-vivo device may transmit image frames to the receiver, and the receiver may transmit an instruction to the in-vivo device, for example, to change the images' capturing rate, for example, based on captured images.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The length and anatomically-inhomogeneous nature of the GI system&#x2014;it is about five meters long and it has anatomically distinct sections such as the small intestine and the large intestine&#x2014;and the way in which the GI tract is situated within the body tends to detrimentally affect wireless communication between the in-vivo device and the external receiver when the in-vivo device reaches certain locations within the GI tract. This detrimental effect, in part, results from the relatively low transmission power that an autonomous, self-contained, in-vivo device uses, and also because body tissues (e.g., muscle tissues, tissues of the GI organs, bone tissue, etc.) interfere with the communication. A poor communication channel may result in noisy communication and even in loss of data (e.g., image data). For example, the in-vivo device may transmit an image but, in a poor communication environment, the receiver might not receive the image.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The communication problem described above is further exacerbated by the massive bone structure of the pelvis that supports the GI organs (e.g., the small intestine, the large intestine) and is even less pervious to radio waves than the soft body tissues. Heretofore, antennas setups/layouts have been designed to enable fairly good communication, between a swallowed in-vivo device and an external receiver, when the in-vivo device is in the upper section/part of the GI system, and, therefore, the effect of the pelvic bones on the quality of communication is relatively low, negligible, or non-existent. U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,531, filed Jan. 17, 1995, entitled &#x201c;IN VIVO VIDEO CAMERA SYSTEM&#x201d;, U.S. Pat. No. 7,618,366, filed Mar. 8, 2005, entitled &#x201c;ARRAY SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR LOCATING AN IN VIVO SIGNAL SOURCE&#x201d;, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,650,180, PCT application filed Jul. 4, 2004, entitled &#x201c;IMAGING SENSOR ARRAY AND DEVICE AND METHOD FOR USE THEREOF&#x201d; show typical conventional antenna setups. However, the detrimental effect of the pelvis bones on the communication's quality is by far noticeable when the in-vivo device is in the lower section/part of the GI system, where the pelvis bones have the strongest detrimental effect on the communication quality, and the conventional antenna setups used for the communication have been found to be far from optimal, or unsuitable, for sensing signals that originate from a signal source residing in the pelvis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the lower section of the GI tract in general, and the lower part of the colon in particular, is of special clinical interest because of its susceptibility to diseases, it would be beneficial to have an antenna setup that improves wireless communication between the in-vivo device and the external receiver while the in-vivo device traverses the lower section/part of the GI tract, and in every area of the GI tract.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional antenna arrays include antenna elements that are planar &#x2018;loop&#x2019; antennas. One problem with planar &#x2018;loop&#x2019; antennas is that these antennas are directional and they have a relatively sharp null, and, in general, such antennas have a radiation pattern that is similar to a radiation pattern of a dipole antenna. Being directional and having a sharp null, the communication between a swallowed in-vivo device and an antenna element is susceptible to the location of the in-vivo device within the GI system. If one antenna element receives a relatively weak signal, other antennas of the antenna array may receive a stronger signal but, still, there might be situations where all the antennas receive weak signals due to their unsuitable communication characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While moving an in-vivo device through the GI system is beneficial, there are some drawbacks associated with conventional antennas that are used to exchange data between the in-vivo device and an external receiver. It would be beneficial to have an extra-body antenna setup that enables receiving signals from the in-vivo device regardless of the location of the device in the GI system/tract.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It would, therefore, be beneficial to be able to provide wearable antenna assembly that would improve communication between a swallowed in-vivo device and an extra-body receiver.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A wearable antenna assembly is provided, which facilitates an improved communication with a swallowable in-vivo device. The wearable antenna assembly may include a posterior antenna assembly that may be accommodated by a posterior pouch, an anterior antenna assembly that may be accommodated by an anterior pouch, and a belt to which the pouches may be fastened.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The posterior antenna assembly may include a flat posterior antenna element that may include a flat, electrically insulating, posterior base. The posterior base may include a lateral portion having a lateral line, and at least a first protrusion that continues from the lateral portion and extends away from the lateral line.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A first antenna element may be formed (e.g., mounted on, laminated on or in, or built into, or by using a printed circuit board (&#x201c;PCB&#x201d;) technique) in the first protrusion, and the at least first protrusion may be configured, and the first antenna element may be formed therein (e.g., be being mounted on, laminated on or in, or built into, or by using a printed circuit board technique), such that, when the belt is worn by an individual, the first protrusion conveniently lies on, and generally adapted to the shape of the buttocks, such the first antenna element is situated adjacent to or in front of a first of the two greater sciatic notches of the pelvis. The posterior base may include a second protrusion, on which a second antenna element may be formed. The second protrusion may also continue the lateral portion and extend away from the lateral line in the same direction as the first protrusion. The posterior base, with only one protrusion that extends away from the lateral portion, may be &#x201c;r&#x201d;-shaped, and with the two protrusions extending away from the lateral portion it may be &#x201c;U&#x201d;-shaped. The second protrusion may be configured, and the second antenna element may be formed therein, such that, when the belt is worn by an individual, the second protrusion conveniently lies on, and generally adapted to the shape of the buttocks, such that the second antenna element is situated adjacent to or in front of the second/other greater sciatic notch of the pelvis.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each of the antenna elements formed in the posterior base may have an orientation that may be defined with respect to the lateral line, and the orientations of the antenna elements may be optimized to maximize signal reception.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The anterior antenna assembly may include a flat, electrically insulating, anterior lateral base having a lateral line, and n antenna elements that may be formed, for example side-by-side, in the anterior lateral base along the lateral line. Each of the n antenna elements may have an orientation according to an orientation setup, that may be defined with respect to the lateral line, and the orientations of the n antenna elements may be optimized to maximize signal reception. The anterior lateral base may be configured, and the n antenna elements may be formed therein, such that, when the belt is worn, the n antenna elements are situated adjacent to, or in front of, the abdomen and maximize signal reception therethrough.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The description that follows provides various details of exemplary embodiments. However, this description is not intended to limit the scope of the claims but instead to explain various principles of the invention and the manner of practicing it.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an adult male human, the GI tract is 5 meters long in a live subject, or up to 9 meters without the effect of muscle tone, and consists of the upper GI tract and the lower GI tract. The GI tract may also be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut. The upper GI tract generally includes the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. With respect to the GI system the exact demarcation between &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower&#x201d; can vary according to the used convention. The lower GI tract includes most of the small intestine and all of the large intestine.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When an in-vivo device traverses the GI system, it may move through the lower GI tract passively or controllably. The lower GI tract, which includes most of the small intestine and all of the large intestine, is the nearest GI part to the pelvis bones and, as explained above, some conventional antenna setups are unable to maintain a good and stable communication channel between the in-vivo device and the external receiver with which the in-vivo device operates when the in-vivo device reaches the lower GI tract. A new wearable antenna assembly that mitigates the communication problems discussed herein is shown in the drawings and described below. In general, the new wearable antenna assembly includes a posterior antenna assembly and an anterior antenna assembly, each of which includes new antenna elements that are arranged, per assembly, in a unique way. Regarding the posterior antenna assembly, its antenna elements may be positioned in a location that optimizes signal reception.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block/schematic diagram of an in-vivo imaging system according to an example embodiment. The in-vivo imaging system may include an in-vivo imaging device <b>110</b>, external (extra-body) receiver <b>120</b> that may function as a data recorder, workstation <b>130</b> (e.g., personal computer), and a display <b>132</b>. In-vivo imaging device <b>110</b> may be, for example a swallowable device, capturing images and transmitting corresponding image frames to an external receiving apparatus, such as receiver <b>120</b>. The image frames may be presented in real-time or after processing, be combined into an image stream or video movie for display to a user, for example by using display <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An in-vivo imaging device may have one or more imagers. By way of example, imaging device <b>110</b> include one imager; e.g., imager <b>112</b> (more than one or two imagers may be used). In-vivo imaging device <b>110</b> may also include a light/illumination source <b>114</b>, a data (e.g., image data or) frame generator <b>116</b>, a controller <b>118</b>, a storage unit <b>122</b>, a transceiver <b>124</b>, and a power source <b>126</b> for powering them. Controller <b>118</b>, among other things, may controllably operate illumination source <b>114</b> to illuminate areas traversed by in-vivo device <b>110</b>, and coordinates the images capturing timing of imager <b>112</b>. Controller <b>118</b> may temporarily store captured images and related image frames in storage unit <b>122</b>. Controller <b>118</b> may also perform various calculations and store calculation results in storage unit <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Frames generator <b>116</b> may receive image data <b>113</b> from imager <b>112</b> and use the image data to produce an image frame (&#x201c;frame&#x201d; for short) for the pertinent captured image. A frame typically includes a header field that contains information and/or metadata related to the frame itself (e.g., information identifying the frame, the serial number of the frame, the time the frame, the bit-wise length of the frame, etc.). A frame may also include an uncompressed version of the image data and/or a compressed version thereof, and a decimated image. The header may also include additional information, for example a readout of any additional sensor integrated into device <b>110</b>. Controller <b>118</b> may operate illumination source <b>114</b> to illuminate, for example, four times per second to enable capturing four images per second, and transceiver <b>124</b> to concurrently transmit corresponding frames at the same rate or at a different rate. Controller <b>118</b> may operate illumination source <b>114</b> to capture more images per second, for example seventeen images or more than seventeen images per second, and transceiver <b>124</b> to concurrently transmit corresponding frames at the same rate.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">After frames generator <b>116</b> produces a frame for a currently captured image, controller <b>118</b> wirelessly communicates <b>125</b> the frame to data recorder <b>120</b> by using transceiver <b>124</b>. Receiver <b>120</b> may be a stand alone receiver that is located close enough to the person swallowing the in-vivo device in order to facilitate receiving and processing of the transmitted frames by data recorder <b>120</b>. However, as explained above, the quality of the communication between the in-vivo device and the external receiver strongly depends on the location and orientation of the in-vivo device in the GI tract: in some locations of the in-vivo device the signal-to-noise ratio (&#x201c;SNR&#x201d;) may be much lower than in other locations, which may result in loss of images if the SNR gets too low.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Data recorder <b>120</b> may include a transceiver <b>144</b>, a frame parser <b>146</b>, and a processor <b>148</b> for managing transceiver <b>144</b> and frame parser <b>146</b>. Data recorder <b>120</b> may include additional components (e.g., USB interface, Secure Digital (&#x201c;SD&#x201d;) card driver/interface, controllers, etc.), elements or units, for example, for communicating with (e.g., transferring frames, data, etc. to) an external processing/displaying system that may be configured to process images captured by in-vivo device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment transceiver <b>144</b> receives a frame corresponding to a particular captured image, and frame parser <b>146</b> parses the frame to extract the various data entities contained therein (e.g., image data, decimated image associated with, or representing the particular captured image, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The in-vivo imaging system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may include a workstation <b>130</b>. Workstation <b>130</b> may include a display or be functionally connected to one or more external displays, for example to display <b>132</b>. Workstation <b>130</b> may receive image frames, and other types of data from data recorder <b>120</b>, and present them in real-time, for example as live video, or produce a video stream. Workstation <b>130</b> may include a memory, such as memory <b>134</b>, for storing the frames (and possibly data of other types) transferred from data recorder <b>120</b>, and a processor, such as processor <b>136</b>, for processing the stored data (e.g., image data). In-vivo imaging device <b>110</b> may also include an &#x201c;on/off&#x201d; switching system <b>128</b> for switching imaging device <b>110</b> on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Signals that are transmitted from in-vivo device <b>110</b> (e.g., by transceiver <b>124</b>) are received by antennas that are attached or laid in proximity to the body of the person swallowing the in-vivo device. The signals received by the antennas are forwarded to data recorder <b>120</b>, for analysis and interpretation, via a communication cable. (The antennas and the communication cable are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.)</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Components of the system and device according to embodiments of the present invention may be similar to components used in a capsule endoscopy system commercially available from the common assignee of the present invention, which capsule endoscopy system is commercially known as the PillCam&#xae; capsule.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> respectively depict the anterior view and the posterior view of a human skeleton, including the position of the GI system therein. The GI system may be roughly divided into two sections with respect to a bisection line <b>210</b> (&#x2018;pelvis line&#x2019;): a lower section that includes the GI organs below line <b>210</b>, and an upper section that includes the GI system organs above line <b>210</b>. The terms &#x201c;lower&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper&#x201d; in the present context are intended to suggest only the relative positions of the various GI organs with respect to an upright person. Pelvis <b>220</b> is shown between line <b>210</b> and line <b>230</b>. Pelvis <b>220</b> contains and supports the lower section of the GI system that typically includes part of the small intestine and the entire or most of the large intestine</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As explained above, conventional antenna layouts are not optimized to the structure of the pelvis. For example conventional antenna layouts disregard the bone structure of the pelvis and the signal attenuation caused by it when the in-vivo device reaches, or moves through, the lower part of the GI tract. For example, some conventional antennas, which receive signals from swallowed in-vivo devices, are placed just above the ilium crest, as shown at <b>240</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> (antenna belt <b>240</b> may include one or more antenna elements similar to antenna element <b>250</b>, which is shown in simplistic form). While antenna belt <b>240</b> (and other antenna layouts in which antenna elements are positioned above the ilium crest, may provide a relatively good reception coverage for signals that are transmitted from the upper GI system (the part of the GI system above bisection <b>210</b>), it may provide a non-stable to poor reception coverage for signals that are transmitted from some regions of the GI part below bisection line <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The GI area referred to by numeral reference <b>260</b> has been found to be one of the more problematic areas in terms of radio communication, due to the pelvis bones that communication-wise mask these areas. The aforesaid communication problem is mitigated by taking advantage of specific openings in the pelvis, which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C, which are described below, through which radio signals can relatively easily pass (&#x2018;easily&#x2019;: without being attenuated by a bony medium), and situating antenna elements in front of, or in proximity to, these openings, as demonstrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> depicts an example pelvis <b>300</b> with two openings <b>310</b>. Each of openings <b>310</b> generally has a shape of a notch that is known in the field of osteology as a &#x201c;greater sciatic notch&#x201d;. Different perspectives of the greater sciatic notches are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, at <b>310</b>. Each greater sciatic notch is formed by the ilium bone (a bone that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> at <b>320</b>) and the ischium bone (a bone that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> at <b>330</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The signal transmitted by the in-vivo device is generally isotropic. Therefore, when an in-vivo device reaches the lower section of the GI system, at least a portion of the radio signal that the in-vivo device transmits passes through greater sciatic notches <b>310</b>, for which reason this signal portion is significantly less attenuated comparing to other signal portions that pass through the pelvis bones. Signals that pass through the greater sciatic notches are still attenuated by soft tissues, but this kind of attenuation is tolerable as it still results in significantly better signal reception compared to conventional positioning of antennas. That is, antennas situated near, or in front of, greater sciatic notches <b>310</b> receive significantly stronger signals from the lower part of the GI system comparing to antennas that are situated traditionally, for example in the way shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref> (e.g., antenna belt <b>240</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a lateral view of a skeleton <b>400</b> and an example wearable antenna assembly <b>410</b> positioned thereon according to an example embodiment. Antenna layout <b>410</b> may include an anterior/frontal antenna <b>420</b> and a posterior antenna <b>430</b>. By &#x201c;anterior antenna&#x201d; is meant an antenna that is (to be) situated at, or adjacent to, the abdomen. By &#x201c;posterior antenna&#x201d; is meant an antenna that is (to be) situated at, or adjacent to, the back.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to the present invention the anterior antenna and the posterior antenna may each include one or more antenna elements. An example anterior antenna is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and an example posterior antenna in shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are described below.) Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, posterior antenna <b>430</b> is situated on the buttocks, adjacent to, or in proximity to, the greater sciatic notches (a greater sciatic notche is pointed at by an arrow <b>440</b>) in order to optimize reception of signals that are transmitted from an in-vivo device (e.g., from in-vivo device <b>110</b>) that is located in the lower part of the GI tract. Optimal reception from the lower part of the GI tract is obtained because the signal, which the in-vivo device transmits, passes through the greater sciatic notches with significantly reduced attenuation.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the in-vivo device transmits a signal while it is in the upper part of the GI system (e.g., above line <b>210</b>), the signal picked up by posterior antenna <b>430</b> is relatively weak, or non-existent, due to the adverse effect of the pelvic bones. However, anterior antenna <b>420</b> typically receives a much stronger signal because, unlike the lower part of the GI tract, the abdomen does not include bones, nor it is protected or shielded by bones that, as explained above, attenuate radio signals. When the in-vivo device transmits a signal while it is in the lower part of the GI system (e.g., below line <b>210</b>), the signal picked up by anterior antenna <b>420</b> may be weak, or non-existent, but posterior antenna <b>430</b> may receive a much stronger signal because it is located in proximity to the greater sciatic notches. Using an antenna layout that includes an anterior antenna (e.g., anterior antenna <b>420</b>) and a posterior antenna (e.g., posterior antenna <b>430</b>) that is adapted to optimize reception of signals that pass through the greater sciatic notches, ensures that a stronger signal is obtained from the in-vivo device regardless of whether the in-vivo device is in the upper part of the GI system, or in the lower part thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows wearable antenna assembly <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> positioned on a human body. With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, like reference numerals designate, or refer to, like elements/objects. Posterior antenna assembly <b>430</b> may be positioned on the upper portion of buttocks <b>450</b>, as demonstrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, in order to minimize inconveniency to the person who wears it. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> schematically illustrates the position of posterior antenna setup <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> relative to the posterior view of the pelvis according to an example embodiment. In order to improve radio communication when the in-vivo device is inside the pelvis, posterior antenna <b>430</b>/<b>1</b> is positioned on the buttocks adjacent to, or in proximity to, greater sciatic notch <b>440</b>/<b>1</b>, and posterior antenna <b>430</b>/<b>2</b> is positioned on the buttocks adjacent to, or in proximity to, greater sciatic notch <b>440</b>/<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Traditionally, antenna elements are adhered to various points on patients (e.g., on the abdomen, on the rib cage, etc.), the reason being that, having to be carried by/on patients, the antenna elements have to be small and light, and, as such, they have to be as close to the body as possible in order to be able to receive signals with an acceptable strength. An array of antennas with individual antenna elements separately adhered to the patient body may also be easily adjusted to the dimensions of each individual patient. In another configuration, the traditional antenna elements are incorporated into a wearable belt or vest, which incorporation may result in inferior signal reception due to distancing of the antenna elements from the patient body. In accordance with the present invention, the geometry of the antenna elements and the wearable antenna assembly overcome some of the drawbacks of some conventional antenna setups. A widely used conventional antenna geometry is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, which are described below, and an example antenna element geometry according to an example embodiment is shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> show a traditional antenna <b>500</b>, which is known in the field of antennas as a &#x201c;halo antenna&#x201d;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, antenna <b>500</b> is a horizontally polarized, omni-directional &#xbd; wavelength dipole antenna. It is shaped like a loop with a small break, or discontinuity, <b>510</b> on the side of the loop directly opposite the feed point <b>520</b>, so that the dipole ends do not meet. The antenna is usually one continuous conductor <b>530</b>. Being horizontally polarized, halo antennas have very little vertical polarization components, and, in general, they perform poorly for vertically polarized signals.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Due to their electrical characteristics (e.g., polarization), antenna <b>500</b> (and like antennas) has to touch the body's skin, or at least has to be not more than a few millimeters away from the body's skin, in order to be able to receive signals with acceptable strength. The reason for this requirement is that the combination of the body's electrical characteristics and a loop antenna, when they are in close proximity, form an electrical circuit that enables the antenna to resonate in response to radio frequency (&#x201c;RF&#x201d;) signals, which may have, for example, a 30-MHz bandwidth centered, for example, at 434 MHz. The stronger the resonance, the stronger the antenna's signal (the better the reception). Distancing the antenna away from the body (e.g., more than 2-3 millimeters away) significantly detracts from this capability, up to a point where the signal to noise ratio (&#x201c;SNR&#x201d;) at the receiver gets so low that communication may be disconnected. Antenna element <b>500</b> typically has a gain of 1 decibel relative to an isotropic antenna and an impedance of 70-80 ohms when the distance between the antenna element and the body is less than 3-4 millimeters. When antenna element <b>500</b> is distanced farther away from the body (e.g., more than 3-4 millimeters), its performance is significantly degraded. Cable <b>540</b> connects antenna <b>500</b> to a receiver, for example to a data recorder such as data recorder <b>120</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, antenna <b>500</b> is shown embedded in a pocket <b>550</b> that is attachable to the skin, for example by glue. As explained above, attaching pockets such as pocket <b>550</b>, or the antennas themselves, to the skin causes discomfort to the person wearing the antennas.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an antenna element <b>600</b> according to an example embodiment. Antenna element <b>600</b> includes a ground plane <b>610</b> and a conducting strip <b>620</b>. Each of ground plane <b>610</b> and conducting strip <b>620</b> has a truncation: ground plane <b>610</b> has a truncation <b>612</b>, and conducting strip <b>620</b> has a truncation <b>622</b>. Truncation <b>612</b> is generally situated opposite truncation <b>622</b> (truncations <b>612</b> and <b>622</b> are located at opposite sides/vertices of antenna element <b>600</b>). In some embodiments, only one element (e.g., the ground plane or the conducting strip) may have a truncation. In other embodiments neither the ground plane nor the conducting strip has a truncation. Ground plane <b>610</b> and conducting strip <b>620</b> are isolated from one another, in terms of direct current (&#x201c;DC&#x201d;), by capacitor <b>630</b>, which is used also for RF tuning. That is, capacitor <b>630</b> and the inductance, L, of the antenna make up an electrical circuit that resonates in response to radio signals. Output terminal <b>632</b> outputs the radio signal received at the antenna element, in order for it to be provided to a radio receiver for deciphering/interpretation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Ground plane <b>610</b> and conducting strip <b>620</b> are formed on a common flat substrate, side-by-side, for example by using PCB techniques. Ground plane <b>610</b> may have a segment (the segment is shown at <b>616</b>) that is parallel to, and partly overlaps, a segment of conducting strip <b>620</b> (the segment of conducting strip <b>620</b> is shown at <b>626</b>). Segment <b>626</b> may be connected to truncation <b>622</b> of conducting strip <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Antenna element <b>600</b> is a type of a folded dipole antenna. In a &#x2018;typical&#x2019; folded dipole antenna the tips of the antenna are &#x2018;folded back&#x2019; until the two tips almost meet at the feed point, such that the antenna comprises an entire wavelength. A folded dipole antenna, therefore, has a greater bandwidth than a standard half-wave dipole. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, antenna <b>600</b> has two tips, or ends (the tips, or ends, are shown at <b>614</b> and <b>624</b>). Since tip/end <b>624</b> is folded back while tip/end <b>614</b> extends out from ground plane <b>610</b>, antenna <b>600</b> may be thought of as being an &#x201c;asymmetric folded dipole antenna&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Antenna element <b>600</b> is generally rectangularly shaped (it may be circumscribed by a rectangle <b>640</b>). Antenna <b>600</b> has an orientation that may be defined, or expressed, for example, by an orientation line <b>650</b>. As shown, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a wearable antenna assembly may include a plurality of antenna elements that may be identical or similar to antenna element <b>600</b>, and each antenna element may have a different orientation than the adjacent antenna elements. Orientation line <b>650</b> is shown slightly off-centered for clarity. The length, L, of rectangular antenna <b>600</b> may be 100 millimeters or about 100 millimeters (e.g., L=100&#xb1;15 millimeters). The width, W, of rectangular antenna <b>600</b> may be 80 millimeters or about 80 millimeters (e.g., W=80&#xb1;10 millimeters). Antenna <b>600</b> may have other lengths and/or widths.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Due to its design, antennas identical or similar to antenna <b>600</b> do not have to be as closed to the skin as antenna <b>500</b>; they can be distanced away from the skin (e.g., up to 30 centimeters), and yet they facilitate better radio communication (in comparison to antenna <b>500</b> or similar antennas) in the RF range mentioned above (e.g., a 30-MHz bandwidth centered, for example, at 434 MHz).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">An antenna element such as antenna element <b>600</b> typically has a gain of 2 decibels relative to an isotropic antenna and an impedance of 70-80 ohms for an extended range relative to antenna element <b>500</b>.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows a posterior antenna element <b>700</b> for receiving radio signals that originate from a swallowed in-vivo device and pass through the two greater sciatic notches of the pelvis. Posterior antenna element <b>700</b> may include a posterior flat antenna base <b>710</b>, or posterior base <b>710</b> for short. Posterior antenna element <b>700</b> may be one of two or more antenna assemblies that may be attached to a belt to make up a wearable antenna assembly. Another antenna assembly, which is referred to herein as the &#x201c;anterior antenna assembly&#x201d;, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Posterior base <b>710</b> may generally be an oblong shaped object, having a length L<b>1</b> and width W<b>1</b>. Posterior base <b>710</b> may include a lateral portion <b>720</b> having a lateral line <b>730</b>, and at least a first protrusion <b>740</b> that may continue from (it may be an extension of) lateral portion <b>720</b> and extends away from lateral line <b>730</b>, typically perpendicularly with respect to lateral line <b>730</b>. The term &#x201c;typically perpendicularly with respect to lateral line <b>730</b>&#x201d; means at a right angle or substantially at a right angle (e.g., 90&#xb0;&#xb1;30&#xb0;) with respect to lateral line <b>730</b>. For example, first protrusion <b>740</b> may extend away at 60 degrees, or at 80 degrees, etc., from lateral line <b>730</b>. A first antenna element (the first antenna element is shown at <b>742</b>) may be mounted on, incorporated or embedded in, or built into first protrusion <b>740</b>. Antenna element <b>742</b> may be identical or similar to antenna element <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For example, antenna element <b>742</b> may include a conducting strip <b>744</b> that may be identical or similar to conducting strip <b>620</b> of antenna element <b>600</b>, and a ground plane <b>746</b> that may be identical or similar to ground plane <b>610</b> of antenna element <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Posterior base <b>710</b> may also include a second protrusion <b>750</b> that may also continue from (e.g., it may also be an extension of) lateral portion <b>720</b>, and may also extend away from lateral line <b>730</b>, typically perpendicularly with respect to lateral line <b>730</b>. First protrusion <b>740</b> and second protrusion <b>750</b> of posterior base <b>710</b> may be symmetrical with respect to symmetry line <b>770</b>, but they need not be symmetrical. Symmetry line <b>770</b> may be perpendicular to lateral line <b>730</b>, but it need not be perpendicular lateral line <b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A second antenna element (the second antenna element is shown at <b>752</b>) may be mounted on, incorporated or embedded in, or built into second protrusion <b>750</b>. Each of antenna elements <b>742</b> and <b>752</b> may be identical or similar to antenna element <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For example, antenna element <b>752</b> may include a conducting strip <b>754</b> that may be identical or similar to conducting strip <b>620</b> of antenna element <b>600</b>, and a ground plane <b>756</b> that may be identical or similar to ground plane <b>610</b> of antenna element <b>600</b>. The ground plane of each antenna element (e.g., ground plane <b>746</b>, or ground plane <b>756</b>, or both ground planes) may be situated in-between lateral portion <b>720</b> and the pertinent conducting strip.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">First protrusion <b>740</b>, or second protrusion <b>750</b>, or both protrusions <b>740</b> and <b>750</b> may be configured (e.g., sized, shaped, produced from materials, etc.) such that, when the belt is worn on the person's waist, posterior antennas element <b>700</b> is fitted to its wearer's buttocks such that one antenna element is tightly positioned adjacent to one of the two greater sciatic notches of the pelvis and, if there is also a second antenna element (e.g., on another protrusion of posterior base <b>710</b>), the second antenna element is tightly positioned adjacent to the other greater sciatic notch. By way of example, the overall length, L<b>1</b>, of posterior base <b>700</b> may be 253 millimeters or approximately 253 millimeters, and the overall width, W<b>1</b>, of posterior base <b>710</b> may be 105 millimeters or approximately 105 millimeters. The thickness of posterior base <b>710</b> may be 13 millimeters, or approximately 13 millimeters. Posterior base <b>710</b> may have a gap <b>760</b> to make posterior base <b>710</b>, as a whole, more flexible in multiple direction. For example, gap <b>760</b> enables protrusions <b>740</b> and <b>750</b> to be twisted or flexed to opposite directions with respect to lateral line <b>730</b>, for example it enables one protrusion (e.g., protrusion <b>740</b>) to be twisted or flexed towards the viewer and the other protrusion (e.g., protrusion <b>750</b>) away from the viewer. Gap <b>760</b> may enable protrusions <b>740</b> and <b>750</b> to be twisted or flexed also with respect to symmetry line <b>770</b>. By imparting to posterior base <b>710</b> more flexibility, gap <b>760</b> enables posterior base <b>710</b> to be better fitted to its wearer. Typically, gap <b>760</b> is aligned or coincides with symmetrical line <b>770</b>, but it need not.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Similar to antenna element <b>600</b>, each of antenna elements <b>742</b> and <b>752</b> has a longitudinal axis that is associated with it and defines its orientation, for example, relative to lateral line <b>730</b>. An &#x201c;orientation&#x201d; of an antenna element may be expressed as the direction of its longitudinal axis, or as an angle, &#x3b1;, between its longitudinal axis and lateral line <b>730</b>. For example, antenna element <b>742</b> has a longitudinal axis <b>748</b> that defines the orientation of antenna element <b>742</b> relative to lateral line <b>730</b>, and antenna element <b>752</b> has a longitudinal axis <b>758</b> that defines the orientation of antenna element <b>752</b> relative to lateral line <b>730</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, antenna element <b>742</b> (a &#x201c;first antenna&#x201d; of posterior base <b>710</b>) has an orientation (a &#x201c;first orientation&#x201d;) that differs from the orientation (a &#x201c;second orientation&#x201d;) of antenna element <b>752</b> (a &#x201c;second antenna&#x201d; of posterior base <b>710</b>): the orientation of antenna element <b>742</b> is at an acute angle, &#x3b1;, with respect to lateral line <b>730</b>, as shown at <b>731</b>, and the orientation of antenna element <b>752</b> is parallel to lateral line <b>730</b> (i.e., &#x3b1;=0 degrees). In general, the first orientation may be defined to be &#x3b1;<b>1</b> (e.g., the angle between antenna element <b>742</b> and lateral line <b>730</b>, where 0&#x2266;&#x3b1;<b>1</b>&#x2266;90 degrees), and the second orientation may be defined to be &#x3b1;<b>2</b> (e.g., the angle between antenna element <b>752</b> and lateral line <b>730</b>, where 0&#x2266;&#x3b1;<b>2</b>&#x2266;90 degrees), where &#x3b1;<b>1</b>&#x2260;&#x3b1;<b>2</b> in order to ensure good reception of radio signals that are transmitted from a swallowed in-vivo device no matter the location of the device in the lower part of the GI tract, or its orientation. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, &#x3b1;<b>1</b>&#x2245;45 degrees, and &#x3b1;<b>2</b>=0 degrees. In another example, &#x3b1;<b>1</b> may be 80 degrees and &#x3b1;<b>2</b> may be 20 degrees. In another example, &#x3b1;<b>1</b> may be equal to 0 degrees and &#x3b1;<b>2</b> may be equal to 45 degrees plus/minus 10 degrees. Orientations &#x3b1;<b>1</b> and &#x3b1;<b>2</b> may be adjusted, for example as per the person wearing the posterior antenna element <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Posterior base <b>710</b> may include a flat, flexible and electrically insulating material, such as Kapton. (Kapton is a polyimide film developed by &#x201c;DuPont&#x201d;.

Additionally or alternatively, posterior base <b>710</b> may include a flat dielectric substrate of another type. Posterior base <b>710</b> may be consisted of one flexible layer, or it may be multilayered, having multiple flexible layers. Posterior base <b>710</b> may be flexible with respect to any of lateral line <b>730</b> and symmetry line <b>770</b>, or with respect to both lateral line <b>730</b> and symmetry line <b>770</b>. Posterior base <b>710</b> may be flexible with respect to all directions; i.e., it may be isotropically flexible, to enable a better fit of the posterior antenna element <b>700</b>, as a whole, to the buttocks of its wearer. The flexibility of posterior base <b>710</b> may be direction dependent. Posterior base <b>710</b> may be consisted of or include any material, or any combination of materials, that facilitates the required flexibility characteristics.</p>

Therefore, these areas of the posterior base may be stiffened in order to enable them to withstand folding induced stresses and other types of mechanical stresses. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, posterior base <b>710</b> may include rigid stiffeners <b>782</b> and <b>784</b> for the capacitor and the output terminal of antenna element <b>742</b>, respectively, and rigid stiffeners <b>786</b> and <b>788</b> for the capacitor and the output terminal of antenna element <b>752</b>, respectively.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Anterior lateral base <b>802</b> may be produced from an isotropically flexible, electrically insulating, material such as Kapton, onto which posterior antenna element <b>700</b> is mounted (e.g., laminated), or it be produced from a non-isotropically flexible material that may be based on, or include, for example, Kapton or similar material.</p>

The output signal of each antenna element <b>810</b> through <b>840</b> (the radio signal received at each antenna) may be provided, via the pertinent antenna's output terminal, to electrical conductors (e.g., signal traces or electrical wires). The electrical conductors providing the antenna signals may be transferred from anterior lateral base <b>802</b> to a receiver, or to a data recorder, via a signal cable that is schematically shown at <b>850</b>.</p>

In order to ensure good and stable radio communication between an in-vivo device and an extra-body receiver while the device is in the upper part of the GI system, the orientations of the antenna elements of anterior antenna assembly <b>800</b> make up an orientation setup in which each two adjacent antenna elements have different orientations. each of the n antenna elements may have an orientation according to or as per an orientation setup. An example orientation setup is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in which antenna element <b>810</b> has an orientation <b>812</b>, or &#x3b2;<b>1</b>, relative to lateral line <b>804</b>, that is approximately 45 degrees, and the orientation of antenna element <b>820</b> (sown as orientation <b>822</b>), relative to lateral line <b>804</b>, is 90 degrees; thus adjacent antenna elements <b>810</b> and <b>820</b> have different orientations. Likewise, the orientation of antenna element <b>820</b>, relative to lateral line <b>804</b>, is 90 degrees, and the orientation of antenna element <b>830</b> (sown as orientation <b>804</b>), relative to lateral line <b>804</b>, is zero degrees; thus adjacent antenna elements <b>820</b> and <b>830</b> have different orientations.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In another example orientation setup, the orientation of the n antenna elements is increased by a fixed increment, or delta, &#x394;, from one antenna element to another.

In another example orientation setup, two orientations are used, and the orientation of the n antenna elements alternates across the antenna elements; that is, the orientation of the antenna elements may alternate from one antenna element to another. For example, in a series of n consecutive antenna elements designated as A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b>, A<b>5</b>, . . . , An, the orientation of the antenna elements may alternate between a first orientation, &#x3b3;<b>1</b>, and a second orientation, &#x3b3;<b>2</b>; that is, every odd antenna element (e.g., antenna elements A<b>1</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>5</b>, . . . , An<b>2</b>&#x2212;1) may have orientation &#x3b3;<b>1</b> (or orientation &#x3b3;<b>2</b>), and every even antenna element (e.g., antenna elements A<b>2</b>, A<b>4</b>, A<b>6</b>, . . . , An<b>2</b>) may have orientation &#x3b3;<b>2</b> (or orientation &#x3b3;<b>1</b>).
