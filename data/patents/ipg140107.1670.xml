<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 61,357,518 title &#x201c;Baseball bat swing aid&#x201d; filed on Jun. 4, 2010, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention entails a precise baseball bat swinging aid with inertia-based swing indicator built into a baseball bat and molded grip optimizer, which will teach correct swinging technique of a baseball bat for athletes and recreational sports players. The invention generally relates to instructional devices for teaching and improving a correct bat swing through use of said specifically-molded grip and attachable or built-in inertia-based swing aid.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The sport of baseball is much more complex than the simple swinging of a stick to hit a ball. In fact, the bat, itself, is a complex invention. The bat is carefully carved and constructed to allow for a quick and balanced swing with power. The barrel of the bat is meant to hit the ball, and contains a sweet spot of optimum hitting performance of a ball. The barrel narrows into a handle and ends with a knob, which keeps the bat from sliding out of the batter's hands. The bat handle is very thin so that batters can comfortably set their fingers in a grip. On metal bats, there is often rubber or cloth wrapping around the handle to optimize the gripping surface. However, the actual practice of gripping the bat handle is not intuitive and is not well-known or taught. The baseball bat has evolved through many physical form evolutions to become somewhat standardized in form today.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The baseball swing is known to be one of the most difficult tasks in sports. In order to successfully hit a baseball, a person must match his bat swing as closely as possible and for as long as possible with the path of the baseball thrown by the pitcher. The hitter must simultaneously consider several technical strategies, such as how level the swing is in relation to different planes, the angle of the elbows, and grip technique. The key to successful baseball hitting is to have a good swing that is repeatable and adjustable to the angle of the pitched ball. Since the pitcher is standing above the hitter on the mound, he is throwing the ball from his shoulder and the ball will travel in a downward flight to the strike zone. Therefore, the optimal swing plane for the bat will be a slight upswing to match the downward angle of the ball flying towards the strike zone. Once a hitter has mastered a good swing with solid fundamental technique, he is prepared to effectively recognize a good pitch and properly meet it with a correct bat swing to excel in the sport. However, such technical mastery proves highly difficult without an effective practice aid. Most problematic for novices and even advanced batters are correct grip of the bat and correct swing technique and motion progression. The present invention seeks to solve these problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Objectives of the present invention include production of a simple and precise teaching tool for teaching and correcting a player's baseball swing. This baseball teaching aid will prevent the generally mistaken batting action of casting out to hit the ball and instead facilitate a proper swing action of having the batter first pulling the left hand elbow (for the right hand batter that is) \and then pushes out by both hands to have the bat hit the ball and thereafter rotate wrist to create correct timing of rotating wrists to follow through the swing. Another objective of the present invention is to utilize an inertia-based swing indicator to provide feedback about the proper swing path, body movement progression, and alignment of the baseball bat during a swing in order to maximize the effectiveness of the baseball bat swing. Furthermore, an objective of the present invention is to teach and correct a batter's grip and for optimal swinging power, timing, and technical mastery.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention contemplates a baseball bat swinging aid including a baseball bat with a grip positioning handle. When the batter grips the baseball bat, the batter's hands are properly aligned with each other so that the batter can manipulate the baseball bat properly when attempting to hit the baseball. In the proper position, the knuckles are lined up. During a proper bat swing, the batter's bat is generally horizontal with the playing field. During the proper bat swing, the batter's left arm initiates the left turn of the batter's upper torso. The batter's wrists do not rotate until after the baseball bat contacts the baseball. Prior to contact, the batter's right arm pushes forward so that the power of the batter is pushed forward into the ball. In all incorrect bat swing, the user swings the baseball bat by casting out by hitting the ball by extending both hands. The concept is to accelerate the bat as fast as possible to transfer maximum power to the baseball. Unfortunately, this sends the power of the batter sideways, not forward. Also, the incorrect and correct bat swings produce different inertia, profiles along the swing path. The baseball bat may be retrofitted with a swing indicator, which takes advantage of different inertia profiles between the correct and incorrect bat swings. The swing indicator has a bead that travels within one of two grooves, namely, the upper and lower groove. Initially, the bead resides within the single upper groove on the left hand side of the swing indicator. When the batter properly swings the bat by first pull by the left elbow then by pushing out, contacting the ball, then rotating the wrist, the bead will enter the tower groove of the swing indicator. However, when the batter incorrectly swings by casting out without pulling the elbow and rotates the wrists while contacting the ball, then the bead will enter the upper groove due to the casting action, indicating an incorrect swing. The bead moves within the upper and lower groove based on the inertia profile created by the batter's swing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Both the grip positioner and the swing indicator work in conjunction with each other. The reason is that the grip positioner enables the batter to be able to execute a proper bat swing. The swing indicator indicates whether the batter has accomplished the proper bat swing. The grip positioner may be built into a baseball bat or may be produced as an independent unit to be attached later via attachment means, such as velcro, button strap, form-fitting slip-on, or chemical bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The bat swing aid indicator unit may be built into a baseball bat or produced independently to be attached later via attachment means, such as velcro, button strap, form-fitting slip-on, or chemical bonding. Furthermore, the grip positioner and bat swing indicator may be produced together and packaged as a unit, or may be pre-assembled into a baseball bat and packaged as a unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> refers to the body of the current invention, wherein element <b>1</b> refers to the specifically grooved training grip, element <b>2</b> refers to the upper shaft of the bat, and element <b>3</b> refers to the swing indicator apparatus;</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which depicts actual use of the bat training aid, element <b>1</b> refers to the specifically-grooved training grip, element refers to the upper shaft of the bat, element <b>3</b> refers to the swing indicator apparatus as a whole, element <b>4</b> refers to the bead which travels along the upper or lower groove in the swing indicator apparatus depending on the batter's swing inertia profile, element <b>5</b> refers to the upper groove, and element <b>6</b> refers to the lower groove;</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, which is an illustration of the grip positioner device in active use, the batter's hands upon the specifically-molded grooves of the grip positioner show that the batter's middle knuckles are properly aligned along a vertical axis for proper bat gripping. Element <b>7</b> refers to the aligned middle knuckles of the two gripping hands due to placement along the preset grooves of the element <b>1</b> grip positioner. Element <b>2</b> refers to the hitting portion of the baseball bat shaft;</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, which is an illustration of the bottom half of a baseball bat attached with a grip positioner, we find deep set molded grooves in the grip positioner in element <b>1</b> which is separate from the hitting portion of the baseball bat shaft in element <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, which is an illustration of a baseball player swinging a baseball bat with attached grip positioner and baseball bat swinging aid, we find that a correct swing by the batter, whereby the batter first pull by the left elbow then by pushing and casting out the bat to contact the pitched ball, will move the bead (element <b>4</b>) along the groove in the swinging aid (element <b>3</b>) by inertia drive. Specially, it is the first action of pulling that move the bead to the lower groove.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, which is a continuation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> wherein the baseball player has correctly pushed the bat forward after first pulling the bat to contact the ball and then rotates the wrists, the bead (element <b>4</b>) moves along the grooves of the swing aid (element <b>3</b>) into the lower groove (element <b>6</b>), where it rests and visually indicates that the batter has performed a technically correct bat swing.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which is a horizontal layout of a baseball bat with built-in grip positioner and swing aid, we find the grip positioner with specifically-molded grooves for proper batting grip (element <b>1</b>), connected to the hitting portion of the bat shaft (element <b>2</b>), and a built-in swing aid (element <b>3</b>) with inertia-propelled bead (element <b>4</b>) which travels along either the upper groove (element <b>5</b>) or the lower groove (element <b>6</b>) depending on the correctness of the bat swing. A correct swing, which entails first pull by the left elbow then by pushing out to contact and strike the baseball, then rotating the wrists afterwards, will result in a proper bat swing, the inertial drive of which first pulling the bat and then cast out will propel the bead (element <b>4</b>) into the lower groove (element <b>6</b>) of the bat swing aid (element <b>3</b>). An incorrect bat swing, whereby the batter cast out without first pulling the elbow prior will create an inertia profile which propels the bead (element <b>4</b>) across the upper groove (element <b>5</b>) where it will stay to visually indicate improper batting technique.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which is an independent attachable bat swing aid (element <b>3</b>), we find the inertia-propelled bead (element <b>4</b>) which travels along and ends in either the upper groove (element <b>5</b>) which indicates an improper bat swing or the lower groove (element <b>6</b>) which indicates a correct bat swing. Element <b>8</b> refers to means of attaching and securing the detachable or attachable bat swing aid (element <b>3</b>) to any size baseball bat or other hitting stick for the same purpose. Means for securing the bat swing aid in element <b>8</b> may comprise and is not limited to velcro attachment, button clasp, string-tie means, magnetic clasp, chemical bonding, heat bonding, externally-applied tape means, and form-fitting bat model-specific slip-on means.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, which is an independent attachable grip positioner (element <b>1</b>), we find specifically-molded finger grooves for properly positioning the gripping hands such that the middle knuckles align vertically along a single axis in a proper baseball bat grip. Element <b>9</b> refers to attachment means for securing the grip positioner to any sized baseball bat shaft, which comprise and are not limited to velcro attachment, button clasp, string-tie means, magnetic clasp, chemical bonding, heat bonding, externally-applied tape means, and form-fitting bat model-specific slip-on means;</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which is one embodiment of a bat swing aid indicator with aural indication of correct technique, we find the inertia-propelled bead (element <b>4</b>) traveling along the upper groove (element <b>5</b>) and contacting upper groove contact sensor (element <b>10</b>), which sends an electronic signal to attached speaker or other aural indicator (element <b>12</b>) and produces an aural indication (element <b>13</b>) through audio tone or other tone to indicate that the bat swing technique was incorrect, based on the inertia profile of the swing. Element <b>6</b> refers to the lower groove of the bat swing indicator, and leads to the lower groove contact sensor (element <b>11</b>), which would send an electronic signal to attached speaker element <b>12</b>) to produce an aural indication (element <b>13</b>) that the bat swing was technically correct.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Finally, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, which is another embodiment of a bat swing aid indicator with visual indication of correct technique, we find the inertia-propelled bead (element <b>4</b>) traveling along the lower groove (element <b>6</b>) and contacting the lower groove contact sensor (element <b>11</b>), which sends an electronic signal to visual indicator unit (element <b>14</b>) and displays a visual cue at the lower groove light emitting diode, or other visual indicator element <b>16</b>) to indicate that a correct bat swing was made. Element <b>10</b> is a contact sensor for the upper groove (element <b>5</b>), which upon contact by the bead (element <b>4</b>) will send an electronic signal to visual indicator unit (element <b>14</b>) and display a visual cue at the upper groove indicator light emitting diode or other visual indicator (element <b>15</b>) to indicate that an incorrect bat swing was made.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Finally, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> which is an unpowered embodiment of the bat swing aid, we find that the bead (element <b>4</b>) propelled by the inertia profile of an incorrect bat swing travels through the upper groove (element <b>5</b>) and contacts the spring-actuated contact sensor (element <b>10</b>). Thereafter, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the force of the bead (element <b>4</b>) contacting the spring-actuated contact sensor (element <b>10</b>) causes a spring and lever mechanism (element <b>18</b>) to force the trap door (element <b>17</b>) upwards, thus trapping the bead within the end of the groove into which it traveled.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> which is a continuation of the action sequence of the unpowered embodiment of the bat swing aid, user actuation of the spring-operated release button (element <b>19</b>) located at the end of the upper and lower groove will retract the trap door (element <b>17</b>), reset the spring-actuated contact sensor (element <b>10</b>), and reject the bead (element <b>4</b>) from the groove via positive force of the resetting spring-actuated contact sensor. Thus, the bat swing aid is ready to monitor another bat swing by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, which is another embodiment of the swing aid as disclosed in the present invention, a horizontal layout of a baseball bat with built-in grip positioner and swing aid, we find the grip positioner with specifically-molded grooves for proper batting grip (element <b>1</b>), connected to the hitting portion of the bat shaft (element <b>2</b>), and a built-in swing aid (element <b>3</b>) with inertia-propelled bead (element <b>4</b>) which travels along the main tube (element <b>20</b>) and ending up either in the upper tube (element <b>21</b>) or the lower tube (element <b>22</b>) depending on the correctness of the bat swing. A correct swing, which entails first pull by the left elbow then by pushing out to contact and strike the baseball, then rotating the wrists afterwards, will result in a proper bat swing, the inertial drive of which first pulling the bat and then cast out will propel the bead (element <b>4</b>) along the main tube (element <b>20</b>) and into the lower tube (element <b>22</b>) of the bat swing aid (element <b>3</b>). An incorrect bat swing, whereby the batter cast out without first pulling the elbow prior will create an inertia profile which propels the bead (element <b>4</b>) across along the main tube (element <b>20</b>) and into the upper tube (element <b>21</b>) where it will stay to visually indicate improper batting technique. Specifically, there will be an opening at where the main tube (element <b>20</b>) joins the upper tube (element <b>21</b>) and the lower tube (element <b>22</b>) which would allow the bead (element <b>4</b>) to travel freely to and from the tubes.</p>
