<p id="p-0005" num="0016">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (PRIOR ART), there is a diagram of an exemplary traditional LTE wireless telecommunications network <b>100</b> configured to provide a MBMS service to one or more UEs <b>102</b> (only one shown). In this example, the traditional LTE wireless telecommunications network <b>100</b> includes two MMEs/S-GWs <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>, four eNBs <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>c </i>and <b>106</b><i>d</i>, four cells <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, <b>108</b><i>c </i>and <b>108</b><i>d</i>, and three MCEs <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>and <b>110</b><i>c</i>. The first MME/S-GW <b>104</b><i>a </i>has S1 interfaces with eNBs <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b</i>. The second MME/S-GW <b>104</b><i>b </i>has S1 interfaces with eNBs <b>106</b><i>c </i>and <b>106</b><i>d</i>. The first MCE <b>110</b><i>a </i>has a M2 interface with eNB <b>106</b><i>b</i>. The second MCE <b>110</b><i>b </i>has M2 interfaces with eNBs <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>d</i>. The third MCE <b>110</b><i>c </i>has a M2 interface with eNB <b>106</b><i>c</i>. The eNBs <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>c </i>and <b>106</b><i>d </i>communicate with one another over multiple X2 interfaces. The eNBs <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>c </i>and <b>106</b><i>d </i>respectively manage their own cells <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, <b>108</b><i>c </i>and <b>108</b><i>d </i>which have their own radio cover areas within which there may be one or more UEs <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0006" num="0021">The exemplary traditional LTE wireless telecommunications network <b>100</b> has an architecture and functionality for providing MBMS to UEs <b>102</b> as described in 3GPP TS 36.300 entitled &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2 (Release 10)&#x201d; dated June 2011. The contents of this document are incorporated by reference herein. The skilled person will appreciate that the exemplary traditional LTE wireless telecommunication system <b>100</b> may have many different configurations and may support multiple UEs <b>102</b>, multiple MMEs/S-GWs <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>, multiple eNBs <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>c </i>and <b>106</b><i>d</i>, and multiple MCEs <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>and <b>110</b><i>c</i>. In addition, the skilled person will also appreciate that the exemplary traditional LTE wireless telecommunication system <b>100</b> would include many other components which are well known in the art but their description is not needed to explain a particular problem that may occur when the UE <b>102</b> which is currently receiving a MBMS service moves away from their current source cell <b>108</b><i>a </i>(for example). This particular problem is discussed in detail next.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0022">In the exemplary traditional LTE wireless telecommunications system <b>100</b> there is a MBMS Service present in a subset of the cells <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, <b>108</b><i>c </i>and <b>108</b><i>d</i>. If the UE <b>102</b> is in connected mode and receiving a MBMS service then it would be advantageous to handover the UE <b>102</b> to another cell supporting the same MBMS service so the UE <b>102</b> continues to receive the MBMS service. If the target cell does not support the same MBMS Service, then the UE <b>102</b> may decide to receive this service over unicast which increases the traffic load in the network <b>100</b> or the UE <b>102</b> may not be able to access the MBMS service at all if for instance the cell does not have the extra resources.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0023">In the present example, when the UE <b>102</b> is in cell <b>108</b><i>a </i>and a handover is made to cell <b>108</b><i>b </i>where the two cells <b>108</b><i>a </i>and <b>108</b><i>b </i>have the same MBSFN areas IDs but the MBSFN Synchronization areas are different. This means that the two MBSFN areas are not identical but they have been assigned the same MBSFN area by chance or accident. In this case, when the UE <b>102</b> is handed over to cell <b>108</b><i>b</i>, it is possible that the service is not available over MBMS hence the UE <b>102</b> may not be able to receive the service. If the UE <b>102</b> is handover from cell <b>108</b><i>a </i>to cell <b>108</b><i>c </i>then same problem may occur because the MBSFN areas are different. If the UE <b>102</b> is handover from cell <b>108</b><i>a </i>to cell <b>108</b><i>d </i>it is guaranteed that the target cell <b>108</b><i>d </i>supports the service since both cells <b>108</b><i>a </i>and <b>108</b><i>d </i>support the same MBSFN area and the same MBSFN Synchronization area. Thus, if eNB <b>104</b><i>a </i>selects cell <b>108</b><i>d </i>as the target cell for the handover then the UE <b>102</b> will be able to receive the broadcasted service received in the source cell <b>108</b><i>a</i>. However, the eNB <b>104</b><i>a </i>currently does not have the information needed to help select a target cell so the UE <b>102</b> may continue to receive the MBMS Service. This need and other needs are satisfied by the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0024">An apparatus, a method, and a wireless telecommunication system that address the aforementioned shortcoming and other shortcomings of the prior art are described in the independent claims of the present application. Advantageous embodiments of the apparatus, the method, and the wireless telecommunication system have been described in the dependent claims of the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0025">In an aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention there is provided an apparatus (e.g. eNB, base station) configured to manage a source cell with a radio coverage area within which there is currently located a UE. The apparatus comprises a processor and a memory that stores processor-executable instructions therein where the processor interfaces with the memory and executes the processor-executable instructions to select a target cell to handover the user equipment such that the user equipment would continue to receive a MBMS service. In one example, the apparatus is able to select the target cell when the processor interfaces with the memory and executes processor-executable instructions stored therein to: (a) request the UE while located within the source cell to provide information about the MBMS service; (b) receive the requested information from the UE; (c) acquire information which identifies a MBSFN Area and optionally a MBSFN Synchronization Area within each of neighboring cells adjacent to the source cell; and (d) select one of the neighboring cells to be the target cell to handover the UE by using the received information from the UE and the acquired information about each of the neighboring cells. The advantage of the apparatus is that the UE after undergoing the handover to the target cell would continue to receive the MBMS service.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0026">In yet another aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention there is provided a method implemented by an apparatus (e.g., eNB, base station) which manages a source cell with a radio coverage area in which there is currently located a UE. In one example, the apparatus implements the method to select a target cell to handover the UE such that the UE would continue to receive a MBMS service. At one step, the apparatus requests the UE while located within the source cell to provide information about the MBMS service they are currently receiving. At another step, the apparatus receives the requested information from the UE. At yet another step, the apparatus acquires information which identifies a MBSFN Area and optionally a MBSFN Synchronization Area within each of neighboring cells adjacent to the source cell. At another step, the apparatus selects one of the neighboring cells to be the target cell to handover the UE by using the received information from the UE and the acquired information about each of the neighboring cells. The advantage of the method is that the UE after undergoing the handover to the target cell would continue to receive the MBMS service.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0027">In still yet another aspect of exemplary embodiments of the present invention there is provided a wireless telecommunication system comprising an apparatus (e.g., eNB, bases station) configured to manage a source cell with a radio coverage area within which there is currently located a UE, and at least one neighboring apparatus each of which is configured to manage a neighboring cell which is adjacent to the source cell. The apparatus comprises a processor and a memory that stores processor-executable instructions therein where the processor interfaces with the memory and executes the processor-executable instructions to select a target cell to handover the user equipment such that the user equipment would continue to receive a MBMS service. In one example, the apparatus is able to select the target cell when the processor interfaces with the memory and executes processor-executable instructions stored therein to: (a) request the UE while located within the source cell to provide information about the MBMS service; (b) receive the requested information from the UE; (c) acquire information which identifies a MBSFN Area and optionally a MBSFN Synchronization Area within each of neighboring cells adjacent to the source cell; and (d) select one of the neighboring cells to be the target cell to handover the UE by using the received information from the UE and the acquired information about each of the neighboring cells such that the UE after undergoing the handover to the target cell would continue to receive the MBMS service.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0028">In the event, the apparatus is not able to select a target cell to handover the UE such that the UE would continue to receive the MBMS service then the apparatus sends the received information about the MBMS service currently being received by the UE to the neighboring apparatus that was selected for the handover of the UE even though the neighboring cell associated with the selected neighboring apparatus does not support the MBMS service. Then, the neighboring apparatus would use the received information about the MBMS service that was previously received by the UE during another handover to select another target cell where the UE would be able to receive the MBMS service. Further in the event, the selected neighboring apparatus is not able to select a target cell to handover the UE such that the UE would be able to receive the MBMS service then the selected neighboring apparatus sends the received information about the MBMS service that was previously received by the UE to another apparatus that was selected for the handover of the UE even though a cell associated with the selected another apparatus does not support the MBMS service. Then, the selected another apparatus would use the received information about the MBMS service that was previously received by the UE during yet another handover to select yet another target cell where the UE would be able to receive the MBMS service.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is a diagram of an exemplary LTE wireless telecommunications network <b>200</b> configured to provide a MBMS service to one or more UEs <b>202</b> (only one shown) in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In this example, the exemplary LTE wireless telecommunications network <b>200</b> includes two MMEs/S-GWs <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>b</i>, four eNBs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d</i>, four cells <b>208</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d</i>, and three MCEs <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>and <b>210</b><i>c</i>. The first MME/S-GW <b>204</b><i>a </i>has S1 interfaces with eNBs <b>206</b><i>a </i>and <b>206</b><i>b</i>. The second MME/S-GW <b>204</b><i>b </i>has S1 interfaces with eNBs <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d</i>. The first MCE <b>210</b><i>a </i>has a M2 interface with eNB <b>206</b><i>b</i>. The second MCE <b>210</b><i>b </i>has M2 interfaces with eNBs <b>206</b><i>a </i>and <b>206</b><i>d</i>. The third MCE <b>210</b><i>c </i>has a M2 interface with eNB <b>206</b><i>c</i>. The eNBs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d </i>communicate with one another over multiple X2 interfaces. The eNBs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d </i>respectively manage their own cells <b>208</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>which have their own radio cover areas within which there may be one or more UEs <b>202</b>.

<p id="p-0022" num="0041">The exemplary LTE wireless telecommunications network <b>200</b> has an architecture and functionality for providing MBMS to UEs <b>202</b> as described in 3GPP TS 36.300 entitled &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); Overall description; Stage 2 (Release 10)&#x201d; dated June 2011. Note that that the 3GPP TS 36.300 standard does not disclose the eNBs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d</i>. The exemplary LTE wireless telecommunication system <b>200</b> may have many different configurations and may support multiple UEs <b>202</b>, multiple MMEs/S-GWs <b>204</b><i>a </i>and <b>204</b><i>b</i>, multiple eNBs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d</i>, and multiple MCEs <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>and <b>110</b><i>c</i>. In addition, the exemplary LTE wireless telecommunication system <b>200</b> would include many other components but for clarity are not described herein while the eNBs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d </i>are described in detail herein. A detailed description is provided next to explain how one eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) is configured to select a target cell associated with another eNB <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>or <b>206</b><i>d </i>(or possibly a traditional eNB) to handover the UE <b>202</b> such that the UE <b>202</b> would continue to receive a MBMS service when moving from the radio coverage area of a source cell to the radio coverage area of a target cell.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is a block diagram illustrating in greater detail the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) configured in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>includes a receiver <b>302</b>, a transmitter <b>304</b>, a processor <b>306</b>, and a memory <b>308</b> (storage medium <b>308</b>). The receiver <b>302</b> is configured to receive signals from the UE <b>202</b> (see step <b>502</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The transmitter <b>304</b> is configured to transmit signals to the UE <b>202</b> (see step <b>504</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). It should be mentioned that eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>has many well known components incorporated therein but for clarity those well known components are not described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0043">In particular, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>is configured to manage source cell <b>208</b><i>a </i>(cell <b>1</b>) with a radio coverage area within which there is currently located the UE <b>202</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The UE <b>202</b> is currently receiving a MBMS service or is at least interested in receiving a MBMS service. The UE <b>202</b> is also currently moving away from the radio coverage area within the source cell <b>208</b><i>a</i>. The eNB <b>206</b> is further configured such that the processor <b>306</b> interfaces with the memory <b>308</b> and executes processor-executable instructions stored therein to select a target cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(for example) to handover the UE <b>202</b> such that the UE <b>202</b> would continue to receive the MBMS service or be able to receive the MBMB service it was interested in while located in the source cell <b>208</b><i>a</i>. In one example, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>is able to select the target cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(for example) when the processor <b>306</b> interfaces with the memory <b>308</b> and executes processor-executable instructions stored therein to: (a) request the UE <b>202</b> while located within the source cell <b>208</b><i>a </i>to provide information about the MBMS service; (b) receive the requested information from the UE <b>202</b>; (c) acquire information which identifies a MBSFN Area and optionally a MBSFN Synchronization Area within each of neighboring cells <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>adjacent to the source cell <b>208</b><i>a</i>; and (d) select one of the neighboring cells <b>208</b><i>d </i>(for example) to be the target cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>to handover the UE <b>202</b> by using the received information from the UE <b>202</b> and the acquired information about each of the neighboring cells <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>such that the UE <b>202</b> after undergoing the handover to the target cell <b>202</b> would continue to receive the MBMS service or be able to receive the MBMB service it was interested in while located in the source cell <b>208</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0044">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the exemplary LTE wireless telecommunications network <b>200</b> shows a deployment of four eNBs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d </i>and their corresponding four cells <b>208</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d</i>. The UE <b>202</b> is in connected mode and connected to cell <b>208</b><i>a </i>(source cell <b>1</b>). When a handover becomes necessary, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>should, if possible, select a cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(for example) where the UE <b>202</b> continues to receive the MBMS service it currently receives. As described in the Background Section, the traditional eNB <b>106</b><i>a </i>using the currently standardized 3GPP solution does not know which of the neighboring cells <b>108</b><i>b</i>, <b>108</b><i>c </i>or <b>108</b><i>d </i>are advantageous to select such that the UE <b>102</b> may continue receiving the MBMS service. The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>addresses this problem by requesting the UE <b>202</b> to provide information about which MBMS services it is receiving or is interested in receiving and acquiring information about the MBSFN Areas and optionally the MBMS Synchronization Areas of the neighboring cells <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d</i>. Thereafter, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>uses this information to select a cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(for example) where the UE <b>202</b> is still able to receive or if desired could receive the MBMS Service.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0045">The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>may acquire the information about its neighboring cells <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>in several ways (for example):</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0046">1. By Configuration</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0047">2. By exchanging the information between the eNBs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d </i>using an external interface such as the M2 interface, the X2 interface, and/or the S1 interface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). There is an advantage when exchanging the information using the X2 interface since there will be minimum extra configuration work required when compared to using another interface since the system may to a large extent be automatically configured. Furthermore, if the MBSFN Service area and MBMS Synchronization Area are provided using the X2 Setup Request and X2 Setup Response messages as well as in the eNB configuration update message then the configuration effort in the system is kept to a minimum. These messages are described in 3GPP TS 36.423 entitled &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN); X2 application protocol (X2AP) (Release 10)&#x201d; V.10.2.0 dated June 2011 (the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein). Alternatively, it is also possible to define a new message which carries the information over the X2 interface.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0048">3. Any interface connecting the eNBs <b>206</b><i>a</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>c </i>and <b>206</b><i>d </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0049">In the present example, Table 1 shows the information available in the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) about cells <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>(cells <b>2</b>-<b>4</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0032" num="0051">Once, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) has the information about the MBMS service used by the UE <b>202</b> and the information about its neighboring cells <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>then it may use this information to evaluate the possible target cells <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c </i>and <b>208</b><i>d </i>and select the target cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(for example) to handoff the UE <b>202</b> so the UE <b>202</b> may continue to receive the MBMS service or start receiving the desired MBMS service. An example of how the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) may operate is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0052">1. The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>manages cell <b>208</b><i>a </i>belonging to MBMS Synchronization Area <b>1</b> and MBSFN Area <b>1</b> and provides/starts the MBMS Service identified by TMGI=1.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0053">2. The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>asks the UE <b>202</b> or request the UE <b>202</b> which MBMS service(s) it is receiving or interested in receiving.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0054">3. The UE <b>202</b> responds with TMGI=1 and optionally which MBSFN Area the UE <b>202</b> receives the service from.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0055">4. The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>realizes that the service identified by TMGI=1 runs in MBSFN Area=1 and belongs MBSFN Synchronization Area=1.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0056">5. The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>identifies neighboring cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(cell <b>4</b>) as the optimal candidate since it supports the MBSFN Area <b>1</b> and belongs to MBSFN Synchronization Area=1.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0057">6. The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>knows that cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(cell <b>4</b>) belongs to the same MBSFN Area, the same MBSFN Synchronization Area, and that service continuity is possible so a handover to cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(cell <b>4</b>) is made.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0058">If the exemplary LTE wireless telecommunications network <b>200</b> has geographically separated areas controlled by different MCEs <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>and <b>210</b><i>c </i>then it is possible for the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>to select cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(cell <b>4</b>) based on the MBSFN Area only while the MBMS Synchronization Area is not needed because the MBSFN Area ID selected by the individual MCEs are selected in a coordinated way by the operator. However this is a less robust solution even though possible in this particular case.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0059">In any case, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) may want to reduce the number of times it sends a request to the UE <b>202</b> to report if it is currently receiving a MBMS service or is interested in receiving a MBMS service. There are several ways of achieving this and two exemplary options are as follows:
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0060">1. The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) may ask once and send the information about the MBMS service that UE is currently receiving or interested in to the neighboring eNB <b>206</b><i>d </i>(for example) which manages the target cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(cell <b>4</b>) at handover. The neighboring eNB <b>206</b><i>d </i>upon receiving the UE <b>202</b> may then decide when it shall request the information again based on configuration. This may be implemented by having the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>send a list to the neighboring eNB <b>206</b><i>d </i>identifying the MBMS service(s) the UE <b>202</b> has reported an interest in receiving or is currently receiving.</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0061">2. The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>after requesting the MBMS service information from the UE <b>202</b> starts a timer measuring the age of the received MBMS service information. Then, when the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>regards the received MBMS service information to be old it may request the UE <b>202</b> to provide the MBMS service information again. The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>may transfer the MBMS service information to the neighboring eNB <b>206</b><i>d </i>during handover by for instance using a list identifying the MBMS service(s) the UE <b>202</b> is interested in receiving and the time since the information was provided.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0062">There may be a situation where the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>may decide to perform a handover under normal conditions (e.g., UE <b>202</b> moving out of source cell <b>208</b><i>a</i>) or because the radio conditions are bad in the source cell <b>208</b><i>a </i>but there is no target cell which is available that supports the same MBSFN Area and MBSFN Synchronization area. In addition, there may be a situation where there are no target cells which broadcast any type of MBMS service and thus the neighboring eNB which receives the handoff from the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>may not retrieve information from the handovered UE <b>202</b> to determine which MBMS services it is interested in. These two situations are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0063">In these two situations or similar situations, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) may transfer information in the handover preparation to the neighboring eNB (e.g., neighboring eNB) which manages the target cell to notify the neighboring eNB that the UE <b>202</b> was previously receiving a MBMS Service or was interested in receiving a MBMS service. For example, the information that may be transferred to the neighboring eNB may include any of the following:
<ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0064">1. MBSFN Area or a list of MBSFN Areas that could be sorted according to a priority.</li>
        <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0065">2. MBSFN Area(s) and an indicator indicating how long the network (or eNBs) is to propagate the received MBMS information.</li>
        <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0066">3. MBSFN Area(s) and corresponding MBSFN Synchronization Area(s).</li>

Note: The eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) could also transmit this information to the neighboring eNB <b>206</b><i>d </i>(for example) in the situation where the eNB <b>206</b><i>d </i>could continue to provide the MBMS service to the UE <b>202</b>.

<p id="p-0043" num="0068">The neighboring eNB may use this information to effectively steer the UE <b>202</b> in a subsequent handover to another eNB which manages a target cell that is capable of providing the previously received or interested MBMS service to the UE <b>202</b>. If the other eNB is not able to provide the previously received or interested MBMS service to the UE <b>202</b> then it may also send the information in a handover to yet another eNB which may manage a target cell that is capable of providing the previously received or interested MBMS service to the UE <b>202</b>. Thus, by using this information it is possible for the network to steer the UE <b>202</b> interested in receiving a service over MBMS back to the correct MBSFN Area after one or more handovers to cells that do not support the desired MBMS Service areas. There are several possible alternatives to this scheme in which one of the eNBs would discontinue forwarding this information during one or more handovers. For example, the eNB may use the time since the UE <b>202</b> reported that it was receiving or interested in receiving the MBMS service to decide when the information is outdated and the network will no longer take the MBSFN Area information into consideration. In another example, the eNB may use the time until the last service the UE <b>202</b> has reported interest in stops for each MBSFN Area to decide when the information is removed and the network will no longer take the MBSFN Area information into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is a diagram used to explain how eNBs <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>could function in a scenario where a UE <b>404</b> which is currently receiving a MBMS service has to be handover to a cell <b>406</b><i>a </i>(cell <b>3</b>) that does not support MBMS in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In this scenario, the eNB <b>402</b><i>a </i>manages two cells <b>406</b><i>b </i>and <b>406</b><i>c </i>(cells <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>) where the MBMS service is provided in cell <b>406</b><i>c </i>(cell <b>2</b>) but not in cell <b>406</b><i>b </i>(cell <b>1</b>). Further, there is a coverage hole <b>408</b> in the radio coverage area of cell <b>406</b><i>c </i>(cell <b>2</b>) and to provide radio coverage in the coverage hole <b>408</b>, cell <b>406</b><i>a </i>(cell <b>3</b>) is deployed which is managed by eNB <b>402</b><i>b</i>. Cells <b>406</b><i>a </i>(cell <b>3</b>) and cell <b>406</b><i>b </i>(cell <b>1</b>) belong to the same frequency layer while cell <b>406</b><i>c </i>(cell <b>2</b>) which is currently providing the MBMS service to UE <b>404</b> belongs to another frequency layer.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0070">As shown, the UE <b>404</b> is receiving the MBMS service and moving from the right towards the left as indicated by the arrow <b>410</b>. When the UE <b>404</b> arrives to the coverage hole <b>408</b>, the eNB <b>402</b><i>a </i>selects cell <b>406</b><i>a </i>(cell <b>3</b>) which is managed by eNB <b>402</b><i>b </i>as the target for handover and performs the handover. The eNB <b>402</b><i>a </i>does not select cell <b>406</b><i>a </i>(cell <b>1</b>) because it is not within range for the UE <b>404</b>. The eNB <b>402</b><i>a </i>knows for example due to configuration or information exchange using the X2 interface which MBSFN area(s) and MBSFN Synchronization Area(s) are supported by cell <b>406</b><i>c </i>(cell <b>2</b>). Thus, the eNB <b>402</b><i>a </i>knows the UE <b>404</b> upon handover may no longer be able to receive the MBMS service.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0071">The challenge is to move the UE <b>404</b> back to cell <b>406</b><i>c </i>(cell <b>2</b>) where the MBMS service is available when the radio coverage is sufficient. To meet this challenge, the eNB <b>402</b><i>a </i>provides during the handover the MBSFN Area(s) and MBSFN Synchronization Area(s) where the UE <b>404</b> is currently receiving the MBMS Service from to the eNB <b>402</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the eNB <b>402</b><i>b </i>knows that a future handover to cell <b>406</b><i>c </i>(cell <b>2</b>) is preferable when compared to a handover to cell <b>406</b><i>b </i>(cell <b>1</b>) taking into account MBMS provided Services.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0072">However, depending on the radio conditions, the eNB <b>402</b><i>b </i>may need to handover the UE <b>404</b> to cell <b>406</b><i>b </i>(cell <b>1</b>) anyway when the UE <b>202</b> moves further to the left. In this case, the eNB <b>402</b><i>b </i>would transfer the MBMS information about the MBMS service previously received by the UE <b>404</b> to the eNB <b>402</b><i>a</i>. The eNB <b>402</b><i>a </i>will now know that it would be advantageous to move the UE <b>404</b> to cell <b>406</b><i>c </i>(cell <b>2</b>). Hence, to meet this particular challenge the eNBs <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>would continue to forward the MBSFN Area(s) and corresponding MBSFN Synchronization area(s) in which the UE <b>402</b> was receiving or interested in receiving MBMS services from during handovers.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0073">In the event, the UE <b>402</b> remains in cell <b>406</b><i>a </i>(cell <b>3</b>) for a long time, then the MBMS service it reported having received or having an interest in receiving may have stopped. To meet this challenge, the eNB <b>402</b><i>a </i>may add a time indicator in the MBMS information which is transmitted to the eNB <b>402</b><i>b </i>when transitioning the UE <b>404</b> from cell <b>406</b><i>a </i>(cell <b>2</b>) to cell <b>406</b><i>c </i>(cell <b>3</b>). Or, the eNB <b>402</b><i>b </i>may use a timer which is started when receiving the UE <b>404</b>. Thus, when a predetermined amount of time has expired since the eNB <b>402</b><i>b </i>received the UE <b>404</b>, then the eNB <b>402</b><i>b </i>knows that too much time has passed since the UE <b>404</b> was receiving the MBMS service and there is no point in trying to steer the UE <b>404</b> back to the MBSFN Area where the service was provided.</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0099">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is a flowchart illustrating the basic steps of an exemplary method <b>500</b> implemented by the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>(for example) for selecting a target cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>(for example) to handover the UE <b>202</b> (for example) such that the UE <b>202</b> would continue to receive a MBMS service or receive a MBMS service they where interested in receiving while in the source cell in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Beginning at step <b>502</b>, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>requests the UE <b>202</b> while located within the source cell <b>208</b><i>a </i>to provide information (e.g., TMGI) about the MBMS service they are currently receiving or interested in receiving. At step <b>504</b>, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>receives the requested information (e.g., TMGI) from the UE <b>202</b>. At step <b>506</b>, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>acquires information which identifies a MBSFN Area and optionally a MBSFN Synchronization Area within each of neighboring cells <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c</i>, and <b>208</b><i>d </i>adjacent to the source cell <b>208</b><i>a</i>. At step <b>508</b>, the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>selects one of the neighboring cells <b>208</b><i>d </i>(for example) to be the target cell to handover the UE <b>202</b> by using the received information from the UE <b>202</b> and the acquired information about each of the neighboring cells <b>208</b><i>b</i>, <b>208</b><i>c</i>, and <b>208</b><i>d </i>such that the UE <b>202</b> after undergoing the handover to the target cell <b>208</b><i>d </i>would continue to receive the MBMS service. At step <b>510</b>, if the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>cannot select a target cell to handover the UE <b>202</b> such that the UE <b>202</b> would continue to receive the MBMS service or be able to receive the interested MBMS service then the eNB <b>206</b><i>a </i>would send the received information about the MBMS service received by the UE <b>202</b> and possibly the time indicator to a neighboring eNB associated with one of the neighboring cells that was selected for the handover of the UE <b>202</b> even though the neighboring cell associated with the selected neighboring eNB does not support the MBMS service. Then, the neighboring eNB would use the received information about the MBMS service that was previously received by the UE during another handover to select another target cell where the UE <b>202</b> would be able to receive the MBMS service.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0100">From the foregoing, it may be seen that the present invention was described above with respect to a LTE wireless telecommunications network and eNBs. However, the previously described exemplary embodiments of the present invention may be practiced in any type of wireless telecommunication network where there is an apparatus (e.g., eNB, base station) that manages a cell in which a UE may receive a MBMS service. For example, the present invention may be practiced in GSM, UMTS/W-CDMA, CDMA2000, or WiMAX wireless telecommunication networks. Furthermore, the present invention has many other features, advantages etc. . . . in addition to those mentioned above some of which are as follows:
<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0101">If an indication of which MBMS service the UE is interested in receiving or is receiving is sent to the target cell this reduces the number of times an apparatus (e.g., eNB, base station) has to request a UE to report the MBMS services it is receiving or interested in receiving.</li>
        <li id="ul0018-0002" num="0102">Since the apparatus (e.g., eNB, base station) knows if a UE is interested in a particular MBMS service it also knows when it is not necessary to take the MBSFN areas in the neighboring cells into consideration hence allowing different handover strategies depending on if a UE is receiving a MBMS service over MBMS broadcast or not.</li>
        <li id="ul0018-0003" num="0103">When the network propagates the MBSFN Area in the handover messages the network may return the UE to a suitable cell when the network had to trigger a handover to a cell not broadcasting any MBMS Service where the alternative is even worse, such as dropping the UE.</li>
