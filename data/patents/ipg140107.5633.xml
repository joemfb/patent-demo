<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Application launching on a computer via indexed data. Based on a search term entered by a user, the computer searches an index containing metadata representative of one or more applications installed on the computer. A user interface on the computer's display has a window for displaying the results of searching the index. In addition, the user interface receives user input to select an application from the search results to be initiated. The computer is responsive to the user input via the user interface for initiating the selected application installed on the computer. A computer-readable medium including a persistent component, an index component, a query component, and an execution component embodies further aspects of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/159,821, filed Jun. 23, 2005, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently available computer operating systems use a &#x201c;Start&#x201d; menu for launching applications installed on a computer. The Start menu typically lists recently accessed programs. In addition, an &#x201c;All Programs&#x201d; option of the Start menu permits a user to navigate through multiple submenus to locate a program he or she wishes to open. The user then clicks on an appropriate user interface element to open the selected program. If a particular program does not appear on the Start menu or one of its submenus, the user may need to search for the program on the computer's hard drive. A typical Start menu also includes a &#x201c;Favorites&#x201d; section, which enables the user to open favorite Web sites and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unfortunately, the Start menu can become quite unwieldy over time as more and more applications are installed on the computer. The Start menu can easily consume an entire screen length and often has multiple columns and submenus. As such, many useful applications can become buried in several layers of menus, which make them very difficult to locate and launch.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the invention overcome one or more deficiencies in known systems by permitting a user to easily access and run software applications on his or her computer. Aspects of the invention provide an index of applications using desktop search functionality, which in part allows the user to quickly and easily search for a desired application to be launched in much the same manner as searching for a text document or e-mail. When items are retrieved by the desktop search engine, they are enabled for launching (e.g., right-click enabled) directly from the results window user interface. In addition, aspects of the invention improve search efficiency, the relevance of search results, and the user experience with a search tool that is &#x201c;lighter,&#x201d; customizable, and more aesthetically pleasing to the user. In this regard, an embodiment of the invention automatically scopes search results, partitions the results by file type, and presents a consistent interface across different contexts.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Computer-readable media having computer-executable instructions for performing a method of launching applications embody further aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Alternatively, embodiments of the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates components of an exemplary computer system <b>100</b> implementing an embodiment of the invention. Aspects of the invention allow a user of computer system <b>100</b> to easily access and run software applications <b>102</b>, or programs, on a computer. An index <b>104</b> contains metadata associated with the applications <b>102</b> installed on the computer, which simplifies the task of locating and initiating a particular application. In one embodiment, desktop search functionality, such as provided by Microsoft Corporation's MSN&#xae; Toolbar Suite, helps users quickly find virtually any type of document, media file or e-mail message on their computers. This search functionality identifies keywords within files as well as within their titles. In other words, the index <b>104</b> permits the user to search for a particular application <b>102</b> in much the same manner as searching for a text document or e-mail. One example of metadata is the file type of the indexed item.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In general, desktop searching may refer to the ability to search multiple data sources (e.g., the Internet, corporate intranets and databases, hard drives and removable storage on the user's computer) from a search term entered into a text box or other form of search field on the computer desktop. Many user activities performed during the course of normal computer usage may be accomplished by searching the desktop contents. Advantageously, desktop searching according to aspects of the invention returns desired results quickly enough to produce a significant productivity increase and permits the user to launch a separate application directly from the search results.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a persistent user interface (UI) element <b>106</b> remains on the desktop for accessing information in index <b>104</b> and providing results based on partial matches of one or more characters input by the user. In this manner, the UI element <b>106</b> is available in the computer's operating system shell as well as hosted in various applications. This significantly reduces repeated mouse clicks and keystrokes. In addition to metadata associated with applications <b>102</b>, the index <b>104</b> contains metadata for browser favorites, recent documents, and operating system shell namespace (e.g., for printers, connections, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Aspects of the present invention also provide a second UI element <b>108</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for displaying results of the search. In order to provide useful results as soon as possible, one embodiment of the invention modifies the query term input in UI element <b>106</b> by, for example, appending a wildcard operator and filtering the most appropriate data types. Filtering in this manner to narrow the scope of the search vastly improves the speed of the search. Given the limited screen space available for display, one embodiment also prunes the results by limiting them to certain document types depending on the search and grouping relevant items by task. Advantageously, the user may customize these groupings. By determining a user's intended search scope without explicit user designation or selection, aspects of the invention improve search efficiency and the relevance of search results by providing a search tool that is &#x2018;lighter,&#x201d; customizable, and more aesthetically pleasing to the user. In one embodiment, the invention determines search scope by &#x201c;predicting&#x201d; the user's intended search scope based on the context of his or her current application.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second UI element <b>108</b>, although referred to as a program launch UI, is optimized to perform numerous repetitive tasks such as launching programs, looking up contacts, e-mails, etc. In addition, items retrieved by the desktop search engine may be right-click enabled and provide the user with generally the same options as the Start menu.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The UI element <b>108</b> may be embodied by a &#x201c;Word Wheel,&#x201d; that is, a pop-up window providing a summary of results from desktop search queries as the user types. The Word Wheel, in one embodiment, permits the user to open items, launch applications, right-click for extra context-menu information, without having to launch a separate application or window. As the user types, the summarized view in UI element <b>108</b> suggests possible results based on the user's input, and provides access to these results without launching a full, detailed, results window.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exemplary flow diagram illustrating search and launch operations according to an embodiment of the invention. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the user wishes to launch a word processing program, such as Microsoft&#xae; Word available from Microsoft Corporation. Beginning at <b>202</b>, the user desires to launch a program <b>102</b>. At <b>204</b>, the user clicks in the first UI element <b>106</b> (e.g., a desktop edit/search field) and starts typing a program name (e.g., &#x201c;word&#x201d;). Searching of index <b>104</b> begins at <b>206</b> to identify the best match for the text entered by the user. At <b>208</b>, embodiments of the invention provide the second UI element <b>108</b> (e.g., a Word Wheel results view) to display the best matches in a relatively simple, clean list. The user may continue to type additional characters of the search term until the list is satisfactory. At <b>210</b>, may click on a selected result item to launch the desired program <b>102</b> (e.g., Microsoft&#xae; Office Word 2003).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exemplary screen shot illustrates a user interface according to an embodiment of the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, UI element <b>106</b> provides the user with instant search access to information on his or her computer as well as the Internet. In one embodiment, the query box of UI element <b>106</b> uses &#x201c;word wheeling&#x201d; to dynamically display results in UI element <b>108</b> as the user begins typing a search term. For example, as a user types &#x201c;w-o-r-d&#x201d; into the search box, he or she quickly sees a list of any desktop applications that contain the letter &#x201c;w&#x201d; and a list of Internet search results for the search term. The search results automatically, and quickly, update as the user types additional characters; first &#x201c;w&#x201d;, then &#x201c;wo&#x201d;, then &#x201c;wor&#x201d;, and finally the complete search term &#x201c;word&#x201d;. At any time, the user may stop typing and select the desired application for launching from UI element <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, the default search scope is set to the computer's hard drive and includes local files and e-mail. As described above, the desktop search tool provides persistence because it resides in the taskbar.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the UI element <b>108</b> partitions the search results by file type (e.g., Program/Application, Browser Favorites, Contacts, etc.). These items are displayed as subgroups in a Word Wheel window in the illustrated embodiment. According to aspects of the present invention, the Word Wheel UI element <b>108</b> enables the user to easily find and launch a selected application <b>102</b> installed on the computer. For example, to launch an application, the user types its title (or a portion of the title) in the desktop search field UI <b>106</b> and then clicks on the appropriate result shown in UI element <b>108</b> to launch the application. In the alternative, the user can navigate the search results with the keyboard's arrow keys and &#x201c;enter&#x201d; on the desired result item as a means for selecting the desired application to be launched.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, UI element <b>108</b> groups the results by type (e.g., applications, documents, contacts, e-mail) and lists up to a predetermined number of result items for each type. In an alternative embodiment, the invention allows the user to specify which result types will be displayed in the Word Wheel UI element <b>108</b>. For example, a user can choose to only display applications. In this manner, UI element <b>108</b> presents a diverse set of search results in a single, unified UI. Advantageously, the individual search results UIs are consistent with each other even though the searches may have been performed in different scopes or contexts. The similarity and familiarity of the results interfaces improves search efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">One implementation of the invention is as follows. Applications, IE Favorites, My Recent Documents are stored as folders and files under C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\ and C:\Documents and Settings\&#x3c;current logged in user&#x3e;\. Using the indexer in the desktop search tool, indexes these data elements so they can be queried in meaningful ways to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exemplary flow diagram illustrating computer-executable instructions in the form of pseudocode according to an embodiment of the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the pseudocode explains the process that an embodiment of the invention may follow to perform queries against a desktop search index and launch tasks from those queries. The illustrated process is initiated by the user typing one or more characters into a persistent UI search field (e.g., UI element <b>106</b>). Reference character <b>402</b> indicates a persistent component (Deskbar_SetText), reference character <b>404</b> indicates an index component (Wordwheel_SetText), reference character <b>406</b> indicates a query component (DesktopSearch_Query), and reference character <b>408</b> indicates an execution component (Wordwheel_ExecuteItem).</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, DesktopSearch_Query is repeated for every letter typed and Wordwheel_ExecuteItem is responsive to input from the user, such as the user clicking on a result item, to select an application for launching.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows one example of a general purpose computing device in the form of a computer <b>130</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, a computer such as the computer <b>130</b> is suitable for use in the other figures illustrated and described herein. Computer <b>130</b> has one or more processors or processing units <b>132</b> and a system memory <b>134</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a system bus <b>136</b> couples various system components including the system memory <b>134</b> to the processors <b>132</b>. The bus <b>136</b> represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus also known as Mezzanine bus.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The computer <b>130</b> typically has at least some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media, which include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media, may be any available medium that may be accessed by computer <b>130</b>. By way of example and not limitation, computer readable media comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. For example, computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that may be used to store the desired information and that may be accessed by computer <b>130</b>. Communication media typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media. Those skilled in the art are familiar with the modulated data signal, which has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. Wired media, such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media, such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media, are examples of communication media. Combinations of any of the above are also included within the scope of computer readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The system memory <b>134</b> includes computer storage media in the form of removable and/or non-removable, volatile and/or nonvolatile memory. In the illustrated embodiment, system memory <b>134</b> includes read only memory (ROM) <b>138</b> and random access memory (RAM) <b>140</b>. A basic input/output system <b>142</b> (BIOS), including the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within computer <b>130</b>, such as during start-up, is typically stored in ROM <b>138</b>. RAM <b>140</b> typically includes data and/or program modules that are immediately accessible to and/or presently being operated on by processing unit <b>132</b>. By way of example, and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates operating system <b>144</b>, application programs <b>146</b>, other program modules <b>148</b>, and program data <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The computer <b>130</b> may also include other removable/non-removable, volatile/nonvolatile computer storage media. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a hard disk drive <b>154</b> that reads from or writes to non-removable, nonvolatile magnetic media. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows a magnetic disk drive <b>156</b> that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile magnetic disk <b>158</b>, and an optical disk drive <b>160</b> that reads from or writes to a removable, nonvolatile optical disk <b>162</b> such as a CD-ROM or other optical media. Other removable/non-removable, volatile/nonvolatile computer storage media that may be used in the exemplary operating environment include, but are not limited to, magnetic tape cassettes, flash memory cards, digital versatile disks, digital video tape, solid state RAM, solid state ROM, and the like. The hard disk drive <b>154</b>, and magnetic disk drive <b>156</b> and optical disk drive <b>160</b> are typically connected to the system bus <b>136</b> by a non-volatile memory interface, such as interface <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The drives or other mass storage devices and their associated computer storage media discussed above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, provide storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer <b>130</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, hard disk drive <b>154</b> is illustrated as storing operating system <b>170</b>, application programs <b>172</b>, other program modules <b>174</b>, and program data <b>176</b>. Note that these components may either be the same as or different from operating system <b>144</b>, application programs <b>146</b>, other program modules <b>148</b>, and program data <b>150</b>. Operating system <b>170</b>, application programs <b>172</b>, other program modules <b>174</b>, and program data <b>176</b> are given different numbers here to illustrate that, at a minimum, they are different copies.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A user may enter commands and information into computer <b>130</b> through input devices or user interface selection devices such as a keyboard <b>180</b> and a pointing device <b>182</b> (e.g., a mouse, trackball, pen, or touch pad). Other input devices (not shown) may include a microphone, joystick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are connected to processing unit <b>132</b> through a user input interface <b>184</b> that is coupled to system bus <b>136</b>, but may be connected by other interface and bus structures, such as a parallel port, game port, or a Universal Serial Bus (USB). A monitor <b>188</b> or other type of display device is also connected to system bus <b>136</b> via an interface, such as a video interface <b>190</b>. In addition to the monitor <b>188</b>, computers often include other peripheral output devices (not shown) such as a printer and speakers, which may be connected through an output peripheral interface (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The computer <b>130</b> may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as a remote computer <b>194</b>. The remote computer <b>194</b> may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to computer <b>130</b>. The logical connections depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> include a local area network (LAN) <b>196</b> and a wide area network (WAN) <b>198</b>, but may also include other networks. LAN <b>136</b> and/or WAN <b>138</b> may be a wired network, a wireless network, a combination thereof, and so on. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices, enterprise-wide computer networks, intranets, and global computer networks (e.g., the Internet).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When used in a local area networking environment, computer <b>130</b> is connected to the LAN <b>196</b> through a network interface or adapter <b>186</b>. When used in a wide area networking environment, computer <b>130</b> typically includes a modem <b>178</b> or other means for establishing communications over the WAN <b>198</b>, such as the Internet. The modem <b>178</b>, which may be internal or external, is connected to system bus <b>136</b> via the user input interface <b>184</b>, or other appropriate mechanism. In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to computer <b>130</b>, or portions thereof, may be stored in a remote memory storage device (not shown). By way of example, and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates remote application programs <b>192</b> as residing on the memory device. The network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing a communications link between the computers may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Generally, the data processors of computer <b>130</b> are programmed by means of instructions stored at different times in the various computer-readable storage media of the computer.
