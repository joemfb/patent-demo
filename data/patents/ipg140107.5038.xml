<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, aspects of the disclosure are directed towards techniques for using short-range communication, such as near-field communication (NFC), to redirect the communication of a computing device to receive digital items selected at a kiosk device.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Typically, kiosk devices may provide a Quick Response (QR) code for each available digital item for download. A user may use his computing device, such as a mobile phone, to take a picture of a QR code corresponding to a digital item. The QR code may embed a universal resource locator (URL) that the computing device may then navigate to download the digital item. However, using a mobile computing device to take a picture of a QR code might be cumbersome because it may be difficult for the user to properly line up and focus the mobile computing device to take a legible photo of the QR code. Furthermore, if the QR code is dynamically generated at the kiosk device and displayed onto a display of the kiosk device, the light emitted from the display as well as any light reflected off of the display may saturate the camera sensor of the mobile computing device and may make it harder to take a legible photo of the QR code. In addition, activating the camera functionality of the mobile computing device may be cumbersome because the mobile computing device may have to be unlocked, the mobile computing device may have to exit out of the current running computer application, and the mobile computing device then may have to launch the camera application or a specialized QR code capture application.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Instead of presenting a QR code, a kiosk device may instead display a pass code corresponding to a selected item that the user may enter into his mobile computing device to enable his mobile computing device to download the selected digital content. However, entering the pass code into the computing device may also be cumbersome. For example, the mobile computing device may have to be unlocked, the mobile computing device may also have to exit out of the current running computer application, the mobile computing device may also have to launch a web browsing application, navigate to a page referenced by a specific URL, and receive the pass code entered by the user into the page referenced by the URL.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The kiosk device may also often require payment information, such as credit card information, to be directly into the kiosk device before the kiosk device displays the appropriate QR code or otherwise enable access to the selected digital item. Because entering payment information may, for example, require inputting credit card information such as the name, address, credit card number, credit card expiration date, and credit card security code, the user may spend a long time in front of the kiosk device entering the information. Requiring the user to enter payment information directly into the kiosk device may create security problems, such as another person looking over the user's shoulder or even looking at the kiosk display, if the kiosk display displays the payment information as the user enters that information. In addition, entering payment information directly into the kiosk device may also introduce unknowns, such as if the payment information is being stored by the kiosk device and, if so, the security employed by the kiosk device to protect such stored payment information.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Techniques of this disclosure may, in various aspects, enable a user to purchase and have digital items selected on a kiosk device be downloaded to his mobile computing device by selecting a digital item at the kiosk device when the mobile computing device, such as a mobile phone, is within a defined proximity of a tag device at the kiosk device. The kiosk device may dynamically display representations of digital items available for download or purchase, and a user may interact with the kiosk to browse through the digital items available to select a desired digital item. Responsive to the mobile computing device being placed in range of the tag device, the mobile computing device may gain access to the selected digital item, including downloading the selected digital item onto the mobile computing device. If payment information is required from the user before the mobile computing device is granted access to the selected digital item, the user may be able to enter the required payment information directly into the mobile computing device, allowing the mobile computing device to communicate the payment information to the kiosk device, instead of the user entering the payment information directly into the kiosk device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tag device of the kiosk device may be a passive tag, such as a passive near-field communication (NFC) tag. Due to potential limitations of the passive tag as to the amount of information that may be stored on and transmitted by the passive tag, the passive tag may, in some cases, only store and transmit the unique identity of the kiosk device, such as a universal resource locator (URL) associated with the kiosk device, to the mobile computing device. Furthermore, due to its passive nature, the passive tag may, in some instances, not receive any information regarding the digital item selected at the kiosk device in order to transmit that information to the mobile computing device. In some examples, the passive tag may only be able to transmit static information. Despite the potential limitations described above, advantages of using a passive tag as a tag device may include that passive tags are less complex compared to, for example, active tags, and thus may be less expensive to implement and may be less likely to malfunction than active tags.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">To address the potential limitations of a passive NFC tag described above, the NFC tag may be able to redirect the mobile computing device it is in communications with to communicate with a remote system that has received information regarding the selected digital item at the kiosk device. The NFC tag may achieve the redirection by sending a URL that includes a unique identifier identifying the kiosk device to the mobile computing device. The kiosk device may also send the selected digital item (or the identity of the selected digital item) to the remote system. The mobile computing device may access a web page referenced by the URL that is provided by the remote system. The remote system may be able to determine the identity of the kiosk device based on the unique identifier included in the URL, and the remote system may be able to send the digital item selected at the kiosk device to the mobile computing device. In this fashion, digital items may be dynamically selected at the kiosk device and may be received by the mobile computing device based on the information provided by the passive NFC tag.</p>

Device identifier <b>130</b>, in some examples, may be an identifier that uniquely identifies kiosk computing device <b>110</b> associated with the tag device <b>114</b>.

In this way, computing device <b>100</b> may be able to receive access to digital item <b>122</b> that corresponds with the selection made at kiosk computing device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some examples, computing device <b>100</b> requesting access to digital item <b>122</b> may include accessing, by computing device <b>100</b>, a web page referenced by a universal resource locator (URL) included in device identifier <b>130</b>, and receiving access by computing device <b>100</b> to digital item <b>122</b> may include downloading, by computing device <b>100</b>, digital item <b>122</b> from a remote server, accessing, by computing device <b>100</b>, digital item <b>122</b> at a remote server, or receiving, by computing device <b>100</b>, a token associated with digital item <b>122</b>. In some examples, first communication pathway <b>116</b> may include a short-range communication pathway, such as NFC, between a passive NFC tag, such as tag device <b>114</b> and computing device <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is another block diagram illustrating an example computing device <b>100</b> that is configured to receive access to an example digital item <b>122</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, digital item <b>122</b> may be stored in kiosk computing device <b>110</b> and/or in remote system <b>120</b>, and computing device <b>100</b> may be able to receive access to digital item <b>122</b> from kiosk computing device <b>110</b> or remote system <b>120</b>. For example, kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may send digital item <b>122</b> to computing device <b>100</b> via kiosk communication pathway <b>119</b>, or kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may make digital item <b>122</b> available to computing device <b>110</b> at remote system <b>120</b>, and remote system <b>120</b> may in turn send digital item <b>122</b> to computing device <b>100</b> via remote communication pathway <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Digital item <b>122</b> may include any digital file, program, or media, including but not limited to an electronic book (e-book), a text file, an audio file, a video file, digital images, electronic documents, computer applications, directional information, and the like, including a combination of two or more of these items. The digital item <b>122</b> may be stored in the remote system <b>120</b>, in the kiosk computing device <b>110</b>, and/or in another external device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some examples, kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may not necessarily be a specialized kiosk. Instead, kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may be any computing device that is configured to present an interface for receiving the selection of digital item <b>122</b>. Kiosk user interface device <b>112</b> may be any combination of devices capable of receiving input from user <b>150</b> and providing output to user <b>150</b>, including but not limited to a presence-sensitive display. Kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may also include or be associated with tag device <b>114</b>, such as a passive NFC tag, which may be configured to transmit device identifier <b>130</b> that uniquely identifies kiosk computing device <b>110</b>. In some examples, digital item <b>122</b> may be stored in kiosk computing device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some examples, kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may include one or more zones, where a tag device such as tag device <b>114</b> may be associated with each zone of the one or more zones of kiosk computing device <b>110</b>. In such an example, each zone may act like an individual kiosk computing device <b>110</b> having an associated tag device <b>114</b> that sends a device identifier identifying the specific zone associated with that tag device <b>114</b> to computing device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Computing device <b>100</b> may be a mobile computing device, including but not limited to a mobile phone, a tablet computer, a personal digital assistant, a handheld computer, a media player, and the like, including a combination of two or more of these items. Computing device <b>100</b> may include display <b>102</b>, such as a presence-sensitive display, that may receive input and provide output. For example, display <b>102</b> may be configured to output contents of digital item <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Remote system <b>120</b> may include but is not limited to one or more remote servers, one or more computing devices, or a cloud computing service. A cloud computing service may include one or more remote servers that may provide one or more services, including but not limited to computation, software, data access, and storage services, without requiring end-user knowledge of the physical location and configuration of the systems that deliver the one or more services. In some examples, one or more digital items, including digital item <b>122</b>, may be stored in remote system <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Computing device <b>100</b> may include a short-range communication module, such as a near-field communication (NFC) module (not shown) capable of initiating short range wireless communication via first communication pathway <b>116</b> with tag device <b>114</b> associated with kiosk computing device <b>110</b> over a short distance. For example, this short distance may be less 100 meters, less than 10 meters, less than 1 meter, less than 10 centimeters, less than 5 centimeters, or even less than 4 centimeters. Although only one tag device <b>114</b> is provided in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, tag device <b>114</b> may be representative of any number of tag devices configured to communicate with computing device <b>100</b> using a short range communication protocol, such as an NFC protocol. Since each tag device <b>114</b> may be relatively simple and configured to communicate with any number of other NFC devices, computing device <b>100</b> may be capable of establishing communication with thousands or even millions of different location devices. In some examples, first communication pathway <b>116</b> may include an NFC network.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Computing device <b>100</b> may operate in at least two different modes to communicate with tag device <b>114</b> using first communication pathway <b>116</b>, such as NFC. For example, computing device <b>100</b> and tag device <b>114</b> may be configured to operate in a passive mode and an active mode of operation. In an active mode of operation, computing device <b>100</b> may generate a first radio field that is received by tag device <b>114</b> in physical proximity to computing device <b>100</b>. In response, tag device <b>114</b> may generate a second radio field that is received by computing device <b>100</b>. In this way, data may be communicated between computing device <b>100</b> and tag device <b>114</b> such as using peer-to-peer communication. In the active mode, computing device <b>100</b> may also power or activate a passive device to retrieve data from the passive device, as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a passive mode of operation, load modulation techniques may be employed to facilitate data communication between computing device <b>100</b> and tag device <b>114</b> via first communication pathway <b>116</b>. In a passive mode, tag device <b>114</b> may not generate a radio field in response to the radio field of computing device <b>100</b>. Instead, tag device <b>114</b> may include electrical hardware (e.g., an NFC module) that generates a change in impedance in response to the radio field generated by computing device <b>100</b>. For example, computing device <b>100</b> may generate a radio field that is received by tag device <b>114</b>. Electrical hardware in tag device <b>114</b> may generate a change in impedance in response to the radio field. The change in impedance may be detected by the NFC module of computing device <b>100</b>. In this way, load modulation techniques may be used by computing device <b>100</b> to obtain device identifier <b>130</b> from tag device <b>114</b>. In other words, computing device <b>100</b> may obtain device identifier <b>130</b> from tag device <b>114</b>, but tag device <b>114</b> may not receive any data from computing device <b>100</b> in the passive mode. Other well-known modulation techniques including phase modulation and/or amplitude modulation may also be employed to facilitate data communication between computing device <b>100</b> and tag device <b>114</b> in other examples.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Tag device <b>114</b> may generally operate in passive mode. In passive mode, tag device <b>114</b> may be referred to as an NFC tag or NFC target. In other words, computing device <b>100</b> may include active NFC hardware and tag device <b>114</b> may include passive NFC hardware. Since a passive tag device <b>114</b> does not need a dedicated power supply, tag device <b>114</b> may be placed in a variety of locations, on any surface, or even as part of smaller items. For example, tag device <b>114</b> may be embodied as a sticker or adhesive poster that is placed on the wall of a building. Passive tag device <b>114</b> may also be less expensive and more difficult to corrupt with computing device <b>100</b>. In this manner, tag device <b>114</b> may include electrical hardware that generates a change in impedance in response to a radio field. However, in other examples, tag device <b>114</b> may be another computing device. For example, tag device <b>114</b> may be a computing device that operates in a passive NFC mode and/or an active NFC mode. In other words, tag device <b>114</b> may include active NFC hardware. This active NFC hardware may be configured to emulate passive NFC hardware or participate in active near-field communication.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one example of a passive tag device, tag device <b>114</b> may communicate device identifier <b>130</b> to the computing device <b>100</b> in response to receiving a radio field generated by the NFC module of computing device <b>100</b>. In other words, device identifier <b>130</b> may be data stored on tag device <b>114</b>. In response to receiving the radio field (e.g., receiving power sufficient to transmit data), computing device <b>100</b> may receive device identifier <b>130</b> from tag device <b>114</b>. In this manner, tag device <b>114</b> may only be capable of delivering or sending device identifier <b>130</b> if computing device <b>100</b> is within close physical proximity to tag device <b>114</b>. Although a user may physically touch, bump, or tap computing device <b>100</b> to tag device <b>114</b>, computing device <b>100</b> may be capable of receiving device identifier <b>130</b> from tag device <b>114</b> without physically touching tag device <b>114</b>. In some examples, the techniques of this disclosure may be applicable to other types of computer-readable short range communication signals and devices, including but not limited to Bluetooth, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, quick response (QR) codes, bar codes, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, the device identifier <b>130</b> does not include the digital item <b>122</b> itself nor does it include any indications as to the identity of the digital item <b>122</b>. Instead, the device identifier <b>130</b> may simply act as an identifier for kiosk computing device <b>110</b>. In this manner, device identifier <b>130</b> may instruct computing device <b>100</b> to communicate with kiosk computing device <b>110</b> via kiosk communication pathway <b>119</b>, or to communicate with remote system <b>120</b> via remote communication pathway <b>117</b>. In some examples, both kiosk communication pathway <b>119</b> and remote communication pathway <b>117</b> may be considered second communication pathway <b>118</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, computing device <b>100</b> may request and receive access to digital item <b>122</b> by communicating via remote communication pathway <b>117</b> with remote system <b>120</b> based on device identifier <b>130</b>. Device identifier <b>130</b> may include a universal resource locator (URL) that references an Internet resource within remote system <b>120</b> that includes or redirects to digital item <b>122</b>. The URL may also include an identifier, such as a unique name, associated with kiosk computing device <b>110</b>, so that remote system <b>120</b> may be able to identify kiosk computing device <b>110</b> based on the URL. In response to receiving device identifier <b>130</b> from tag device <b>114</b>, computing device <b>100</b> may send a request for access to the Internet resource referenced by the URL included in device identifier <b>130</b>. In some examples, computing device <b>100</b> may navigate, without user intervention, to the Internet resource referenced by the URL, in response to receiving device identifier <b>130</b>. In some examples, computing device <b>100</b> may display a confirmation dialog at display <b>102</b> to confirm that computing device <b>100</b> will navigate to the Internet resource referenced by the URL. In some examples, the Internet resource referenced by the URL may be a web page hosted on remote system <b>120</b>, and accessing the Internet resource referenced by the URL may include sending a request from computing device <b>100</b> to remote system <b>120</b> to access the Internet resource referenced by the URL.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Because the URL may include an identifier associated with kiosk computing device <b>110</b>, remote system <b>120</b> may, responsive to receiving the request from computing device <b>100</b> for access the Internet resource referenced by the URL, be able to identify kiosk computing device <b>110</b> or an Internet resource associated with kiosk computing device <b>110</b> based on the URL. For example, an example URL may be &#x201c;http://www.example.com/kiosk/&#x201d;. The &#x201c;www.example.com&#x201d; domain referenced by the example URL may be hosted on the remote system <b>120</b>, and the specific &#x201c;kiosk&#x201d; web page referenced by the URL may uniquely identify the kiosk computing device <b>110</b> to the remote system. In some examples, other identifiers that uniquely identify the kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may be embedded within the URL in any other suitable fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Responsive to kiosk computing device <b>110</b> receiving a selection of digital item <b>122</b>, kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may send to remote system <b>120</b> the identity of digital item <b>122</b>. In some examples, remote system <b>120</b> may query kiosk computing device <b>100</b> for the identity of digital item <b>122</b>, and kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may, in response, send identity of the digital item <b>122</b> to remote system <b>120</b>. In some examples, remote system <b>120</b> may contain a database of kiosk-digital item associations, and remote system <b>120</b> may be able to identify digital item <b>122</b> by querying the database based on the identity of kiosk computing device <b>110</b>. In some examples, kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may send the digital item <b>122</b> to the remote system <b>120</b>. In other examples, kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may send a redirection pointer to remote system <b>120</b> that redirects to digital item <b>122</b> in remote system <b>120</b>, and remote system <b>120</b> may insert the redirection pointer into the Internet resource referenced by the URL included in kiosk identifier <b>130</b>, so that computing device <b>100</b> may be redirected to digital item <b>122</b> if computing device <b>100</b> accesses the Internet resource referenced by the URL.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After determining digital item <b>122</b> associated with the selection received by kiosk computing device <b>110</b>, remote system <b>120</b> may allow the computing device <b>100</b> access to digital item <b>122</b>. In some non-limiting examples, remote system <b>120</b> may send a request for payment information to purchase or rent digital item <b>122</b> to computing device <b>100</b> and may grant computing device <b>100</b> access to the digital item only after receiving and verifying the payment information. A user may enter the payment information directly into computing device <b>100</b>, which may be more secure than the user entering payment information into kiosk computing device <b>110</b> for the reasons previously discussed above. A user may also have payment information already stored on computing device <b>100</b> and the user may be able to send the stored payment information to remote system <b>120</b> without needing to re-enter payment information.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some examples, receiving, by computing device <b>100</b>, access to digital item <b>122</b> may include receiving the contents of digital item <b>122</b>. In some examples, receiving, by the computing device <b>100</b>, access to the digital item <b>122</b> may include receiving a token, such as a URL, that references the digital item. The computing device <b>100</b> may be able to access the digital item <b>122</b> by accessing the Internet resource associated with the URL.

Device identifier <b>130</b> may include instructions for communicating with kiosk computing device <b>110</b>. The instructions, in some examples, may be embedded within an URL included in device identifier <b>130</b>. Responsive to computing device <b>100</b> receiving device identifier <b>130</b> from tag device <b>114</b> via first communication pathway <b>116</b>, computing device <b>100</b> may contact kiosk computing device <b>110</b> based at least in part on device identifier <b>130</b> to receive access to digital item <b>122</b> directly from kiosk computing device <b>110</b> via kiosk communication pathway <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Computing device <b>100</b> may be able to determine whether to receive access to digital item <b>122</b> from kiosk computing device <b>110</b> or remote system <b>120</b> if both choices are available to computing device <b>100</b>. For example, remote communication pathway <b>117</b> may be a wide area network (WAN) wireless connection (such as a cellular data connection), and kiosk communication pathway <b>119</b> may be a local area network (LAN) wireless connection (such as a Wi-Fi connection). In this case, because the LAN wireless connection may support higher bandwidth transfers than the WAN wireless connection, computing device <b>100</b> may decide to receive access to digital item <b>122</b> via kiosk communication pathway <b>119</b> from kiosk computing device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some examples, the bandwidth of computing device <b>100</b>'s network connections may affect how computing device <b>100</b> accesses digital item <b>122</b>. For example, if computing device <b>100</b> is receiving access to digital item <b>122</b> via a higher bandwidth connection (such as via a LAN), computing device <b>100</b> may receive the entire contents of digital item <b>122</b>. In contrast, if computing device <b>100</b> is instead receiving access to digital item <b>122</b> via a lower bandwidth connection (such as via a WAN), computing device <b>100</b> may only receive a URL that references digital item <b>122</b>, so that computing device <b>100</b> may be able to access the URL at a later time to access digital item <b>122</b> if computing device <b>100</b> is on a higher bandwidth connection.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some examples, kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may serve as a virtual bookshelf system for a bookstore cloud service, such as provided by remote system <b>120</b>.

Tag device <b>114</b> associated with kiosk computing device <b>110</b> may be situated on or near an area besides the presence-sensitive display. Responsive to scanning tag device <b>114</b>, computing device <b>100</b> may receive from tag device <b>114</b> device identifier <b>130</b> including a URL that references the bookstore cloud service.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4D</figref> are conceptual diagrams illustrating an example technique for communicating digital items according to aspects of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, kiosk computing device <b>410</b>, similar to kiosk computing device <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, may include kiosk user interface device <b>412</b>. Kiosk user interface device <b>412</b> of kiosk computing device <b>410</b> may, in some examples, be a presence-sensitive screen/display. Kiosk user interface device <b>412</b> may display a plurality of digital items and may receive input from a user <b>450</b> selecting digital item <b>422</b> out of the plurality of digital items displayed at kiosk user interface device <b>412</b>. The user interface displayed at kiosk user interface device <b>412</b> may be divided into a one or more zones <b>404</b>A-N (hereafter &#x201c;zones <b>404</b>&#x201d;). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, each representation of a bookshelf in the user interface may denote a zone in zones <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Kiosk computing device <b>410</b> may include one or more tag devices <b>414</b>A-<b>414</b>N (hereafter &#x201c;tag devices <b>414</b>&#x201d;) where each tag device in tag devices <b>414</b> may be associated with a zone in zone <b>404</b>. For example, tag device <b>414</b>A may be associated with zone <b>404</b>A and tag device <b>414</b>B may be associated with zone <b>404</b>B. Tag devices <b>414</b>, similar to tag device <b>114</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, may be a short-range wireless communication device, such as an NFC device, an RFID device, a Bluetooth device. In some examples, tag devices <b>414</b> may be a passive short-range wireless communication device, such as an NFC tag, that is able to transmit static information but is not able to transmit dynamic information to or to receive any information from a short-range wireless communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, in response to receiving a selection of digital item <b>422</b> from user <b>450</b>, kiosk user interface device <b>412</b> may display a detailed view of the selected digital item <b>422</b> and may display a prompt for user to download the digital item to user <b>450</b>'s computing device <b>400</b> (e.g., the user's mobile phone). In some examples, kiosk user interface device <b>412</b> may also display options that, if selected, may display the table of contents, or may allow user <b>450</b> to interact with kiosk user interface device <b>412</b> to preview a portion of the contents of digital item <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Because digital item <b>422</b> is located in zone <b>404</b>A, computing device <b>400</b> may receive device identifier <b>430</b> that uniquely identifies kiosk computing device <b>410</b> and zone <b>404</b>A by being tapped or bumped against the corresponding tag device <b>414</b>A associated with zone <b>404</b>A, or by being placed within a specified short-range vicinity of the corresponding tag device <b>414</b>A associated with zone <b>404</b>A, to communicate with tag device <b>414</b> via short-range wireless communication, such as NFC. In response to short-range wireless communication being established between computing device <b>400</b> and tag device <b>414</b>A, tag device <b>404</b>A may send device identifier <b>430</b> to computing device <b>400</b>. Because tag device <b>414</b> may be a passive tag device, device identifier <b>1430</b> may be static data that does not change and does not include an indication as to the selected digital item. In some examples, device identifier <b>430</b> may be a URL that points to an Internet resource associated with zone <b>404</b>A of kiosk <b>410</b>, such as &#x201c;www.example.com/kioskl/zonel/&#x201d;, which may uniquely identify zone <b>404</b>A of kiosk computing device <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Because tag device <b>414</b> may be a passive tag device that may potentially be unable to dynamically update data stored within it, tag device <b>414</b> may potentially not receive any indication of the digital item that was selected. Thus, in response to receiving the selection of digital item <b>422</b> in zone <b>404</b>A, kiosk computing device <b>410</b> may modify the contents of the Internet resource referenced by the URL in device identifier <b>430</b> to include the contents of digital item <b>422</b>. For example, if digital item <b>422</b> comprises the novel &#x201c;A Tale of Two Cities&#x201d; and if the URL in the device identifier comprises &#x201c;www.example.com/kioskl/zonel/&#x201d;, kiosk computing device <b>410</b> may modify the Internet resource referenced by that URL, or cause that internet resource to be modified, so that it includes the contents of the novel &#x201c;A Tale of Two Cities.&#x201d; Alternatively, kiosk computing device <b>410</b> may insert a redirection pointer into the Internet resource referenced by the URL in device identifier <b>430</b> to redirect from the Internet resource to the digital item <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The Internet resource referenced by device identifier <b>430</b> may be stored in remote system <b>420</b> that is remote to computing device <b>400</b> and kiosk computing device <b>410</b>, or may be stored in kiosk computing device <b>410</b>. If the Internet resource is stored in remote system <b>420</b>, then kiosk computing device <b>410</b> may communicate an indication of the selected digital item <b>422</b> to remote system <b>420</b>, such that remote system <b>420</b> may modify the Internet resource to include the contents of digital item <b>422</b>. For example, if remote system <b>420</b> stores digital items offered at kiosk computing device <b>410</b>, including digital item <b>422</b>, then, in response to receiving the indication of the selected digital item <b>422</b>, remote system <b>420</b> may select digital item <b>422</b> out of the digital items stored in remote system <b>420</b> based on the indication and may modify the Internet resource to include the contents of digital item <b>422</b>. Alternatively, if remote system <b>420</b> does not already store the selected digital item <b>422</b>, the indication sent from kiosk computing device <b>110</b> to remote system <b>420</b> may include contents of digital item <b>422</b>. In response to receiving the contents of digital item <b>422</b>, remote system <b>420</b> may modify the Internet resource to include the contents of digital item <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">If the Internet resource is stored in kiosk computing device <b>410</b>, such as if kiosk computing device <b>410</b> includes a web server, kiosk computing device <b>410</b> may update the Internet resource to include the contents of digital item <b>422</b> in response to receiving a selection of digital item <b>422</b> from user <b>450</b>. In response to receiving device identifier <b>430</b> from tag device <b>414</b>A, computing device <b>400</b> may display prompt <b>426</b> at display <b>402</b> that, if selected, enables computing device <b>400</b> to request access to the Internet resource referenced in device identifier <b>430</b>. In some examples, in response to receiving device identifier <b>430</b> from tag device <b>414</b>A, computing device <b>400</b> may automatically, and without user intervention, request access to the Internet resource referenced in device identifier <b>430</b>.</p>
