<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to apparatus for producing terahertz (THz) radiation. More specifically, the present invention relates to a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based reverse magnetron apparatus for producing THz radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Most current sources of THz radiation are either very dim (e.g. nonlinear down conversion of optical lasers generate typically nanowatt (nW) outputs), very inefficient, or both (e.g. far infrared lasers have a power output in the THz region of few milliwatts (mW) but efficiencies of about 0.01%). Such conventional THz radiation sources are described in P. H. Siegal, &#x201c;THz Technology: An Overview&#x201d;, <i>International Journal of High Speed Electronics and Systems</i>, Vol. 13, No. 2 (2003), which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Quantum cascade lasers can be as bright as 50 mW, but they require cryogenic cooling. Unfortunately, other apparatus capable of generating intense sources of THz radiation are uniformly bulky and difficult to transport (e.g. free electron laser and synchrotron radiation sources).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Magnetrons have featured prominently in the production of intense microwave radiation, as described in, for example, Victor L. Granatstein and Igor Alexeff, ed., <i>High Power Microwave Sources</i>, Boston: Artech, 1987, herein incorporated by reference. While the external configurations of different conventional magnetrons vary, the basic internal structures are generally the same&#x2014;these include a central filament/cathode, an outside anode cylinder concentric to the cathode, an antenna, and magnets. The motion of electrons is due to the combined influence of cross electric (radial) and magnetic (axial) fields. In this case, the radiation frequency is near to the cyclotron frequency and amplification is achieved as the whirling cloud of electrons, influenced by the high voltage and the strong magnetic field, forms a rotating pattern that resembles the spokes in a spinning wheel and interacts with an alternating current flow in the resonant cavities configured at the inner surface of the anode. In order to achieve radiation frequencies in the THz region, unrealistically large magnetic fields, of several Tesla, are required.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 7,274,147, issued to Shim et al., describes a MEMS-based apparatus, using a miniaturized magnetron and claims to generate THz radiation. In Shim et al. an anode block concentrically surrounds a cathode unit and the electrons spiral outward. The large magnetic field requirements for operation of this device in the THz region make this apparatus impractical.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with one embodiment, a terahertz (THz) reverse micromagnetron includes: a cathode ring having a central void; and an anode post centrally located within the central void of the cathode ring, wherein application of an applied voltage between the cathode ring and the anode post causes field-emitted electrons to be accelerated radially inwards producing radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with another embodiment, a THz reverse micromagnetron chip includes a plurality of terahertz (THz) reverse micromagnetrons, each THz reverse micromagnetron including: a cathode ring having a central void; and an anode post centrally located within the central void of the cathode ring, wherein application of an applied voltage between the cathode ring and the anode post causes field-emitted electrons to be accelerated radially inwards producing radiation. In one embodiment, the chip has a width of about 1 cm and a length of about 1 cm and includes several hundred of the THz reverse micromagnetrons. In one embodiment, the chip includes a conductive substrate electrically connecting each anode post of the plurality of THz reverse micromagnetrons. In one embodiment, the chip includes a void centrally located on the chip. In one embodiment, this void has an area of at least 1/9 of a total surface area of the chip.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with a further embodiment, a terahertz (THz) reverse micromagnetron assembly includes: a chip mount, the chip mount adapted to mount a chip; a chip mounted on the chip mount, the chip including: a plurality of terahertz (THz) reverse micromagnetrons, each THz reverse micromagnetron including: a cathode ring having a central void; and an anode post centrally located within the central void of the cathode ring wherein the chip has a void centrally located on the chip; a a magnet assembly having a first pole and a second pole arranged in a push-pull configuration, wherein each of the first pole and the second pole has a central void, and wherein the chip mount is positioned between the first pole and the second pole of the magnet assembly; a first reflecting mirror and a second reflecting mirror, wherein the first reflecting mirror and the second reflecting mirror form a confocal cavity having a confocal point, further wherein the chip is positioned in the confocal plane of the confocal cavity; and wherein application of an applied voltage between the cathode ring and the anode post causes field-emitted electrons to be accelerated radially inwards producing radiation.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Broadly viewed, embodiments in accordance with the terahertz (THz) reverse micromagnetron include a centrally located anode surrounded by a cathode ring, herein termed a &#x201c;reverse-magnetron&#x201d; configuration. When power is applied, electrons move radially inward in the combined electric and magnetic cross-fields and can reach orbiting angular frequencies in the THz region, even with a magnetic field of the order of 1 T or less. The terahertz reverse micromagnetron is portable, operates at room temperature, and can be bright. It has applicability in imaging and other applications where intense sources of radiation are needed, such as in the areas of improvised explosive device (IED) detection, airport security, imaging for medical, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor applications, and spectroscopy for large chem-bio molecules.</p>

In one embodiment, THz reverse micromagnetron <b>10</b> can be formed as a microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based device as further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a single terahertz reverse micromagnetron <b>26</b> in accordance with one embodiment. In one embodiment, THz reverse micromagnetron <b>26</b> includes anode post <b>12</b> centrally located within the void formed by cathode ring <b>14</b>. In the present embodiment, the interior wall of cathode ring <b>14</b> includes scalloping <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, anode post <b>12</b> is conductively connected to a conductive substrate <b>18</b> and is electrically insulated from cathode ring <b>14</b> by a first insulating layer <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, a conductive bonding material <b>22</b> is disposed between cathode ring <b>14</b> and insulating layer <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, conductive bonding material <b>22</b> is a few microns thick and the thickness of anode post <b>12</b> and cathode ring <b>14</b> is about 100 &#x3bc;m. In one embodiment, terahertz reverse micromagnetron <b>26</b> further includes a top substrate <b>24</b> that hermetically seals the THz reverse micromagnetron <b>26</b> for vacuum packaging. In one embodiment, a second insulating layer <b>20</b> is disposed between top substrate <b>24</b> and the underlying structures. In one embodiment, first insulating layer <b>20</b> and second insulating layer <b>20</b> can be formed of the same material. In some embodiments, first insulating layer <b>20</b> and second insulating layer <b>20</b> can be formed of different materials.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In various embodiments, the dimensions of cathode ring <b>14</b> can vary according to the radiation frequency. In embodiment, the diameter of cathode ring <b>14</b> is at or about 100 &#x3bc;m and the diameter of anode post <b>12</b> is at or about 10 &#x3bc;m. Herein the diameter of cathode ring <b>14</b> refers to the diameter of the void within which anode post <b>12</b> is located. Herein the diameter of anode post <b>12</b> is the outer diameter of anode post <b>12</b>. An applied voltage between cathode ring <b>14</b> and anode post <b>12</b> can yield field-emitted electrons which, in turn, can be accelerated radially inwards. Scalloping <b>16</b>, formed on the inside surface of cathode ring <b>14</b>, can facilitate generation of the field-emitted electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a graph showing the electric characterization of the terahertz reverse micromagnetron of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> in the absence of a magnetic field in accordance with one embodiment. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows an electric characterization (I-V curve) with no external magnetic field. The nonzero electric current is due to field-emitted electrons arriving at the anode. In the presence of an axial magnetic field, the field-emitted electrons spiral into cathode ring <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the radiation output can be enhanced by utilizing an array of THz reverse micromagnetrons. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a schematic view of a chip <b>28</b> containing a plurality of terahertz reverse micromagnetrons <b>26</b> in accordance with one embodiment. In one embodiment, chip <b>28</b> is a 1 cm&#xd7;1 cm chip and includes a plurality of THz reverse micromagnetrons <b>26</b>, illustrated as the grid lined portion of chip <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 3A</figref> together, in one embodiment, conductive substrate <b>18</b> serves as a common electric plane for all anode posts <b>12</b> of the plurality of THz reverse micromagnetrons <b>26</b>, providing a larger surface for heat load management at anode posts <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, a central void <b>32</b> is centrally formed in chip <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, central void <b>32</b> has an area of at least 1/9 of the total surface area of chip <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, a strip perimeter <b>30</b> around the outer edge of chip <b>28</b> can contain electrodes (not shown) that electrically connect to cathode rings <b>14</b> of each THz reverse micromagnetrons <b>26</b>, to conductive substrate <b>18</b>, or both. In one embodiment, the electrodes are suitable for current loads at or about 5 amps.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a close-up view of a portion of anode posts <b>12</b> and cathode rings <b>14</b> on chip <b>28</b> in accordance with one embodiment. In one embodiment, cathode rings <b>14</b> are all electrically interconnected, and anode posts <b>12</b> and cathode rings <b>14</b> are electrically isolated by insulating layer <b>20</b>. As further discussed in greater detail below, a substantial power enhancement can be achieved by positioning chip <b>28</b> in a large confocal cavity with all THZ reverse micromagnetrons <b>26</b> coupled electromagnetically through cavity mirrors.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view of a THz reverse micromagnetron assembly <b>40</b> including a chip <b>28</b> having a plurality of the terahertz reverse micromagnetrons <b>26</b> positioned in a confocal cavity in accordance with one embodiment. In one embodiment, a confocal cavity <b>46</b> is formed between two reflecting mirrors, a first mirror <b>48</b>A and a second mirror <b>48</b>B. In one embodiment, one of the two mirrors <b>48</b>A or <b>48</b>B has high reflectance, while the other has finite transmittance.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4</figref> together, in one embodiment, chip <b>28</b> is mounted on a chip mount <b>44</b> at the focal plane of confocal cavity <b>46</b>. In one embodiment, chip mount <b>44</b> is positioned between two poles of a magnet assembly <b>42</b> in a push-pull configuration. In this push-pull configuration magnet assembly <b>42</b> provides the appropriate uniform magnetic field in the region of chip <b>28</b>. As illustrated, each pole of magnet assembly <b>42</b> has a centrally located void. More particularly, a first pole and a second pole of magnet assembly <b>42</b> each have a centrally located void.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, a through-hole is formed by the central voids in the two poles of magnet assembly <b>42</b> and central void <b>32</b> in chip <b>28</b>. This through-hole allows radiation to bounce back and forth in confocal cavity <b>46</b> between first mirror <b>48</b>A and second mirror <b>48</b>B. In this embodiment, electromagnetic coupling among all THz reverse micromagnetrons <b>26</b> of chip <b>28</b> can be established, encouraging coherent radiation among all the THz reverse micromagnetrons <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment THz reverse micromagnetron assembly <b>40</b> has a Q of at least 100,000 and a magnetic field of at most 1 T. In one embodiment, because the size of each THz reverse magnetron apparatus <b>26</b> is less than 200 &#x3bc;m, i.e., less than a wavelength of THz light, there exists the possibility of intrinsically coherent radiation due to the natural spatial bunching of the electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the theoretical DC power requirements for THz reverse micromagnetron assembly <b>40</b> ranges from about 15 W to about 100 W. With the confocal cavity configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the range of Q values (at 1 THz) is from 10<sup>6 </sup>to 10<sup>7</sup>. Because there can be several hundred THz reverse micromagnetrons <b>26</b> in chip <b>28</b>, and if all couple through a feedback mechanism, then there will be a substantial power enhancement. Thus, even assuming a 1% efficiency, the THz power can be from about 150 mW to about 1 W. This is in contrast to conventional quantum cascade lasers in the THz which yield a maximum of about 20 mW and which need to be cooled at liquid He temperatures, with efficiencies of the order of 0.01%.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, an external solenoid can be utilized to provide frequency tunability of THz reverse micromagnetron assembly <b>40</b>. In a further embodiment, a cell containing a liquid (e.g., benzene) can be inserted, whereby metastable rotational states with transition frequencies in the THz can be excited, acting as an amplifier.</p>

Those of skill in the art can understand that embodiments in accordance with the invention can also be scaled up or down in size to accommodate various applications.
