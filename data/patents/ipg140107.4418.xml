<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0011">According to the present invention, there is provided a mobile telecommunications network including a plurality of nodes, each serving one or more cells, and a network core, wherein a plurality of mobile telecommunications devices are registered with the network and communicate with the network core via ones of the nodes, wherein a plurality of relays, each serving a cell, are provided between at least one of said nodes and at least one of said telecommunications devices to extend the radio coverage provided by the said node, wherein one of said relays comprises a joining relay which is operable to connect to said node via another of said relays, the network including means for analysing characteristics of a path between the joining relay and the network core and for selectively changing the path to facilitate optimisation of the path between the joining relay and the network core.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0012">The said node may be an eNodeB.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0013">In a first embodiment the said node includes the analysing means. The analysing means is operable to receive neighbour cell information from the joining relay.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Overview of SAE/LTE Network</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows schematically the logical elements of a SAE/LTE cellular telecommunications network. Mobile terminal (UE) <b>1</b> is registered with mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b>. The mobile terminal <b>1</b> may be a handheld mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop or desktop personal computer&#x2014;for example, equipped with a wireless datacard. The device <b>1</b> communicates wirelessly with the mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b> via the radio access network (RAN) of the mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b> over radio interface <b>2</b>. The RAN comprises an eNodeB <b>5</b>. An eNodeB <b>5</b> performs functions generally similar to those performed by the nodeB and the radio network controller (RNC) of a 3G network. In practice there will be a multiplicity of eNodeBs <b>5</b>, each serving a particular area or &#x201c;cells&#x201d;. Each eNode B is coupled to an antenna device. The eNode B and antenna device form a cell site. The cell site provides radio coverage to a plurality of cells, e.g. three. Typically, the cell site will only provide radio coverage for a portion of each of the cells. Other portions of each of the cells are provided with radio coverage and by other cell sites.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0034">Signalling in a mobile telecommunications network can be considered to be separated into &#x201c;control plane&#x201d; signalling and &#x201c;user plane signalling&#x201d;. The control plane performs the required signalling, and includes the relevant application protocol and signalling bearer, for transporting the application protocol messages. Among other things, the application protocol is used for setting up the radio access bearer and the radio network layer. The user plane transmits data traffic and includes data streams and data bearers for the data streams. The data streams are characterised by one or more frame protocols specific for a particular interface. Generally speaking, the user plane carries data for use by a receiving terminal&#x2014;such as data that allow a voice or picture to be reproduced&#x2014;and the control plane controls how data are transmitted. A Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN-GW) terminates the user plane within the core <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0035">A PDP (packet data protocol) context defines parameters that support the flow of data traffic to and from a mobile terminal. Among the parameters that are set are the identifier of the external packet data network with which the terminal wishes to communicate, a PDP address recognised in that network (for example, the IP address allocated to the mobile terminal), the address of the network gateway, quality of service (QoS) parameters etc.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0036">A mobility management entity (MME) <b>7</b> provides equivalent functions to the control plane functions of the SGSN and GGSN from the 3G architecture (Release-6). The MME handles security key management. The MME also provides control plane function for mobility between LTE and GSM/UMTS networks. Communications between the eNodeB <b>5</b> are transmitted to the MME <b>7</b> via the S1-c Interface <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0037">A user plane entity (UPE) <b>9</b> handles the user plane traffic functions from the terminal <b>1</b> which includes the IP header and payload compression and ciphering. This UPE <b>9</b> provides the equivalent functions to the user plane part of the 3G RNC and the user plane part of the 3G GGSN. Communications between the eNodeB <b>5</b> are transmitted to the UPE <b>7</b> via the S1-u Interface <b>6</b>. The known 3GPP authentication procedure may be re-used in the SAE/LTE architecture shown, between the terminal <b>1</b>/UE and the MME <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0038">It should be noted that, although in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the MME <b>7</b> and UPE <b>9</b> are shown as separate logical entities they may exist as a single physical node of the telecommunications network in gateway aGW <b>8</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0040">Although only one mobile terminal <b>1</b> is shown, there will in practice be a multiplicity of mobile terminals, each of which is registered with the network core <b>3</b>. Each mobile terminal (including mobile terminal <b>1</b>) is provided with a respective subscriber identity module (SIM) <b>15</b>. During the manufacturing process of each SIM, authentication information is stored thereon under the control of the mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b>. The mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b> itself stores details of each of the SIMs issued under its control. In operation of the mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b>, a terminal <b>1</b> is authenticated (for example, when the user activates the terminal in the network with a view to making or receiving calls) by the network sending a challenge to the terminal <b>1</b>, incorporating a SIM <b>15</b>, in response to which the SIM <b>15</b> calculates a reply and a key (dependent on the predetermined information held on the SIM&#x2014;typically an authentication algorithm and a unique key Ki) and transmits the reply back to the mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b>. The mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b> includes a Home Subscriber Server (HSS) <b>17</b> which has an authentication processor which generates the challenge. Using information pre-stored concerning the content of the relevant SIM <b>15</b>, the authentication processor calculates the expected value of the reply from the mobile terminal <b>1</b> and the key. The authentication processor sends the challenge, reply and key to the MME <b>7</b>. The MME <b>7</b> sends the challenge to the mobile terminal <b>1</b>. If the reply received by MME <b>7</b> matches the expected calculated reply, the SIM <b>15</b> and the associated mobile terminal <b>1</b> are considered to be authenticated. After the authentication process has been completed, the SIM <b>15</b> and MME <b>7</b> share a cipher key which can be used to protect subsequent communications. Integrity keys are generated and derived alongside the cipher keys. The integrity keys are used to integrity protect each of the secured links. The ciphering keys for each of the secured links are passed to the eNodeB <b>5</b>, MME <b>7</b> and UPE <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0041">It should be understood that such an authentication process can be performed for any terminal provided with a SIM <b>15</b> under control of the mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b>. Although the terminal <b>1</b> may communicate wirelessly with the mobile telecommunications network core <b>3</b> via the network's radio access network, this is not essential. For example, the terminal may communicate with the network via the fixed telephone network (PSTN), via a UMA access point, via WLAN and/or via the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0042">If a USIM is used the authentication process is enhanced to provide the capability for the terminal to authenticate the network and to have assurance about the freshness of the key established as a result of the authentication process. In addition authentication using a USIM can generally be used to establish longer keys than if a SIM were used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0043">The SIM may also be a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0044">Mobile telecommunications networks have an active state of communication with their mobile terminals and an inactive/idle state of communication with their terminals. When in the active state, as the mobile terminals move between different cells of the network, the communication session is maintained by performing a &#x201c;handover&#x201d; operation between the cells. In the inactive/idle state, as a mobile terminal moves between different cells of the network the mobile terminal performs &#x201c;cell reselection&#x201d; to select the most appropriate cell on which to &#x201c;camp&#x201d; in order that the mobile terminal can be paged by the network when mobile terminating data is destined for that mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">Conventionally, the mobile terminal or network determines whether a handover/cell reselection procedure should be triggered in dependence upon measurements of the radio signals of the cells in the region of the mobile terminal. A filter is applied to the signals (either by the network or by the mobile terminal) which calculates an average (e.g. arithmetical mean) value of these signals over a particular time period. This filtered/average values of the cells are then compared with each other or with a threshold value. In dependence upon these comparisons, cell reselection/handover related procedures are triggered. This cell reselection/handover process generally comprises taking radio signal measurements of neighbouring cells and comparing these to each other and to the radio signal of the current cell to determine which cell provides the best signal strength/quality. Handover/reselection to the best cell can then occur.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">Generally calculations to determine whether to perform a handover from one base station to another base station are performed by the network, whereas calculations whether to perform cell reselection are performed by the mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0047">Hereinafter, the term &#x201c;handover&#x201d; is used to refer to both active state and inactive/idle state transfer between cells.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows the UE-eNodeB protocol stack.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0051">The eNodeB hosts the PHYsical (PHY), Medium Access Control (MAC), Radio Link Control (RLC), and Packet Data Control Protocol (PDCP) layers that include the functionality of user-plane header-compression and encryption. The eNodeB also provides Radio Resource Control (RRC) functionality corresponding to the control plane. The eNodeB further provides many additional functions including radio resource management, admission control, scheduling, enforcement of negotiated uplink (UL) QoS, cell information broadcast, ciphering/deciphering of user and control plane data and compression/decompression of downlink (DL)/UL user plane packet headers.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0052">In the control-plane, the RRC layer in the eNodeB makes handover decisions based on neighbour cell measurements sent by the UE, pages for the UEs over the air, broadcasts system information, controls UE measurement reporting such as the periodicity of Channel Quality Information (CQI) reports and allocates cell-level temporary identifiers to active UEs. It also executes transfer of UE context from the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB during handover, and performs integrity protection of RRC messages. The RRC layer is responsible for the setting up and maintenance of radio bearers.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the radio coverage provided by cell A, cell B and cell C of an eNodeB <b>5</b>. In order to improve the coverage provided by the eNodeB <b>5</b> one or more relays may be used to provide additional cells D, E, F and G. To a UE a relay has the same &#x201c;appearance&#x201d; as a cell. However, the relay has a unique cell ID, different from the cell ID of the eNodeB <b>5</b> cell that the relay connects through, and performs unique system information transmission to the UE. Similarly, the relay &#x201c;appears&#x201d; to the eNodeB <b>5</b> as a UE.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0054">Relays connect wirelessly to other relays, eNode Bs and UEs. For example a relay may receive wirelessly downlink data from an eNode B that is destined for a particular UE. The relay then passes that downlink data to the UE. This is advantageous in the event that the UE is not in the radio coverage area of the eNode B. The relay enables the UE to receive data even when the UE is not in the radio coverage area of the eNode B. Similarly, a relay enables uplink data to be transmitted from a UE to an eNode B.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0055">To facilitate connection to an eNode B and a UE, a relay is provided with a SIM that is registered with the network of the eNode B and UE.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0056">One or more relays may be provided in the communication path between the UE <b>1</b> and the eNodeB <b>5</b> (relays <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The relay <b>20</b> closest to the UE <b>1</b> in the communication path is a &#x201c;controlling relay&#x201d;. Advantageously, the number of relays in the communication path between a UE <b>1</b> and an eNodeB <b>5</b> is scaleable. The design of a relay is the same when it is connected directly to the eNodeB <b>5</b> and when it is connected to another relay in the communication path between the eNodeB <b>5</b> and the UE <b>1</b>. The relays are arranged in a tree structure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0057">Advantageously, the present embodiments seek to preserve the security conventionally provided between the UE and the eNodeB. The security architecture can be split into:

        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0059">(2) the UE security architecture, which is the adaptation of the existing LTE security architecture for use in the relays by extending the UE security architecture over the secure connection between the eNodeBs and controlling-relay.</li>

</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the UE-eNodeB control interfaces. The RRC <b>30</b>, including its ciphering and integrity protection, runs between the UE and the controlling relay. The RRC signalling for the UE, such as handover messaging, is tunnelled between the controlling relay <b>20</b> and the Multimedia Resource Control Function (MRCF) in the eNodeB <b>5</b> using a new protocol, referred to hereinafter as 3RC protocol <b>32</b>. The 3RC protocol passes UE specific signalling directly from the controlling relay <b>20</b> to the eNodeB <b>5</b> where it can be routed to the correct destination, either along the S2 interface or S1 interface. The 3RC protocol is also used by the eNodeB <b>5</b> to configure the controlling relay <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0065">The intermediary <b>22</b> relay in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> only performs the routing of the RLC packets between the eNodeB <b>5</b> in the controlling relay <b>20</b>. The PDCP frames are ciphered between the eNodeB <b>5</b> and the controlling relay <b>20</b>. This uses the ciphering key defined for the controlling relay's user plane. The 3RC protocol may include a MAC field for integrity protection.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0066">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the security between the UE <b>1</b> and the controlling relay <b>20</b> is the same as the security between the UE <b>1</b> and the eNodeB <b>5</b>. The embodiment provides the 3RC protocol between the controlling relay <b>20</b> and the eNodeB <b>5</b> to facilitate tunnelling of RRC signalling between the controlling relay <b>20</b> and the eNodeB <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0067">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> only the RRC layer is modified compared to the conventional protocol stack. The PDCP, RLC, MAC and PHY layers are the same, and operate in the same way, as if the eNodeB <b>5</b> communicated directly with the UE <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the relay transport protocol. A Relay Transport Control (RTC) protocol <b>34</b> is provided to establish transport links between a relay and its parent node (eNodeB <b>5</b>), and to remove the transport links when they are no longer required. The protocol uses some aspects of RRC, particularly with respect to the initial access procedure, which initiates the connection of the relay to its parent. The RTC protocol is also used to pass batched buffer status reporting to the next hop node if required, such that the radio resources can be targeted to the link where it is most needed due to challenging radio conditions and/or greater demand. The link is ciphered and integrity protected using the keys defined for the RRC of the relay, and runs from the relay to its parent node.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0069">The multi-hop Relay system introduces new challenges compared to a single-hop relay system particularly with respect to the route/connectivity selection.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0070">With a single-hop Relay system, the Relay can determine which cell in the vicinity provides the best coverage, and the Relay will use this cell for connectivity to the appropriate eNodeB of the Operator network. The process that this Relay uses to determine the correct cell is similar to the process that a UE would use to determine the best cell, as is well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0071">However with a multi-hop Relay system, the Relay route through which the Relay connects to the Operators network is not purely determined by the quality of the link between the Relay and its Controlling node, it also needs to take into account the link quality and load of the links between the Controlling node and their Parent eNodeB, as well as the interference to neighbouring cells.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the issue faced in introducing a new Relay into the Relay System to provide coverage to the area highlighted by the dashed circle <b>40</b>. When the new (joining) Relay supporting &#x201c;Cell G&#x201d; is introduced into the system to provide coverage infill at the position shown by the dashed box <b>42</b>, there is reasonable coverage from Cell E, Cell B, Cell C and Cell F for the position of the joining relay. The embodiments to be described are concerned with providing a Relay with connectivity to an eNodeB.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0073">To understand the invention it is first useful to appreciate the initial connectivity of a joining relay into the relay system.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0074">With reference to the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref>, <b>8</b>B and <b>8</b>C the joining Relay (in Flow 1) determines the best route to the eNode B <b>5</b> of the network to maximize the total system throughput as follows: &#x2014;</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0075">1) When the joining Relay is powered up (step A), the joining Relay scans for cells on the Carrier Frequency or Frequencies which the joining Relay has been pre-configured to use (step B), and builds a list of possible cells. Each cell may be served by an eNode B or another relay. The joining Relay ranks the cells (step C) according to radio quality. The best cell is ranked &#x201c;1&#x201d; and is considered first by setting this variable a to &#x201c;1&#x201d; (step D). The joining relay then determines if that cell is suitable, by the suitability criteria that the cell broadcasts.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0076">2) The joining Relay analyses the System Information of the cell and determines whether the flag &#x201c;Relay Access Allowed&#x201d; is &#x201c;True&#x201d; or &#x201c;False&#x201d; (step E):
<ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0077">a. The &#x201c;Relay Access Allowed&#x201d; flag is generally set to &#x201c;True&#x201d; for: (i) an eNodeB which has the necessary functionality to support Relays; (ii) Tier-n Relays if n&#x3c;maxRelayTiers (where maxRelayTiers is the maximum number of hops allowed in the system by the standard or the operator)&#x2014;i.e. the number of relays between the relay to which the joining relay will connect and the eNodeB is less than a predetermined maximum value; and (iii) a Relay that has been told (by the eNodeB or O&#x26;M/SON&#x2014;(Operations &#x26; Maintenance) Self-Optimising Network&#x2014;Server) that it has sufficient link quality to support Child Relays.</li>
        <li id="ul0007-0002" num="0078">b. Also the joining Relay may indicate whether it is the end Relay (a relay with no child relays), or whether it is a higher tier relay, as this gives the eNode B an indication of how much bandwidth would be needed. Alternatively the joining Relay can indicate explicitly how much bandwidth is needed.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0079">If cell a does not have the &#x201c;Relay Access Allowed&#x201d; flag set to true, and there are further cells to consider (step F), the value of a is incremental (step G) and the next ranked cell is considered by repeating step E. Step E (and step F and G) are repeated until a suitable cell is found on the lowest ranked cell has been considered (a=x).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0080">Note: for all below solutions the cell of the joining Relay is not in service, i.e. it is not being transmitted at this time.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0081">In a first embodiment of the invention (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</figref>, <b>8</b>B and <b>8</b>C) centralised route control is used:</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0082">A-3) The joining Relay selects the cell which has the best radio quality, and that has the &#x201c;Relay Access Allowed&#x201d; flag set to &#x201c;True&#x201d; (as described in steps A to G above); and then Attaches to the network to acquire network connectivity (step H):

        <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0083">a. The joining Relay (in a similar manner to a UE) performs the Initial Access procedure to its Parent Node (eNode B), and then sends the ATTACH message (of the NAS Control Protocol) to the MME. The joining Relay in this case would not include an APN (Access Point Name) or any other special information. The subscription stored in the HSS associated with the SIM contained in the joining Relay would be configured with either the APN or with an IP address associated with a PDN-GW which is connected to the Management Network of the Operator. The PDN GW selected would have particular properties for handling relay nodes, e.g. with optimised connection to Device management server and/or the ability to use the ID of the cell the Relay is using on the eNodeB to select the correct device management server. Interactions between the PDN-GW and network servers can occur, e.g. using RADIUS and/or Diameter protocols and the Cell ID can then be passed from the PDN-GW to the network server to permit connection to and/or selection of the correct Network Management Server.</li>
        <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0084">b. In the Initial UE message which is carrying the Attach message the eNodeB includes the Cell ID of the cell which the joining Relay is connecting through on the eNodeB, and in addition it may also include the Cell ID of the Intermediary Relays. The Cell ID information is passed to the HSS when the subscription information is retrieved. The O&#x26;M server, SON server or OMA DM server can then query the HSS for the Cell ID of the parent cell of the joining Relay to determine which configuration information to load on the joining Relay. Additionally a change in the Cell ID of an Intermediary Relay can be used to determine whether the joining Relay has been moved around the network.</li>
        <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0085">c. The joining Relay is allocated a Default SAE Bearer which only has connectivity to the Management Network of the operator. The joining Relay can either use DHCP to request an IP address, with the DCHP Response including the IP address of the SON/O&#x26;M Server to be used to retrieve the configuration; or the joining Relay is allocated an IP address as part of the Attach process. The joining Relay needs to be configured with the FQDN of the configuration server to be used for the device configuration&#x2014;this may be an O&#x26;M server, SON server or OMA DM server.</li>

<p id="p-0070" num="0094">A-5) The CM function analyses the Measurements provided by the joining Relay (information elements i to vi above). The CM Function determines which of the CGIs received in the Measurements belong to other Relays, and which are directly controlled by eNodeBs. For the measurements of other Relays, the CM Function looks up in its RRM Database (a database of historical information about the link quality/budget for that Relay to its Controlling eNodeB) for each Relay listed by the joining Relay, which takes into account any Intermediary Relays (and the quantity). The CM Function then equates this link quality/budget of that Controlling Relay to a Penalty Offset which is applied to the Downlink Signal Strength/quality measurements provided by the eNodeB. The CM function then, using this information, selects through which Relay or eNodeB the joining Relay should connect (step K).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0095">A-6) The CM Function responds to the joining Relay, informing the joining Relay which cell the joining Relay should connect through (step L).</p>

Once attached to the network the joining Relay reconnects to the CM Function and provides updated connectivity and measurement report information (step P), which the CM Function stored in the RRM Database.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0098">In a second embodiment of the invention (Flow 2) system information based route control is used, which will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0099">As in the first embodiment, when the joining Relay is powered up (step A), the joining Relay scans for cells on the Carrier Frequency or Frequencies which the joining Relay has been pre-configured to use (step B). The first cell is considered by setting variable a to &#x201c;1&#x201d; (step C). The joining relay then determines if the cell is suitable, by the suitability criteria that the cell broadcasts. The joining relay checks whether the &#x201c;Relay Access Allowed&#x201d; flag is true for the cell (step D).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0100">B-3) On the system information of each cell which has the &#x201c;Relay Access Allowed&#x201d; flag set to &#x201c;True&#x201d;, a new field is included which indicates the backhaul link quality between that cell and the eNodeB&#x2014;the field provides two new parameters both coded in dBm (step E), and provides figures for a handicap that should be applied to the measured signal quality and measured Signal Strength of that cell (step F). The joining Relay also reads the system information to find the output power of the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0101">B-4) The joining Relay measures the signal quality (step G) and signal strength (step H) of each of the cells which allow Relay Access, and:

</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0105">As step L it is determined whether there are further cells to consider; if there are (i.e. if a&#x3c;x), the value of a is incremental at step M, and steps E to M are repeater for the next cell. This continues until all cells have been considered.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0106">B-5) The joining Relay camps on the highest ranked cell, and attaches (step N) to the network to acquire network connectivity, in a similar manner to (A-3) above. The joining relay connects to the CM function (step O) and sends neighbour cell information to the CM function (step P) in a similar manner to (A-4) above.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0107">B-6) The CM Function signals in step Q to the Intermediary Relays to modify their handicap they transmit in their System Information, based on the measurements the joining Relay has provided in step P, and the assumed load the new Relay will introduce into the Relay system.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0108">In a third embodiment of the invention (Flow 3) handover based route control is used, and will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0109">C-3) The joining Relay uses the normal cell selection rules defined for a UE, and filters based on whether &#x201c;Relay Access is Allowed&#x201d; is step to &#x201c;time&#x201d;. For example, steps A to G of flow <b>1</b> are performed. When the joining Relay is powered up (step A), the joining Relay scans for cells on the Carrier Frequency or Frequencies which the joining Relay has been pre-configured to use (step B), and builds a list of possible cells. The joining Relay ranks the cells (step C). The best cell is ranked &#x201c;1&#x201d; and is considered first by setting this variable a to &#x201c;1&#x201d; (step D). The joining relay then determines if the cell is suitable, by the suitability criteria that the cell broadcasts. The joining Relay analyses the System Information of the cell and determines whether the flag &#x201c;Relay Access Allowed&#x201d; is &#x201c;True&#x201d; or &#x201c;False&#x201d; (step E). If cell a does not have the flag set to true, and there are further cells to consider (step F), the value of a is incremental (step G) and the next ranked cell is considered by repeating step E. Step E (and step F and G) are repeated until a suitable cell is found on the lowest ranked cell has been considered (a=x). The joining Relay accesses the best cell where &#x201c;Relay Access is Allowed&#x201d; and performs the Attach procedure (step H).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0110">C-4) The joining Relay generates measurement reports for its Controlling Relay (in step I) (as in A-4 above) but the measurement reports are sent to the Relay to which the joining relay connects (that is, the joining relay's controlling relay) and are not sent to the CM-Function). The controlling relay then contacts the CM Function located in the eNodeB and passes this information to the CM function (step J).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0111">C-5) When the Controlling Relay is provided with a response from the CM Function (step K), it may trigger a handover of this Relay to one of the other Relays, or eNodeBs in the list of measured cells. The Handover is performed as though this Relay was just another UE (step L). The Handover messaging between the Controlling Relay and the new Controlling Relay includes an indication that the incoming handover is for a Relay.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0112">It should be noted that this last embodiment avoids the Relay having to re-initialise the Access Security.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0113">The present invention also addresses the optimisation of relay connections into the relay system in a fourth embodiment now described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A to 11D</figref>. To appreciate this one must first consider basic reconnection technique.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0114">Once the Relay is connected into the Relay System it is assumed that in the known First Release proposal that there will be no mobility for the Relay whilst it is providing connectivity for UEs, as this would require a complicated mechanism to handover multiple UEs between cells. The present embodiment provides a mechanism to move the UEs off a Relay such that the Relay can again be re-connected into the Relay system in the best manner for system efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0115">The CM Function is Responsible for the determining when a Relay Connectivity Route needs to be modified (step A). The CM Function starts by triggering disconnection of the Relays furthest from the eNodeB on any branch that needs to be re-organised (step B); so when the CM Function triggers a Relay to re-connect in a different position in the tree (step C), it should have no child Relays connected to it, only UEs.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0116">The CM Function informs the Relay of the Re-connection, and the Relay starts to offload the UEs that are connected through this Relay by triggering their individual handover to neighbouring cells. A new indication is included in the Handover message between the network entities such that the handover statistics for use in future handovers are not affected.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0117">The CM Function only triggers one Relay at a time to Re-connect, and therefore minimises the ping-pong of UEs between Cells.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0118">When the Relay has emptied itself of UEs and it then slowly powers down the common pilot symbols of the cell (step D).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, if the selected cell is different from the current cell (step E), the joining Relay performs the standard network detach procedure and is released from the network (step F)&#x2014;as in A7 above. The joining Relay reselects to the cell which was specified by the CM Function and performs the Attach procedure (step G). Once attached to the network the joining Relay reconnects to the CM Function and provides updated connectivity and measurement report information (step H), which the CM Function stored in the RRM Database&#x2014;as in A8 above.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0120">In a variation of the fourth embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11C and 11D</figref>, steps A to D are performed as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>, the Relay generates measurement reports for its Controlling Relay (in step E) (as in C-4 above) and the measurement reports are sent to the controlling Relay. The controlling relay contacts the CM Function located in the eNodeB and passes this information to the CM function (step F)&#x2014;as in C-4 above. When the Controlling Relay is provided with a response from the CM Function (step G), it may trigger a handover of this Relay to one of the other Relays, or eNodeBs in the list of measured cells. The Handover is performed as though this Relay was just another UE (step H). The Handover messaging between the Controlling Relay and the new Controlling Relay includes an indication that the incoming handover is for a Relay&#x2014;as in C-5 above.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0121">Note: If a handover based route control solution is adopted, the need for Relay having to re-initialise the Access Security is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> outlines an approach to the provision of optimised reconnection. When the CM Function decides that the route by which a Relay <b>20</b> connects to the eNodeB <b>5</b> needs to be changed, it informs the Controlling Relay <b>22</b> (or Controlling eNodeB) of that Relay <b>20</b> that a change of routeing is required. The CM Function informs the Controlling node <b>22</b>A of the target cell <b>50</b> for handover of the Relay <b>20</b>. The Controlling node <b>22</b> initiates the Handover procedure for that Relay to the target node <b>22</b>A. The Handover Required message is sent from controlling node <b>22</b> to target node <b>22</b>A includes information on number and identity of the supported Child Relays and UEs <b>52</b> of the Relay <b>20</b> being relocated, and provides an indication of the usage characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0123">The Target Controlling Node <b>22</b>A creates the necessary resources available for the Relay <b>20</b> that is being relocated, requests the necessary transport resources from its Parent Node eNode B <b>5</b> (which in turn triggers its parent node&#x2014;if there is one&#x2014;to ensure transport resources are available). The Target Controlling Node <b>22</b>A creates a Handover Command message indicating the resource allocation to use on the target cell <b>50</b>, and a mapping of resources to child UEs <b>52</b> and child Relays (depending on the Transport design of the link).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0124">From the above example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, before the Handover Command message can be sent by Cell E <b>50</b> to Cell F, Cell E needs to contact Cell B to request the establishment of the necessary Transport Resources for the incoming UEs <b>52</b> and Relays (i.e. similar to the lines between Cell C and Cell F).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0125">The UEs <b>52</b> are not informed of the movement of a parent Relay <b>20</b> to a new position in the Relay System tree.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0126">When the Relay <b>20</b> has been successfully Relocated, the Resources allocated by Cell C for the UEs <b>52</b> and the Relays <b>20</b> that have been moved can be released.</p>
