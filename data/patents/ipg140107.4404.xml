<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A coexistence central entity CCE receives deployment messages from each of a plurality of N access nodes. Each deployment message has an identifier of an access node of the plurality and an identifier of a channel in a license-exempt band. From the received deployment messages the CCE compiles and maintains a database which associates each channel with a multicast group. Each multicast group includes all of the access nodes from which was received at least one deployment message identifying a said channel corresponding thereto. When the CCE receives a multicast message from one of the access nodes identifying a given channel, it checks the database to find members of a multicast group associated with the given channel, and notifies at least some of those members of the received multicast message. In this manner the access node's multicast message is forwarded among the whole group.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One approach to preventing congestion of cellular core networks due to the ever-increasing volume of wireless data and number of wireless users is to off-load some wireless traffic to non-cellular networks such as a WLAN, whose access points provide access to the Internet. However, such traffic off-load and anticipated gains from spectrum efficiency improvement is not expected to fully offset predicted data traffic increases. As a result, in addition to the more costly licensed spectrum there is discussion, among radio network operators and manufacturers of user handsets and network equipment, of utilizing license-exempt portions of the radio spectrum for wireless traffic. Such license-exempt spectrum is also termed the shared band or bands, and for example include the ISM band and the TV WS which the FCC in the United States is considering for this use.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In practice, such shared bands may be coordinated by the licensed spectrum systems, or they may be used by a stand-alone cell such as a LTE-A femto cell which provides fast access to the Internet in a similar manner to the WLAN specifications at IEEE 802.11. The advantage of a LTE-A femto cell over the traditional WLAN is the improved spectrum efficiency in LTE-A, realized through such concepts as LTE's flexibility in managing the deployment bandwidth, the number of utilized carriers, and even its flexible reconfiguration of center frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The extension of LTE-A onto the shared band as well as certain problems that are anticipated for such an extension are discussed in a paper by M-A. Phan, H. Wiemann and J. Sachs of Ericsson Research entitled Flexible Spectrum Usage-How LTE Can Meet Future Capacity Demands [ITG FG 5.2.4 workshop, Jul. 8, 2008], and also in a summary of research by Rui Yang of InterDigital Communications LLC entitled Overview of Research Projects with NYU-Poly [Nov. 12, 2010].</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One such problem is how to enable co-existence of multiple APs/BSs which deploy into the shared band by efficiently managing the potential interference therebetween. This interference problem exists regardless of whether different APs/BSs are operating on the same or different RATs since it is interference on the shared band which is the concern.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One conventional RAT-independent approach to manage such interference on the TV WS is to use a so-called a coexistence manager (CM), whose architecture is set forth by IEEE 802.19 Task group 1 and shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The CM is a function which operates on top of the radio access technologies. It has interfaces to other coexistence manager entities/servers. With the help of the CM, different RATs can negotiate the spectrum utilization between each other or submit to the control of a CM which locally governs the spectrum utilization for the shared spectrum.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">The term access node is used in the description below to be RAT independent, and includes an eNodeB of a LTE-A system, an access point AP of a WLAN system, a NodeB of a UTRAN system, a micro or femto access node, and the access nodes of other RATs. The access node provides wireless connectivity for one or more user devices to access a broader network such as the Internet or a publicly switched telephone network. In some RATs the access node may be embodied as a user device which takes on the function of providing access to other user devices, such as an AP-station in WLAN. Relay stations, remote radio heads, and other variations of a BS are also encompassed by the term access node.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">An environment in which embodiments of the invention may be practiced with advantage is shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This exemplary arrangement includes three different access nodes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, which may be operating according to a similar RAT or according to two or more different types of RATs (e.g., LTE-A and WLAN). While each access node may be providing connectivity to one or user devices, for clarity of illustration such user devices or UEs <b>20</b> are shown only for access node <b>22</b>. Each access node has a communication link with a co-existence central entity CCE <b>28</b> which may be embodied as a CM (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and IEEE 802.19.1) or as a SBD-SN, to name just two possibilities. In other embodiments one of the access nodes or a higher level network node (such as a mobility management entity or serving gateway of an LTE-A system) may serve this CCE function. These links between access nodes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and the CCE <b>28</b> may be direct or may pass through other entities such as intermediary servers, and these links may be wired (including optical), wireless, or some combination of both. The following description provides details of communication between the first access node <b>22</b> and the second access node <b>24</b> with their respective UEs on the shared band, in such a way as to avoid causing interference to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">It is assumed that the first access node <b>22</b> selects a channel on a shared band. The first access node <b>22</b> then sends to the CCE <b>28</b> what is termed herein deployment information or a deployment message. In various exemplary embodiments the CCE <b>28</b> may be a CM as in IEEE 802.19.1 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or a network entity/server which takes on the functions of a SBD-SN. The deployment information which the first access node <b>22</b> sends in its deployment message includes the key parameters for its intended use of the shared band, such as for example the channel and the transmission power. This deployment message will also include an identifier of the first access node <b>22</b> which is sending the deployment message. So for example if the first access node <b>22</b> is a LTE eNodeB the node identifier may be its cell ID, whereas if the first access node <b>22</b> is a WLAN AP the node identifier may be its SSID. Other types of IDs may be used for access nodes operating in other types of RATs.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">The identifier for the access node may be in the body of the deployment message itself. Or in an embodiment in which the communication link over which the deployment message passes from the first access node <b>22</b> to the CCE <b>28</b> uses an Internet protocol, the identifier may be in the message header as the sender address. In this case the identifier may be the first access node's web-based uniform resource locator/uniform resource identifier (URL/URI), and at least the first access node <b>22</b> would be pre-registered to the CCE <b>28</b> which has stored in its memory the cell ID or SSID which corresponds to that same first access node's URL/URI.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">The deployment message may identify the channel in the shared band by a channel index, such as where there is a database of TV WS (or other shared band spectrum) similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which the various access nodes might consult to see which channels on the shared bandwidth might be less prone to interference. Alternatively the deployment message may identify the channel as a frequency band, such as center frequency and bandwidth or simply a frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">Irrespective of how the access node identifier and the channel identification is indicated in the deployment message, the CCE <b>28</b> receives multiple ones of these deployment messages from multiple access nodes, and possibly any given access node may send multiple deployment messages for different channels in the shared band. In a general case it can be assumed that there is an integer number N of access nodes, and a finite number of channels in the shared band (which for the case the channels are indexed there may then be an integer number I of channels greater than one). In this arrangement the CCE <b>28</b> may receive one or more deployment messages from each of that plurality of N access nodes, each deployment message including an identifier of the n<sup>th </sup>access node from which it originated and an identifier of an i<sup>th </sup>channel in the shared band. These deployment messages may carry further information but the CCE <b>28</b> will use these two distinct pieces of information to build its database.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">From all of these deployment messages which the CCE <b>28</b> receives, it assembles a database which associates each different i<sup>th </sup>channel with a multicast group, which is termed herein an i<sup>th </sup>multicast group since each i<sup>th </sup>channel has but one associated group. The members of any given multicast group include all of the access nodes from which the CCE <b>28</b> has received at least one deployment message with the identifier of the i<sup>th </sup>channel. The CCE <b>28</b> maintains the database by dropping from various multicast groups those access nodes whose deployment message for the relevant i<sup>th </sup>channel is outdated. In one embodiment a given i<sup>th </sup>channel becomes outdated when a specific end-time specified within the deployment message for use of that channel has passed. In another embodiment a given i<sup>th </sup>channel becomes outdated when the CCE <b>28</b> receives from the access node a dissociation message. A third embodiment is a combination of the two: normally the channel becomes outdated due to the dissociation message, but if either a time in the deployment message itself or some default time period elapses without the CCE <b>28</b> receiving a dissociation message for that channel, the CCE <b>28</b> renders the relevant channel outdated by default. In this way the CCE <b>28</b> creates and maintains the multicast group based on the occupied channels on the shared band.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">This is shown in the signaling diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which uses similar reference numbers for the three access nodes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> as does <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as well as for the CCE <b>28</b>. The three access nodes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may alternatively be termed CCE-PEs as listed at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the description above as well as that related to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> below, N is used to designate a plurality of access nodes. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, X as well as Y are used to designate two different channels in the shared band.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">The first access node <b>22</b> selects channel X in the shared band for use with its UEs <b>20</b> and sends a deployment message <b>302</b> to the CCE <b>28</b> identifying channel X and itself. At block <b>304</b> the CCE <b>304</b> sees that there is no pre-existing multicast group for channel X and so the CCE <b>28</b> creates one, with the first access node <b>22</b> as its only member. Then the CCE <b>28</b> receives another deployment message <b>306</b> which also identifies channel X and which further identifies the second access node <b>24</b>. The CCE <b>28</b> receives a third deployment message <b>308</b> identifying channel X and the third access node <b>26</b>. From these two additional messages <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> the CCE <b>28</b> adds at block <b>310</b> to the existing multicast group for channel X two new members, the second and third access nodes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0031">The first access node <b>22</b> subsequently sends another deployment message <b>312</b> identifying itself as well as channel X and channel Y, both in the shared band (this may be because the first access node <b>22</b> wants to use frequency-adjacent channels at the same time). Alternatively this deployment message <b>312</b> may identify a center frequency and bandwidth which happens to span at least portions of both channel X and channel Y. Upon receiving this deployment message <b>312</b> the CCE <b>28</b> consults its database and sees that the first access node <b>22</b> is already a member of the multicast group associated with channel X and so does nothing further for that multicast group. The CCE <b>28</b> further sees that there is no pre-existing multicast group for channel Y and so it creates one, with the first access node <b>22</b> as its only member.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0032">Assuming these four deployment messages are the only ones received by the CCE <b>28</b>, then the content of the database is as follows (in which the database utilizes at least the RAT-specific identifier for the various access node members):</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0034">The remaining steps and messages shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> relates to the distribution of information concerning use of the shared band channel(s) by an access node. More specifically, the first access node <b>22</b> sends a multicast message <b>316</b> to the CCE <b>28</b>. This message <b>316</b> is not multicast directly by the first access node <b>22</b> which originally created and sent it, but only later by the CCE <b>28</b>. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> embodiment this original multicast message is addressed to channel X. At block <b>318</b> the CCE <b>24</b> enters the database with channel X from the multicast message <b>316</b>, reads the identifiers of all members of the multicast group associated with channel X, and forwards the first access node's multicast message to all members of that multicast group at messages <b>316</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>316</b>-<b>2</b>. In another embodiment the multicast message <b>316</b> is forwarded <b>316</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>316</b>-<b>2</b> to all members of the corresponding multicast group except the access node member from which the multicast message <b>316</b> was originally received, or only to members which are within a certain geographic proximity to the sending first access node <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0035">Different addressing systems are possible for the frequency channel-to-multicast address mapping performed by the CCE <b>28</b> at block <b>318</b>, depending on which types of addresses the CCE <b>28</b> is using in its database. In one embodiment this mapping (which obtains the addresses for the forwarded multicast messages <b>316</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>316</b>-<b>2</b>) are IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and/or Ethernet MAC addresses. In another embodiment this mapping uses RAT-specific addresses to which are sent the forwarded multicast messages <b>316</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>316</b>-<b>2</b>, such as radio network temporary identifiers RNTIs for the LTE system. The database may have different address types for different access nodes, and so in one implementation one or more of the forwarded multicast messages <b>316</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>316</b>-<b>2</b> may be addressed to an IPv4/IPv6 address while other addressees of the same forwarded multicast messages <b>316</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>316</b>-<b>2</b> may be RNTIs.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0036">In one implementation, all of the messages shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> are sent on the channel which they identify: messages <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>316</b>, <b>316</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>316</b>-<b>2</b> are sent on channel X; and message <b>312</b> may be two distinct messages of which one is sent on channel X and the other is sent on channel Y or it may be one message sent near the center frequency of both those (adjacent) channels. In another implementation the deployment messages are communicated to the CCE <b>28</b> over a control link which is not on the shared band (e.g., a wired Internet connection or control link passing through higher network nodes such as a mobility management entity) but the multicast messages are transmitted on the channel to which they are respectively addressed, which in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> example is channel X for multicast message <b>316</b>. For implementations in which the different access nodes are operating on different RATs they may not have the capability to communicate with one another wirelessly, in which case the deployment messages <b>302</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, <b>312</b> as well as the multicast messages <b>316</b>, <b>316</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>316</b>-<b>2</b> are for example sent on wired digital subscriber line DSL connections to each access node or for the case the CCE <b>28</b> is multi-RAT capable a wireless backhaul connection for each access node (which for robustness are preferably not on the shared band channels).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0037">Each of these options offers two advantages. First, apart from identifying an appropriate channel in the shared band (which might involve consulting a TV WS database or similar as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), no access node needs to monitor any shared band channel until it sends its own deployment message identifying that shared band. Second, no access node needs to blind detect on that shared channel to find out if other access nodes are using it since they are able to read the forwarded multicast message <b>319</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>319</b>-<b>2</b> which is addressed to their RAT-specific ID (or other unique ID).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0038">In this manner any access node occupying a certain channel in the shared band may communicate with other systems/access nodes on that specific channel by indicating the channel number (such as a TV channel, which implicitly maps to a certain part of the shared band spectrum), or by indicating a center frequency and bandwidth (which might be considered to be a carrier spanning over multiple TV channels or a virtual channel on the shared spectrum). The CCE <b>28</b> receives the multicast message <b>316</b> from an access node <b>22</b> which is addressed to a specific channel (X) or frequency in the shared spectrum. The CCE <b>28</b> has a mapping entity which records the channel utilization by different access nodes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and creates an address table for each channel so it can create a multicast message <b>316</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>316</b>-<b>2</b> addressed to the correct recipient access nodes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0039">The access node <b>22</b> which occupies a channel (X) on the shared spectrum can transmit higher layer messages <b>316</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>316</b>-<b>2</b> in a multicast manner, via message <b>316</b> and the CCE <b>28</b>, to other access points <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> occupying the same channel (X) by using the channel number as an address reference for the CCE <b>28</b> to utilize in accessing its database. Upon receiving the multicast message <b>316</b> from an access node <b>22</b> the CCE <b>28</b> checks the channel number and generates the multicast message which it forwards to the access node addresses which are associated in the database with the channel number reference.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0040">In another embodiment, the CCE <b>28</b> constructs the database as detailed above for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but when distributing at <b>316</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>316</b>-<b>2</b> the multicast message <b>316</b> it received from the first access node <b>22</b> it restricts those to whom it sends the re-transmission to those access nodes which lie within a pre-determined geographic proximity to the access node <b>22</b> from which the multicast message <b>316</b> was received. This more limited re-transmission of the multicast message may also exclude the access node <b>22</b> from which the CCE <b>28</b> originally received the multicast message <b>316</b>. The CCE <b>28</b> may filter the multicast group for this purpose based on geographic location information which the individual access nodes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> provide (and which the CCE <b>28</b> also stores in its database). In this manner the CCE <b>28</b> restricts its channel multicast message forwarding to only a certain geographic area rather than to all members of the multicast group regardless of the minimal interference potential from more remote nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">By means of the embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the multicast groups based on the channel occupancy can be used for interference coordination and management between different access nodes. When considering a scenario in which access nodes on the same shared-band channel are uncoordinated with one another (such as femto cells), such uncoordinated access nodes can exchange information via multicasting to the specific channel utilizing the distribution procedure at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but in this case the information which is included in the multicast message <b>316</b> may be for forming neighbor relations among the different uncoordinated femto cells in the vicinity.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">Embodiments of the invention as described by example above, and particularly the channel-specific multicast groupings, provide the technical effect of enabling an efficient communication mechanism among frequency-coexisting access nodes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and possibly even different RAT systems on the same shared band radio resources. It is the CCE <b>28</b> which coordinates this efficient communication mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> above is a logic flow diagram which describes an exemplary embodiment of the invention from the perspective of the CCE <b>28</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represents steps executed by a computer program or an implementing algorithm stored in the local memory of the CCE <b>28</b>, as well as illustrating the operation of a method and a specific manner in which the CCE <b>28</b> (or one or more components thereof) are configured to cause that CCE/electronic device to operate. The various blocks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may also be considered as a plurality of coupled logic circuit elements constructed to carry out the associated function(s), or specific result of strings of computer program code stored in a memory.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">Such blocks and the functions they represent are non-limiting examples, and may be practiced in various components such as integrated circuit chips and modules, and that the exemplary embodiments of this invention may be realized in an apparatus that is embodied as an integrated circuit. The integrated circuit, or circuits, may comprise circuitry (as well as possibly firmware) for embodying at least one or more of a data processor or data processors, a digital signal processor or processors, baseband circuitry and radio frequency circuitry that are configurable so as to operate in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">Blocks <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> relate to building of the database from multiple deployment messages that are received by the CCE <b>28</b>, and block <b>406</b> relates to distribution of a given multicast message which the CCE also receives. At block <b>402</b> the CCE <b>28</b> receives deployment messages from each of a plurality of N access nodes, each deployment message comprising at least an identifier of a given access node of the plurality and an identifier of a channel of a plurality of channels in a license-exempt band (N is an integer greater than one). Note that there may be more than N access nodes cooperating through the one CCE <b>28</b>, but in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> example only N of them are currently participating. Then at block <b>404</b>, the CCE compiles and maintains a database from the received deployment messages: the database associates each channel with a corresponding multicast group, and each multicast group comprises at least all of the access nodes from which was received at least one deployment message identifying a said channel corresponding thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">Information distribution at block <b>406</b> finds the CCE <b>28</b>, in response to receiving a multicast message from one of the access nodes (e.g., first access node <b>22</b>) identifying a given channel, taking two distinct steps: utilizing the database to determine members of the multicast group associated with the given channel (which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> include access nodes <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>); and notifying at least some of the determined members of the multicast group corresponding to the received multicast message. Block <b>406</b> is optional in that there are other ways to utilize the created database.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">As detailed for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the compiled database of block <b>402</b> comprises an address table for the identifier of each channel. The CCE <b>28</b> utilizes the database to determine members of a given multicast group at block <b>406</b> by accessing the database on the basis of the channel to which the received multicast message is addressed. The members of the relevant multicast group are identified in the database itself by at least identifiers of a type specific to a RAT in which the respective member operates (e.g., RNTI for LTE, SSID for WLAN).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048">Further portions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are directed towards specific implementations and embodiments which are also optional. Assuming the information distribution from block <b>406</b>, then at block <b>408</b> the members of the multicast group which are notified at block <b>406</b> are only those members which are within a pre-determined geographic proximity to the access node (<b>22</b>) from which the multicast message was received. As noted above it may be inefficient to include the sender of the multicast message in the multicast forwarding of that same message, so in parentheses at block <b>408</b> the access node (<b>22</b>) from which the multicast message itself was originally received is excluded from the notifying.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0049">Block <b>410</b> indicates that the notifying of block <b>406</b> is via message forwarding, mentioned above. Forwarding is not the only way to distribute this information; the CCE <b>28</b> may re-cast the received multicast message into a new format so that what is distributed is not an exact copy of what was received with only addressees changed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0050">At block <b>412</b> the multicast message received on the channel identified at step <b>406</b> is forwarded to the members whose identifiers obtained from the database. As detailed above those addresses from the database may be RAT-specific and/or IPv4/IPv6 and/or ethernet MAC addresses.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for illustrating a simplified block diagram of various electronic devices and apparatus that are suitable for use in practicing the exemplary embodiments of this invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> a first access node <b>22</b> is adapted for communication over a wireless link C with a mobile apparatus, such as a mobile terminal or UE <b>20</b>. The first access node <b>22</b> may be a macro eNodeB, a WLAN AP, a femto eNodeB, or other type of BS or AP.</p>

The first access node <b>22</b> stores this radio resource deployment information <b>22</b>G concerning the license-exempt band in its local MEM <b>22</b>B so as to avoid interfering with other access nodes for which the first access node <b>22</b> has received a forwarded multicast message as detailed above.</p>

While not particularly illustrated for the UE <b>20</b> or first access node <b>22</b> or second access node <b>24</b>, those devices are also assumed to include as part of their wireless communicating means a modem which may be inbuilt on a radiofrequency RF front end chip within those devices <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and which chip also carries the TX <b>20</b>D/<b>22</b>D/<b>24</b>D and the RX <b>20</b>E/<b>22</b>E/<b>24</b>E. The CCE <b>28</b> also has stored in its local memory at <b>28</b>G the database which it constructs and maintains as detailed above and listing the multicast group members corresponding to each channel in the shared band.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">The second access node <b>24</b> includes its own processing means such as at least one data processor (DP) <b>24</b>A, storing means such as at least one computer-readable memory (MEM) <b>24</b>B storing at least one computer program (PROG) <b>24</b>C, and communicating means such as a transmitter TX <b>24</b>D and a receiver RX <b>24</b>E for bidirectional wireless communications with other UEs under its control via one or more antennas <b>24</b>F.

The second access node <b>24</b> stores at <b>24</b>G in its local MEM <b>24</b>B messages and shared band deployment information similar to those described above for the first access node <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">At least one of the PROGs <b>28</b>C in the CCE <b>28</b> is assumed to include program instructions that, when executed by the associated DP <b>28</b>A, enable the device to operate in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of this invention, as detailed above.
