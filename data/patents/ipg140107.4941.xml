<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">A developer unit such as a binary ink developer (BID) unit is a consumable that is often used in a printing apparatus such as a liquid electrophotographic (LEP) printing apparatus. This consumable is generally made from custom and/or off-the-shelf components. In LEP printing apparatus, generally a photosensitive drum is charged and is then selectively exposed to a laser to form a charge pattern that corresponds to an image. The drum is then contacted with a BID unit that selectively transfers a liquid ink pattern to the charge pattern. The liquid ink pattern is transferred from the photosensitive drum to a print medium, for example, through an intermediate member, to form the image on the print medium.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">During the life of a development unit such as a binary ink developer (BID) unit there are many occurrences when the BID unit is stopped, for example, between print jobs. During such occurrences a developer roller of the BID unit may sustain damage to a portion thereof exposed to extended contact with adjacent components resulting in potential mechanical, chemical and electrical damage to the developer roller. Further, a developer roller may have a portion thereof exposed to a stable environment inside the developer unit and another portion thereof exposed to a different environment outside of the developer unit when the developer roller, for example, is not rotating and is not engaged with a photosensitive drum. Thus, the portion exposed to the outside environment may be subjected to damage caused by polymer conductivity and polymer surface properties. The damage to the developer roller may result in banding which negatively impacts print quality.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified view of developer units disposed in a liquid electrophotographic (LEP) printing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present general inventive concept. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the LEP printing apparatus <b>100</b> includes a light source <b>102</b>, a photosensitive drum <b>104</b>, charge units <b>110</b>, an intermediate transfer member <b>108</b> and an impression drum <b>114</b>. Also, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are developer units <b>210</b> removeably mounted in the LEP printing apparatus <b>100</b> opposite the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> may include a photo imaging plate (PIP) foil having a cylindrical photoconductive material made of selenium, a selenium compound, an organic photoconductor or any other suitable photoconductor known to one of ordinary skill in the art disposed around a drum core. The charge units <b>110</b> may be any type of charge unit known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as a scorotron or a charge roller. The intermediate transfer member <b>108</b> may include a roller having a cylindrical blanket disposed around a drum core.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the intermediate transfer member <b>108</b> may be disposed between and in contact with the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> and the impression drum <b>114</b>. The charge units <b>110</b> and the developer units <b>210</b> may be circumferentially arranged proximate to the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>. The developer units <b>210</b> may selectively engage the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> as is old and well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The developer units <b>210</b> may be, for example, binary ink development units (BID). In the present embodiment, each BID unit <b>210</b> may include ink such as liquid toner, and contain a different color ink. For example, the six BID units <b>210</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may contain a total of six different color inks.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an exemplary embodiment, in operation, the LEP printing apparatus <b>100</b> may produce a print on a substrate <b>102</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as follows. The photosensitive drum <b>104</b> is charged by the charge units <b>110</b>. As the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> is rotated, the light source <b>102</b> such as a laser produces a laser beam that discharges specific areas on the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>. These discharged areas define a latent image. One BID unit <b>210</b>, for example, selectively engages the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> and applies the ink thereto during each rotation of the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present embodiment, the BID unit <b>210</b> includes a developer roller <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) which, for example, may be charged to a lower potential than the charged areas on the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>, and a larger potential than the discharged areas on the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>. Charged ink in the BID unit <b>210</b> is attracted to the discharged areas on the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> and not transferred to areas of the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> having higher potential than the developer roller <b>214</b>. Thus, as the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> is rotated, a color plane of the image is formed on the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>. With each additional rotation of the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>, for example, the laser discharges specific areas on the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> and another BID unit <b>210</b> selectively engages the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> and applies ink to the discharged areas. In this manner, a developed image is formed on the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>. The charging of the developer roller <b>214</b>, the photosensitive drum <b>104</b>, and the ink is old and well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Also, the arrows inside each roller indicate the exemplary rotational direction of the respective rollers. It is envisioned that the rollers may rotate in other suitable directions.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present embodiment, the developed image is transferred from the photosensitive drum <b>104</b> to the intermediate transfer member <b>108</b>. The transfer of the developed image is achieved, for example, through predominantly electrical and/or mechanical forces. The intermediate transfer member <b>108</b> may be charged and heated to raise a temperature of the ink, for example, to drive off carrier fluid and melt ink for fixing on the substrate <b>102</b>. The developed image is transferred from the intermediate transfer member <b>108</b> to the substrate <b>102</b> such as a print medium passing between the intermediate transfer member <b>108</b> and the impression drum <b>114</b>.</p>
