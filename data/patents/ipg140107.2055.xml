<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to compounds having one or more stabilizer groups, such as hindered amine light stabilizer groups, and one or more mesogen groups or segments, and to compositions, such as liquid crystal compositions, and articles of manufacture, such as optical elements, containing such compounds.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The molecules of a liquid crystal tend to align with one another in substantially one direction, which results in a fluid material having anisotropic optical, electromagnetic, and mechanical properties. A mesogen is typically described as the primary or fundamental unit (or segment or group) of a liquid crystal material that induces, and/or is induced into, structural order amongst and between liquid crystals (e.g., other liquid crystal materials that are present).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Liquid crystal polymers are polymers capable of forming regions of highly ordered structure while in a liquid phase. Liquid crystal polymers have a wide range of uses, including engineering plastics, and gels for LC displays. The structure of liquid crystal polymers is typically composed of densely packed fibrous polymer chains that provide self-reinforcement almost to the melting point of the polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Dichroism can occur in liquid crystals due to the optical anisotropy of the molecular structure, or the presence of impurities, or the presence of dichroic dyes. As used herein, the term &#x201c;dichroism,&#x201d; and similar terms, such as &#x201c;dichroic&#x201d; means the ability to absorb one of two orthogonal plane polarized components of radiation (e.g., transmitted and/or reflected radiation) more strongly than the other orthogonal plane polarized component.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">Linearly polarizing elements, such as linearly polarizing lenses for sunglasses and linearly polarizing filters, are typically formed from orientated, such as unilaterally orientated, polymer sheets containing a dichroic material, such as a static dichroic dye. Consequently, conventional linearly polarizing elements are static elements having a single, linearly polarizing state. Accordingly, when a conventional linearly polarizing element is exposed to either randomly polarized radiation or reflected radiation of the appropriate wavelength, some percentage of the radiation transmitted through the element is linearly polarized. As used herein the term &#x201c;linearly polarized&#x201d; means to confine or effectively limit the vibrations of the electromagnetic vector of light waves to one direction or plane.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">In addition, conventional linearly polarizing elements are often tinted. For example, conventional linearly polarizing elements can contain a coloring agent, such as a static dichroic dye, and correspondingly have an absorption spectrum that does not vary in response to actinic radiation. The color of conventional linearly polarizing elements typically depends upon the coloring agent present in the element, and is often a neutral color (e.g., brown or gray). As such, while conventional linearly polarizing elements are useful in reducing glare associated with reflected light, they are not, however, well suited for use under certain low-light conditions, because of the static coloring agent. In addition, because conventional linearly polarizing elements have only a single, tinted linearly polarizing state, they are limited in their ability to store or display information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">As discussed above, conventional linearly polarizing elements are typically formed using sheets of orientated polymer films containing a dichroic material. Thus, while dichroic materials are capable of selectively absorbing one of two orthogonal plane polarized components of transmitted radiation, if the molecules of the dichroic material are not suitably positioned or aligned, no net linear polarization of transmitted radiation will be achieved. Due to the random positioning of the molecules of the dichroic material, selective absorption by the individual molecules will cancel each other such that no net or overall linear polarizing effect is achieved. As such, suitable positioning of the molecules of the dichroic material is typically achieved by alignment thereof with another material, which results in a net linear polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">In contrast to the dichroic elements discussed above, conventional photochromic elements, such as photochromic lenses that are formed using conventional thermally reversible photochromic materials, are generally capable of converting from a first state, for example, a &#x201c;clear state,&#x201d; to a second state, for example, a &#x201c;colored state,&#x201d; in response to exposure to actinic radiation, and then reverting back to the first state in response to, actinic radiation, such as the absence or reduction of exposure to actinic radiation, and/or thermal energy. As such, conventional photochromic elements are generally well suited for use in both low-light conditions and bright conditions. Conventional photochromic elements, however, that do not include linearly polarizing filters are generally not adapted to linearly polarize radiation. That is, the absorption ratio of conventional photochromic elements, in either state (e.g., clear state and/or colored state), is generally less than two. As used herein, the term &#x201c;absorption ratio&#x201d; refers to the ratio of absorbance of radiation linearly polarized in a first plane to the absorbance of the same wavelength radiation linearly polarized in a plane orthogonal to the first plane, in which the first plane is defined as the plane with the highest absorbance. Therefore, conventional photochromic elements are not capable of reducing glare associated with reflected light to the same extent as conventional linearly polarizing elements. To address this deficiency, photochromic-dichroic materials have been developed. Photochromic-dichroic materials provide both photochromic properties (i.e., having an absorption spectrum for at least visible radiation that varies in response to at least actinic radiation), and dichroic properties (i.e., capable of absorbing one of two orthogonal plane polarized components of at least transmitted radiation more strongly than the other).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Photochromic materials and photochromic-dichroic materials can be incorporated into a substrate or an organic material, for example a polymer substrate, including liquid crystal polymer substrates. When photochromic materials and photochromic-dichroic materials undergo a change from one state to another (e.g., from a clear state to a colored state), the molecule(s) of the photochromic compound or photochromic-dichroic compound typically undergo a conformational change from a first conformational state to a second conformational state. This conformational change can result in a change in the amount of physical space that the compound occupies. For certain photochromic materials and certain photochromic-dichroic materials, however, to effectively transition from one state to another state (e.g., to transition from a clear state to a colored state, or to transition from a colored state to a clear state, and/or to transition from a non-polarized state to a polarized state, or to transition from a polarized state to a non-polarized state) the photochromic compound or photochromic-dichroic compound typically requires a chemical environment that is sufficiently flexible to allow the compound to transition from a first conformational state to a second conformational state at a rate that is at least sufficient to provide the desired response on over an acceptable time frame. Liquid crystal polymers can provide such a sufficiently flexible environment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">Organic materials, such as polymers and/or liquid crystal polymers, typically include stabilizers, such as thermal stabilizer and/or ultraviolet light stabilizers, to limit and/or delay degradation of the organic material due to exposure to elevated temperatures and/or ultraviolet light. The presence of stabilizers in organic materials containing dichroic materials, such as photochromic-dichroic materials, can disrupt alignment of the dichroic materials, resulting in an undesirable reduction in absorption ratio values. Alternatively or additionally, when the organic material is composed of or contains liquid crystal materials, such as liquid crystal polymers, the presence of stabilizers can undesirably disrupt alignment of the liquid crystal materials. Still further alternatively or additionally, to disrupting liquid crystal alignment, the stabilizers may not be sufficiently soluble in the liquid crystal material, such as a liquid crystal polymer matrix, resulting in an undesirable reduction in clarity (e.g., an increase in haze) of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">It would be desirable to develop new stabilizers that can be used in compositions containing liquid crystal materials. In addition, it would be desirable that such newly developed stabilizers minimize or result in no disruption of liquid crystal alignment and/or have improved solubility in compositions containing liquid crystal materials. It would be further desirable that such newly developed stabilizers enhance liquid crystal alignment in compositions containing liquid crystal materials.</p>

<p id="p-0238" num="0239">To a reaction flask containing 100 milliliters (mL) of methylene chloride was added 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-4-ol (2.0 grams (g), 9.93 millimoles (mmol)), 4-(4-pentylcyclohexyl)benzoic acid (5.45 g, 19.87 mmol), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (4.30 g, 20.86 mmol), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.06 g, 0.5 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere. A white precipitate formed and was removed by filtration. Evaporation of the solvent provided a product which was purified by precipitation from methylene chloride/methanol (1/10, volume/volume) and recrystallized from ethyl acetate/methanol. White crystals (3.85 g) were recovered as the product. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) showed that the product had a structure consistent with 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-((4-(4-pentylcyclohexyl)benzoyl)oxy)-1-(2-((4-(trans-4-pentylcyclohexyl)benzoyl)oxy)ethyl)piperidine as represented by the following graphic formula.</p>

<p id="p-0261" num="0276">Coating Procedure for Photoalignment Materials</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0277">The photoalignment coating solution prepared in Part 3 was applied to the test substrates by spin-coating on a portion of the surface of the test substrate by dispensing approximately 1.0 mL of the solution and spinning the substrates at 800 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 3 seconds, followed by 1,000 rpm for 7 seconds, followed by 2500 rpm for 4 seconds. A spin processor from Laurell Technologies Corp. (WS-400B-6NPP/LITE) was used for spin coating. Afterwards, the coated substrates were placed in an oven maintained at 120&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. The coated substrates were cooled to about 26&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0278">The dried photoalignment layer on each of the substrates was at least partially ordered by exposure to linearly polarized ultraviolet radiation using a DYMAX&#xae; UVC-6 UV/conveyor system by DYMAX&#xae; Corp. having a 400 Watt power supply. The light source was oriented such that the radiation was linearly polarized in a plane perpendicular to the surface of the substrate. The amount of ultraviolet radiation that each photoalignment layer was exposed to was measured using a UV Power Puck&#x2122; High energy radiometer from EIT Inc (Serial No. 2066) and was as follows: UVA 0.126 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 5.962 J/cm<sup>2</sup>; UVB 0.017 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 0.078 J/cm<sup>2</sup>; UVC 0 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 0 J/cm<sup>2</sup>; and UVV 0.046 W/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 2.150 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. After ordering at least a portion of the photo-orientable polymer network, the substrates were cooled to about 26&#xb0; C. and kept covered.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0279">Coating Procedure for Liquid Crystal Coating Formulations</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0280">The Liquid Crystal Coating Formulations (&#x201c;LCCF&#x201d;) prepared in Part 2 were each spin coated at a rate of 400 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 6 seconds, followed by 800 rpm for 6 seconds onto the at least partially ordered photoalignment materials prepared as described above on the test substrates. Each coated substrate was placed in an oven at 60&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. Afterwards the substrates were cured under two ultraviolet lamps in the UV Curing Oven Machine designed and built by Belcan Engineering in nitrogen atmosphere while running on a conveyor belt at 2 ft/min speed at peak intensity of 0.445 Watts/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UVA and 0.179 Watts/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UW and UV dosage of 2.753 Joules/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UVA and 1.191 Joules/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UW. The cured layers were exposed to corona generated by 53.00 KV, 500 Watts while traveling on a conveyor at a belt speed 3 ft/min.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0281">Coating Procedure for Transitional Layer</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0282">The Transitional layer solution prepared in Part 4 was spin coated at a rate of 1,400 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 7 seconds onto the cured LCCF coated substrates prepared as described above. Afterwards the coated substrates were cured under two ultraviolet lamps in the UV Curing Oven Machine designed and built by Belcan Engineering in nitrogen atmosphere while running on a conveyor belt at 6 ft/min speed at peak intensity of 1.887 Watts/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UVA and 0.694 Watts/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UVV and UV dosage of 4.699 Joules/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UVA and 1.787 Joules/cm<sup>2 </sup>of UW. The cured transitional layers were exposed to corona generated by 53.00 KV, 500 Watts while traveling on a conveyor at a belt speed 3 ft/min. Post curing of the coated substrates was completed at 105&#xb0; C. for 3 hours.</p>

<p id="p-0269" num="0284">Measurement of Clearing Temperatures upon Heating and Cooling</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0285">Approximately 0.1-5 mg of a sample of each of the Example and Grey-1 Control listed in Table 2 was applied to a VWR Vista Vision&#x2122; microscope slide. A FISHERFINEST&#xae; Premium cover glass was applied to the sample. The resulting microscope slide was placed onto an INSTEC&#xae; HCS302 hot stage that was mounted on the sample stage of an OLYMPUS&#xae; BX51 polarized light microscope so that the sample spot was in the optical path of the microscope. The microscope was also equipped with an INSTEC&#xae; STC200 temperature controller, so that the temperature of the hot stage was controlled, and a DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUMENTS 11.2 Color Mosaic camera, so that the clearing temperature upon heating and cooling could be observed from a computer display. The Example and Grey-1 Control listed in Table 2 demonstrated the Nematic phase. Clearing temperatures were measured by observing the samples during heating at a rate of 1&#xb0; C./min starting at 25&#xb0; C. Cooling temperatures were observed after turning off the heat.</p>

<p id="p-0272" num="0287">Photochromic Performance Tests Including Absorption Ratio, Optical Response Measurements and Fatigue</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0288">Prior to response testing on an optical bench, the substrates were conditioned by exposing them to 365 nm ultraviolet light for 10 minutes at a distance of about 14 cm from the source in order to pre-activate the photochromic molecules. The UVA irradiance at the sample was measured with a Licor Model Li-1800 spectroradiometer and found to be 22.2 Watts per square meter. The samples were then placed under a halogen lamp (500 W, 120 V) for about 10 minutes at a distance of about 36 cm from the lamp in order to bleach, or inactivate, the photochromic compound in the samples. The illuminance at the sample was measured with the Licor spectroradiometer and found to be 21.9 Klux. The samples were then kept in a dark environment for at least 1 hour prior to testing in order to cool and continue to fade back to a ground state.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0289">An optical bench was used to measure the optical properties of the coated substrates and derive the absorption ratio and photochromic properties. Each test sample was placed on the optical bench with an activating light source (a Newport/Oriel Model 66485 300-Watt Xenon arc lamp fitted with a UNIBLITZ&#xae; VS-25 high-speed computer controlled shutter that momentarily closed during data collection so that stray light would not interfere with the data collection process, a SCHOTT&#xae; 3 mm KG-2 band-pass filter, which removed short wavelength radiation, neutral density filter(s) for intensity attenuation and a condensing lens for beam collimation) positioned at a 30&#xb0; to 35&#xb0; angle of incidence to the surface of the test sample. The arc lamp was equipped with a light intensity controller (Newport/Oriel model 68950).</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0290">A broadband light source for monitoring response measurements was positioned in a perpendicular manner to a surface of the test sample. Increased signal of shorter visible wavelengths was obtained by collecting and combining separately filtered light from a 100-Watt tungsten halogen lamp (controlled by a constant voltage powder supply) with a split-end, bifurcated fiber optical cable. Light from one side of the tungsten halogen lamp was filtered with a SCHOTT&#xae; KG1 filter to absorb heat and a HOYA&#xae; B-440 filter to allow passage of the shorter wavelengths. The other side of the light was either filtered with a SCHOTT&#xae; KG1 filter or unfiltered. The light was collected by focusing light from each side of the lamp onto a separate end of the split-end, bifurcated fiber optic cable, and subsequently combined into one light source emerging from the single end of the cable. A 4&#x2033; or 6&#x2033; light pipe was attached to the single end of the cable to insure proper mixing. The broad band light source was fitted with a UNIBLITZ&#xae; VS-25 high-speed computer controlled shutter that momentarily opened during data collection.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0291">Polarization of the light source was achieved by passing the light from the single end of the cable through a Moxtek, PROFLUX&#xae; Polarizer held in a computer driven, motorized rotation stage (Model M-061-PD from Polytech, PI or equivalent). The monitoring beam was set so that the one polarization plane (0&#xb0;) was perpendicular to the plane of the optical bench table and the second polarization plane (90&#xb0;) was parallel to the plane of the optical bench table. The samples were run in air, at 23&#xb0; C.&#xb1;0.1&#xb0; C. maintained by a temperature controlled air cell.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0292">To align each sample, a second polarizer was added to the optical path. The second polarizer was set to 90&#xb0; of the first polarizer. The sample was placed in an air cell in a self-centering holder mounted on a rotation stage. A laser beam (Coherent&#x2014;ULN 635 diode laser) was directed through the crossed polarizers and sample. The sample was rotated (in 3&#xb0; steps as coarse moves and in 0.1&#xb0; steps as fine moves) to find the minimum transmission. At this point the sample was aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the Moxtek polarizer and the second polarizer as well as the diode laser beam was removed from the optical path. The sample was aligned within &#xb1;0.5&#xb0; prior to any activation.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0293">To conduct the measurements, each test sample was exposed to 6.7 W/m<sup>2 </sup>of UVA from the activating light source for 10 to 20 minutes to activate the photochromic compound. An International Light Research Radiometer (Model IL-1700) with a detector system (Model SED033 detector, B Filter, and diffuser) was used to verify exposure at the beginning of each day. Light from the monitoring source that was polarized to the 0&#xb0; polarization plane was then passed through the coated sample and focused into a 1&#x2033; integrating sphere, which was connected to an OCEAN OPTICS' S2000 spectrophotometer or equivalent using a single function fiber optic cable. The spectral information, after passing through the sample, was collected using OCEAN OPTICS&#xae; OOIBase32 and OOIColor software, and PPG propriety software. While the photochromic material was activated, the position of the polarizing sheet was rotated back and forth to polarize the light from the monitoring light source to the 90&#xb0; polarization plane and back. Data was collected for approximately 600 to 1200 seconds at 5-second intervals during activation. For each test, rotation of the polarizers was adjusted to collect data in the following sequence of polarization planes: 0&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 90&#xb0;, 0&#xb0;, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0294">Absorption spectra were obtained and analyzed for each test sample using the Igor Pro software (available from WaveMetrics). The change in the absorbance in each polarization direction for each test sample was calculated by subtracting out the 0 time (i.e., unactivated) absorption measurement for the samples at each wavelength tested. Average absorbance values were obtained in the region of the activation profile where the photochromic response of the photochromic compound was saturated or nearly saturated (i.e., the regions where the measured absorbance did not increase or did not increase significantly over time) for each sample by averaging absorbance at each time interval in this region. The average absorbance values in a predetermined range of wavelengths corresponding &#x3bb;<sub>max-vis</sub>+/&#x2212;5 nm were extracted for the 0&#xb0; and 90&#xb0; polarizations, and the absorption ratio for each wavelength in this range was calculated by dividing the larger average absorbance by the small average absorbance. For each wavelength extracted, 5 to 100 data points were averaged. The average absorption ratio for the photochromic compound was then calculated by averaging these individual absorption ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0295">Change in optical density (&#x394;OD) from the bleached state to the darkened state was determined by establishing the initial transmittance, opening the shutter from the xenon lamp to provide ultraviolet radiation to change the test lens from the bleached state to an activated (i.e., darkened) state. Data was collected at selected intervals of time, measuring the transmittance in the activated state, and calculating the change in optical density according to the formula: A OD=log(% Tb/% Ta), where % Tb is the percent transmittance in the bleached state, % Ta is the percent transmittance in the activated state and the logarithm is to the base 10. Measurements were made at a weighted wavelength range corresponding to CIE Y, described in CIE Technical Report, Colorimetry, CIE 15:2004, 3<sup>rd </sup>Edition, published by the Commission Internationale De L'Eclairage, Vienna, Austria, which publication is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0296">The fade half life (T&#xbd;) is the time interval in seconds for the &#x394;OD of the activated form of the photochromic compounds in the test samples to reach one half the &#x394;OD measured after fifteen minutes, or after saturation or near-saturation was achieved, at room temperature after removal of the source of activating light, e.g., by closing the shutter. The &#x394;OD, fade half life and absorption ratio were all determined prior to fatigue testing.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0297">An Atlas Ci4000 Weather-Ometer&#xae; was used for conducting the simulated solar radiation accelerated weathering, i.e., fatigue. The samples were exposed for a 1 hour dark cycle and then a 65 hour light cycle using a boro/boro silicate filtered Xenon arc lamp with an output of 0.25 Watts per square meter at 340 nm. The temperature in the Atlas Ci4000 Weather-Ometer&#xae; was maintained at 45&#xb0; C. and the relative humidity was controlled at 70% humidity. The temperature of the black panel which has a thermometer connected to it and is representative of the test samples was maintained at 55&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0298">After the samples underwent this UV exposure fatigue cycle, they were preconditioned and measured on the optical bench to obtain the final &#x394;OD<sub>final </sub>under the same conditions as described for the initial testing. The percent fatigue was determined by measuring the difference between the change in optical density (&#x394;OD) of the test sample before and after accelerated weathering according to the formula: % Fatigue=(&#x394;OD<sub>init</sub>&#x2212;&#x394;OD<sub>final</sub>)/&#x394;OD<sub>init</sub>&#xd7;100.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0299">Also determined was the delta b* value. The delta b* value was the measured difference in the bleach state b* value as determined by the measured b*<sub>init </sub>on the Hunter UltraScan Pro unit prior to exposure in the Atlas Ci4000 Weather-Ometer&#xae; minus the measured b*<sub>final </sub>value on the bleached state of the lens after this UV exposure fatigue cycle of 65 hours. The delta b* represents the amount of yellowing of the lens that occurs during fatigue.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0300">The test results are reported in Table 3. A Grey-1 Control was also included. All test results were an arithmetic average of duplicate tests.</p>
