<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Security systems are common. When an alarm is detected, most security systems seize a phone line to call a central monitoring station. That is, a plain-told telephone system (&#x201c;POTS&#x201d;) call is made to alert the central monitoring station of the alarm. This POTS-based security system is very reliable, but the telephone call may require more than thirty (30) seconds to set-up. Moreover, while the phone line is seized, a customer is unable to make or receive calls to other numbers&#x2014;such as &#x201c;911.&#x201d;</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The exemplary embodiments will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. The exemplary embodiments may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. These embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the exemplary embodiments to those of ordinary skill in the art. Moreover, all statements herein reciting embodiments, as well as specific examples thereof, are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally, it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future (i.e., any elements developed that perform the same function, regardless of structure).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, for example, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the diagrams, schematics, illustrations, and the like represent conceptual views or processes illustrating the exemplary embodiments. The functions of the various elements shown in the figures may be provided through the use of dedicated hardware as well as hardware capable of executing associated software. Those of ordinary skill in the art further understand that the exemplary hardware, software, processes, methods, and/or operating systems described herein are for illustrative purposes and, thus, are not intended to be limited to any particular named manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless expressly stated otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first device could be termed a second device, and, similarly, a second device could be termed a first device without departing from the teachings of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified schematic illustrating an environment in which exemplary embodiments may be implemented. A security system <b>100</b> communicates with a central monitoring station <b>102</b> via a packet data network <b>104</b>. The security system <b>100</b> has an alarm controller <b>106</b> that receives inputs from one or more alarm sensors <b>108</b>. As those of ordinary skill in the art understand, the alarm sensors <b>108</b> monitor for heat, smoke, motion, sound, or any other physical or logical parameter that may indicate a security event. The alarm controller <b>106</b> may also interface with one or more cameras <b>110</b> that capture video data and microphones <b>112</b> that capture audio data. The cameras <b>110</b> and microphones <b>112</b> may constantly capture video and audio that is automatically stored in a local mass storage device <b>114</b> (as will be later explained).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The security system <b>100</b> may be processor-controlled. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates, the security system <b>100</b> may include a processor <b>120</b> (e.g., &#x201c;&#x3bc;P&#x201d;), application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or other component that executes a client-side security application <b>122</b> stored in a memory <b>124</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> monitors the inputs, status, or state of the alarm sensors <b>108</b>, the cameras <b>110</b>, and/or the microphones <b>112</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may also instruct any of the cameras <b>110</b> and/or the microphones <b>112</b> to capture audio and/or video data. When the client-side security application <b>122</b> detects an alarm condition <b>126</b> from one of the sensors <b>108</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> instructs the processor <b>120</b> to retrieve an IP emergency alarm address (&#x201c;IPEAA&#x201d;) <b>130</b> from the memory <b>124</b>. The IP emergency alarm address <b>130</b> is a network communications address at which the central monitoring station <b>102</b> receives packetized alarm messages from customers/subscribers of an alarm monitoring service. The IP emergency alarm address <b>130</b> may be preloaded into the memory <b>124</b>, and the IP emergency alarm address <b>130</b> may be changed after a software update to the client-side security application <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The client-side security application <b>122</b> then generates an alarm message <b>132</b>. The alarm message <b>132</b> includes data that identifies a network address associated with the security system <b>100</b> and/or the alarm controller <b>106</b>. The alarm message <b>132</b> may also include data that describes the alarm condition <b>126</b>, such as an alarm code associated with the sensor <b>108</b>. The alarm message <b>132</b> may also include information describing the customer and/or the customer's physical street address. Whatever data is included in the alarm message <b>132</b>, the data is packetized according to a packet protocol. Once the alarm message <b>132</b> is formatted and ready, the processor <b>120</b> sends the alarm message <b>132</b> to the IP emergency alarm address <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A data service monitoring center <b>134</b> continuously monitors data connectivity. When the client-side security application <b>122</b> detects the alarm condition <b>126</b>, the alarm controller <b>106</b> must reliably connect to the data network <b>104</b> to inform the central monitoring station <b>102</b>. If the alarm controller <b>106</b> cannot connect to the data network <b>104</b>, then the security system <b>100</b> may have failed its function. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may thus constantly monitor wireless and wireline connections to the alarm controller <b>106</b>. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may be based in the data network <b>104</b>, or the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may be a software application executed by the alarm controller <b>106</b>. Regardless, the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> continuously monitors wireless and wireline data connectivity to the alarm controller <b>106</b> in the home. If communication fails between the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>, the alarm controller <b>106</b>, and/or the central monitoring station <b>102</b>, then a trouble condition may be reported to a network operations center <b>136</b>. The network operations center <b>136</b> may then undertake a diagnostic analysis to establish a root cause.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates a home access portal <b>138</b>. All communication with the alarm controller <b>106</b> may require authentication in the home access portal <b>138</b>. Authentication may be accomplished by providing a valid user name and password. All communication towards the home passes through the home access portal <b>138</b> and then is communicated over a secure socket layer (SSL) connection to a customer's home. When the customer is away from their home and wishes to access the video cameras <b>110</b> in their home, the customer may first be authenticated by the home access portal <b>138</b>. If the customer successfully authenticates, the customer's request flows over the secure socket layer (SSL) connection. Likewise, when an agent in the central monitoring center <b>102</b> wants to access the camera <b>110</b> in the home, the agent may first be authenticated by the home access portal <b>138</b>. The home access portal <b>138</b> may thus provide a much higher level of security compared to having authentication occur in the alarm controller <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Any packet protocol is suitable. As those of ordinary skill in the art understand, sometimes information is packetized (or &#x201c;framed&#x201d;) for use in packet data networks. The information is grouped into packets according to the packet protocol. As those of ordinary skill in the art also understand, there are many packet protocols. Some of the more well-known packet protocols include TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, and SNA. Some standards organizations, such as the I.E.E.E., issue standards for packetizing data. Some networks are &#x201c;mixed.&#x201d; That is, the network receives and handles packets of differing protocols, and a &#x201c;translator&#x201d; determines the particular packet protocol and the appropriate destination for each packet. Because the basics of packetizing and packet protocols are well-known, this disclosure will not further explain the packetizing of the alarm message <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a detailed schematic illustrating receipt of the alarm message <b>132</b>, according to exemplary embodiments. The alarm message <b>132</b> routes from the alarm controller <b>106</b>, through the data network <b>104</b>, and to a security server <b>140</b> at the central monitoring station <b>102</b>. The security server <b>140</b> has a processor <b>142</b> (e.g., &#x201c;&#x3bc;P&#x201d;), application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or other component that executes a server-side security application <b>144</b> stored in a memory <b>146</b>. The server-side security application <b>144</b> and the client-side security application <b>122</b> cooperate in a client-server environment to notify of alarms from the security system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the security server <b>140</b> receives the alarm message <b>132</b>, the server-side security application <b>144</b> obtains any data associated with the alarm message <b>132</b>. The server-side security application <b>144</b>, for example, retrieves a network address <b>150</b> associated with the security system <b>100</b> and/or the alarm controller <b>106</b>. The network address <b>150</b>, for example, may be extracted from one or more header portions and/or payload portions of the packetized alarm message <b>132</b>. However the network address <b>150</b> is received, the server-side security application <b>144</b> may then assign a human or computerized agent <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Because a high percentage of alarms are &#x201c;false,&#x201d; the agent <b>151</b> may first verify the alarm. Alarms are often inadvertently triggered, such as when an owner of a home opens a door and accidentally triggers the alarm. If the agent <b>151</b> immediately summons emergency services, and the alarm is false, then local police and fire departments have wasted time and resources. Some municipalities may even impose fees for the unnecessary dispatch. The agent <b>151</b>, then, may first want to verify the alarm before summoning emergency services.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The agent <b>151</b>, for example, may first attempt to contact a homeowner or other responsible party. When the alarm message <b>132</b> is received, the server-side security application <b>144</b> may associate the network address <b>150</b> to a notification address <b>152</b>. The notification address <b>152</b> is any telephone number, email address, and/or network communications address which is notified of alarms detected by the security system <b>100</b>. The server-side security application <b>144</b>, for example, queries a data table <b>154</b> that is stored in the memory <b>146</b> of the security server <b>140</b>. The data table <b>154</b> maps, relates, or otherwise associates the network address <b>150</b> to the notification address <b>152</b>. The server-side security application <b>144</b> retrieves the notification address <b>152</b> that is associated with the network address <b>150</b>. The data table <b>154</b> only illustrates simple hexadecimal addresses, though; in practice, the addresses may be many bits and/or digits. The agent <b>151</b> may then establish communication with a communications device <b>156</b> associated with the notification address <b>152</b>. The agent <b>151</b>, for example, may call, email, text, or otherwise notify the communications device <b>156</b> of a security event detected by the security system <b>100</b>. If the agent <b>151</b> determines that the alarm is legitimate, the agent <b>151</b> may summon emergency help.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Exemplary embodiments, therefore, allow the agent <b>151</b> to first verify the alarm condition <b>126</b>. Before summoning emergency services, the agent <b>151</b> may also request and access audio/video data <b>158</b> from the cameras and/or the microphones (illustrated as reference numerals <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The audio/video data <b>158</b> may be live, real-time data captured by the cameras <b>110</b> and/or the microphones <b>112</b>. The audio/video data <b>158</b>, however, may also include archived audio/video data of events preceding and succeeding the alarm condition <b>126</b>. The agent <b>151</b> may then view the audio/video data <b>158</b> to help determine whether the alarm condition <b>126</b> represents a true emergency condition. If the alarm is a legitimate security concern, then the agent <b>151</b> may summon emergency help.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> are more detailed schematics illustrating the exemplary embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates three (3) different connection mechanisms to the data network <b>104</b>. When the client-side security application <b>122</b> detects the alarm condition <b>126</b> from one of the sensors <b>108</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> must connect to the data network <b>104</b> to send the alarm message <b>132</b> to the central monitoring station <b>102</b>. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates, the client-side security application <b>122</b> may connect to the data network <b>104</b> using any of three (3) different connection mechanisms. The client-side security application <b>122</b>, for example, may connect to the data network <b>104</b> using a wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b>, a wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b>, and/or a short message service <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, then, illustrates different, simultaneous connections to the data network <b>104</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may send the alarm message <b>132</b> over the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> to the data network <b>104</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may also send the alarm message <b>132</b> over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> and/or over the short message service <b>164</b>. While either connection mechanism may be used, exemplary embodiments may prefer the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b>. Each cellular network is usually a proprietary network operated by, or on behalf of, a single service provider. A wireline network, however, may be operated and maintained by multiple service providers due to governmental regulations. A cellular network, then, may be a more reliable connection mechanism. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may thus prefer to send the alarm message <b>132</b> over the more reliable wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also illustrates the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may continuously monitor data connectivity to the alarm controller <b>106</b>. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may interface with a monitoring module <b>170</b>, according to exemplary embodiments. The monitoring module <b>170</b> may be a subroutine or software module that cooperates with the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> to monitor availability of the connection mechanisms. That is, data service monitoring center <b>134</b> and the monitoring module <b>170</b> may monitor the status of the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b>, the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b>, and the short message service <b>164</b>. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b>, for example, may continuously or periodically call or &#x201c;ping&#x201d; the monitoring module <b>170</b>. If a ping over wireless and/or wireline connectivity is unsuccessful, then pinging may be repeated multiple times. If a successive number of pings do not result in a response, then a trouble condition will automatically be reported to the network operations center <b>136</b>. Personnel in the network operations center <b>136</b> will then identify and isolate the trouble and restore service.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Exemplary embodiments may thus establish a hierarchy of connectivity. When the alarm condition <b>126</b> is detected, the client-side security application <b>122</b> may first determine whether the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> is available to the data network <b>104</b>. When the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> is available, the client-side security application <b>122</b> routes the alarm message <b>132</b> over the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> to the IP emergency alarm address (&#x201c;IPEAA&#x201d;) <b>130</b> associated with the central monitoring station <b>102</b>. When, however, the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> is unavailable, the client-side security application <b>122</b> routes the alarm message <b>132</b> over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> to the IP emergency alarm address <b>130</b>. Should the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> be unavailable, then the client-side security application <b>122</b> may revert to the short message service <b>164</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may thus prioritize the connection mechanisms and first attempt communication using the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b>. If cellular data service is unavailable, a second attempt may be made over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b>. If wireline broadband service is unavailable, then a third attempt may be made using the short message service <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a detailed schematic illustrating the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b>, according to exemplary embodiments. The alarm controller <b>106</b> communicates with a cellular data modem <b>180</b>. The cellular data modem <b>180</b> communicates with the data network <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a 3G cellular architecture, in which the cellular data modem <b>180</b> uses third generation (or &#x201c;3G&#x201d;) cellular packet data service to communicate with the data network <b>104</b>. The cellular data modem <b>180</b>, for example, may utilize general packet radio service (GPRS), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), universal mobile telecommunications service (UMTS), and/or high speed packet access (HSPA). The cellular data modem <b>180</b> sends and receives data to an antenna <b>182</b> of a base station transceiver <b>184</b>. The base station transceiver <b>184</b> communicates with a mobile telephone switching office (&#x201c;MTSO&#x201d;) <b>186</b>, and the mobile telephone switching office <b>186</b> has a data link to the data network <b>104</b>. The cellular data modem <b>180</b> modulates and/or demodulates the signals that are received and sent via the base station transceiver <b>184</b>. The cellular data modem <b>180</b> is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, so the cellular data modem <b>180</b> need not be discussed in detail. The cellular data modem <b>180</b> may be addressable, so the cellular data modem <b>180</b> may also have a unique or shared modem address <b>188</b>. When the alarm condition <b>126</b> is detected, then the client-side security application <b>122</b> may route the alarm message <b>132</b> over the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> to the data network <b>104</b>. Exemplary embodiments, however, may utilize other cellular standards, such as fourth generation cellular data standards. Exemplary embodiments may also utilize other wireless standards, such as WI-FI&#xae;, WI-MAX&#xae;, or any of the IEEE 802 family of standards.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a detailed schematic illustrating the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b>, according to exemplary embodiments. The alarm controller <b>106</b> communicates with a broadband data modem <b>200</b>. The broadband data modem <b>200</b> communicates with the data network <b>104</b> over a physical wireline connection <b>201</b>. The broadband data modem <b>200</b> modulates and/or demodulates data that is sent to, and received from, the data network <b>104</b>. The broadband data modem <b>200</b> is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, so the architecture and operating principles of the broadband data modem <b>200</b> need not be discussed. The broadband data modem <b>200</b> may be addressable, so the broadband data modem <b>200</b> may have a unique or shared broadband modem address <b>202</b>. When the alarm condition <b>126</b> is detected, and when the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> is available, the client-side security application <b>122</b> may route the alarm message <b>132</b> over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> to the data network <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a detailed schematic illustrating the short message service <b>164</b>, according to exemplary embodiments. Here the alarm controller <b>106</b> wirelessly communicates with the antenna <b>182</b> and the base station transceiver <b>184</b> of a short message service center (&#x201c;SMSS&#x201d;) <b>210</b>. The short message service center <b>210</b> has a data link to the data network <b>104</b>. The short message service center <b>210</b> also has a unique or shared network address. The short message service <b>164</b> is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, so the short message service <b>164</b> need not be discussed in detail. The alarm controller <b>106</b> sends the alarm message <b>132</b> as a text message <b>212</b> to the short message service center <b>210</b>, and the text message <b>212</b> routes through the data network <b>104</b> to the central monitoring station <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> illustrate polling schemes, according to exemplary embodiments. Here the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may periodically send polling messages to determine the status of the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b>, the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b>, and/or the short message service <b>164</b>. If the alarm controller <b>106</b> responds, then connectivity is successful. Exemplary embodiments may thus poll for the availability of each network connection.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example, illustrates a wireless polling message <b>220</b>. The wireless polling message <b>220</b> may be initiated by a server operating in the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. The server operating in the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may execute the server-side security application <b>144</b> to route the wireless polling message <b>220</b> through the packet data network <b>104</b> and over the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> (e.g., a secure socket layer connection) to the network address <b>162</b> associated with the alarm controller <b>106</b>. When the alarm controller <b>106</b> receives the wireless polling message <b>220</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> causes the alarm controller <b>106</b> to send a response <b>222</b>. The response <b>222</b> may communicate over the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> to the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. When the response <b>222</b> is received, the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> knows that the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> is online and communicating.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a wireline polling message <b>230</b>. The wireline polling message <b>230</b> routes from the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>, into and through the packet data network <b>104</b>, and over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> to the alarm controller <b>106</b>. When the alarm controller <b>106</b> receives the wireline polling message <b>230</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> causes the alarm controller <b>106</b> to send a wireline response <b>232</b>. The wireline response <b>232</b> communicates over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> and through the packet data network <b>104</b> to the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. When the response <b>222</b> is received, the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> knows that the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> is online and communicating.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a text polling message <b>240</b>.

The short message service center <b>210</b> then wirelessly routes the text polling message <b>240</b> to the network IP address associated with the alarm controller <b>106</b>. When the alarm controller <b>106</b> wirelessly receives the text polling message <b>240</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> causes the alarm controller <b>106</b> to send a text response <b>242</b>. Here the text response <b>242</b> may wirelessly communicate to the short message service center <b>210</b>, and the short message service center <b>210</b> routes the text response <b>242</b> through the packet data network <b>104</b> to the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. When the text response <b>242</b> is received, the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> knows that the short message service <b>164</b> is online and communicating.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is another schematic illustrating a polling scheme, according to exemplary embodiments. Here the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> utilizes a hybrid polling scheme that tests two connection mechanisms with a single polling cycle. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b> sends the wireless polling message <b>220</b> over the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b>. The wireless polling message <b>220</b> routes to the network address associated with the alarm controller <b>106</b>. When the alarm controller <b>106</b> receives the wireless polling message <b>220</b>, here the client-side security application <b>122</b> sends the wireline response <b>232</b>. The wireless polling message <b>220</b> may include header or payload instructions to route the wireline response <b>232</b> over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> to the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. That is, the wireless polling message <b>220</b> may include a network path and/or routing information that forces the wireline response <b>232</b> to communicate over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b>. When the wireline response <b>232</b> is received, the server-side security application <b>144</b> knows that the both the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b> and the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> are online and communicating.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic illustrating another polling scheme, according to exemplary embodiments. Here the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> utilizes another hybrid polling scheme that tests three connection mechanisms with a single polling cycle. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b> again sends the wireless polling message <b>220</b> over the wireless cellular network connection <b>160</b>. When the alarm controller <b>106</b> receives the wireless polling message <b>550</b>, here the client-side security application <b>122</b> may send two separate responses. The alarm controller <b>106</b>, for example, may send the wireline response <b>232</b> as a first response. The wireline response <b>232</b> communicates over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> to the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. The alarm controller <b>106</b> may also send the text response <b>242</b> as a second response. The text response <b>242</b> may be sent using the short message service <b>164</b> to the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. Here, then, the client-side security application <b>122</b> may be programmed to send two responses. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may obtain routing instructions from the header or payload of the wireless polling message <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Exemplary embodiments may additionally or alternatively obtain routing instructions from a routing table <b>250</b>.

The routing table <b>250</b> may specify a network path and/or network addresses that cause the wireline response <b>232</b> to route over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> to the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. That is, the routing table <b>250</b> may associate the network address of the alarm controller <b>106</b> to a listing of equipment and/or network addresses that force the wireline response <b>232</b> to route over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may retrieve pre-specified or configured routing instructions that ensure the wireline response <b>232</b> correctly routes over the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b>. Likewise, client-side security application <b>122</b> retrieves pre-specified or configured routing instructions that ensure the text response <b>242</b> routes to the short message service center <b>210</b> and then to the data service monitoring center <b>134</b>. When the wireline response <b>232</b> is received, the server-side security application <b>144</b> knows that the wireline broadband network connection <b>162</b> is online and communicating. When the text response <b>242</b> is received, the server-side security application <b>144</b> knows that the short message service <b>164</b> is online and communicating.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The reliability of the polling schemes illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref> depends on fresh information. If the polling scheme is infrequent, then the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may not know the current availability of either connection mechanism. Exemplary embodiments may thus periodically perform any of the polling schemes illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref>. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b>, for example, may send the wireless polling message <b>220</b> and then wait for receipt of the wireless response <b>22</b>, the wireline response <b>232</b>, and/or the text response <b>242</b>. A timer may be initiated to countdown from a predetermined amount of time before a sequential wireless polling message is sent. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may initiate a poll at any interval of time, from fractions of seconds to once daily. A polling cycle every minute, as an example, may be adequate for most needs without unnecessarily clogging the data network <b>104</b>. If both the wireline response <b>232</b> and the text response <b>242</b> are received, the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may reset the timer. If either response is not received, though, the data service monitoring center <b>134</b> may resend polling messages. If, for example, a successive number of pings do not result in either response, then a trouble condition will automatically be reported to the network operations center (illustrated as reference numeral <b>136</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Personnel in the network operations center <b>136</b> will then identify and isolate the trouble and restore service.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic illustrating retrieval of video data, according to exemplary embodiments. When the security server <b>140</b> receives the alarm message <b>132</b>, the agent <b>151</b> may want to view live or archived video data of the alarm scene. The agent <b>151</b>, then, may instruct his or her computer terminal <b>260</b> to send a video request <b>262</b> to the alarm controller <b>106</b>. The video request <b>262</b> routes over the packet data network <b>104</b> to the network IP address <b>150</b> associated with the alarm controller <b>106</b>. When the client-side security application <b>122</b> receives the video request <b>262</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> retrieves live video data <b>264</b> from at least one of the cameras <b>110</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> instructs the alarm controller <b>106</b> to send the live video data <b>264</b> to a terminal IP address <b>268</b> associated with the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b>. The agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> has a video processor that displays the live video data <b>264</b> on a display device (the video processor and the display device are not shown for simplicity). The agent <b>151</b> may view the live video data <b>264</b> to help determine whether the alarm condition <b>126</b> is legitimate. If the live video data <b>264</b> indicates a fire, attack, or other legitimate security concern, then the agent <b>151</b> may immediately summon police, fire, and/or other emergency services.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Permissions may need to be established. If multiple cameras are present in the customer's home, the customer may not want the agent to have access to all cameras. That is, there may be some camera outputs that are &#x201c;off limits&#x201d; and not accessible. A bedroom security camera, for example, may be configured as &#x201c;private,&#x201d; not shared, and perhaps not archived. The homeowner/customer may thus establish a policy to manage which camera outputs are available to the central monitoring station during an alarm condition. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may be configured to permit, or deny, remote access to any output of any camera <b>110</b> according to user and/or the user's location. If a user has acceptable authentication credentials (e.g., username and password), but an unacceptable location (such as GPS coordinates), then the client-side security application <b>122</b> may deny access to video and any other feature. Some camera output may be associated with public permissions, while other camera output may be associated with specific authentication credentials.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic illustrating archival video data, according to exemplary embodiments. Here the agent at the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> may also request and receive older, archived video data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for example, illustrates a video database <b>280</b>. As the one or more cameras <b>110</b> capture video data, the client-side security application <b>122</b> may instruct the alarm controller <b>106</b> to store the video data in the video database <b>280</b>. The video database <b>280</b> thus builds up, over time, archival video data <b>282</b>. The video database <b>280</b> may thus be used to reveal important archival video data <b>282</b> of events that preceded a fire, burglary, or other emergency situation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a local architecture for the video database <b>280</b>, according to exemplary embodiments. The video database <b>280</b> is locally maintained in a local or home network that is shared with the alarm controller <b>106</b>. That is, any video data captured by the cameras <b>110</b> is stored in a home or business network that communicates with the alarm controller <b>106</b>. Because the video data is locally captured and stored, the video data need not be sent to a remote storage location via the Internet. Upstream bandwidth consumption is thus reduced or not needed. The video database <b>280</b>, however, may be remotely located from the alarm controller <b>106</b>, but excessive bandwidth may be needed to upload video data. Regardless, the video database <b>280</b> may store the video data on a FIFO (&#x201c;first in, first out&#x201d;) basis, with each camera <b>110</b> having a dedicated memory space or partition. An alternate storage scheme may used, though, such as a &#x201c;last in, first out&#x201d; (or &#x201c;LIFO&#x201d;) basis to speed recovery of the most recent footage. The video database <b>280</b> may also store data as a loop that is overwritten after a predetermined time (such as multiple days or weeks, although a two or three day time period may be adequate for most customers). The video database <b>280</b> may also date and time stamp the video data to help indexing and retrieval efforts.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">However the video database <b>280</b> is configured, the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> may request archival footage. The agent <b>151</b> instructs his or her computer terminal <b>260</b> to send an archival video request <b>284</b> to the alarm controller <b>106</b>. The archival video request <b>284</b> routes over the packet data network <b>104</b> to the network IP address <b>150</b> associated with the alarm controller <b>106</b>. When the client-side security application <b>122</b> receives the archival video request <b>284</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> instructs the video database <b>280</b> to retrieve the older archival video data <b>282</b> and to send the older archival video data <b>282</b> to the terminal address (illustrated as reference numeral <b>268</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) associated with the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b>. The agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> displays the older archival video data <b>282</b>, thus allowing the agent <b>151</b> to see what events transpired prior to the alarm condition <b>126</b>. The older archival video data <b>282</b> may reveal the cause of a fire, the face of an intruder, or other information that legitimates the alarm condition <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a schematic illustrating camera zones, according to exemplary embodiments. Because there may be multiple cameras <b>110</b> in a home or business, the live video data <b>264</b> may consume too much bandwidth in the packet data network <b>104</b>. If the client-side security application <b>122</b> attempts to send live video data <b>264</b> from three (3) different cameras <b>110</b>, for example, the live video data <b>264</b> may likely create or encounter congestion in the packet data network <b>104</b>. Delivery to the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> may be delayed or even fail. Delay or failure may be unacceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Exemplary embodiments, then, may reduce bandwidth consumption. When the alarm condition <b>126</b> is detected, the alarm condition <b>126</b> may identify an alarm code <b>290</b> associated with the sensor <b>108</b> that triggered the alarm condition <b>126</b>. Suppose the alarm code <b>290</b> is associated with a front door sensor. Video data of the front door is thus most relevant. Video data of a back door may be less helpful. Bandwidth may thus be reduced by only sending the live video data <b>264</b> from a camera aimed at the front door. Video data of the back door may contribute to congestion and delay delivery of the more-important front door video data.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The client-side security application <b>122</b> may then associate the alarm code <b>290</b> to a particular one (or more) of the cameras <b>110</b>. When the client-side security application <b>122</b> receives the alarm code <b>290</b> associated with the sensor <b>108</b> that triggered the alarm condition <b>126</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> may select only the most relevant video data. The client-side security application <b>122</b>, for example, may query a camera table <b>292</b> that is stored in the memory of the alarm controller <b>106</b>. The camera table <b>292</b> maps, relates, or otherwise associates the alarm code <b>290</b> to a camera address <b>294</b>. Each of the cameras <b>110</b> is uniquely identified with the camera address <b>294</b>. Each camera <b>110</b> may have a private Internet Protocol address, and each camera <b>110</b> may interface with a web server (either in the home or in the data network <b>104</b>). The client-side security application <b>122</b> retrieves the camera address <b>294</b> that is associated with the alarm code <b>290</b>. When the client-side security application <b>122</b> receives the video request <b>262</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> may then retrieve only the live video data <b>264</b> associated with the retrieved camera address <b>294</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> instructs the alarm controller <b>106</b> to send only the live video data <b>264</b> associated with the camera address <b>294</b> to the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b>. Because only the relevant video data is sent, less bandwidth is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The agent <b>151</b> at the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> may request video from any camera <b>110</b>. When the alarm message <b>128</b> is received, the agent may select a camera <b>110</b> to access in the home and start seeing streaming video. The agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> may display information indicating the camera zone associated with the alarm condition <b>126</b>. The agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> may also display a graphical user interface that permits the agent <b>151</b> to access the live video data <b>264</b> from any camera <b>110</b> in the home. Under most circumstances the agent <b>151</b> will receive and viewing the live video data <b>264</b> from one camera <b>110</b> at a time. If bandwidth permits, though, the agent <b>151</b> could select and view live video data <b>264</b> from multiple cameras <b>110</b> at one time. Bandwidth concerns, though, are in the access network to the data network <b>104</b>. The live video data <b>264</b> from one or more cameras will not create congestion in the data network <b>104</b>. If congestion were to occur, congestion will occur in the access network. For example, if a customer has an ADSL service with 1.5 Mbps downstream and 256 Kbps upstream, the upstream bandwidth could be limiting. One may assume that the upstream bandwidth for streaming to a PC is &#x2dc;140 Kbps.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Any video data, from any camera <b>110</b>, is also available. Even though the client-side security application <b>122</b> may initially send only live video data <b>264</b> associated with the camera number <b>294</b>, the agent <b>151</b> may request video data from any camera <b>110</b>. After the agent <b>151</b> views the live video data <b>264</b> from the camera number <b>294</b> associated with the alarm code <b>290</b>, the agent <b>151</b> may want video data from other cameras. When agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> sends a subsequent video request <b>262</b>, the agent may specify output from a particular camera number <b>294</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> retrieves the live video data <b>264</b> associated with the requested camera number <b>294</b> and sends the requested live video data <b>264</b> to the terminal IP address <b>268</b> associated with the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Zones may also be used. When the alarm condition <b>126</b> is detected, the alarm condition <b>126</b> may identify the alarm code <b>290</b> associated with the sensor <b>108</b> that triggered the alarm condition <b>126</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may then query the camera table <b>292</b> for the zone and for the associated camera number <b>294</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may then retrieve only the live video data <b>264</b> associated with the retrieved camera number <b>294</b>. Exemplary embodiments may thus enable communication of the specific sensor that triggered the alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a schematic illustrating archival camera zones, according to exemplary embodiments. Here the camera table <b>292</b> may also be used to retrieve the archival video data <b>282</b> associated with a particular camera number <b>294</b>. Once the alarm code <b>290</b> is known, the client-side security application <b>122</b> queries the camera table <b>292</b> for the camera number <b>294</b> associated with the alarm code <b>290</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> retrieves the camera number <b>294</b> and instructs the video database <b>280</b> to retrieve the archival video data <b>282</b> associated with the camera number <b>294</b>. The video database <b>280</b> may then send the archival video data <b>282</b> to the terminal IP address <b>268</b> associated with the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b>. The agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> displays the older archival video data <b>282</b>, thus allowing the agent <b>151</b> to see what events preceded the alarm condition <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a schematic illustrating audio data, according to exemplary embodiments. The alarm system <b>100</b> may include one or more microphones <b>112</b> that capture real-time, live audio data <b>300</b>. The live audio data <b>300</b> may be sent to the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b> to help the agent <b>151</b> evaluate the emergency situation. The live audio data <b>300</b> may also be stored in an audio database <b>302</b> to provide a long-term repository of audio data. The audio database <b>302</b> is again illustrated as being locally maintained in the customer's local network to reduce bandwidth consumption. The audio database <b>302</b> may store the video data on a FIFO (&#x201c;first in, first out&#x201d;) or LIFO (&#x201c;last in, last out&#x201d;) basis, with each microphone <b>112</b> having a dedicated memory space or partition. The audio database <b>302</b> may also store the live audio data <b>300</b> as a loop that is overwritten after a predetermined time, and the audio database <b>302</b> may also date and time stamp the audio data <b>300</b> to help indexing and retrieval efforts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> also illustrates a microphone table <b>304</b> modified to also associate the alarm code <b>290</b> to a unique microphone number <b>306</b>. When the client-side security application <b>122</b> receives an audio request <b>308</b>, the client-side security application <b>122</b> may then retrieve only the live audio data <b>300</b> associated with the microphone number <b>306</b>. The client-side security application <b>122</b> may also instruct the audio database <b>302</b> to retrieve archived audio data <b>310</b> associated with the microphone number <b>306</b>. Both the live audio data <b>300</b> and the archived audio data <b>310</b> may thus be sent to the terminal IP address <b>268</b> associated with the agent's computer terminal <b>260</b>. The live audio data <b>300</b> and the archived audio data <b>310</b> allows the agent <b>151</b> to hear what events preceded the alarm condition <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref> are schematics illustrating remote notification of alarms, according to exemplary embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates the client-side security application <b>122</b> notifying any third party of the alarm condition <b>126</b> detected by the security system <b>100</b>.

The list <b>320</b> of notification addresses is illustrated as being locally stored in the alarm controller <b>106</b>, but the list <b>320</b> of notification addresses may be remotely accessed and retrieved via the packet data network <b>104</b>. The list <b>320</b> of notification addresses stores communications addresses which are notified of the alarm condition <b>126</b> detected by the security system <b>100</b>. Each entry in the list <b>320</b> of notification addresses may be a telephone number, I.P. address, email address, pager address, or any other communications address. The client-side security application <b>122</b> formats an alarm notification <b>322</b>, and the alarm notification <b>322</b> may include information describing the alarm condition <b>126</b> (such as the alarm code <b>290</b>, a physical street address, and any other information). The client-side security application <b>122</b> then sends the alarm notification <b>322</b> to each entry in the list <b>320</b> of notification addresses. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates the alarm notification <b>322</b> communicating via the packet data network <b>104</b> to a third party communications device <b>324</b> associated with one of the notification addresses.

The list <b>334</b> of conference addresses is illustrated as being locally stored in the security server <b>140</b>, but the list <b>334</b> of conference addresses may be remotely accessed and retrieved via the packet data network <b>104</b>. The list <b>334</b> of conference addresses stores communications addresses which are joined to a shared communications session (such as a Voice-over Internet Protocol conference call, a video conference, or even a text conference). The server-side security application <b>144</b> establishes a common session with one or more of the communications addresses in the list <b>334</b> of conference addresses. Once the conference <b>330</b> is established, the server-side security application <b>144</b> cooperates with the client-side security application <b>122</b> to send the live video data <b>264</b>, the archived video data <b>282</b>, the live audio data <b>300</b>, and/or the archived audio data <b>310</b> to a conference participant associated with the remote communications device <b>332</b>.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a schematic illustrating a services gateway ecosystem, according to exemplary embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a residential services gateway ecosystem comprising broadband wireline data service, 3G cellular packet data service, and a data service monitoring platform. Software in the Services Gateway will constantly monitor the availability of the customer's broadband wireline data service, i.e., ADSL, VDSL or Bring-Your-Own-Broadband. When the customer's broadband wireline data service is available, the Services Gateway will always utilize the broadband wireline data service, i.e., DSL or cable modem service, to connect to the network. When the broadband wireline service is not available, then the Services Gateway will automatically switch to the 3G Cellular Packet Data Service (GPRS, EDGE, UMTS or HSPA) to connect to the data network <b>104</b> and automatically return to the broadband wireline data service when it is restored.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For the Home Security application, 3G Cellular Data may be the primary signaling path to the central monitoring station <b>102</b>. If 3G Cellular Data is not available, however, then broadband wireline data will be used. If neither 3G Cellular Packet Data Service nor broadband wireline service are available, then signaling to the central monitoring station <b>102</b> will be done using SMS (text messaging). Because control over cellular networks may be maintained and ensured, cellular networks will be default. When a customer does not have a broadband wireline service, virtually all services can be supported using 3G Cellular Packet Data Service (GPRS, EDGE, UMTS or HSPA) to connect to the data network <b>104</b>. The data service monitoring center <b>134</b> in the data network <b>104</b> may constantly monitor the status of the broadband wireline data service and the 3G Cellular Packet Data Service to each customer's home.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref> are schematics illustrating various architectures for a professionally monitored Home Security System, according to exemplary embodiments. The residential security system may have all wired sensors, all wireless sensors, and/or any combination of wired and wireless sensors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref> illustrate an Alarm Management application in the services gateway that is the service logic. The services gateway replaces the traditional Home Security cabinet. When a user puts the system into an &#x201c;armed&#x201d; state via a wall mounted keypad, Wi-Fi Touch Pad, Mobile Device or PC, the application monitors the status of wired and/or wireless sensors, such as window contacts, door contacts, motion detectors, glass breakage and smoke/CO detector. When the system is &#x201c;armed&#x201d; and a sensor is activated, an alarm condition is established and the alarm information is automatically communicated to the central monitoring station <b>102</b> via IP signaling over a 3G cellular packet data service (GPRS, EDGE, UMTS and HSPA). If 3G cellular packet data service is not available, then the customer's wired broadband data service is used. If the customer's broadband data service is not available, then alarm messages are sent via SMS. Wireless sensors are individually monitored within the home by the application. Wired sensors may be individually monitored (star wiring) or may be monitored as a &#x201c;zone&#x201d; (daisy chain wiring with multiple sensors in a zone), which includes typically multiple sensors, by the application.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The alarm message <b>132</b> contains any alarm information and communicates to the central monitoring station <b>102</b>. The alarm message <b>132</b>, for example, may include information identifying the customer's account and the sensor that was activated or the zone that contains the sensor that was activated. A customer will automatically be notified via SMS, email or a VoIP call when an alarm is communicated to the central monitoring station <b>102</b>. As soon as the alarm information is received by the central monitoring station <b>102</b>, the agent <b>151</b> will immediately attempt to contact the customer to verify that it is a real alarm and not a false alarm. If the agent is successful in contacting the customer and verifies that it is a real alarm condition, then the agent will contact the fire department, police department or EMS. In general if the agent is not successful in contacting the customer to verify that it is a real alarm condition, then the agent will contact the fire department, police department or EMS. During an alarm condition if Remote Video Monitoring is available in the customer's home and the agent has permission to access the Remote Video Monitoring, then the agent will access the cameras <b>110</b> in the customer's home to assist in verifying that it is a real alarm condition.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The home security sensors <b>108</b> are utilized to monitor for intrusion and fire/smoke. The sensors may be wired and/or wireless. Sensors for intrusion monitoring can include window contacts, door contacts, motion detectors, and glass breakage.

Wired sensors may be individually monitored (star wiring) or may be monitored as a &#x201c;zone&#x201d; (daisy chain wiring with multiple sensors in a zone), which includes typically multiple sensors, and receive power over the wire. Wireless sensors are individually monitored within the home and may be battery powered or AC powered with battery backup.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The Services Gateway may be equipped with a minimum of 24 hour battery backup. During local power failure conditions the battery will power the Services Gateway and some sub-systems automatically may be shutdown to preserve battery life, such as an optional hard drive.

As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> illustrates, the user selects the camera <b>110</b> that they want to view and a pop-up window appears for the selected camera. The pop-up window displays the streaming video from the selected camera and if the camera is equipped with controls, such as tilt, pan, zoom or brightness, the controls appear in the pop-up window. The pop-up window also contains Video Capture Controls which enable a user to capture a Still Image or Motion Video Clip that is transmitted to local storage on a hard drive in the AT&#x26;T Services Gateway and/or to network storage. If a camera is capable of streaming video and audio, then when accessing a camera a user will see streaming video and hear audio.

On a periodic basis, such once per day or once per hour due to the packet protocol, the central monitoring station <b>102</b> may &#x201c;ping&#x201d; the AT&#x26;T Services Gateway in a customer's home to verify that the signaling path is in operation. If multiple pings are not successful then a trouble condition will automatically be reported to an AT&#x26;T Network Operations Center. If a ping fails, more frequent pings may be attempted. If the more frequent pings are still unsuccessful, then a diagnostic routine may commence to determine a fault. Exemplary embodiments may revert to SMS, and the data network <b>104</b> may prioritize SMS alarm messages. Because SMS is usually best effort, exemplary embodiments may prioritize SMS alarm messages and confirm delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The central monitoring station <b>102</b> may thus capture video during alarm conditions. If the customer's home is equipped with cameras for Remote Video Monitoring, a specified amount of streaming video, such as ten seconds, is automatically being buffered in memory on a first in and first out basis in memory on the AT&#x26;T Services Gateway from each camera. During an alarm condition, which is detected by the Alarm Management and central monitoring station Reporting application executing on the AT&#x26;T Services Gateway, the buffered streaming video clips on the AT&#x26;T Services Gateway will automatically be transmitted to an online electronic file storage system in the central monitoring station and the agent in the central monitoring station who is assigned to handle alarm will be notified that video is available. Because the video is being buffered on a continuous basis the streaming video clips that are sent to the central monitoring station will include both pre-alarm and post-alarm video, e.g., if a ten second video clip is sent it could include five seconds of pre-alarm video and five seconds of post-alarm video. The video clips that are automatically sent to the central monitoring station will be a tool for the agent to use in determining if the alarm is real or is a false alarm, in addition the agent may be provided access to live video from the home during the alarm condition.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Exemplary embodiments include conferencing capability during alarm conditions. When an alarm is received in the central monitoring station and assigned to an agent, the agent will immediately attempt to determine if the alarm is a real alarm or a false alarm, in general 99% of alarms reports to central monitoring stations are false alarms. Typically the first thing that an agent will do is attempt to contact the customer by phone by placing a call to the customer's home phone number and if that call is not successful they will proceed calling numbers on a list that the customer has provided. If the agent is successful in contacting the customer by phone and the customer has a device telephone capable of IMS multimedia conferencing, such as a mobile device that is IMS multimedia conferencing enabled, then the agent can establish an IMS multimedia session and the agent and the customer can jointly be viewing streaming video from cameras in the customer's home in order to determine if the alarm is real. The IMS multimedia conference could be expanded to include additional parties, such as police, fire and/or medical personnel. The purpose of the IMS multimedia conferencing during alarm conditions is to assist the agent in the central monitoring station in determining if the alarm that has been received is real.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Exemplary embodiments may also include home automation and control. Home Automation &#x26; Control includes devices for monitoring and/or controlling the environment. Devices can include temperature sensors where the user can be notified via SMS, email or voice if the temperature is above a temperature specified by the user or below a temperature specified by the user. Water detectors may also notify the user via SMS, email or voice if water is detected. A remote control water shut-off valve may be remotely opened and closed via a mobile device or PC, and the user is notified when water is detected and shuts off the water. Power modules may control lighting and appliances, whereby the user can easily establish programs for automatically controlling lighting and appliances and user can remotely via a mobile device or PC turn lighting and appliances on and off. Home Automation &#x26; Control includes devices may also include thermostats, remote control door locks, garage door openers, and remote control windows and shades. Any sensor can trigger an event which can automatically be communicated to a user via a mobile device or PC and/or can be used to control devices, e.g., when a user disarms the security system and it is nighttime, automatically turn on lighting and change a thermostat setting.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Exemplary embodiments may also provide notification of events. When any event occurs in the home, such as the reporting of an alarm to the central monitoring station or simply the opening of a door, the customer can automatically be notified of the event by SMS/MMS, email and/or voice calling. If the customer's home is equipped with cameras for Remote Video Monitoring, then a still video image can also be included via a MMS or attachment to email. A customer via a simple web interface will be able to link events and actions, e.g., when the security alarm is dis-armed automatically turn on selected lights in the home and change the thermostat setting or if an alarm is triggered turn on all of the lights in the home and send an SMS and email to the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-30</figref> are schematics illustrating various graphical user interfaces, according to exemplary embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates various mobile interfaces for smart devices, such as the APPLE&#xae; IPHONE&#xae;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> illustrates a user-friendly touch pad interface with selective icons for functions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates a larger, more comprehensive computer interface for larger display screens.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Exemplary embodiments thus eliminate the traditional home security panel for the Home Security application because the service logic for home security executes on the AT&#x26;T Services Gateway in the form of a software application. The basic system comprises the AT&#x26;T Services Gateway in conjunction with an Alarm Management and central monitoring station Reporting application and wireless and/or wired devices in the home, including keypads, sirens and sensors. All of the wireless devices in the home associated with the Home Security application may be based on an open systems wireless technology, such as ZigBee (www.zigbee.org) or proprietary wireless technology, such as that used by Honeywell, DSC, Xanboo and others. A user can be automatically be notified via SMS, email or voice of any event that occurs in the home, including the reporting of an alarm to the central monitoring station. Wireline and wireless connectivity is constantly being monitored to the home via a network platform. During an alarm condition a central monitoring station agent can utilize IMS multimedia conferencing capabilities to enable the agent, customer and police/fire/EMS personnel to simultaneously view streaming video/audio from the home and/or stored streaming video/audio.</p>
