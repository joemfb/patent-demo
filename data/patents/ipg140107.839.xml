<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In the manufacture and assembly of windows and doors that include a viewing or vision area; a viewing area layer (typically constructed of glass) must be assembled to a sash and fixedly secured thereto. More specifically, a traditional window and door manufacturing technique requires a number of steps. First, the sash, window frame or door glass assembly must be constructed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a window sash <b>20</b>. The window sash includes a sash opening <b>26</b> and a glazing leg <b>22</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) to which a viewing area or glass layer <b>24</b> is ultimately secured. The glazing leg <b>22</b> extends inwardly from an inner surface of the window sash <b>20</b>, along a perimeter of sash opening <b>26</b>. Once the sash assembly is constructed, a suitable back bedding glazing compound is applied to the glazing leg <b>22</b>. Next, the viewing area or glass <b>24</b> is laid into sash <b>20</b>, and into contact with the back bedding glazing compound. A typical back bedding glazing compound used in this process has an open time that begins upon application, before the glass is laid, and can range from minutes to hours.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The length of cure time for the back bedding glazing compound cure time in prior art systems is necessary due to the steps involved in applying the back bedding glazing compound and properly laying and positioning the glass into the sash. More specifically, the glass laying process is a multi-step process.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">After the back bedding glazing compound is applied to the glazing leg, setting blocks may be installed along the perimeter of the sash opening <b>26</b> so as to assist with centering, or squaring the glass layer <b>24</b> in the sash opening <b>26</b>. After the setting blocks are positioned, the glass layer <b>24</b> is placed in contact with the back bedding glazing compound along the glazing leg, compressing the back bedding glazing compound to effect a strong seal between the glass layer an the glazing leg. In some instances, it may be necessary to maneuver the glass layer to properly center or square the glass layer in the sash. Alternatively, after the back bedding glazing compound is applied to the glazing leg, the glass is laid and centered in the sash opening and setting blocks are inserted around the glass perimeter. Accordingly, a sufficient cure time for the back bedding glazing compound has been required to provide for such maneuverability.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Once the glass layer <b>24</b> is properly positioned, glazing beads (or glazing stops) may be installed such that they conceal a gap created by the setting blocks to maintain position of the glass while the back bedding glazing compound cures to fix the glass layer <b>24</b> to the glazing leg <b>22</b>. However, because of the cure time needed to accommodate proper positioning of the glass layer on the back bedding glazing compound, once the glass layer <b>24</b> is positioned with the spacers, the assembly must then be moved to a curing station to complete the cure operation. As such, the current method results in significant delay in completing manufacturing of windows and doors. In addition, due to the extra manufacturing steps of loading and unloading the assembly onto drying pallets, significant expense is incurred.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there exists a need to decouple the back bedding glazing compound open time limitations from the glass laying process. Decoupling will allow for the use of back bedding glazing compounds with faster cure times, thereby allowing increased through put while reducing, eliminating staging and racking time of glazed sashes.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Various components of a glazing assembly <b>10</b> will first be explained. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an exemplary sash <b>20</b> is shown on a glazing table <b>28</b>. While the present disclosure depicts sash <b>20</b> as a window, it is understood that the disclosure is not limited to windows.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Sash <b>20</b> typically includes an outer periphery defined by upwardly raised wall members <b>30</b> that defines a sash opening <b>26</b>. The interior surface <b>32</b> of wall members <b>30</b> are each configured to have an inwardly extending glazing leg <b>22</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that forms a ledge extending around interior surface <b>32</b> of wall members <b>23</b>. Glazing leg <b>22</b> will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Positioned above glazing table <b>28</b> is a back bedding glazing compound distribution system <b>34</b> that is fluidly connected to a back bedding glazing compound supply source (not shown). Back bedding glazing compound distribution system <b>34</b> is mounted to as to be selectively moveable along cross rails <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> that are positioned perpendicular to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Back bedding glazing compound distribution system <b>34</b> includes a back bedding glazing compound applicator assembly <b>42</b>, best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Back bedding glazing compound applicator assembly <b>42</b> includes a static mixer <b>44</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>) that is mounted in a sleeve <b>46</b> and an applicator nozzle assembly <b>48</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Extending from back bedding glazing compound distribution system <b>34</b> are first and second support brackets <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. In one embodiment, first and second support brackets <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are positioned so as to extend generally perpendicular to each other. First and second support brackets <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are also arranged so as to be in a fixed position relative to back bedding glazing compound applicator assembly <b>42</b>. Exemplary embodiments of first and second support brackets <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref>. An optional stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> may also be connected to back bedding glazing compound distribution system <b>34</b>. Stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> will be discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Fixed to each of first and second support brackets <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> are positioner assemblies <b>54</b>. An embodiment of positioner assembly <b>54</b> is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. Each positioner assembly <b>54</b> includes a selectively actuatable position member <b>56</b> with a tip element <b>58</b> on a distal end thereof. A retaining member is attached to a proximal end of the position member <b>56</b> and serves to limit the distance that position member <b>56</b> may extend. Retaining member is positioned within a generally hollow housing <b>61</b> of the positioner assemblies <b>54</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, tip element <b>58</b> is shown as having a generally cylindrical shape. However, it is understood that the tip element <b>58</b> may be constructed with other configurations, such as a wedge shape, for example, without departing from the disclosure. In one exemplary embodiment, tip element <b>58</b> is constructed of a non-abrasive material, such as, for example, Delrin&#xae; plastic, such that tip element <b>58</b> will not damage either sash <b>20</b> or glass layer <b>24</b> when contacting same. Position members <b>56</b> will be explained in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">One of first and second brackets <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> may further include a selectively extendable depth probe <b>60</b> and position indicator <b>62</b>. While depth probe <b>60</b> and position indicator <b>62</b> are both shown mounted on second bracket <b>52</b>, it is understood that depth probe <b>60</b> and position indicator <b>62</b> may also be mounted on first bracket <b>50</b>, or one may be positioned on first bracket <b>50</b> and the other may be positioned on second bracket <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Operation of glazing assembly <b>10</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> and <b>25</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the glazing operation <b>100</b>. To begin the glazing operation, at step <b>102</b> sash <b>20</b> is placed on glazing table <b>28</b>, which in one embodiment, is configured to have a generally horizontal mounting surface. Vertical mounting surfaces are also possible. Sash <b>20</b> is selectively fixed to glazing table <b>28</b> such that sash <b>20</b> is prevented from moving during the glazing operation. In one exemplary embodiment, glazing table <b>28</b> is provided with selectively actuated retaining walls (not shown) that engage an exterior surface of opposite walls <b>30</b>. The process then proceeds to step <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">At step <b>104</b>, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, once sash <b>20</b> is properly positioned, positioner assemblies <b>54</b> are actuated such that position members <b>56</b> are lowered from a stored position to an extended position, into sash opening <b>26</b> until tip element <b>58</b> engages glazing leg <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, positioner assemblies <b>54</b> include pneumatically actuated pistons <b>59</b> that are positioned within a positioner housing <b>61</b> that move position members <b>56</b> into the extended position. In addition to contacting glazing leg <b>22</b>, a portion of tip element <b>58</b> also contacts interior surface <b>32</b> of sash opening <b>26</b>. More specifically, in one exemplary embodiment, tip elements <b>58</b> are positioned adjacent to interior surface <b>32</b> of sash opening <b>26</b> that is generally orthogonal to glazing leg <b>22</b>. The process then proceeds to step <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">At step <b>106</b>, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with positioner members <b>56</b> still in the extended position, and before any back bedding glazing compound is applied to sash <b>20</b>, glass layer <b>24</b> is inserted into sash opening <b>26</b>. Glass layer <b>24</b> is then pushed against each of tip elements <b>58</b> with a wedge (not shown) that is pushed against one of the edges of glass layer <b>24</b> that is not contacting tip element <b>58</b> to quickly fix glass layer <b>24</b> in position within sash opening <b>26</b>. However, due to tip elements <b>58</b>, a gap <b>66</b> is created between an outside edge <b>68</b> of glass layer <b>24</b> an interior surface <b>32</b> of sash <b>20</b>. Further, tip elements <b>58</b> also serve to center glass layer <b>24</b> in sash opening <b>26</b>. The process then proceeds to step <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At step <b>108</b>, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an optional depth probe <b>60</b> may be actuated to verify the depth of gap <b>66</b>. During this operation, depth probe <b>60</b> is extended downward into gap <b>66</b> (shown in phantom) until a distal end of depth probe <b>60</b> contacts glazing leg <b>22</b>. Depth probe <b>60</b> is configured with a sensor element to transmit the depth readings to a processing unit that is also in communication with back bedding glazing compound distribution system <b>34</b>. Once the depth of gap <b>66</b> is verified, depth probe <b>60</b> is retracted into a stored position. The process then proceeds to step <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At step <b>110</b> (referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the positioner members <b>56</b> are retracted into the stored position. Next, at step <b>112</b> back bedding glazing compound applicator assembly <b>42</b> is lowered from a stored position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) to a dispensing position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In the dispensing position, a nozzle head <b>200</b> of applicator nozzle assembly <b>48</b> is positioned within gap <b>66</b> (seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Applicator assembly <b>42</b> is lowered into the dispensing position either manually or automatically by a central control processor. In the manual operation, a hand grip <b>45</b> is provided (shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that moves applicator assembly <b>42</b> vertically, as well as laterally. To insure that applicator assembly <b>42</b>, and particularly nozzle head <b>200</b> is properly positioned within gap <b>66</b>, a position indicator <b>62</b> is mounted on one of first and second brackets <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, so as to provide an indication to the user of the placement of nozzle head <b>200</b>. In one particular embodiment, position indicator <b>62</b> is a laser light.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment, nozzle head <b>200</b> is a generally sized to be received within gap <b>66</b> and has an opening <b>202</b> that is in fluid communication with a back bedding glazing compound channel <b>204</b> that extends through nozzle head <b>200</b>. An exemplary embodiment of nozzle head <b>200</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>. In the embodiment shown, nozzle head <b>200</b> has a generally rectangular shape defined by substantially planar major surfaces <b>206</b>. However, the shape of nozzle head <b>200</b> is not limited to the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-12</figref>. Indeed, other exemplary shapes, such as trapezoid, triangular, and semi-circular are also contemplated. In one embodiment, a chamfered edge <b>207</b> may be provided allow for ease of positioning of nozzle head <b>200</b> into gap <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Back bedding glazing compound channel <b>204</b> is formed through a top surface <b>208</b> of nozzle head <b>200</b> and extends through nozzle head <b>200</b> to opening <b>202</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, opening <b>202</b> is configured to extend through a side surface <b>210</b> of nozzle head <b>200</b>, adjacent to a bottom surface <b>212</b> of nozzle head <b>200</b>. As will be explained in further detail below, this arrangement of opening <b>202</b> provides a controlled dispensing of back bedding glazing compound.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>, in one embodiment of applicator nozzle assembly <b>48</b>, a tube member <b>214</b> is fixedly attached to nozzle head <b>200</b>, around back bedding glazing compound channel <b>204</b>. Tube member <b>214</b> is fixedly attached to a connecting member <b>216</b> which secures to an applicator holder <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An embodiment of applicator holder <b>218</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. Applicator holder <b>218</b> includes a connection channel <b>220</b> that is in communication with a mixer channel <b>222</b>. Connecting member <b>216</b> is received within connection channel <b>220</b>. In one embodiment, a distal end of static mixer <b>44</b> (which is positioned within sleeve <b>46</b>) is fixedly secured in mixer channel <b>222</b>. The connection between static mixer <b>44</b> and mixer channel <b>222</b> may be a snap-fit connection. Other suitable connection members may also be used. When both static mixer <b>44</b> and connecting member <b>216</b> are engaged within applicator holder <b>218</b>, opening <b>202</b> in nozzle head <b>200</b> is in fluid communication with static mixer <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Applicator holder <b>218</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 9</figref> further include an optional integral stabilizer mount <b>224</b>. Stabilizer mount <b>224</b> includes a mounting channel <b>226</b> that receives a portion of stabilizer assembly <b>64</b>. An alternative embodiment of applicator holder <b>218</b>&#x2032; is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. As may be seen, applicator holder <b>218</b>&#x2032; does not include stabilizer mount <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> illustrate nozzle assembly <b>48</b> mounted in applicator holder <b>218</b> and nozzle head <b>200</b> being spaced apart from static mixer <b>44</b>, in yet another embodiment, nozzle head <b>200</b> may be directly fixed to a distal end of static mixer <b>44</b>&#x2032;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-22</figref>, static mixer <b>44</b>&#x2032; includes a tubular body <b>300</b> that tapers into a narrow channel <b>302</b> at a distal end <b>304</b> thereof. A proximal end <b>306</b> is open to receive back bedding glazing compound during operation. Omitted for clarity from static mixer <b>44</b> is a series of spiral members that serve to mix the back bedding glazing compound materials, if required. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, distal end <b>304</b> is inserted into back bedding glazing compound channel <b>204</b> formed in nozzle head <b>200</b> and fixedly secured thereto by any suitable means.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref>, at step <b>112</b>, applicator nozzle head <b>200</b> is lowered into the dispensing position, nozzle head <b>200</b> is positioned within gap <b>66</b> created between outside edge <b>68</b> of glass layer <b>24</b> and interior surface <b>32</b> of sash <b>20</b>. As may be seen best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, glazing leg <b>22</b> includes a lip <b>23</b> that is formed along an edge <b>25</b> that extends inwardly toward sash opening <b>26</b>. Lip <b>23</b> cooperates with glass layer <b>24</b> to create a back bedding glazing compound groove <b>27</b> that is in fluid communication with gap <b>66</b>. When applicator nozzle head <b>20</b> is positioned in gap <b>22</b>, opening <b>202</b> in nozzle head <b>20</b> is oriented so as to be directed toward back bedding glazing compound groove <b>27</b>. Then in step <b>114</b>, back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> is pumped through nozzle assembly <b>48</b> and into back bedding glazing compound groove <b>27</b> with sufficient pressure so as to substantially fill back bedding glazing compound groove <b>27</b>. The area that defines back bedding glazing compound groove <b>27</b> is also known as the &#x201c;bite.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Once lowered into gap <b>66</b> and back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> is being dispensed, nozzle assembly <b>48</b> travels around outside edge <b>68</b> of glass layer <b>24</b> so as to extend around the perimeter of glass layer <b>24</b>. To accommodate the corners formed in sash <b>20</b>, nozzle assembly <b>48</b> is lifted and rotated as each reaches each corner. This action is referred to as &#x201c;indexing.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The travel speed of nozzle assembly <b>48</b>, fluid pressure and volumetric flow rate of back bedding glazing compound <b>300</b> are selected depending on the size of sash <b>20</b> and the viscosity of back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b>. In one embodiment, travel speed, fluid pressure and volumetric flow rate are controlled by a central process unit.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, in connection with step <b>112</b>, stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> is also provided that is operably connected to nozzle assembly <b>48</b>. As such, as nozzle assembly <b>48</b> is moved from the stored position to the dispensing position, stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> is also moved into a contacting position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), as will be explained in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An embodiment of stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-18</figref>. Stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> includes stabilizer housing <b>400</b>, a roller or caster ball <b>402</b>, and an actuation member <b>404</b>. Stabilizer housing <b>400</b> is generally hollow and retains roller ball <b>402</b> and actuation member <b>404</b> therein. In operation, actuation member <b>404</b> biases roller ball <b>402</b> partially through an opening <b>406</b> formed in stabilizer housing <b>400</b>. In one embodiment, actuation member <b>404</b> is a spring that may be activated by a plunger (not shown), when in an operation position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> is moved into the operation position, roller ball <b>402</b> extends outwardly from opening <b>406</b> and applies force to a top surface of glass layer <b>24</b> (when placed on glazing table <b>28</b>). In one particular exemplary embodiment, stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> is positioned to be adjacent nozzle assembly <b>48</b>. Moreover, actuating member <b>404</b> acts against roller ball <b>402</b> so as to apply a force normal to glass layer <b>24</b> adjacent the periphery of glass layer <b>24</b>, as back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> is being dispensed by nozzle assembly <b>48</b>. The applied force by stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> prevents back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> from pushing glass layer <b>24</b> upwardly during dispensing. Stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> is configured to travel at the same speed as nozzle assembly to apply a continuous force while back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> is being applied. In one particular embodiment, stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> is configured to apply about 2-20 lbs of force on glass layer <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one exemplary embodiment, to insure that stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> travels with nozzle assembly <b>48</b>, stabilizer housing <b>400</b> may be fixedly mounted to applicator holder <b>218</b>. Thus, as applicator nozzle assembly <b>48</b> travels around glazing leg <b>22</b> that borders sash opening <b>26</b>, stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> will move with nozzle assembly <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another alternative embodiment, instead of providing stabilizer assembly <b>64</b>, mechanically actuated vacuum cups may be applied to the underside of glass layer <b>24</b> to retain glass in place while the back bedding glazing compound dispensing operations proceeds.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">After back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> has been applied to glazing leg along the perimeter of sash opening <b>26</b>, at step <b>116</b>, nozzle assembly <b>48</b> and (if included) stabilizer assembly <b>64</b> are retracted to the stored position.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At step <b>118</b>, the glazed sash is then moved to a transfer conveyor. The transfer conveyor may be configured of sufficient length and operated at a sufficient speed that the back bedding glazing compound is cured prior to the next manufacturing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Because back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> is not applied until after glass layer <b>24</b> is properly centered within sash opening <b>26</b>, and because back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> is being applied substantially directly and simultaneously to glass layer <b>24</b> and glazing leg <b>22</b>, a suitable back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> may be used that significantly reduces the cure time required by prior art glazing methods. More specifically, a back bedding glazing compound <b>350</b> that has a cure time of five minutes or less may be used. An example of such back bedding glazing compound is sold under the trade name Sikasil&#xa9; WT-490 manufactured by the owner of the present application. Due to a shorter cure time, the cumbersome process of continuously loading glazed sashes onto curing pallets may be eliminated at considerable savings.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">While the disclosure has been described in connection with a single glass layer <b>24</b>, it is understood that the process of glazing using an insulating glass unit is also within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
