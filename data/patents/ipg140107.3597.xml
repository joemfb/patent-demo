<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Semiconductor electronic devices and components, and a variety of circuit applications in which the devices and components may be utilized are described.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">To date, most transistors used in power electronic applications have typically been fabricated with silicon (Si) semiconductor materials. Common transistor devices for power applications include Si CoolMOS, Si Power MOSFETs, and Si Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs). While Si power devices are inexpensive, they suffer from a number of disadvantages, including relatively low switching speeds and high levels of electrical noise. More recently, silicon carbide (SiC) power devices have been considered due to their superior properties. III-N semiconductor devices, such as gallium nitride (GaN) devices, are now emerging as attractive candidates to carry large currents, support high voltages and to provide very low on-resistance and fast switching times.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most conventional III-N high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) and related transistor devices are normally on, i.e., have a negative threshold voltage, which means that they can conduct current at zero gate voltage. These devices with negative threshold voltages are known as depletion-mode (D-mode) devices. It is preferable in power electronics to have normally off devices, i.e., devices with positive threshold voltages, that cannot conduct current at zero gate voltage, in order to avoid damage to the device or to other circuit components by preventing accidental turn on of the device. Normally off devices are commonly referred to as enhancement-mode (E-mode) devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reliable fabrication and manufacturing of high-voltage III-N E-mode devices has thus far proven to be very difficult. One alternative to a single high-voltage E-mode device is to combine a high-voltage D-mode device with a low-voltage E-mode device in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to form a hybrid device, which in many cases achieves the same or similar output characteristics as a single high-voltage E-mode device, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The hybrid device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> and a low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> both encased in a package <b>10</b>, the package including a source lead <b>11</b>, a gate lead <b>12</b>, and a drain lead <b>13</b>. The source electrode of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> and the gate electrode of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> are both electrically connected to the source lead <b>11</b>. The gate electrode of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> is electrically connected to the gate lead <b>12</b>. The drain electrode of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> is electrically connected to the drain lead <b>13</b>. The source electrode of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> is electrically connected to the drain electrode of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes a single high-voltage E-mode transistor <b>21</b> encased in the same or a similar package to the hybrid device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The source electrode of the high-voltage E-mode transistor <b>21</b> is connected to the source lead <b>11</b>, the gate electrode of the high-voltage E-mode transistor <b>21</b> is connected to the gate lead <b>12</b>, and the drain electrode of the high-voltage E-mode transistor <b>21</b> is connected to the drain lead <b>13</b>. Both of the devices in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> are capable of blocking high voltages between the source lead <b>11</b> and drain lead <b>13</b> when 0V is applied to the gate lead <b>12</b> relative to the source lead <b>11</b>, and both devices can conduct current from the source lead <b>11</b> to the drain lead <b>13</b> when a sufficiently positive voltage is applied to the gate lead <b>12</b> relative to the source lead <b>11</b>. While there are many conventional applications in which the hybrid device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be used in place of the single high-voltage E-mode device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there are certain applications in which modifications and/or improvements to the structure of the hybrid device are necessary in order to achieve the desired output.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another aspect, an electronic component is described that includes a high-voltage depletion-mode transistor, a low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor, and a single package enclosing both the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor and the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor. A source electrode of the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor is electrically connected to a drain electrode of the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor, a drain electrode of the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor is electrically connected to a drain lead of the single package, a gate electrode of the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor is electrically connected to a gate lead of the single package, a gate electrode of the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor is electrically connected to an additional lead of the single package, and a source electrode of the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor is electrically connected to a source lead of the single package.</p>

A maximum current that can flow through the electronic component may be smaller when a voltage of the additional lead is less than a voltage of the source lead as compared to when the voltage of the additional lead is equal to the voltage of the source lead. The device can include a capacitor, wherein a first end of the capacitor is electrically connected to the gate electrode of the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor, and a second end of the capacitor is electrically connected to the source electrode of the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor. The single package can enclose the capacitor. The high-voltage depletion-mode transistor can be a III-Nitride transistor. The low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor can be a silicon-based transistor or a III-Nitride transistor. The device can include resistor, wherein a first end of the resistor is electrically connected to the additional lead of the single package, and a second end of the resistor is electrically connected to the conductive structural portion of the single package. The single package can further comprise a source lead that is electrically connected to the conductive structural portion of the single package, and the second end of the resistor is directly connected to the source lead. The resistor can be external to the single package. A short-circuit survivability of the electronic component can be at least 10 microseconds when a voltage of the gate lead relative to a voltage of the conductive structural portion of the single package is greater than a threshold voltage of the electronic component, a high voltage is applied to the drain lead relative to the conductive structural portion of the single package, and a voltage of the additional lead is less than the voltage of the conductive structural portion of the single package. The voltage of the additional lead can be at least about 1V less than the voltage of the conductive structural portion of the single package.

Methods can include at a second time switching the voltage of the gate lead relative to the conductive structural portion of the single package to a value that is greater than the threshold voltage of the electronic component, allowing a current to flow through the electronic component. The single package can further comprise a source lead, and the source lead is electrically connected to the conductive structural portion of the single package. Electrically connecting the source electrode of the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor to the conductive structural portion of the single package can comprise electrically connecting the source electrode of the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor to the source lead of the single package. The high-voltage depletion-mode transistor and the resistor can be on a common substrate. The high-voltage depletion-mode transistor and the resistor can comprise a same semiconductor layer structure. The high-voltage depletion-mode transistor and the resistor can comprise III-N semiconductor materials. The high-voltage depletion-mode transistor can comprise a semiconductor layer structure, and the resistor can comprise a conducting or semiconducting layer which is on the semiconductor layer structure. The resistor can have a resistance of between about 100 Ohms and 100 kOhms. A short-circuit survivability of the electronic component can be at least 10 microseconds when a voltage of the gate lead relative to a voltage of the source lead of the single package is greater than a threshold voltage of the electronic component, a high voltage is applied to the drain lead relative to the source lead of the single package, and a voltage of the gate electrode of the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor is less than the voltage of the source lead of the single package. The voltage of the additional lead can be at least about 1V less than the voltage of the source lead of the single package. A maximum current that can flow through the electronic component can be smaller when a voltage of the additional lead is less than a voltage of the source lead as compared to when the voltage of the additional lead is equal to the voltage of the source lead.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantages of the electronic components described herein, and the methods for operating the electronic components, can include one or more of the following. The slew rate of the electronic components can be limited, which may result in lower electromagnetic interference (EMI) during or immediately after switching, as well as preventing malfunction of the gate drive circuit that may be connected to the components. The maximum current that may flow through the electronic components can be limited, which can prevent damage to the electronic components in case of failure of the external circuit, such as by increasing the short-circuit survivability of the electronic components.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Described herein are packaged hybrid enhancement-mode electronic components which include a high-voltage depletion-mode transistor and a low-voltage enhancement mode transistor, both of which are encased or encapsulated in a single package. The electronic components furthermore either include an integrated resistor connected to the gate electrode of the depletion-mode transistor, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or are configured so that the gate electrode of the depletion-mode transistor is electrically connected to a lead of the single package but is not electrically connected to any of the other electrodes of either transistor, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. For electronic components with an integrated resistor, the resistor can limit the slew rate immediately after the input voltage of the electronic component is switched, which can result in less generation of electrical noise or electromagnetic interference (EMI), as well as preventing malfunction of the gate drive circuit. For electronic components in which the gate electrode of the depletion-mode transistor is electrically connected to a lead of the single package but is not electrically connected to any of the other electrodes of either transistor (i.e., the electronic component of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), a resistor can optionally be externally connected (i.e., external to the single package, such that the resistor is not contained within the case of the single package) to the gate electrode of the depletion-mode transistor to achieve the same benefits as that for electronic components with an integrated resistor, and additionally allow for user selection of the value of the gate resistance in order to optimize circuit performance. Furthermore, the electronic component of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> can be configured as a current limiter in order to limit the current that can flow in case of failure of the external circuit, thereby preventing large currents that may further damage the circuit or other external components. These electronic components and their applications are further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, two or more contacts or other items such as conductive layers or components are said to be &#x201c;electrically connected&#x201d; if they are connected by a material which is sufficiently conducting to ensure that the electric potential at each of the contacts or other items is intended to be the same, i.e., is about the same, at all times under any bias conditions. As used herein, a &#x201c;hybrid enhancement-mode electronic device or component&#x201d; is an electronic device or component formed of a high-voltage depletion-mode transistor and a low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor configured such that the component can operate similarly to a single high-voltage enhancement-mode transistor. That is, a hybrid enhancement-mode device or component includes at least 3 nodes having the following properties. When the first node (source node) and second node (gate node) are held at the same voltage, the hybrid enhancement-mode device or component can block a positive high voltage applied to the third node (drain node) relative to the source node. When the gate node is held at a sufficiently positive voltage relative to the source node, current passes from the source node to the drain node or from the drain node to the source node when a sufficiently large positive voltage is applied to the drain node relative to the source node. As used herein, &#x201c;blocking a voltage&#x201d; refers to the ability of a transistor, device, or component to prevent significant current, such as current that is greater than 0.001 times the operating current during regular conduction, from flowing through the transistor, device, or component when a voltage is applied across the transistor, device, or component. In other words, while a transistor, device, or component is blocking a voltage that is applied across it, the total current passing through the transistor, device, or component will not be greater than 0.001 times the operating current during regular conduction.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, a &#x201c;high-voltage device&#x201d;, such as a high-voltage transistor, is an electronic device which is optimized for high-voltage switching applications. That is, when the transistor is off, it is capable of blocking high voltages, such as about 300V or higher, about 600V or higher, or about 1200V or higher, and when the transistor is on, it has a sufficiently low on-resistance (R<sub>ON</sub>) for the application in which it is used, i.e., it experiences sufficiently low conduction loss when a substantial current passes through the device. A high-voltage device can at least be capable of blocking a voltage equal to the high-voltage supply or the maximum voltage in the circuit for which it is used. A high-voltage device may be capable of blocking 300V, 600V, 1200V, or other suitable blocking voltage required by the application. In other words, a high-voltage device can block all voltages between 0V and at least V<sub>max</sub>, where V<sub>max </sub>is the maximum voltage that can be supplied by the circuit or power supply, and V<sub>max </sub>can for example be 300V, 600V, 1200V, or other suitable blocking voltage required by the application. In some implementations, a high-voltage device can block any voltage between 0V and at least 2*V<sub>max</sub>. As used herein, a &#x201c;low-voltage device&#x201d;, such as a low-voltage transistor, is an electronic device which is capable of blocking low voltages, such as between 0V and V<sub>low</sub>, (where V<sub>low </sub>is less than V<sub>max</sub>), but is not capable of blocking voltages higher than V<sub>low</sub>. In some implementations, V<sub>low </sub>is equal to about |V<sub>th</sub>|, about 2*|V<sub>th</sub>|, about 3*|V<sub>th</sub>|, or between about |V<sub>th</sub>| and 3*|V<sub>th</sub>|, where |V<sub>th</sub>| is the absolute value of the threshold voltage of a high-voltage transistor contained within the circuit in which the low-voltage device is used. In other implementations, V<sub>low </sub>is about 10V, about 20V, about 30V, about 40V, or between about 5V and 50V, such as between about 10V and 30V. In yet other implementations, V<sub>low </sub>is less than about 0.5*V<sub>max</sub>, less than about 0.3*V<sub>max</sub>, less than about 0.1*V<sub>max</sub>, less than about 0.05*V<sub>max</sub>, or less than about 0.02*V<sub>max</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One difference between the devices of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is that every transistor electrode in the E-mode device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is accessible to an end user, whereas there are several electrodes in the hybrid device that are inaccessible. For example, a user could directly apply any voltage or connect an external component to any of the electrodes of the high-voltage E-mode transistor <b>21</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by applying the desired voltage or connecting the external component to the associated package lead. For the hybrid device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a user could directly apply any voltage or connect an external component to the source and gate electrodes of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> and to the gate and drain electrodes of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b>, but not to the drain electrode of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> or to the source electrode of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b>. Furthermore, the voltage applied to the gate electrode of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> is limited to always being the same as the voltage applied to the source electrode of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b>, since these two electrodes are both electrically connected to the same package lead. Similarly, any external component connected to the gate electrode of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> would also be connected to the source electrode of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In many circuits, one or more high-voltage E-mode transistors such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> will have their gate electrodes driven by an external gate-drive circuit. That is, an output node of the gate-drive circuit is electrically connected to the gate electrode or gate lead <b>12</b> of the high-voltage E-mode transistor and applies voltage signals to the gate. For many applications, it is desirable to insert a resistor (i.e., a gate resistor) electrically between the gate electrode of the E-mode transistor and the output node of the gate-drive circuit. That is, instead of connecting the output node of the gate drive-circuit directly to gate lead <b>12</b> of the E-mode transistor, one end of a gate resistor is electrically connected to the gate lead <b>12</b> of the E-mode transistor, and the output node of the gate-drive circuit is connected to the opposite end of the gate resistor. A single E-mode transistor such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> typically has a substantial input-to-output capacitance (i.e., Miller capacitance) between the gate and drain electrodes, which in the absence of a gate resistor leads to large transient gate currents and large transient drain voltage gradients (i.e., high slew rates) immediately after the transistor is switched. The large transient gate currents and/or large transient drain voltage gradients can damage or interfere with the gate drive circuit, and the high slew rates can additionally cause intolerably high levels of EMI. Adding a gate resistor to the charge/discharge path of the Miller capacitance in the E-mode transistor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as described above, can limit the slew rate and reduce transient gate currents during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">If a hybrid enhancement-mode electronic device, such as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is used in place of the E-mode transistor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the Miller capacitance between the input and output, which for this device is the capacitance between the gate electrode of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> and the drain electrode of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b>, is typically not substantially large. Hence, connecting a gate resistor between the input of the hybrid enhancement-mode electronic device (i.e., the gate electrode of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b>) and the node driving the input may not substantially affect the slew rate. However, a substantial capacitance does exist between the gate and drain electrodes of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b>. Hence, inserting a gate resistor electrically between the gate electrode of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> and the source electrode of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> would achieve the desired effect of reducing the slew rate. However, the hybrid enhancement-mode electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> does not include means by which a gate resistor could be connected in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of an electronic component <b>25</b> which includes a high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b>, a low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b>, and a resistor <b>24</b>, all encased, enclosed, or encapsulated in a single package <b>10</b>. The electronic component <b>25</b> includes a hybrid enhancement-mode electronic device with a gate resistor, all encased, enclosed, or encapsulated in a single package. An exposed plan view of the electronic component <b>25</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, illustrates portions of the single package <b>10</b> along with the electronic devices which are encased, enclosed, or encapsulated within the single package <b>10</b>. A perspective view of the single package <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and an alternative single package <b>10</b>&#x2032; that can be used in place of single package <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The single package <b>10</b>, illustrated in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, includes encapsulating structural portions, such as a case <b>34</b> and a package base <b>33</b>, as well as non-structural portions, such as leads <b>11</b>-<b>13</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;structural portions&#x201d; of a package are portions which form the basic shape or molding of the package and provide the structural rigidity of the package necessary to protect the enclosed devices. In many cases, when an electronic component which includes a package is used in a discrete circuit, a structural portion of the package is directly mounted to the circuit or circuit board. In the single package <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the package base <b>33</b> is formed of an electrically conducting material, i.e., the package base <b>33</b> is an electrically conductive structural portion of the package, and the case <b>34</b> is formed of an insulating material. The single package includes three leads, a gate lead <b>12</b>, a drain lead <b>13</b>, and a source lead <b>11</b>. In some implementations, the source lead <b>11</b> is omitted. The leads <b>11</b>-<b>13</b> are each formed of an electrically conducting material. The source lead <b>11</b>, when included, can be either electrically connected to the package base <b>33</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or can alternatively be electrically isolated from the package base <b>33</b>. The gate and drain leads <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, respectively, are electrically isolated from the package base <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, a &#x201c;single package&#x201d; is a package containing, enclosing, encapsulating, or encasing one or more electronic devices or components. A single package includes structural portions, such as the package base <b>33</b> and case <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which completely surround the enclosed devices or components. A single package also includes conducting leads which are at least partially on an opposite side of the structural portion material from the enclosed electronic devices or components, the leads being electrically connected to some or all of the enclosed electronic devices or components. Thus, a user wanting to connect an external device or circuit component to one of the electrodes of the enclosed devices or components can connect the external device or circuit component to the package lead which is connected to the desired electrode of the enclosed device. In some implementations, the enclosed or encapsulated devices or components are not each individually encased or encapsulated in a package separate from one another. That is, a single package can have a perimeter within which the one or more electronic devices are located and there is no packaging separating or in the space between one of the electronic devices and another of the electronic devices within the single package. The structural portions of the single package, such as the package base <b>33</b> and case <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, can form a single cavity in which the electronic devices or components are enclosed. In some implementations, the electronic devices or components contained in the package can be supported by the package base <b>33</b>, and a single case <b>34</b> can be molded around the enclosed electronic devices or components, such that the single package does not contain any cavity or cavities (i.e., the single package is free of any cavity or cavities), and the case material contacts the enclosed electronic devices or components. The footprint of the case <b>34</b>, i.e., the area of the case as measured parallel to a main surface of the package base <b>33</b>, may be less than 900 square millimeters, less than 400 square millimeters, or less than 100 square millimeters. The enclosed electronic devices or components can be supported by the package base <b>33</b>. In some implementations, there is no package base material or case material between any of the electronic devices, i.e., if there is a cavity formed by the case <b>34</b> the cavity is a continuous cavity. The connections between the various electronic devices or components enclosed in the single package can be wire bonds or can be formed by wire bonding. In some implementations, one or more of the enclosed electronic devices or components are formed on a common substrate or share a common material layer, in which case connections between electrodes can be lithographically defined. In some implementations, connections between various enclosed electronic devices or components to one another, or to portions of the package, are not formed by circuit traces on a circuit board. That is, the interior of the cavity in the single package can be free of circuit traces, i.e., conductive trace lines that are deposited on a circuit board. A single package has mechanical integrity without inclusion of any additional casing.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an alternative single package <b>10</b>&#x2032; that can be used in place of single package <b>10</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The single package <b>10</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is similar to single package <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, except that the package base <b>33</b> and case <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are replaced by a conducting case <b>133</b>, i.e., an electrically conductive structural portion, which completely surrounds the enclosed devices. In the single package <b>10</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the source lead <b>11</b>, when included, is either electrically connected to the conducting case <b>133</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, or can alternatively be electrically isolated from the conducting case <b>133</b>. The gate and drain leads <b>12</b> and <b>13</b>, respectively, are both electrically isolated from the conducting case <b>133</b> by electrically insulating material <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b> can be a field-effect transistor (FET), such as a high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT), a heterojunction field-effect transistor (HFET), a JFET, a MESFET, a CAVET, or any other FET structure suitable for power switching applications. In some implementations, the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b> is a III-Nitride or III-N transistor, such as a III-N FET, a III-N HEMT, a III-N HFET, a III-N POLFET, a III-N JFET, a III-N MESFET, a III-N CAVET, or any other III-N structure suitable for power switching applications. When a III-N transistor is used, it may be a III-face device (i.e., electrodes are formed on a group III face of the III-N layers) or a N-face device (i.e., electrodes are formed on an N face of the III-N layers). As used herein, the terms III-Nitride or III-N materials, layers, devices, structures, etc., refer to a material, device, or structure comprised of a compound semiconductor material according to the stoichiometric formula Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N, where x+y+z is about 1.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When a III-N transistor is used for high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b>, the III-N transistor can be a lateral device with an insulating or semi-insulating portion on an opposite side of the semiconductor body from all of the electrodes, such as the III-N HEMT <b>23</b>&#x2032; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In some implementations, a semi-insulating layer is formed by doping a semiconductor layer to render the layer electrically insulating, although not as insulating as some insulating materials. The III-N HEMT <b>23</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes an insulating or semi-insulating portion <b>61</b>, a semiconductor body <b>62</b> which includes a III-N buffer layer <b>63</b>, such as a layer of GaN, and a III-N barrier layer <b>64</b>, such as a layer of AlGaN, a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel <b>65</b>, a source electrode <b>45</b>, a gate electrode <b>46</b>, and a drain electrode <b>47</b>. The III-N HEMT can optionally include a conducting or semi-conducting portion <b>66</b>, such as a silicon substrate on an opposite side of insulating or semi-insulating portion <b>61</b> from the semiconductor body <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some implementations, conducting or semi-conducting portion <b>66</b> is not included, and the insulating or semi-insulating portion <b>61</b> is an insulating or semi-insulating substrate or carrier wafer. In other implementations, conducting or semi-conducting portion <b>66</b> is included and is a silicon substrate or an electrically conducting carrier wafer, and the insulating or semi-insulating portion <b>61</b> is an insulating or semi-insulating III-N layer. As used herein, a &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; is a material layer on top of which semiconductor material layers of a semiconductor device are epitaxially grown such that the crystalline structure of the portion of semiconductor material contacting or adjacent to the substrate at least partially conforms to or is at least partially determined by the crystalline structure of the substrate. In some implementations, the substrate does not contribute to any conduction of current through the semiconductor device. Having the III-N transistor be a lateral device with an insulating or semi-insulating portion on an opposite side of the semiconductor body <b>62</b> from all of the electrodes can be advantageous. When mounting the III-N transistor inside the package, the surface of the device on a side opposite the electrodes, i.e., surface <b>68</b>, can be mounted directly to the package base <b>33</b> without requiring an insulating spacer, such as a &#x201c;shim&#x201d;, between the III-N transistor and the package base <b>33</b>. For example, when conducting or semi-conducting portion <b>66</b> is not included, the insulating or semi-insulating portion <b>61</b> can be mounted directly to the package base <b>33</b> without requiring an insulating spacer between the III-N transistor and the package base <b>33</b>, and when conducting or semi-conducting portion <b>66</b> is included, the conducting or semi-conducting portion <b>66</b> can be mounted directly to the package base <b>33</b> without requiring an insulating spacer between the III-N transistor and the package base <b>33</b>. Transistors which are currently used in conventional power switching circuits, for example Si CoolMOS transistors, are typically vertical devices with electrodes on both sides of the semiconductor body, and therefore may require an insulating spacer between the transistor and the package base, which can result in poorer dissipation of heat generated during operation of the transistor and in some cases can result in more EMI produced during circuit operation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A III-N transistor used for high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b> may also include additional features for power switching applications. These can include, but are not limited to, insulating layers between the gate and the semiconductor body, surface passivation layers, field plates, recesses in the semiconductor body beneath the gate, and additional semiconductor layers, such as an AlN layer between the III-N buffer layer <b>63</b> and the III-N barrier layer <b>64</b>, or a III-N back-barrier layer between the 2DEG <b>65</b> and the insulating or semi-insulating portion <b>61</b> or between the 2DEG <b>65</b> and the conducting or semi-conducting portion <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b> has a positive threshold voltage V<sub>th</sub>, such as about 1V or higher, about 1.5V or higher, or about 2V or higher. The low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b> can block any voltage between 0V and at least |V<sub>th</sub>|, where |V<sub>th</sub>| is the magnitude (absolute value) of the threshold voltage of the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b>. Typical III-N depletion-mode transistor threshold voltages V<sub>th </sub>for high-voltage devices are about &#x2212;5 to &#x2212;10V (depletion-mode=negative V<sub>th</sub>). Hence, when a III-N transistor is used for high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b>, the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b> may be capable of blocking any voltage between 0V and at least 5V, 0V and at least 10V, or 0V and at least 20V. In some implementations, the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b> can block any voltage between 0V and at least about 2*|V<sub>th</sub>|. The low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b> is hence a low-voltage device, as the voltages that it must be capable of blocking are substantially less than the circuit high voltage. In some implementations, the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b> is a Si MOS transistor, while in other implementations it is a III-N transistor, such as a III-N HEMT. In yet other implementations, the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b> is a nitrogen-face or N-face III-N transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The resistance value of the resistor <b>24</b> in part determines the maximum slew rate of the circuit. For a given circuit, a larger resistance value R for resistor <b>24</b> results in a lower maximum slew rate. In most cases, the resistance R multiplied by the gate capacitance of the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b> is proportional to the maximum slew rate. In some implementations, the resistor value is between about 100 Ohms and 100 kOhms.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electronic devices encased or enclosed within the single package <b>10</b> in the electronic component <b>25</b> are mounted inside the single package and connected as follows. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, electrical connectors <b>52</b>-<b>57</b>, which can be single or multiple wire bonds, are used to electrically connect portions of the single package <b>10</b>, the low-voltage enhancement-mode (E-mode) transistor <b>22</b>, the high-voltage depletion-mode (D-mode) transistor <b>23</b>, and the resistor <b>24</b> to one another.

Electrode <b>48</b>&#x2032; is electrically connected to the gate electrode <b>46</b> of the III-N HEMT <b>23</b>&#x2032;, for example by an interconnect <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some implementations, the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b> and the resistor <b>24</b> both share or are formed on a common substrate, but are formed of different materials or material layers. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a single component <b>84</b>&#x2032; which includes the III-N HEMT <b>23</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and a resistor <b>24</b>&#x2033;. The resistor <b>24</b>&#x2033; is formed of a conducting or semiconducting layer <b>112</b> which can be deposited on the III-N material layers that are used to form III-N HEMT <b>23</b>&#x2032;. The resistor includes electrodes <b>48</b>&#x2032; and <b>49</b>&#x2032; which form ohmic contacts to the conducting or semiconducting layer <b>112</b>.

Integrating the high-voltage depletion-transistor and the resistor into a single component can simplify packaging and reduce costs.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In other implementations, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>, an electronic component <b>85</b> includes a high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b> and a low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b> both encased, enclosed, or encapsulated in a single package <b>90</b>. The electronic component <b>85</b> may optionally include a capacitor <b>5</b> encased, enclosed, or encapsulated in the single package <b>90</b>, as will be described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a schematic diagram of electronic component <b>85</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows opposite ends of a resistor <b>24</b> connected to leads <b>11</b> and <b>14</b> of the single package of electronic component <b>85</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is an exposed plan view of the electronic component <b>85</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective view of the single package <b>90</b>. The single package <b>90</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, is similar to package <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, but further includes an additional lead <b>14</b> which is electrically isolated from the package base <b>33</b>. Alternatively, the package base <b>33</b> and case <b>34</b> could be replaced by a single conducting case, i.e., an electrically conductive structural portion, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, which completely surrounds the enclosed transistors, in which case the source lead <b>11</b> is either electrically connected to or electrically isolated from the conducting case, and all other leads are electrically isolated from the conducting case. The requirements for the high-voltage depletion-mode transistor <b>23</b> and for the low-voltage enhancement-mode transistor <b>22</b> are the same as those previously described for electronic component <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The electronic devices encased or enclosed within the single package <b>90</b> in the electronic component <b>85</b> are mounted inside the single package <b>90</b> and connected as follows. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, electrical connectors <b>92</b>-<b>97</b>, which can be single or multiple wire bonds, are used to electrically connect portions of the single package <b>90</b>, the low-voltage enhancement-mode (E-mode) transistor <b>22</b>, the high-voltage depletion-mode (D-mode) transistor <b>23</b>, and the capacitor <b>5</b> (when included) to one another. When III-N transistors with semi-insulating substrates are used for either or both the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> or the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b>, the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> and/or the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> can be mounted inside the package with their respective insulating or semi-insulating substrates in contact with the package base <b>23</b>. When a capacitor <b>5</b> is included, the capacitor <b>5</b> can be mounted inside the package with a first electrode in contact with the package base <b>23</b>. The source electrode <b>42</b> of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> is electrically connected to a conductive structural portion of the package such as the package base <b>33</b>, for example by conductive connector <b>95</b>, or can alternatively be electrically connected to source lead <b>11</b> of the package. In some implementations, the source electrode <b>42</b> of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> is electrically connected to a conductive structural portion of the package such as the package base <b>33</b>, and the package does not include a source lead. In this case, the package may only include three leads; a gate lead <b>12</b>, a drain lead <b>13</b>, and an additional lead <b>14</b>. The gate electrode <b>43</b> of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> is electrically connected to the gate lead <b>12</b> of the package, such as by conductive connector <b>94</b>. The drain electrode <b>44</b> of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> is electrically connected to the source electrode <b>45</b> of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b>, such as by conductive connector <b>92</b>. The drain electrode <b>47</b> of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> is electrically connected to drain lead <b>13</b> of the package, such as by conductive connector <b>96</b>. The gate electrode <b>46</b> of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> is electrically connected to the additional lead <b>14</b> of the package, such as by conductive connector <b>93</b>. The gate electrode <b>46</b> of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> is electrically connected to a lead of the single package, but is not electrically connected to any of the other electrodes of either transistor and in some implementations is not connected to any electrodes of any other transistors within the package (for example, when additional transistors are also included within the package). The second electrode of the capacitor is electrically connected to the gate electrode <b>46</b> of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b>, such as by conductive connector <b>97</b>, or can alternatively be electrically connected to the additional lead <b>14</b> of the package.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a resistor <b>24</b> can be at one end electrically connected to the additional lead <b>14</b> and at the other end electrically connected to source lead <b>11</b>, which can limit the slew rate and reduce gate currents, similar to the advantages achieved by the resistor <b>24</b> in electronic component <b>25</b>. In this implementation, a capacitor <b>5</b> is not included. Furthermore, in this implementation the user can choose the specific value of resistor <b>24</b> instead of being confined to the value of the pre-installed encapsulated resistor <b>24</b> as in electronic component <b>25</b>, thereby allowing for greater flexibility in circuit design. However, including a resistor <b>24</b> within the package, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, may be preferable in that parasitic inductances may be reduced, which can improve the circuit performance.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Electronic component <b>85</b> may further be operated as a current limiter to limit the current that can flow through the circuit in case of failure of the external circuit, such as short-circuiting of the load. This method of operation, which is achieved by applying a negative voltage to the additional lead <b>14</b> relative to the source lead <b>11</b>, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>. In conventional devices used for current limiting, the maximum current can generally only be reduced or limited at the expense of the on-state voltage, which is the voltage drop across the high-current terminals (drain to source, collector to emitter) while normal rated current is flowing. In other words, reducing the maximum current that can flow through a conventional device, either by modifying the device design or bias conditions, typically results in an increase in the device on-resistance or on-state voltage, which increases power loss during operation. A conventional device with a lower current limit will have a higher voltage drop in the on state, all other parameters being equal.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In electronic component <b>85</b>, because the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> provides the high-voltage blocking capability, it will normally have the larger contribution to the on-resistance of the composite device. That resistance, however, is often dominated by resistance of a drift region which provides the high-voltage capability, rather than the channel of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b>, which is directly modulated by the gate of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b>. Therefore, the gate of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> may be used to limit the maximum current without appreciably increasing the on-state resistance of the electronic component <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, when electronic component <b>85</b> drives a load <b>102</b>, which can be an inductive load, source lead <b>11</b> can be connected to ground, drain lead <b>13</b> can be connected to one end of the load <b>102</b>, and the opposite end of the load <b>102</b> can be connected to the circuit high voltage supply <b>103</b>. The gate of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> can be held at a lower voltage than the source of the low-voltage E-mode transistor <b>22</b> by a voltage supply <b>101</b>, which is at one end connected to source lead <b>11</b> and at an opposite end connected to additional lead <b>14</b>. Alternatively, other methods can be used to maintain the voltage difference between source lead <b>11</b> and additional lead <b>14</b>. For example, rather than using a voltage source to directly apply a negative voltage to the additional lead <b>14</b>, a voltage divider circuit may be used to maintain the voltage difference between source lead <b>11</b> and additional lead <b>14</b>. If the load <b>102</b> becomes a short circuit or becomes bypassed by a short circuit, which may for example occur during or after circuit failure, the maximum allowable current of the electronic component <b>85</b> will flow through the electronic component <b>85</b> and any other devices or components which are in series with the current path. The value of the voltage difference between the source and gate electrodes of the high-voltage D-mode transistor <b>23</b> directly controls the magnitude of this current. The more negative the voltage at the gate electrode relative to the source electrode, the smaller the maximum current that can flow. It can furthermore be advantageous to include capacitor <b>5</b> when electronic component <b>85</b> is operated as a current limiter in order to further stabilize the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The electronic component <b>85</b> is capable of limiting the maximum current with only a minimal increase in the on-state voltage drop or on resistance, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows simulated current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for electronic component <b>85</b> when 0V is applied to lead <b>14</b> relative to lead <b>11</b>, where the current I is the simulated current flowing into or out of drain lead <b>13</b>, and the voltage V is applied between source lead <b>11</b> and drain lead <b>13</b>. Each of the curves <b>201</b>-<b>205</b> corresponds to a different voltage V<sub>g </sub>applied to gate lead <b>12</b>, where V<sub>g </sub>equals 2V for curve <b>201</b>, 2.4V for curve <b>202</b>, 2.8V for curve <b>203</b>, 3.2V for curve <b>204</b>, and 3.6V for curve <b>205</b>. The on-resistance is determined by the slope of the I-V curve at small values of applied voltage V when the gate voltage V<sub>g </sub>is held high (such as 3.6V), i.e., the slope of line <b>208</b>. More specifically, the on-resistance R<sub>on</sub>=1/(slope of line <b>208</b>). As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, when the electronic component is operated such that the gate voltage V<sub>g </sub>in the on state is 3.6V, the maximum current able to flow through the device is about 28 Amps and the on-resistance is about 0.043 Ohms. The simulated I-V characteristics of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> are for the same component as those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the only difference in the simulations being that now &#x2212;4.5V is applied to lead <b>14</b> relative to lead <b>11</b>. As seen, the maximum current able to flow through the device is about 18 Amps, or about 36% lower than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, while the on-resistance (given by the inverse of the slope of line <b>308</b>) is only slightly higher than in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">One reason to limit the current in a circuit is to ensure that the electronic devices included in the circuit are not damaged in the event that one of the circuit components is short circuited for some amount of time. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, if the load <b>102</b> becomes short circuited for some amount of time during circuit operation, the maximum current that is able to flow through electronic component <b>85</b> will flow for the duration of the time that electronic component <b>85</b> is short circuited. Reducing the maximum current increases the length of time that the maximum current can flow through electronic component <b>85</b> without damaging any of the electronic devices contained within the single package (i.e., increases the short-circuit survivability).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> show measurements of the short-circuit survivability of electronic component <b>85</b> operated at different maximum currents (i.e., different voltages applied to lead <b>14</b> of the package). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, lead <b>14</b> was biased at 0V (grounded) and drain lead <b>13</b> was biased at 300V (the load <b>102</b> was omitted), while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, lead <b>14</b> was biased at &#x2212;5V and drain lead <b>14</b> was biased at 400V (the load <b>102</b> was omitted). The negative voltage applied to lead <b>14</b> for the measurement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> results in a smaller maximum current for the measurement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> as compared to the measurement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. For both measurements, source lead <b>11</b> was grounded. In both measurements, the gate lead <b>12</b> was initially held at 0V, at time t=0 seconds was switched on (to a value greater than the threshold voltage of electronic component <b>85</b>), and at time t=10 microseconds was switched back to 0V. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, at time t=2 microseconds, the current <b>311</b> flowing through electronic component <b>85</b> drastically increased (the current level exceeded the axis limits of the plot) and the voltage <b>312</b> across the electronic component <b>85</b> began to drop, indicating that one or more of the devices in electronic component <b>85</b> were damaged. When the gate voltage was switched back to 0V at t=10 microseconds, substantial current <b>311</b> continued to flow, further indicative of damage to the devices. Hence the short-circuit survivability in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> was about 2 microseconds for a source-drain voltage of 300V.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, between t=0 and t=10 microseconds, the current <b>311</b> decreased monotonically and the voltage <b>312</b> across the electronic component <b>85</b> remained constant at 400V, indicating that the electronic component <b>85</b> was not damaged during this time and was operating properly. Furthermore, after the gate voltage was switched back to 0V at t=10 microseconds, the voltage <b>312</b> across the electronic component <b>85</b> remained constant at 400V and no substantial current <b>311</b> continued to flow through electronic component <b>85</b>, indicating that the electronic component <b>85</b> was still not damaged and was operating properly. Hence the short-circuit survivability in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> was at least 10 microseconds for a source-drain voltage of 400V. As such, when electronic component <b>85</b> is described as operated with a negative voltage applied to lead <b>14</b> relative to lead <b>11</b>, as described above, the short-circuit survivability can be at least 10 microseconds for a source-drain voltage of at least about 300V or at least about 400V. In some implementations, the voltage applied to lead <b>14</b> is at least about 1V less than that applied to lead <b>11</b>, at least about 3V less than that applied to lead <b>11</b>, or at least about 5V less than that applied to lead <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the techniques and devices described herein. For example, when the high-voltage D-Mode transistor and the resistor of component <b>25</b> are integrated such that they share the same semiconductor materials, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the semiconductor materials do not need to be III-N materials, but can be formed of other materials, such as silicon, III-As, or III-P materials. The low-voltage E-mode transistor in electronic component <b>85</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, can be replaced by a bipolar transistor, such as an n-p-n bipolar transistor, when the electronic component <b>85</b> is used in current limiting applications.
