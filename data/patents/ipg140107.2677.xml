<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to adjuvants for agricultural sprays, and more particularly, to sulphated polyhydric alcohols, polyols, saccharides, and polysaccharides as adjuvants in agricultural spray applications. Agricultural spray applications include herbicides, insecticides, insect repellents, fungicides, and plant growth regulators.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Agricultural spray applications have long included agents to amplify or accelerate the activity of the pesticidal active ingredient. These agents often include nitrogen based fertilizers such as UAN (Urea Ammonium Nitrate) or AMS (Ammonium Sulphate). Although the mechanism is debated the empirical evidence is strong that there is better uptake of selected active ingredients when nitrogen-based agents are incorporated. There are many different pesticide chemistries that include recommendations for addition of nitrogen-based adjuvants; however the greatest numbers of these are herbicides. Pesticides, which includes fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, algicides, moluscicides, miticides and rodenticides, are well known from the state of the art (here, The Pesticide Manual, 14<sup>th </sup>edition, BCPC 2006, editor CDS Tomlin, is included as a reference, it provides information about the individual mode of actions of active ingredients).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Glyphosate (sodium 2-[(hydroxy-oxido-phosphoryl)methylamino]acetic acid or N(phosphonomethyl)glycine is a non-selective systemic herbicide. Glyphosate, one of the most widely used herbicides, is effective in killing a wide variety of plants, including grasses, broadleaf, and woody plants. Glyphosate is currently supplied in several formulations, including ammonium salt, isopropyl amine salt, potassium salt, and glyphosate acid. Glufosinate is another non-selective herbicide with a different mode of action than glyphosate because translocation only occurs within leaves. Commonly, it is available as ammonium salt.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Spray solutions comprising &#x201c;hard water&#x201d; and glyphosate have been demonstrated to have reduced control of unwanted vegetation. &#x201c;Hard water&#x201d; is water with high levels of calcium, magnesium, and/or sodium. Other cations may also contribute to hard water. It has been proposed that &#x201c;hard water&#x201d; in a spray tank reduces the effectiveness of glyphosate because the cations form a complex with the glyphosate molecule. Glyphosate acts as a chelator or a sequestering agent and forms complexes in the presence of calcium, iron, and magnesium ions. These complexes are incapable of penetrating the epidermal layers of plant leaves and thus reduce the effectiveness of glyphosate as a control agent in unwanted vegetation or weeds.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Adding agents such as ammonium sulphate, for example, to the spray tank, alleviates the problems associated with hard water, by sequestering the cations, and in turn &#x201c;protecting&#x201d; the herbicide to penetrate and translocate to the root system of the unwanted vegetation or weed. In addition to ammonium sulphate, phosphoric acid and citric acid are used to sequester, i.e., complex, hard water ions, including Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, by associating with the glyphosate molecule, thus preventing the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and Mg<sup>2+ </sup>from doing so.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">When ammonium (or other sequestering agent) is complexed with the glyphosate or glufosinate molecule, the molecule functions as intended. Large quantities of ammonium sulphate, i.e., 8.5 lbs to 17 lbs per 100 gallons of water (equivalent to 1 to 2 kg/100 l), are currently recommended to provide the desired effect. Ammonium sulphate is limited to water-based formulations. Adding ammonium sulphate may still be beneficial, even when the water is not hard. Some plants, for example, velvetleaf (<i>abutilon theophrastt</i>) contain high levels of calcium in intracellular spaces, and/or have natural defence mechanisms which may also reduce the effectiveness of glyphosate. The addition of ammonium sulphate in these situations also improves the effectiveness of glyphosate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Many commercial crops have been genetically modified to tolerate glyphosate herbicide sprays, creating a global demand for glyphosate herbicide formulations. The commercial aqueous glyphosate formulation usually contains a surfactant, in addition to other additives, including humectants, anti-gelling agents and anti-freezing agents. The surfactant functions to increase surface wetting, and may also potentiate the active ingredient. Glycerol, a renewable resource, may be used as a humectant in such agricultural spray applications.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One negative effect of the presence of ammonium sulphate in a water spray solutions is its effect on the cloud point of surfactants due to increased electrolyte levels. This effect prevents the formation of stable liquid formulations of glyphosate with ammonium sulfate and a surfactant. Although ammonium sulphate is available in both dry and liquid (40%) forms, end users prefer liquid versions that offer some other functional additives. There are very few surfactants that can be blended with concentrated liquid ammonium sulphate and form single phase products, although alkyl polyglycoside may be added in amounts up to 20% with 40% ammonium sulphate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">What remains is a need for an effective replacement for ammonium sulphate and for suitable nitrogen based adjuvants in other agricultural applications, in particular to form a stable liquid formulation, preferentially containing glyphosate or glufosinate, optionally containing a surfactant to boost the respective biological efficacy, with a sequestering agent for cations, said sequestering agent enhancing the biological performance of active ingredients, too. It has been the object of the present invention to meet this desire of the market.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a first embodiment the present invention refers to a process for preparing an adjuvant for agricultural applications, characterized in that a polyhydric alcohol, polyol, saccharide, or polysaccharide is reacted with a sulphating agent, preferably with sulphamic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Surprisingly applicants have observed that by reacting polyhydric alcohols, polyols, saccharides, or polysaccharides with an sulphation agent, preferably sulphamic acid, an improved sequestering potential is realized when the sulphated compounds are added to glyphosate, for example, as the multiple activity sites yield a more efficient sequesterant than ammonium sulphate. By sulphating molecules with one or more hydroxyl groups, one can obtain different degrees of sulphation being present in one product. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, sulphated glycerol is used. Glycerol sulphate is known and described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,452,943, (Colgate) yet, it is restricted to its formation by using sulphamic acid with an amide as catalyst. EP 0532557 A1 (Henkel) teaches a process for making glycerol sulphate using gaseous sulphur trioxide. However, no reference to agricultural applications is made in these disclosures.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Sulphating Agents</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Suitable sulphating agents encompass inter alia concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum, chlorosulphonic acid or SO<sub>3 </sub>gas. Especially preferred is to use sulphamic acid, also known as amidosulphonic acid, amidosulphuric acid, aminosulphonic acid, and sulphamidic acid, is a weakly acidic, colourless, water-soluble compound according to the formula H<sub>3</sub>NSO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Surfactants</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As set out above, the surfactants according to the present invention exhibit a significant adjuvant effect on biologically-active ingredients, such as for example herbicides, at in particular glyphosates (which also includes its salts, like for example sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, alkyl ammonium salt). The surfactants are obtained by reacting an alcoholic compound with sulfamic acid. Said alcoholic compound encompasses polyhydric alcohols, polyols, saccharides, polysaccharides and their mixtures. According to another aspect of the invention, the sulphates may be prepared by reacting polyhydric alcohols, polyols, saccharides, and to polysaccharides with concentrated sulphuric acid. In addition, the polyhydric alcohol, polyol, saccharide or polysaccharide starting material may be modified with agents (such as propylene oxide) to increase oil-solubility of the final sulphated product. In addition, the polyhydric alcohol, polyol, saccharide or polysaccharide starting material may be modified with agents (such as propylene oxide) to increase oil-solubility of the final sulphated product according to the standard procedures known from organic chemistry. To the extent solvents are present or even necessary, preferred examples comprise dialkyl amides, for example dimethyl amides of C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty acids, lactic acid or levulinic acid. It is understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited to monosulphates. Depending on the number of available hydroxyl group it also encompasses higher sulphates as for example disulphates, trisulphates and the like and their mixtures.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Polyhydric Alcohols</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Suitable polyhydric alcohols include but are not limited to diols, for example, propylene glycol, and ethylene glycol. Other suitable polyhydric alcohols may include longer carbon chains such as diethylene glycol, hexylene glycol and decalene glycol, glycerol, polyglycerol and their mixtures. The carbon chain length of the polyhydric alcohol will generally not exceed about 14 carbon atoms, and preferably contains 2 to 10, more preferably 3 to 6 carbon atoms, as viscosity may become prohibitively high, and water-solubility too low for miscibility in the spray solution.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Polyols and Saccharides</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Suitable polyols include, but are not limited to, for example, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and their mixtures. The polyol typically contain 2 to 30 and preferably 3 to 10 carbon atoms. Suitable saccharides include, but are not limited to, for example, monosaccharides disaccharides, polysaccharides and their mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The surfactant component may also be a mixture of mono-, di-, and tri-sulphated polyhydric alcohols or polyols, and may also be a mixture of predominantly mono- and di-sulphates. Thoughtful selection of the starting backbone will lead to oil- or water-miscible molecules which as ammonium salts of sulphates will still function as sequestering agents. Addition of propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, polypropylene glycol or polyethylene glycol to one of the free hydroxyl groups counteracts the hydrophilicity of the sulphate created by reaction with sulphamic acid to allow a range of water/oil solubility of the final product. This allows the formulator of hydrolytically unstable pesticides (such as sulphonyl-urea herbicides) to create oil-continuous formulations which include the desired adjuvant. The oil-continuous sulphates become biologically/chemically active adjuvants when diluted into the water rich spray solution at the time of final application. Applicants have advantageously found that oleo-sulphates, based on glycerol, are miscible with all surfactants. When glycerol is selected for use according to an aspect of the invention, the glycerol may be crude or U.S.P. grade, with up to three sulphate groups on the glycerol molecule. Applicants have also advantageously found that glycerol sulphate has blended with every surfactant tested. Surfactants successfully blended include: alkylphenol ethoxylates, alkyl polyglycosides, tallow amine ethoxylates, sorbitan esters, fatty acid esters of glycerol, PEG esters of fatty acids, phosphate esters of alcohols and ethoxylates thereof), amine oxides, alkyl ether sulphates and alcohol ethoxylates. It may also be blended into potassium and isopropylamine salts of glyphosate without any separation. As with ammonium sulphate, the biological effect provided by the invention and compositions including the claimed molecules is more than sequestering of &#x201c;hard water&#x201d; cations. The nitrogen effect stimulates the plant and enhances uptake, translocation and deployment of many pesticidal active ingredients that have no chelating potential. A suitable ratio of about 0.9 moles to 4.0 moles of sulphamic acid to 1 mole of glycerol may be used according to an aspect of the invention. Analysis by Carbon-13 and Attached Proton NMR revealed that the increasing molar ratios of sulphamic acid synthesized amounts of mono-, di- and tri-substituted glycerol with ranges as follows. The invention includes compositions of free glycerol between 3% and 20%, glycerol monosulphate between 12% and 60%, glycerol disulphate between 8% and 20%, and glycerol trisulphate is nil to 20%. Inclusion of a catalyst (acetamide or urea) yielded product that comprised free glycerol between 1% and 15%, glycerol monosulphate between 1% and 35%, glycerol disulphate between 1% and 35%, and glycerol trisulphate is 24%-97%. Both were tested for efficacy with glyphosate in 500 ppm water (250 ppm Ca, 250 ppm Mg). Both improved the control of weeds over 500 ppm water with no additive, as illustrated in the FIGURE.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Advantageously, the order of addition has no effect on the efficacy of the adjuvant. There was also no observed difference between glyphosate treatments made whether the invention was formulated into the glyphosate concentrate or added to existing commercial products at the point of application, commonly referred to as tank mix. Products of the present invention can be combined with other surfactants in pesticide formulation, in particular, glufosinate and glyphosate. For the latter non-selective herbicide, alkyl polyglucosides, amine ethoxylates based on coco or tallow or a phosphorylated derivative, betaines such as trialkyl or cocoamidopropyl betaines, or an amine oxide can be used.</p>

For example, certain types of quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) can be added to pool water or industrial water systems to act as an algicide, protecting the water from infestation and growth of algae.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Pesticides</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines a pesticide as &#x201c;any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest&#x201d;. A pesticide may be a chemical substance or biological agent (such as a virus or bacteria) used against pests including insects, plant pathogens, weeds, mollusks, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms) and microbes that compete with humans for food, destroy property, spread disease or are a nuisance. In the following examples, pesticides suitable for the agrochemical compositions according to the present invention are given:</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Fungicides.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0030">A fungicide is one of three main methods of pest control&#x2014;the chemical control of fungi in this case. Fungicides are chemical compounds used to prevent the spread of fungi in gardens and crops. Fungicides are also used to fight fungal infections. Fungicides can either be contact or systemic. A contact fungicide kills fungi when sprayed on its surface. A systemic fungicide has to be absorbed by the fungus before the fungus dies. Examples for suitable fungicides, according to the present invention, encompass the following chemical classes and corresponding examples:

<p id="p-0027" num="0088">An herbicide is a pesticide used to kill unwanted plants. Selective herbicides kill specific targets while leaving the desired crop relatively unharmed. Some of these act by interfering with the growth of the weed and are often based on plant hormones. Herbicides used to clear waste ground are nonselective and kill all plant material with which they come into contact. Herbicides are widely used in agriculture and in landscape turf management. They are applied in total vegetation control (TVC) programs for maintenance of highways and railroads. Smaller quantities are used in forestry, pasture systems, and management of areas set aside as wildlife habitat.

<p id="p-0029" num="0131">Plant hormones (also known as phytohormones) are chemicals that regulate plant growth. Plant hormones are signal molecules produced within the plant, and occur in extremely low concentrations. Hormones regulate cellular processes in targeted cells locally and when moved to other locations, in other locations of the plant. Plants, unlike animals, lack glands that produce and secrete hormones. Plant hormones shape the plant, affecting seed growth, time of flowering, the sex of flowers, senescence of leaves and fruits. They affect which tissues grow upward and which grow downward, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, plant longevity and even plant death. Hormones are vital to plant growth and lacking them, plants would be mostly a mass of undifferentiated cells. In the following, suitable plant growth regulators are mentioned:

<p id="p-0030" num="0137">Rodenticides are a category of pest control chemicals intended to kill rodents. Rodents are difficult to kill with poisons because their feeding habits reflect their place as scavengers. They would eat a small bit of something and wait, and if they do not get sick, they would continue eating. An effective rodenticide must be tasteless and odorless in lethal concentrations, and have a delayed effect. In the following, examples for suitable rodenticides are given:
<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0138">Anticoagulants are defined as chronic (death occurs after 1-2 weeks post ingestion of the lethal dose, rarely sooner), single-dose (second generation) or multiple dose (first generation) cumulative rodenticides. Fatal internal bleeding is caused by lethal dose of anticoagulants such as brodifacoum, coumatetralyl or warfarin. These substances in effective doses are antivitamins K, blocking the enzymes K<sub>1</sub>-2,3-epoxide-reductase (this enzyme is preferentially blocked by 4-hydroxycoumarin/4-hydroxythiacoumarin derivatives) and K<sub>1</sub>-quinone-reductase (this enzyme is preferentially blocked by indandione derivatives), depriving the organism of its source of active vitamin K<sub>1</sub>. This leads to a disruption of the vitamin K cycle, resulting in an inability of production of essential blood-clotting factors (mainly coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII (proconvertin), IX (Christmas factor) and X (Stuart factor)). In addition to this specific metabolic disruption, toxic doses of 4-hydroxycoumarin/4-hydroxythiacoumarin and indandione anticoagulants are causing damage to tiny blood vessels (capillaries), increasing their permeability, causing diffuse internal bleedings (haemorrhagias). These effects are gradual; they develop in the course of days and are not accompanied by any nociceptive perceptions, such as pain or agony. In the final phase of intoxication the exhausted rodent collapses in hypovolemic circulatory shock or severe anemia and dies calmly. Rodenticidal anticoagulants are either first generation agents (4-hydroxycoumarin type: warfarin, coumatetralyl; indandione type: pindone, diphacinone, chlorophacinone), generally requiring higher concentrations (usually between 0.005 and 0.1%), consecutive intake over days in order to accumulate the lethal dose, poor active or inactive after single feeding and less toxic than second generation agents, which are derivatives of 4-hydroxycoumarin (difenacoum, brodifacoum, bromadiolone and flocoumafen) or 4-hydroxy-1-benzothiin-2-one (4-hydroxy-1-thiacoumarin, sometimes incorrectlly referred to as 4-hydroxy-1-thiocoumarin, for reason see heterocyclic compounds), namely difethialone. Second generation agents are far more toxic than first generation agents, they are generally applied in lower concentrations in baits (usually in the order of 0.001-0.005%), and are lethal after single ingestion of bait and are effective also against strains of rodents that have become resistant against first generation anticoagulants; thus the second generation anticoagulants are sometimes referred to as &#x201c;superwarfarins&#x201d;. Sometimes, anticoagulant rodenticides are potentiated by an antibiotic, most commonly by sulfaquinoxaline. The aim of this association (e.g. warfarin 0.05%+sulfaquinoxaline 0.02%, or difenacoum 0.005%+sulfaquinoxaline 0.02% etc.) is that the antibiotic/bacteriostatic agent suppresses intestinal/gut symbiotic microflora that represents a source of vitamin K. Thus the symbiotic bacteria are killed or their metabolism is impaired and the production of yltamin K by them is dim inuted, an effect which logically contributes to the action of anticoagulants. Antibiotic agents other than sulfaquinoxaline may be used, for example co-trimoxazole, tetracycline, neomycin or metronidazole. A further synergism used in rodenticidal baits is that of an association of an anticoagulant with a compound with vitamin D-activity, i.e. cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol (see below). A typical formula used is, e.g., warfarin 0.025-0.05%+cholecalciferol 0.01%. In some countries there are even fixed three-component rodenticides, i.e. anticoagulant+antibiotic+vitamin D, e.g. difenacoum 0.005%+sulfaquinoxaline 0.02%+cholecalciferol 0.01%. Associations of a second-generation anticoagulant with an antibiotic and/or vitamin D are considered to be effective even against the most resistant strains of rodents, though some second generation anticoagulants (namely brodifacoum and difethialone), in bait concentrations of 0.0025-0.005% are so toxic that no known resistant strain of rodents exists and even rodents resistant against any other derivatives are reliably exterminated by application of these most toxic anticoagulants.</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0139">Vitamin K<sub>1 </sub>has been suggested and successfully used as an antidote for pets or humans, which/who were either accidentally or intentionally (poison assaults on pets, suicidal attempts) exposed to anticoagulant poisons. In addition, since some of these poisons act by inhibiting liver functions and in progressed stages of poisoning, several blood-clotting factors as well as the whole volume of circulating blood lacks, a blood transfusion (optionally with the clotting factors present) can save a person's life who inadvertently takes them, which is an advantage over some older poisons.</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0003" num="0140">Metal phosphides have been used as a means of killing rodents and are considered single-dose fast acting rodenticides (death occurs commonly within 1-3 days after single bait ingestion). A bait consisting of food and a phosphide (usually zinc phosphide) is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate the toxic phosphine gas. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents are resistant to some of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and field mice; zinc phosphide baits are also cheaper than most second-generation anticoagulants, so that sometimes, in cases of large infestation by rodents, their population is initially reduced by copious amounts of zinc phosphide bait applied, and the rest of the population that survived the initial fastacting poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on anticoagulant bait. Inversely, the individual rodents that survived anticoagulant bait poisoning (rest population) can be eradicated by pre-baiting them with nontoxic bait for a week or two (this is important to overcome bait shyness, and to get rodents used to feeding in specific areas by offering specific food, especially when eradicating rats) and subsequently applying poisoned bait of the same sort as used for pre-baiting until all consumption of the bait ceases (usually within 2-4 days). These methods of alternating rodenticides with different modes of action provides a factual or an almost 100% eradication of the rodent population in the area if the acceptance/palatability of bait is good (i.e., rodents readily feed on it).</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0004" num="0141">Phosphides are rather fast acting rat poisons, resulting in that the rats are dying usually in open areas instead of the affected buildings. Typical examples are aluminum phosphide (fumigant only), calcium phosphide (fumigant only), magnesium phosphide (fumigant only) and zinc phosphide (in baits). Zinc phosphide is typically added to rodent baits in amounts of around 0.75-2%. The baits have a strong, pungent garlic-like odor characteristic for phosphine liberated by hydrolysis. The odor attracts (or, at least, does not repulse) rodents, but has a repulsive effect on other mammals; birds, however (notably wild turkeys), are not sensitive to the smell and feed on the bait thus becoming collateral damage.</li>
        <li id="ul0013-0005" num="0142">Hypercalcemia. Calciferols (vitamins D), cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D<sub>2</sub>) are used as rodenticides, which are toxic to rodents for the same reason that they are beneficial to mammals: they are affecting calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few Ws per kilogram body weight daily, which is only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble vitamins they are toxic in larger doses as they readily result in the so-called hypervitaminosis, which is, simply said, poisoning by the vitamin. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxicant is high enough), it eventually leads to death. In rodents consuming the rodenticidal bait it causes hypercalcemia by raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into ionised form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, [CaHCO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup>), which circulates dissolved in the blood plasma, and after ingestion of a lethal dose the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently so that blood vessels, kidneys, the stomach wall and lungs are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues thus damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocard is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels that are affecting both myocardial contractibility and excitation propagation between atrias and ventriculas) and bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, or cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait), sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol and 0.1% ergocalciferol when used alone. There is an important feature of calciferols toxicology which is that they are synergistic with anticoagulant toxicants. This means that mixtures of anticoagulants and calciferols in the same bait are more toxic than the sum of toxicities of the anticoagulant and the calciferol in the bait so that a massive hypercalcemic effect can be achieved by a substantially lower calciferol content in the bait and vice-versa. More pronounced anticoagulant/hemorrhagic effects are observed if calciferol is present. This synergism is mostly used in baits low in calciferol because effective concentrations of calciferols are more expensive than effective concentrations of most anticoagulants. The historically very first application of a calciferol in rodenticidal bait was, in fact, the Sorex product Sorexa&#xae; D (with a different formula than today's Sorexa&#xae; D) back in the early 1970's, containing warfarin 0.025%+ergocalciferol 0.1%. Today, Sorexa&#xae; CD contains a 0.0025% difenacoum+0.075% cholecalciferol combination. Numerous other brand products containing either calciferols 0.075-0.1% (e.g. Quintox&#xae;, containing 0.075% cholecalciferol) alone, or a combination of calciferol 0.01-0.075% with an anticoagulant are marketed.

Antibiotic miticides, carbamate miticides, formamidine miticides, mite growth regulators, organochlorine, permethrin and organophosphate miticides all belong to this category. Molluscicides are pesticides used to control mollusks, such as moths, slugs and snails. These substances include metaldehyde, methiocarb and aluminium sulfate. A nematicide is a type of chemical pesticide used to kill parasitic nematodes (a phylum of worm). A nematicide is obtained from a neem tree's seed cake; which is the residue of neem seeds after oil extraction. The neem tree is known by several names in the world but was first cultivated in India since ancient times.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0185">Typical anionic emulsifiers are aliphatic C<sub>12-22 </sub>fatty acids such as palmitic acid, stearic acid or behenic acid, for example, and C<sub>12-22 </sub>dicarboxylic acids such as azelaic acid or sebacic acid, for example. Other suitable emulsifiers are zwitterionic surfactants. Zwitterionic surfactants are surface-active compounds which contain at least one quaternary ammonium group and at least one carboxylate and one sulfonate group in the molecule. Particularly suitable zwitterionic surfactants are the so-called betaines such as the N-alkyl-N,N-dimethyl ammonium glycinates, for example cocoalkyl dimethyl ammonium glycinate, N-acylaminopropyl-N,N-dimethyl ammonium glycinates, for example cocoacylaminopropyl dimethyl ammonium glycinate, and 2-alkyl-3-carboxymethyl-3-hydroxyethyl imidazolines containing 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl or acyl group and cocoacylaminoethyl hydroxyethyl carboxymethyl glycinate. The fatty acid amide derivative known under the CTFA name of Cocamidopropyl Bewine is particularly preferred. Ampholytic surfactants are also suitable emulsifiers. Ampholytic surfactants are surface-active compounds which, in addition to a C<sub>8/18 </sub>alkyl or acyl group, contain at least one free amino group and at least one &#x2014;COOH&#x2014; or &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>H&#x2014; group in the molecule and which are capable of forming inner salts. Examples of suitable ampholytic surfactants are N-alkyl glycines, N-alkyl propionic acids, N-alkylaminobutyric acids, N-alkyliminodipropionic acids, N-hydroxyethyl-N-alkylamidopropyl glycines, N-alkyl taurines, N-alkyl sarcosines, 2-alkylaminopropionic acids and alkylaminoacetic acids containing around 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Particularly preferred ampholytic surfactants are N-cocoalkylaminopropionate, cocoacylaminoethyl aminopropionate and C<sub>12/18 </sub>acyl sarcosine.</p>
