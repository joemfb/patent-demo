<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a diagnostic cable. More particularly, the present invention relates to a multiplexing diagnostic cable for use with a vehicle diagnostic tool.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern vehicles typically have one or more diagnostic systems, generally having separate computer control modules or electronic control units (ECUs) to control various functions of the vehicle. Some examples include powertrain control module (PCM), engine control module (ECM), transmission control module (TCM), and anti-locking brake system (ABS). The vehicle diagnostic systems often have self-diagnostic capability to detect and alert the driver of problems the vehicle may be encountering. When a problem is found, a diagnostic trouble code or DTC, is set within the computer's memory. DTCs are as general or as specific as the manufacturer desires.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To retrieve and decipher DTCs, an auto repair technician needs a diagnostic tool. The diagnostic tool must, therefore, be connected to the vehicle's data link connector (DLC) to access and retrieve the DTCs. Diagnostic tools are testing devices that interface with the vehicle's diagnostic systems to retrieve information from the various control modules. The diagnostic tools are equipped to communicate in various communication protocols such as Controlled Area Network (CAN), J1850 VPM and PWM, ISO 9141, Keyword 2000 and others. These communications protocols are specific to the various automobile manufacturers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A cable is used to interface the diagnostic tool with the DLC. Although the DLC typically is a J1960 type connector having 16 pins for various communications, controls and measurements, the use of the different pins for different functions varies between the different modules in the vehicle and can also vary with different manufactures of the vehicles. Thus, a maintenance garage would need to carry different cables configured for the various pin configurations and communication protocols used by various vehicle manufacturers. Additionally, the garages can carry different &#x201c;keys&#x201d; or smart system interface (SSI) that can be individually configured for a certain vehicle or communication protocol. These solutions are problematic in that they require the garage to carry various cables or keys for the various vehicles being serviced and require the technician to know which cable or key goes with which vehicle under service. Additionally, the cables and keys can get lost because there are so many to keep track of in the garage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The J1962 connector also supplies the ground signal to the diagnostic tool so that the diagnostic tool can use that as a reference signal. Without a good ground signal, the measurements received by the diagnostic tool may not be accurate. The ground signal can be from a chassis ground or from a signal ground. However, some vehicles do not supply both so that receiving a reference signal can be difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to conduct certain tests in a vehicle certain pins must be grounded. This requires a shop to purchase many jumper connectors, each having different pins to ground the various pins on the DLC, to conduct the desired tests.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an adaptive cable that is configurable between a diagnostic tool and a DLC. It is also desirable to provide an adaptive cable that can control and multiplex with a jumper connector to jump the desired pins so that one connector can be utilized.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention, wherein in one aspect an apparatus is provided that in some embodiments can provide automatic multiplexing capabilities to a cable that connects a diagnostic tool to a DLC of a vehicle. Additionally the cable can also connect to a jumper connector that connects to a vehicle.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of the components of the diagnostic tool <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the diagnostic tool <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the invention includes a processor <b>202</b>, a field programmable gate array (FPGA) <b>214</b>, a first system bus <b>224</b>, the display <b>102</b>, a complex programmable logic device (CPLD) <b>204</b>, the input device in the form of a keypad (scroll device) <b>104</b>, a memory subsystem <b>208</b>, an internal non-volatile memory (NVM) <b>218</b>, a card reader <b>220</b> (optional), a second system bus <b>222</b>, a connector interface <b>111</b>, a selectable signal translator <b>210</b>, a GPS antenna <b>232</b>, a GPS receiver <b>234</b>, an optional altimeter <b>236</b> and wireless communication circuit <b>238</b>. A vehicle communication interface <b>230</b> is in communication with the diagnostic tool <b>100</b> through connector interface <b>111</b> via an external cable <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Selectable signal translator <b>210</b> communicates with the vehicle communication interface <b>230</b> through the connector interface <b>111</b>. Signal translator <b>210</b> conditions signals received from an ECU unit through the vehicle communication interface <b>230</b> to a conditioned signal compatible with diagnostic tool <b>100</b>. Signal translator <b>210</b> can communicate with, for example, the following communication protocols: J1850 (VPM and PWM), ISO 9141-2 signal, communication collision detection (CCD) (e.g., Chrysler collision detection), data communication links (DCL), serial communication interface (SCI), Controller Area Network (CAN), Keyword 2000 (ISO 14230-4), OBD II or other communication protocols that are implemented in a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The circuitry to translate and send in a particular communication protocol can be selected by FPGA <b>214</b> (e.g., by tri-stating unused transceivers). Signal translator <b>210</b> is also coupled to FPGA <b>214</b> and the card reader <b>220</b> via the first system bus <b>224</b>. FPGA <b>214</b> transmits to and receives signals (i.e., messages) from the ECU unit through signal translator <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The FPGA <b>214</b> is coupled to the processor <b>202</b> through various address, data and control lines by the second system bus <b>222</b>. FPGA <b>214</b> is also coupled to the card reader <b>220</b> through the first system bus <b>224</b>. The processor <b>202</b> is also coupled to the display <b>102</b> in order to output the desired information to the user. The processor <b>202</b> communicates with the CPLD <b>204</b> through the second system bus <b>222</b>. Additionally, the processor <b>202</b> is programmed to receive input from the user through the user interface <b>104</b> via the CPLD <b>204</b>. The CPLD <b>204</b> provides logic for decoding various inputs from the user of the diagnostic tool <b>100</b> and also provides glue-logic for various other interfacing tasks.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Memory subsystem <b>208</b> and internal non-volatile memory <b>218</b> are coupled to the second system bus <b>222</b>, which allows for communication with the processor <b>202</b> and FPGA <b>214</b>. Memory subsystem <b>208</b> can include an application dependent amount of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), a hard drive, and/or read only memory (ROM). Software to run the diagnostic tool <b>100</b> can be stored in the memory <b>208</b> or <b>218</b>, including any database. The database can include diagnostic information and other information related to vehicles. In one embodiment, the database can include additional information such as possible fixes for a particular DTC retrieved from a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Internal non-volatile memory <b>218</b> can be an electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), flash ROM, or other similar memory. Internal non-volatile memory <b>218</b> can provide, for example, storage for boot code, self-diagnostics, various drivers and space for FPGA images, if desired. If less than all of the modules are implemented in FPGA <b>214</b>, memory <b>218</b> can contain downloadable images so that FPGA <b>214</b> can be reconfigured for a different group of communication protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The GPS antenna <b>232</b> and GPS receiver <b>234</b> may be mounted in or on the housing <b>101</b> or any combination thereof. The GPS antenna <b>232</b> electronically couples to the GPS receiver <b>234</b> and allows the GPS receiver to communicate (detects and decodes signals) with various satellites that orbit the Earth. In one embodiment, the GPS antenna and GPS receiver are one device instead of two. The GPS receiver <b>234</b> and GPS antenna <b>232</b> electronically couple to the processor <b>202</b>, which is coupled to memory <b>208</b>, NVM <b>218</b> or a memory card in the card reader <b>220</b>. The memory can be used to store cartographic data, such as electronic maps. The diagnostic tool can include all the maps for the U.S. (or country of use), North America or can have the region or state where the diagnostic tool is located. In alternative embodiments, the diagnostic tool can have all the maps of the world or any portion of the world desired by the user. This allows the diagnostic tool to be a GPS device so that a driver can drive from one location to another. The maps may be over lay or incorporated with traffic, local events, and location of other GPS devices (smart phones) and other information that can be useful to the technician. By being able to locate other diagnostic tools with GPS, then the technicians may be able to use the diagnostic tools to locate each other in order to conduct a meeting or have a social event.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The CPLD <b>422</b> provides the communication interface with the diagnostic tool and the control interface for the FETs and relays of a multiplexer <b>410</b> to multiplex signals and other various ancillary functions. The communication interface can use the FORD DCL communication lines on the DB25 connector. These communications are bi-directional in nature. The control interface on the CPLD will have individual I/O lines to control individual FET switches.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Communication protocol module <b>408</b> contains the communication receivers and transceivers necessary for communicating with the vehicle under the test. The communication protocols can include Controlled Area Network (CAN), J1850 VPM and PWM, ISO 9141, DCL (communication links), S/F codes, a solenoid drive, J1708, 2201, CCD (communication collision detection (e.g., Chrysler collision detection)), Controller Area Network (CAN), SCI (serial communication interface), Keyword 2000 and other communication protocols. The communication protocol module also includes the RS232 serial interface for the diagnostic tool.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The multiplexer <b>410</b> includes all the components for it to perform the multiplexing function when instructed by the diagnostic tool. There are 25 pins that can be used with this embodiment of the multiplexer. As noted above, different vehicle manufacturers use different connections (pins) on the J1962 connector and different communication protocols. The multiplexer <b>410</b> must be able to make the right connections so that the diagnostic tool can communicate with the ECU based on the communication protocols used and the connections made at the DLC. The connections can be made with the FETs, relays and other components located in the multiplexer <b>410</b>. For example, for CAN high and low, switches <b>21</b> and <b>10</b>, respectively are switched into place should CAN protocol is being communicated. Using a multiplexing device, the SSI or keys are no longer required to be kept by the garage and allows the adaptive cable to deal with the various communication protocols from various vehicles. Although 25 pins are shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, additional pins or fewer pins can be configured as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Software in the diagnostic tool has been configured to know which connections on the J1962 connector on the vehicle are being used for which purposes and the software instructs the adaptive cable to configure itself to make the correct connections so that the diagnostic tool can communicate properly with the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A power controller <b>412</b> controls the power supplied to adaptive cable. As noted above, the adaptive cable can be powered through the J1962 (Vbat) connection. The power controller can also regulate the power that is provided to the communication protocol module <b>408</b> so that the appropriate power is supplied to the communication protocol circuits (transmitter and receiver). Different communication protocol circuits require different power and thus, the power from the Vbat must be regulated to ensure the right power is provided depending on the communication protocol being used.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The J1962 connector <b>414</b> connects the adaptive cable to the DLC. A second multiplexer circuit <b>418</b> is also provided to cover additional communication protocols that will be needed in the future or were not able to fit in the multiplexer <b>410</b>. The second multiplexer <b>418</b> includes the FETs, relays and other components to perform the required multiplexing task. New vehicle I/O circuits <b>420</b> provide additional circuits not already built into the multiplexer <b>410</b>. Where protection is needed, appropriate I/O protection circuits <b>406</b>, <b>416</b> are provided. The main PCB is designed to support the expansion card, the communication protocol module, the multiplexers, the V I/O, and I/O protection circuits thereon.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram <b>500</b> of a relay circuit according to an embodiment of the invention. As stated above, vehicles can have two grounds, the signal ground <b>502</b> and chassis ground <b>504</b>. These grounds provide the reference signal that the diagnostic tool needs to correctly decipher the signals it collects from the vehicles. Otherwise, the signals from the vehicle may float and accurate measurements are hard to make by the diagnostic tool. However, not all vehicles provide both grounds through the J1962 connector. The vehicle under test may provide one or the other ground and not both grounds. The diagnostic tool will usually look for the signal from the signal ground to see if it is present. However, when the signal ground is not present, the diagnostic tool may not look for a signal from the chassis ground until it is instructed to do so by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The adaptive cable is provided with a relay <b>506</b> that can be energized to switch from one ground to another. The relay can be positioned between the signal ground <b>502</b> and chassis ground <b>504</b> connections. The relay can be configured to switch to the ground that is active in the J1962 connector. For example, the relay can be energized to automatically switch from the signal ground to the chassis ground when no signal is detected from the signal ground but a signal is present on the chassis ground. Thus, the diagnostic tool can always have a ground signal as a reference signal regardless of the vehicle under test.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In operation, the user can enter information about the vehicle under test into the diagnostic tool or the diagnostic tool can automatically detect the information. The information can include YIN, make, year, model and other vehicle information. Based on the information, the diagnostic tool can send a signal to the adaptive cable to configure the multiplexer to make the correct connections with the connections on the DLC. The diagnostic tool includes data for every year, make, and model so that the diagnostic tool can configure the adaptive cable for the correct connections. This can be done automatically without the user having to find the correct SSI cards or keys and insert them into the cable. By having an adaptive cable, the technician can quickly diagnose the vehicle instead of determining the correct SSI cards or keys for the vehicle and then wander around the garage to find them.</p>

The switches <b>644</b> may be controlled via the single control input <b>648</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), such as a button, knob, wheel, or dip switch, the control input <b>648</b> may be integral to the handle <b>610</b> or the body <b>620</b>. The switches <b>644</b> may have different states, such as open and closed depending on the position of the contacts <b>650</b>. The natural or resting state of the switches <b>644</b> may be either open or closed. The manipulation of the control input <b>648</b> changes the state of the switches <b>644</b> from open to closed (by moving the contacts <b>650</b>), or from closed to open (by moving the contacts <b>650</b>) depending on their states.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A jumper connection may be created in the form of pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b> which may be electrically connected together via a wire <b>638</b>. The pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b>, and the wire <b>638</b> may all be parts of one piece, or each may be a separate piece. Because the pins <b>634</b>, <b>636</b> are electrically connected together, when they are mated to the DLC and their respective pin receptacles, the connection will be jumped. That is, a desired functionality of the vehicle may be activated because certain pins <b>634</b>, <b>636</b> are jumped. Some examples of the functionality that can be activated can include jumping pins <b>4</b> &#x26; <b>8</b> to clear or check DTC (diagnostic trouble code) and pins <b>4</b> &#x26; <b>12</b> to activate test mode procedure for vehicle stability control system.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the embodiment where the pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b>, and the wire <b>638</b> may all be parts of one piece, the wire <b>638</b> has a higher resistive property than the switches <b>644</b>, such that when the switches are closed, the jump with pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b> is bypassed, and the pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b> are functionally connected to their respective pin receptacles <b>646</b>. Where the pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b>, and wire <b>638</b> are separate pieces, the wire <b>638</b> and the switches <b>644</b> (including contacts <b>650</b>) are all controlled by the same control input <b>648</b>. When the switches <b>644</b> are in a closed state, then wire <b>648</b> is disengaged from any connection to pins <b>640</b>, or it is at least connected to no more than one of the pins <b>640</b>, such as one of the ground pins, thus none of the pins are jumped. If the switches <b>644</b> are in the open position, then the wire <b>638</b> is connected to pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b>, jumping these pins to put the vehicle in a desired state. In one embodiment, the control input <b>648</b> may be manually manipulated by a user to open the switches <b>644</b> and engage the connection of the wire <b>648</b> with pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b>, or to close the switches <b>644</b> and disengage the connection of the wire <b>648</b> from pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The state of the switches <b>644</b> and whether or not the wire <b>638</b> contacts the designated pins (<b>634</b>, <b>636</b>) may be controlled by the control input <b>648</b> as discussed herein. Manipulation of the control input <b>648</b> may affect the position of the switches <b>644</b> and the wire <b>638</b> in numerous ways. In one embodiment, the control input <b>648</b> may be physically connected to contacts <b>650</b> of the switches <b>644</b> and the wire <b>638</b>, where movement of the control input <b>648</b> is translated by the physical connection to the switches <b>644</b> and the wire <b>638</b> as described above, as an example. In another embodiment, the manipulation of the control input <b>648</b> may cause magnetic fields to be applied to the contacts <b>650</b> of switches <b>644</b> and the wire <b>638</b> causing them to either engage or disengage their respective pins <b>640</b>. The magnetic field may be caused by magnetically charged components that are moved in and out of proximity with contacts <b>650</b> of the switches <b>644</b> and the wire <b>638</b> depending on the state of the control input <b>648</b>. Another embodiment may include creating the magnetic field by applying a current to contacts <b>650</b> of the switches <b>644</b>, the wire <b>638</b>, or the pins <b>640</b>, causing the contacts <b>650</b> of switches <b>644</b> and the wire <b>638</b> to either engage or disengage their respective pins <b>640</b>.</p>

The wire <b>638</b> may operate similarly to the switches <b>644</b>, where the wire <b>638</b> may be attached to one of the pins <b>640</b>, and the wire <b>638</b> may pivot or bend causing the wire <b>638</b> to engage or disengage its other respective pin <b>640</b>. In another embodiment, the wire <b>638</b> may engage and disengage all of the pins <b>640</b> to which the wire <b>638</b> connects to create the jump connection. In this embodiment, the manipulation of the control input <b>648</b> may cause the wire <b>638</b> to move in a direction, such as laterally across the pins <b>644</b>, causing connecting surfaces of the pins <b>640</b> and the wire <b>648</b> to be in or out of phase. Another movement that may cause similar phase alignments is rotation of the wire <b>638</b> along a plane that is substantially parallel with the pins <b>644</b>. Another embodiment may allow the wire <b>638</b> to move in and out of contact with the pins <b>644</b> in a direction along a plane that might intersect the pins <b>644</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">To make the jump, the diagnostic tool <b>100</b> may be used to set the multiplexer <b>410</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the adaptive cable <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to a generic jump mode. In the jump mode, the multiplexer <b>410</b> may be able to functionally connect the pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b> to each other to create the jump connection. It may not be necessary to enter into the diagnostic tool <b>100</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) which of the pins <b>640</b> are being jumped. In generic jump mode, the adaptive cable <b>300</b> may be able sense that the dip switches <b>616</b> for pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b> have been set to the active position by detecting the signals on those pins, and the CPLD <b>422</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) may set the multiplexer <b>410</b> to the appropriate setting to jump the designated pins <b>634</b> and <b>636</b> selected via the dip switches <b>616</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In an alternative embodiment, the jumper connector <b>600</b> can have a preventive mechanism that only allows for two dip switches <b>616</b> to move into the upper portion of the handle <b>610</b> or body <b>620</b> or the active state. With this preventive mechanism, only two pins <b>640</b> can be jumped instead of three or more. This will prevent damage to the vehicle that can be caused by having more than two pins <b>640</b> being jumped.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this embodiment with the dip switches <b>616</b>, the jumper connector <b>600</b> can be made to be more universal so that less jumper connectors <b>600</b> will be needed per garage or per garage bay. In operation, as above, the technician can determine which functionality in the vehicle he wants to test. Then he can determine which pins are needed to be jumped in the DLC in order for that functionality to activate. He then can select the proper dip switches <b>616</b> to move into position in order to be active. Once the correct dip switches <b>616</b> are moved into the active position, the jumper connector <b>600</b> can be connected with the DLC and the desired pins on the DLC are jumped. With the pins on the DLC jumped, the jump connector may be disconnected, and the multiplexer may reconfigure it's connections to accommodate the proper communication protocol for the vehicle so that the functionality then activated can be tested.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the jumper connector <b>600</b> integrated into the J1962 connector <b>312</b>. In this embodiment, instead of having the pins <b>640</b> connected to the pin receptacles <b>646</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), and plugging the pins of the J1962 connector <b>312</b> into the pin receptacles <b>646</b> to connect the adaptive cable <b>300</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to the jumper connecter <b>600</b>, the pins <b>640</b> are connected to the connector <b>318</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In this embodiment, all of the parts of the jumper connector either coincide with similar parts of the J1962 connector <b>312</b>, or are integrated into the J1962 connector <b>312</b> as a single unit. Therefore, the J1962 connector <b>312</b> may further include the dip switches <b>616</b> and the switches <b>644</b>. The switches <b>644</b> may connect the pins <b>640</b> to the connector <b>31</b>.</p>
