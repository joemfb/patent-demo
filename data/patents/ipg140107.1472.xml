<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a pipe-laying vessel and to a method of laying a pipeline. Such a vessel and method is of particular use in the offshore industry relating to oil and gas production.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One of the tasks that is carried out by certain vessels in the offshore industry is that of laying pipelines, either by S-laying or by J-laying. J-laying, in which the pipeline is lowered down an inclined or vertical tower and curves round in a single direction to become approximately horizontal along the seabed, is used primarily for laying pipeline in deep water (that is typically deeper than 1,000 m). Examples of J-laying arrangements are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,030, U.S. Pat. No. 6,592,297, WO 2006/054891, WO 2005/085692 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,796,742.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is an object of the invention to provide an improved pipe-laying vessel and an improved method of laying a pipeline.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a pipe-laying vessel including a tower extending upwardly from the vessel, a pipe loading arm for raising a length of pipe from the deck to a position aligned with the tower, a support assembly for supporting a bulky item to be accommodated along the pipeline, the support assembly including a frame pivotable between a first load receiving position and a second tilted position in which it extends approximately parallel to the tower, and drive means for pivoting the tiltable frame between its first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">By providing a tiltable frame to receive the bulky item, the streamlined introduction of the bulky item into the pipeline is facilitated with only modest amounts of further equipment required.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It should be understood that the pipe loading arm and the support assembly for supporting the bulky item are separate items of equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferably the tiltable frame extends approximately horizontally when it is in the first load receiving position. In that case loading of the bulky item onto the tiltable frame, either by lowering it from above or by skidding it sideways onto the frame, is facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The support assembly is preferably a movable support assembly and may include a movable support on which the tiltable frame is pivotally mounted. The movable support assembly is preferably movable towards and away from the tower. That allows the bulky item to be loaded onto the tiltable frame and, after loading, moved towards the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably the vessel further includes a welding assembly station cabin in the region of a lower portion of the tower. The support assembly is preferably disposed on top of the cabin. The cabin is preferably an enclosed space which may provide weather protection but it may also be an open frame construction. In the case where it defines an enclosed space it preferably defines a single compartment, but it may alternatively define two or more smaller compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably at least part of the support assembly rests on and is supported by the cabin. That enables a more compact and lightweight arrangement to be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably the cabin is movable towards and away from the tower. In that case, the cabin may be interposed along the pipe-laying path (firing line) during welding of a new pipe length (also referred to herein as a pipe string) to the pipeline but may be retracted to a position clear of the pipe-laying path at other times.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The movable support assembly may be movable in unison with the cabin and/or it may be movable independently of the cabin. In an embodiment of the invention described below the assembly is movable both in unison with the cabin and independently of the cabin.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably the cabin and/or the movable support assembly are mounted on rails. More preferably, the cabin and the movable support assembly are mounted at least partly on a common set of rails. In an embodiment of the invention described below, the cabin and one end of the movable support assembly are mounted on a common set of rails and the other end of the movable support assembly is mounted on rails on the roof of the cabin.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably the movable support comprises a first frame, the tiltable frame defining a second frame pivotally mounted on the first frame and pivotable between the first load receiving position and the second tilted position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The drive means for pivoting the tiltable frame may take any of a wide variety of forms including a rack and pinion drive and a winch and rope drive, but in an embodiment described below the drive means comprises one or more hydraulic cylinders (jacks).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention may be applied to a wide range of pipe-laying systems including ones with a fixed tower and ones where the inclination of the tower can be varied, for example systems where the inclination of the tower can be varied by an angle of more than 30 degrees. Also the invention may be applied to a tower in which there is a travelling clamp assembly which may for example be lowered down the tower to lower the pipeline into the sea, or to a tower with one or more tensioners fixed on the tower for lowering the pipeline at a controlled rate. A fixed clamp assembly, also known as a hang off clamp assembly, is preferably provided in the region of a lower portion of the tower fixed to the vessel or to the tower. In an embodiment of the invention described below, the tower is pivotally mounted and is able to operate over a range of angles to the horizontal; in the particular example described the tower can operate at angles in the range of 45 degrees to 96 degrees to the horizontal. In the embodiment described a travelling clamp assembly is mounted for movement along the tower and a fixed clamp assembly is located in the region of a lower portion of the tower and in the particular example described is mounted on the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a preferred arrangement, the pipe loading arm is raised to a position along the tower spaced away from the centre of the tower. At that stage the pipe length carried by the pipe loading arm is preferably well clear of the pipe-laying path (firing line). The pipe string carried by the pipe loading arm can then be swung around the arm to a position along the centre of the tower, that is equidistant from the opposite sides of the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A stinger or similar structure may be provided below the tower. The stinger may control the curvature of the pipeline as it leaves the tower. The stinger may be retractable.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The axis of pivoting of the tiltable frame is preferably in the region of the tower. In an embodiment of the invention described below, the axis of pivoting is in the region of the end of the first frame nearer to the tower. Preferably the location of the axis of pivoting is adjustable, for example to suit different inclinations of the tower and/or to accommodate different shapes of bulky item.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The provision of a movable support assembly for a bulky item on top of the cabin is itself a special and inventive feature. Accordingly, in a second aspect, the invention provides a pipe-laying vessel including a tower extending upwardly from the vessel, a pipe loading arm for raising a length of pipe from the deck to a position aligned with the tower, a welding assembly station cabin in the region of a lower portion of the tower, a movable support assembly for supporting a bulky item to be accommodated along the pipeline, the movable support assembly being disposed on top of the cabin.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">By providing the movable support assembly on top of the cabin, the streamlined introduction of the bulky item into the pipeline is again facilitated with only modest amounts of further equipment required.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a pipe-laying vessel including a tower extending upwardly from the vessel, a pipe loading arm for raising a length of pipe from the deck to a position aligned with the tower, wherein a rope and winch system is provided for moving the pipe loading arm to raise the length of pipe, the rope and winch system including two ropes operating in parallel whereby movement of the loading arm can still be effected by the system in the event that one of the two ropes is inoperative.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The operation of the loading arm is a key part of the pipe-laying procedure and if interrupted, can prevent any pipe-laying. By providing a dual rope system, where even if one rope is severed, the loading arm can still be operated, although possibly at reduced speed, the reliability of pipe-laying is significantly improved.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pipe loading arm is preferably pivotally mounted about a pivot in the region of the bottom of the tower for allowing the loading arm to pivot between a lower, substantially horizontal position and a raised position in which the loading arm is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The two ropes preferably follow adjacent paths. They may be wound on the same winch drum or adjacent winch drums driven by the same drive.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each rope may include an extensible element along its length. Such an element facilitates an equal sharing of loads between the two ropes during normal operation when both ropes are operative.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A vessel of any of the kinds defined above can be designed to operate at considerable depths with correspondingly high tension loads. For example, the equipment on the vessel is preferably able to handle pipe tension loads over 1,000 tonnes and more preferably over 1,500 tonnes, and preferably loads of 2,000 tonnes.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of laying a pipeline from a pipe-laying vessel, the method comprising the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">providing a vessel with an upwardly extending tower,</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">raising a length of pipe on a pipe loading arm from a deck of the vessel to a position aligned with the tower,</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">welding the length of pipe to the end of a pipeline suspended from the vessel,</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">lowering the pipeline with the length of pipe welded thereto,</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">resting a bulky item to be added to the pipeline on a tiltable frame,</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">tilting the frame to a position extending approximately parallel to the tower,</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">transferring the support for the bulky item from the tiltable frame to one or more devices in the tower, and</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">connecting the bulky item to the pipeline suspended from the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The tiltable frame preferably extends approximately horizontally when it receives the bulky item.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The welding of the length of pipe to the end of the pipeline is preferably carried out in a welding assembly station cabin disposed in the region of a lower portion of the tower. In that case, the tiltable frame is preferably tilted from a position overlying the top of the cabin to the position extending approximately parallel to the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method preferably further includes the step of moving the cabin towards the tower. The cabin and the support assembly are preferably moved towards the tower in unison. More preferably the support assembly is moved towards the tower and the cabin in a first step and is moved in unison with the cabin towards the tower in a subsequent step.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to the second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of laying a pipeline from a pipe-laying vessel, the method comprising the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">providing a vessel with an upwardly extending tower,</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">raising a length of pipe on a pipe loading arm from a deck of the vessel to a position aligned with the tower,</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">welding the length of pipe to the end of a pipeline suspended from the vessel, the welding being carried out in a welding assembly station cabin disposed in the region of a lower portion of the tower,</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">lowering the pipeline with the length of pipe welded thereto,</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">resting a bulky item to be added to the pipeline on a movable support assembly disposed on top of the cabin,</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">moving the movable support assembly towards the tower,</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">transferring the bulky item from the movable support assembly into the tower, and</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">connecting the bulky item to the pipeline suspended from the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a pipe-laying vessel including a tower extending upwardly from the vessel, a pipe loading arm for raising a length of pipe from the deck to a position aligned with the tower, a travelling clamp assembly mounted for movement along the tower, a fixed clamp assembly located in the region of a lower portion of the tower, wherein the travelling clamp assembly and/or the fixed clamp assembly includes both a friction clamp and a collar clamp, each of the friction clamp and the collar clamp being movable between an operative position, in which it is adjustable between a clamping and a released position, and an inoperative position.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">By providing both a friction clamp and a collar clamp, each movable between operative and inoperative positions, an especially versatile clamping arrangement can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferably each of the friction clamp and the collar clamp is independently movable between the operative and inoperative positions. This adds to the versatility of the clamping arrangement. The friction clamp and the collar clamp are preferably mounted for pivotal movement between operative and inoperative positions.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is also within the scope of the fourth aspect of the invention for the travelling clamp assembly to be replaced by, for example, tensioners. In a case where there is no travelling clamp assembly, it is the fixed clamp assembly that includes both a friction clamp and a collar clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a pipe-laying vessel including a tower extending upwardly from the vessel, a pipe loading arm for raising a length of pipe from the deck to a position aligned with the tower; a travelling clamp assembly mounted for movement along the tower, wherein the travelling clamp assembly includes both a line-up clamp and a pipeline tension bearing clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In use, the travelling clamp assembly can be lowered down the tower to lower the pipeline into the sea.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The pipeline tension bearing clamp is preferably a friction clamp but it may take other forms such as, for example, a collar clamp. Similarly, the line-up clamp is preferably a friction clamp but it may take other forms such as, for example, a collar clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The line-up clamp may be mounted on the travelling clamp assembly for movement between an operative and an inoperative position. The movement is preferably pivotal movement.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided a pipe-laying vessel including a tower extending upwardly from the vessel, a pipe loading arm for raising a length of pipe from the deck to a position aligned with the tower, and three or more line-up clamps spaced along the tower for receiving the length of pipe from the loading arm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">By providing three line-up clamps along the tower it is possible to align especially well a length of pipe that is to be joined to a pipeline.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Preferably one of the line-up clamps is mounted on a travelling clamp assembly mounted for movement along the tower. In such a case, the position of one line-up clamp varies but, at the stage when a length of pipe is being aligned prior to joining to a pipeline, it will be in a high position on the tower above the other line-up clamps. The high position of the clamp helps to line up the top of the length of pipe for an internal line-up clamp that may be lowered into the pipe. Preferably the line-up clamp is mounted on the travelling clamp assembly in the region of the top of the assembly and/or above the pipeline tension bearing clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Preferably the line-up clamp mounted on the travelling clamp assembly is able to support the tension load of the length of pipe when it is clamped to the pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At least one of the line-up clamps, preferably each of the line-up clamps below the line-up clamp mounted on the travelling clamp assembly, includes rollers spaced around the line-up clamp for allowing longitudinal movement of the length of pipe relative to the clamp when it is clamped to the pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At least two of the line-up clamps are preferably able to be adjusted in a plane substantially perpendicular to the tower in both orthogonal directions. That ensures that the desired lateral positioning within the tower of the length of pipe can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A vessel of any of the kinds defined above can be designed to operate at considerable depths with correspondingly high tension loads. For example, the equipment on the vessel is preferably able to handle pipe tension loads over 1,000 tonnes and more preferably over 1,500 tonnes, and preferably loads of 2,000 tonnes.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While certain methods of laying a pipeline are already described above, the invention further provides a method of laying a pipeline from a pipe-laying vessel, in which the vessel is in any of the forms defined above for any of the aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It should be understood that each aspect of the invention may be combined with selected features or all features of one or more of the other aspects of the invention. Indeed in an embodiment of the invention described below all the aspects of the invention are incorporated in one vessel. Similarly, it should be understood that features described only in the context of the vessel may be incorporated in corresponding features of a method of the invention and vice versa.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pipe-laying vessel indicated generally by the reference numeral <b>1</b> is a monohull vessel which carries at its stern a pipe-laying tower indicated generally by the reference numeral <b>2</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, on the starboard side of the vessel, is a crane indicated generally by the reference numeral <b>3</b>. The vessel is equipped with a propulsion system which may include a dynamic positioning system. The vessel further includes much other equipment appropriate for the operation of a pipe-laying vessel, but the description below will be limited mainly to a description of the pipe-laying apparatus and, especially, special features of that apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pipe-laying tower <b>2</b> is pivotally mounted in a central position, for pivoting movement about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vessel, on two mounting arms <b>4</b>P and <b>4</b>S which project upwardly and rearwardly from the main deck at the stern of the vessel <b>1</b>. In this illustrated example of the invention, the tower <b>2</b> is able to lay pipe when pivoted at an angle of about 45 degrees to the horizontal, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and when at steeper angles including the vertical and extending to a position where the angle is more than 90 degrees (for example, 96 degrees) so that the top of the tower projects outwardly beyond the stern of the vessel. As will be understood, the tower <b>2</b> is used for J-laying of a pipeline.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The vessel <b>1</b> is able to lay rigid pipeline that may be supplied to the vessel in straight lengths. Such lengths of pipeline may be welded together in twos, threes or fours on the deck <b>6</b> of the vessel to form longer lengths of pipe which may then be loaded into the tower for joining to the end of a pipeline being laid. This procedure, which is known per se is described in more detail in for example U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,030, the description of which is incorporated herein by reference. In that particular embodiment two lengths of pipe are welded together to form a double joint string and two double joint strings are subsequently welded together to form a quadruple joint string. In the drawings of this specification a quadruple joint string is shown but that is of course only one of several possible arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The tower <b>2</b> generally comprises a pair of box girders <b>5</b>P, <b>5</b>S interconnected by cross girders <b>7</b> at intervals, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The inclination of the tower is controlled by a pair of beams <b>8</b>P and <b>8</b>S which are pivotally mounted on the deck <b>6</b> and extend upwardly therefrom, passing through the girders <b>5</b>P and <b>5</b>S respectively. The girders <b>5</b>P, <b>5</b>S are driven up and down the beams <b>8</b>P and <b>8</b>S by rack and pinion drives (not shown) to tilt the tower <b>2</b>. Although the tower may be intended to operate only at angles of about 45 degrees or more to the horizontal, it is able to be pivoted down to a substantially horizontal position through the beams <b>8</b>P and <b>8</b>S, for example to allow it to be detached from, or attached to, the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The tower <b>2</b> includes a loading arm <b>9</b> which is pivotably connected to the girder <b>5</b>P of the tower <b>2</b> close to the pivotal connection of the girder to the mounting arm <b>4</b>P. The loading arm can be pivoted, by a rope system described in more detail below, between a position, shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in which it lies horizontally over the deck <b>6</b> and a position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in which it lies alongside and on the inside of the girder <b>5</b>P. During pipelaying a pipe string <b>10</b> is loaded onto the loading arm while the arm is in its horizontal position. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the loading arm is provided with a series of hydraulically operated clamps <b>11</b> along its length. The clamps are mounted so that they can be rotated in unison around the loading arm, to enable the pipe string <b>10</b> to be transferred to clamps mounted for movement along the tower, as will be described more fully below. At the lower end of the loading arm <b>9</b>, a stopper <b>12</b> is provided; the stopper <b>12</b> provides an abutment for the end of the pipe string <b>10</b> and supports most of the weight of the pipe string <b>10</b>, so that the clamps <b>11</b> do not have to accommodate that load. The clamp at the top of the loading arm <b>9</b>, referenced <b>11</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, can be displaced along the length of the arm so that it engages the top portion of a pipe string <b>10</b>, for different lengths of string. The loading arm can accept single, double, triple or quadruple joint strings.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The loading arm <b>9</b> is raised and lowered by a winch and rope system that will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The system is actually a dual rope system but, for the purposes of clarity of illustration, only one rope is shown in the drawings. The system generally comprises a winch <b>14</b> having a pair of drums <b>15</b>A, <b>15</b>B around each of which a respective rope <b>16</b> is wound. Each rope <b>16</b> passes from the winch <b>14</b>, which is mounted on a support <b>17</b> (also acting as one of the cross girders <b>7</b>) fixed to the tower <b>2</b>, over pulleys <b>18</b> on the girder <b>5</b>P, around a pulley <b>19</b> on the loading arm <b>9</b>, around a pulley <b>20</b> on the girder <b>5</b>P, around a pulley <b>21</b> on the loading arm <b>9</b>, over a pulley <b>22</b> on the girder <b>5</b>P, around a pulley <b>23</b> on the support <b>17</b> and back to a fixture on the tower <b>2</b> to which the rope is fixed. Along the final section of the rope <b>16</b>, after the pulley <b>23</b>, an equalizer system <b>24</b> is provided. As already indicated, there are actually two ropes <b>16</b> which pass around their own respective pulleys following the path just described and the equalizer system <b>24</b> is connected to both of them. The presence of the equalizer system <b>24</b> ensures that the tension in each rope is approximately the same in a manner known per se.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The dual rope system is arranged such that, even if one of the ropes is severed, the other rope is able to continue to raise and lower the loading arm <b>9</b>, but at a reduced speed of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">When the loading arm <b>9</b> is in a fully raised position it is held in position on the girder <b>5</b>P by one or more clamps (not shown) to provide a secure fastening of the loading arm to the tower <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A pipe string <b>10</b> raised into position along the tower <b>2</b> is received by a line-up clamp system on the tower <b>2</b> that will now be described. The system generally comprises a travelling block <b>30</b> that includes a first line-up clamp <b>33</b> and a first friction clamp <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), a second line-up clamp <b>35</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>) and a third line-up clamp <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The travelling block <b>30</b> has laterally extending arms <b>37</b> which slidably engage rails on the girders <b>5</b>P, <b>5</b>S to mount the travelling block for sliding movement along the tower. The travelling block <b>30</b> is moved along the tower by a rope system (not shown) in the tower that is connected to a winch <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) on the deck <b>6</b> of the vessel in a manner known per se.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">While the first line-up clamp <b>33</b> is mounted for movement along the tower, the positions along the tower of the second and third line-up clamps are fixed: the second line-up clamp <b>35</b> is mounted on the support <b>7</b> in the regions of the winch <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and the third line up clamp <b>36</b> is mounted on a support <b>39</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) lower down the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">When a pipe string <b>10</b> is received in the tower, the travelling block <b>30</b> is positioned towards the top of the tower in the position shown in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The first line-up clamp <b>33</b> is pivotally mounted on the travelling block pivotable about a horizontal axis through 90 degrees between a retracted position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in which the clamp is disposed in a vertical plane and an operative position in which the clamp is disposed in a horizontal plane. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the clamp itself also has an open position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in which a jaw <b>40</b> of the clamp is retracted to an open position, and a closed position in which the jaw <b>40</b> is pivoted through an angle of about 90 degrees to close the central opening through the clamp.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The first friction clamp <b>34</b>, which may be of a design known per se is mounted on the travelling block <b>30</b> below the line-up clamp <b>33</b> and is movable between an open position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and a closed position in which pads in the clamp are pressed inwardly to grip a pipe string held in the clamp. The first friction clamp <b>34</b> is pivotally mounted at pivots <b>41</b> on the travelling block and is retractable from an operative position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to a retracted position by operation of a hydraulic cylinder <b>42</b> which causes the support on which the first friction clamp <b>34</b> is pivotally mounted to pivot rearwardly thereby moving the first friction clamp <b>34</b> rearwardly. The first friction clamp <b>34</b> is also provided internally with a slewing mechanism of a kind known per se that enables a pipe string held by it to be rotated about its longitudinal axis by &#xb1;190 degrees. The slewing mechanism is not shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The second line-up clamp <b>35</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, is carried on an extensible arm <b>43</b> that is pivotally mounted at pivot <b>44</b> for pivoting movement about an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tower <b>2</b>. Pivoting movement of the clamp <b>35</b> is controlled by a hydraulic cylinder <b>47</b>. Like the line-up clamp <b>33</b>, the clamp <b>35</b> has a pivotally mounted jaw <b>45</b> movable between a closed position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, and an open position by a hydraulic cylinder <b>46</b>. The clamp <b>35</b> differs from the clamp <b>33</b> in that the clamp <b>35</b> allows longitudinal movement of the pipe string <b>10</b> through the clamp and for this purpose a plurality of angularly spaced rollers <b>48</b> are provided which are resiliently pressed against the pipe string <b>10</b> but are able to allow the passage of the pipe string <b>10</b>, including for example the welded joints of a string comprising four pipe lengths (a quadruple string). The rollers <b>48</b> are also hydraulically retractable away from the pipe-laying path.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The third line-up clamp <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is of similar construction to the second line-up clamp <b>35</b> and operates in a similar way. The clamp <b>36</b> is carried on an extensible arm <b>50</b> that is pivotally mounted on the tower in a similar manner to the second line-up clamp <b>35</b>. The clamp <b>36</b> allows longitudinal movement of the pipe string <b>10</b> through the clamp and for this purpose a plurality of angularly spaced rollers <b>51</b> are provided which are resiliently pressed against the pipe string <b>10</b> but are able to allow the passage of the pipe string, including for example welded joints. The rollers <b>51</b> are also retractable away from the pipe-laying path.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In addition to the clamp system described above, the tower <b>2</b> is also provided, at its lower end, with a lower clamp assembly <b>60</b> which is able to engage the upper end of the pipeline to which the pipe string <b>10</b> is to be joined. The lower clamp assembly <b>60</b> is mounted on a framework <b>61</b> at the bottom of the tower below the axis of pivoting of the tower <b>2</b> on the mounting arms <b>4</b>P and <b>4</b>S as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>11</b>. The lower clamp assembly includes both a collar clamp <b>62</b> and a second friction clamp <b>63</b> and each of the clamps is independently retractable out of the pipelaying path. Each of these clamps is commonly referred to as a &#x201c;fixed clamp&#x201d; or a &#x201c;hang-off clamp&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The collar clamp <b>62</b> is supported on two rear legs <b>64</b> and two front legs <b>65</b>. The rear legs <b>64</b> are pivotally mounted on a horizontal beam <b>61</b>A of the framework <b>61</b> and the front legs <b>65</b> are detachably secured to the framework <b>61</b>. Thus, with the front legs <b>65</b> detached, the collar clamp can be retracted to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 13</figref>. A pair of hydraulic cylinders <b>67</b> are provided to effect the pivoting movement of the legs. The collar clamp <b>62</b> may itself be of a design known per se and may be provided with a hydraulically actuated jaw <b>66</b> shown in an open position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 to 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The second friction clamp <b>63</b> comprises both a table portion <b>68</b> and clamp portion <b>69</b> upstanding therefrom. Both the table portion <b>68</b> and the clamp portion <b>69</b> are split into two halves <b>68</b>P, <b>68</b>S and <b>69</b>P, <b>69</b>S, with the plane of the split being a vertical plane containing the longitudinal axis of the vessel. The ability of the clamp <b>63</b> to split enables the pipeline to pass freely through the second friction clamp even if it is not retracted and even allows a bulky item to pass through the second friction clamp. The clamp portion <b>69</b> of the second friction clamp <b>63</b> may be of a design known per se and may for example include friction pads pressed by hydraulic pressure against the pipeline.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The table portion <b>68</b> of the second friction clamp <b>63</b> is pivotally connected at its rear end to the horizontal beam <b>61</b>A and is supported vertically by that beam and another beam <b>61</b>B on the opposite side of the pipelaying path. A pair of hydraulic cylinders <b>70</b> are provided for pivoting the table portion <b>68</b>, and therefore the entire second friction clamp <b>63</b>, between its operative position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> and a retracted position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. In normal operation, the second friction clamp <b>63</b> is in its operative position and the collar clamp <b>62</b> is retracted, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">A safety clamp (not shown) may be provided within the table portion <b>68</b>. Such a clamp can be used to grip the pipeline in the event of any slippage through the lower clamp assembly being detected. Thus the safety clamp can provide a contingency system.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The vessel is provided with a welding assembly station <b>100</b> at which pipeline assembly operations are carried out. The assembly station <b>100</b> generally comprises a cabin <b>101</b> which is slidably mounted by wheels <b>102</b> on rails <b>103</b> provided on the deck <b>6</b> as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 16</figref>. The cabin <b>101</b> can thereby be driven between an operative position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> in which the pipeline path passes through the cabin and a retracted position, shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in which the cabin <b>101</b> is clear of the pipeline path. As shown in the drawings the cabin is supported on a frame <b>104</b> which serves to raise the floor of the cabin to a level such that the height within the cabin for the joint (field joint) of the bottom of a pipe string to the top of a pipeline is at the level of the axis of pivoting of the tower <b>2</b> on the mounting arms <b>4</b>P and <b>4</b>S. By arranging for that axis of pivoting to pass through the location of the joint of the new pipe string with the existing pipeline, it becomes much easier to operate across a range of inclinations of the tower <b>2</b>. For example, whilst <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a pipe string <b>10</b> being joined to the top of a suspended pipeline P with the tower <b>2</b> vertical, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows the junction being made with the tower <b>2</b> at an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal and it can be seen that the location of the joint is still within the cabin.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 to 17</figref>, the aft end wall of the cabin and portions of the roof and floor of the cabin are cut away to form a central end slot <b>105</b> in which the pipeline can be accommodated as the cabin is moved from its retracted position to its operative position. Mounted inside the roof of the cabin is a carousel <b>106</b> carrying equipment for use in welding the pipe string <b>10</b> to the pipeline P. The carousel may be a horseshoe shape to facilitate its introduction around the pipelaying path and may be as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,313,426, the description of which is incorporated herein by reference. An overhead crane <b>108</b>, diagrammatically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> is provided in the top of the cabin <b>101</b> and runs on rails <b>107</b> extending along the length of the cabin. Other rails, not shown, may also be provided on the floor of the cabin, extending from the aft end of the cabin, which may be openable, to each side of the location of the field joint.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The portion of the end slot <b>105</b> in the aft end wall of the cabin and the portions of the slot <b>105</b> in the roof and floor of the cabin have associated closure members (not shown) to enable the slot <b>105</b> to be closed over after movement of the assembly station between its retracted and operative positions. Thus the cabin is weatherproof except when it is being used.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The vessel is also equipped with a handling system for enabling bulky items to be included along the pipeline when required. Bulky items such as valve blocks and Pipe Line End Manifolds (PLEMS) are sometimes required to be laid and it is desirable that their laying should not unduly disrupt or delay the pipelaying. The handling system for handling bulky items generally comprises an extension frame <b>110</b> and a tilting frame <b>111</b>, shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The extension frame <b>110</b> includes a pair of legs <b>112</b> carrying wheels at their bottom ends that engage the rails <b>103</b> on which the cabin <b>101</b> is also mounted. The extension frame also includes a pair of longitudinal beams <b>113</b> that extend horizontally towards the stern of the vessel, being supported at their bow ends by the legs <b>112</b> and at their stern ends carry wheels which engage rails <b>114</b> on the roof of the cabin <b>101</b>. In that way the extension frame <b>110</b> is able to move along the deck <b>6</b> of the vessel and can move in unison with the cabin <b>101</b>, but also independently of the cabin <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The tilting frame <b>111</b> is mounted over the extension frame <b>110</b> and is pivotally connected at its stern end to the extension frame at locations indicated by reference numeral <b>116</b>. In a preferred arrangement the locations <b>116</b> can be adjusted to facilitate operations at different tower angles and/or for different shapes of bulky item. One or more hydraulic cylinders <b>300</b> are provided for tilting the tilting frame <b>111</b> relative to the extension frame. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the stern end of the tilting frame incorporates a slot <b>117</b> which overlies an open ended part of the extension frame <b>110</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the extension frame <b>110</b> and tilting frame <b>111</b> are shown in their most forward (advanced towards the pie-laying path) positions relative to the cabin <b>101</b>, but during normal operation when no bulky item is being added to the pipeline the extension frame <b>110</b> and tilting frame <b>111</b> are in the position shown in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The slot <b>117</b> in the tilting frame <b>111</b> and the open end of the extension frame <b>110</b> allow free passage of the pipe string <b>10</b>, even when the tower is tilted to an angle of 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The sequence of operations involved in a cycle of adding one pipe string <b>10</b> to the pipeline P will now be described, taking first the case of an ordinary cycle of operations. Thereafter special cycles of operations will be described, including one in which a bulky item is added to the pipeline.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">An ordinary cycle of operation will be described starting from the position where the loading arm <b>9</b> has just been raised into the tower <b>2</b> and locked thereto and the pipeline P has just been lowered with a new pipe string added thereto and the travelling block <b>30</b> is at the bottom of the tower <b>2</b> above the lower clamp assembly <b>60</b>. The second friction clamp <b>63</b> is closed holding the tension in the pipeline P and the collar clamp <b>62</b> is in its retracted position. At this stage the cabin <b>101</b> has been moved forwards away from the tower.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The travelling block <b>30</b> is first raised to the top of the tower <b>2</b> and the clamps <b>11</b> and the loading arm <b>9</b> are rotated to load a new pipe string <b>10</b> into the pipelaying path (firing line) in the tower <b>2</b>. At the top of the tower <b>2</b>, is an internal line-up system <b>75</b>, including a winch and an internal line-up clamp which is lowered inside the new pipe string in a manner known per se.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The line-up clamps <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> are in a retracted position away from the firing line as the travelling block is moved up the tower. As soon as the travelling block passes each of the clamps <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, they are deployed into their operative positions. When the clamps <b>11</b> on the loading arm <b>9</b> are moved round as the loading arm <b>9</b> is rotated, the new pipe string is introduced into the clamps <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> which are then closed around the new pipe string <b>10</b> the clamp <b>33</b> also being in its operative positions by this time. The line-up clamp <b>33</b> bears the weight of the new pipe string <b>10</b>. The clamps <b>11</b> are then opened, releasing the new pipe string from the loading arm <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The cabin <b>101</b> is then moved rearwardly towards the tower and the top of the pipeline P and the bottom of the new pipe string <b>10</b> received within the cabin <b>101</b>, entering through the slot <b>105</b> in the cabin, the slot being closed after the cabin <b>101</b> has reached its final position. The precise position of the new pipe string <b>10</b> can then be adjusted to move it into exactly the position required for welding to the pipeline P. The longitudinal position of the pipe string <b>10</b> along the tower <b>2</b> can be adjusted by movement of the travelling block and the lateral position of the pipes relative to the firing line can be adjusted in both orthogonal directions by the line-up clamps, and the internal line-up clamp. It will be understood that the line-up clamps <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> allow free longitudinal movement of the pipe string <b>10</b> through them but are able to apply appropriate transverse loads to deform the pipe string <b>10</b> if necessary and line it up.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Once the pipe string <b>10</b> is correctly positioned it is welded to the pipeline P and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) and coating steps also carried out on the joint. The internal line-up clamp is then raised, the line-up clamp <b>33</b> opened and then retracted and the first friction clamp <b>34</b> on the travelling block <b>30</b> closed to grip the top of the pipe string <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The pipeline path (firing line) passes through the axis of pivoting, of the tower <b>2</b> on the mounting arms <b>4</b>P, <b>4</b>S, and the position of the field joint between the new pipe string <b>10</b> and the pipeline P is on that axis. Thus the position of the field joint does not change as the tower is pivoted.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">When the first friction clamp <b>34</b> is fully engaged with the top of the pipe string <b>10</b>, the second friction clamp <b>63</b> is opened so the pipeline is then suspended from the first friction clamp <b>34</b>. The travelling block <b>30</b> is then lowered and at the same time the cabin <b>101</b> is moved forwards away from the tower so that the travelling block <b>30</b> is able to be lowered by the main winch <b>38</b> to the level of the field joint. As the travelling block <b>30</b> is lowered each of the line up clamps <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> are retracted to allow passage of the travelling block <b>30</b>. Once the travelling block has reached a position in which the top of the pipe string <b>10</b> is at the location of the top of the pipeline P at the beginning of the cycle, the travelling block <b>30</b> stops and the second friction clamp <b>63</b> is closed on the pipeline P and takes the tension load of the pipeline. When the second friction clamp <b>63</b> is fully engaged with the pipeline P, the first friction clamp <b>34</b> is opened releasing the load from the travelling block.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">After the clamps <b>11</b> on the loading arm <b>9</b> are opened, releasing the pipe string <b>10</b> from the loading arm <b>9</b>, the fastening of the loading arm to the girder <b>5</b>P is released and the winch <b>14</b> operated to lower the loading arm down to its horizontal position on the deck <b>6</b>. A new pipe string <b>10</b> is then loaded onto the loading arm, being held by the clamps <b>11</b> which have been rotated back to their position at the beginning of the cycle and the loading arm then raised by the winch <b>14</b> back to a position adjacent the girder <b>5</b>P and fastened thereto. The lowering and raising of the loading arm <b>9</b> takes place in parallel with the welding of the pipe string to the pipeline and the lowering of the pipeline so that the new pipe string is ready to be rotated into position along the firing line once the travelling block <b>30</b> has been lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the sequence of operations described above, the second friction clamp <b>63</b> is used and not the collar clamp <b>62</b>. In an alternative procedure, the second friction clamp <b>63</b> is retracted and the collar clamp <b>62</b> is pivoted into its operational position. The collar clamp <b>62</b> is then opened and closed at the same times as the second friction clamp <b>63</b> in the sequence of operations described above. As will be understood, the collar clamp <b>62</b> holds the pipeline P by engaging the underside of a collar formed on the pipeline P and, when it is used, each new pipe string <b>10</b> is provided with a collar at the appropriate position for engagement by the collar clamp <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">A vessel of the kind described above can be designed to accommodate very high pipeline tension loads, enabling it to operate in very deep water. For example, the vessel may be able to lay pipeline while accommodating a tension load in the tower of over 1,000 tonnes. The second friction clamp <b>63</b> and/or the collar clamp <b>62</b> may be able to accommodate a tension load of over 1,500 tonnes (in a preferred embodiment 2,000 tonnes) and the travelling block and the first friction clamp <b>34</b> may be able to accommodate a tension load of over 1,000 tonnes (in a preferred embodiment 1,500 tonnes) during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">If the vessel is to operate with the tower <b>2</b> at an angle of more than 90 degrees to the horizontal, then it may be necessary to provide an additional facility to control movement of the loading arm <b>9</b> beyond a 90 degree angle. Such a facility may for example be provided by an additional winch which would only be required to handle the low loads needed to control movement of the loading arm <b>9</b> in the region of a vertical position.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As is already known for pipe-laying vessels, the vessel is also equipped with appropriate equipment to enable the pipeline P to be abandoned from and recovered to the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">If a bulky item is to be added to the pipeline P, the loading arm <b>9</b> is not used to load the bulky item but, instead the handling system including the extension frame <b>110</b> and the tilting frame <b>111</b> are used in a manner that will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 to 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">With the cabin <b>101</b> in its forward position clear of the tower <b>2</b> and with the extension frame <b>110</b> in its forward position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a bulky item assembly <b>120</b>, comprising in this example a quadruple pipe string <b>121</b> incorporating a bulky item <b>122</b> shown as a box shape is loaded by a crane, for example the crane <b>3</b>, onto the extension frame <b>110</b> leaving the parts in the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The extension frame <b>110</b> (and therefore also the tilting frame <b>111</b> and the bulky item assembly <b>120</b>) is then moved aft to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, with the wheels on the legs <b>112</b> travelling along the rails <b>103</b> and the wheels on the stern ends of the beams <b>113</b> of the extension frame <b>110</b> travelling along the rails <b>114</b> on the roof of the cabin <b>101</b>. That brings the parts into the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The extension frame <b>110</b> is then fastened to the cabin <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The cabin is then moved aft to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> taking the extension frame <b>110</b>, the tilting frame <b>111</b> and the bulky item assembly <b>120</b> with it. Also, the bulky item assembly <b>120</b> is skidded along the extension frame <b>110</b> to lie over the tilting frame <b>111</b> and is secured to it. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> the cabin <b>101</b> is moved far enough aft that the pivot locations <b>116</b> are close to the pipelaying path in the tower <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The tilting frame <b>111</b> is then tilted about the extension frame <b>110</b> at the pivot locations <b>116</b> using the hydraulic cylinders until the tilting frame <b>111</b> extends parallel to the tower <b>2</b>. In this position the pipe string <b>121</b> is disposed along the normal pipestring path within the tower <b>2</b> and the pipe string <b>121</b> can be engaged by the line-up clamps <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>36</b>, in substantially the same manner as the pipe string <b>10</b>. Also the bulky item <b>122</b> may engage the rails on the girders <b>5</b>P, <b>5</b>S of the tower <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Once the pipe string <b>121</b> is securely held in the tower <b>2</b>, the fastening to the tilting frame <b>111</b> is released and the tilting frame returned to its horizontal position on the extension frame <b>110</b>. The cabin <b>101</b> can then be moved further aft and, if necessary, the bulky item lowered a short distance down the tower to bring the field joint between the bulky item assembly <b>120</b> and the pipeline to the usual location in the cabin <b>101</b>. Once the various operations associated with making the field joint are complete, the cabin can be retracted towards the bow of the vessel, the pipe string <b>121</b> can be engaged by the first friction clamp <b>34</b> on the travelling block <b>30</b>, the line-up clamps <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> can be opened and retracted, the second friction clamp <b>63</b> can be released and split into its two halves and the pipeline with the bulky item assembly <b>120</b> now defining its upper end lowered by the travelling block <b>30</b> down to the usual lower position of the travelling block <b>30</b> at the level where the field joint is made. The second friction clamp <b>63</b> can then be returned to its normal unsplit position and operated to grip the upper end of the pipe string <b>121</b> with the bulky item <b>122</b> now deployed in the water clear of the clamp <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The description above of the operation of the bulky item handling system has been provided for the case where the tower <b>2</b> is inclined at an angle of about 45 degrees to the horizontal but it will be understood that the operation can be carried out in the same way for steeper angles of the tower <b>2</b>, including the case where the tower is vertical.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In the procedure described immediately above, the bulky item assembly <b>120</b> is first placed towards the bow end of the extension frame <b>110</b> and is then skidded onto the tilting frame <b>111</b>. An alternative possibility is to place the assembly <b>120</b> in its final position on the tilting frame <b>111</b> at the outset.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Whilst one particular form of vessel has been described above with reference to the drawings, it will be understood that many modifications may be made to that embodiment and some of these modifications are mentioned below.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the described embodiment a travelling block <b>30</b> is provided for lowering the pipeline P into the water, but it should be understood that other systems, for example, using tensioners, may also be employed. Also, in the described embodiment the loading arm <b>9</b> is pivotally mounted in the region of the bottom of the tower but an alternative arrangement would be for it to be in the form of a strongback and for the end of the loading arm nearer to the tower when the arm is horizontal to be raised up the tower. Furthermore, in the described embodiment, the tower is able to operate at a range of angles but it is also possible for the tower to be fixed, for example, in a vertical position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the tower <b>2</b> is shown with a stinger <b>80</b> at its bottom, this being an option (usually preferred). The construction of the stinger <b>80</b> may be of a kind known per se.</p>
