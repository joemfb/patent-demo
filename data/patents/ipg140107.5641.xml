<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Related keywords are processed by an apparatus and/or a system. A method of processing related keywords may include: receiving a primary keyword inputted by a user; and forming a spliced uniform resource locator (URL), which may be used for requesting related keywords based on the primary keyword. The method may further include establishing a link between an embedded window object in a current web page and a server using the URL to obtain the related keywords from the server. The embedded window object may create keyword list and may present the related keywords in the current web page. The method may further include: obtaining a related keyword selected by the user; and selectively adding the related keyword into an input box.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the national stage application based on international patent application PCT/CN2007/070562, which claims priority from a Chinese patent application, Application No. 200710090413.3, which has been filed to China Patent Office on Apr. 6, 2007, entitled &#x201c;METHOD AND SYSTEM OF PROCESSING CORRELATED KEYWORDS&#x201d;, and incorporates the Chinese patent application in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of data processing, and particularly relates to methods, apparatuses and systems of processing related keywords.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Along with the rapid increase of the use of texts and multimedia contents on the Internet and other data networks and systems, an end user has become increasingly reliant on keyword-based search tools to find required information. In order to obtain a better and more accurate search result, one existing method provides related keywords to to be selected to conduct further searches.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In existing technologies, a process of selecting related keywords includes: click a selection button of related keywords to open a selection window of the related keywords; select related keywords in the window; close the window; and present all selected related keywords in an input box. For example, one display interface of related keywords according to existing technologies is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Based on this interface, a selection process by a user is as follows. Open a search window of job categories upon clicking a selection button besides &#x201c;job categories&#x201d;. The user checks relevant categories after selecting &#x201c;computer network technology generally&#x201d;, and clicks a &#x201c;confirm&#x201d; button upon selection to obtain a presentation of the corresponding &#x201c;job categories&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the demands for information rapidly increase, searching has become one of the most frequently used applications in information technology. However, the users experience some deficiencies of the above method of selecting related keywords in these frequently used information search applications. A selection window usually blocks out the related content of a current page, leading to a poor user experience. When multiple related keywords are selected, the user cannot see the result corresponding to multiple selections before completing the selections in a selection window, making the operations non-intuitive.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, a current technical problem that requires a solution is how to process related keywords in order to satisfy the ever-increasing operating and browsing requirements of users.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In order to more clearly and easily understand the goals, characteristics and advantages of the present disclosure, the present disclosure is described in further detail below using accompanying figures and exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a flow chart of an exemplary method of processing related keywords in accordance with the present disclosure. Specifically, the method includes the procedures described below.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">At Block <b>301</b>, receive a primary keyword inputted by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">At Block <b>302</b>, based on the primary keyword, form a spliced URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to request related keywords of the primary keyword.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">At Block <b>303</b>, an embedded window object in a current web page establishes a link with a server using the URL. The server returns the related keywords to the embedded window object.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">At Block <b>304</b>, the embedded window object creates a keyword list to present the related keywords.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At Block <b>305</b>, obtain a related keyword selected by the user and instantaneously add the related keyword into an input box.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It should be noted that a related keyword can be any keyword that has a relationship with the primary keyword. Examples include a related keyword that is extracted from webpages by matching to the primary keyword, a related keyword that is matched visually or intuitively, or a related keyword that is related by meaning. The correspondence relationship may be determined by one skilled in the art according to experiences or needs. The present disclosure does not have any limitation this.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">It is appreciated that the user inputs the primary keyword in a primary keyword input box to trigger a local program or a script program of the current web page for receiving the primary keyword inputted by the user. Exemplary acts of triggering may include: clicking the primary keyword input box using a mouse, entering into the primary keyword input box through a TAB button, and other triggering actions. Based on the primary keyword, the local program or the script program of the current web page subsequently splices the URL that requests the related keywords of the primary keyword. Preferably, the splicing of a URL of related keywords may be in the form of: prefix of server URL+primary keyword+related keyword ID. For example, if the primary keyword is &#x201c;tea&#x201d;, a related keyword ID is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, and a prefix of a server URL is http://sh.vip.alibaba.com/front/relatedKeywordsFront.htm, then a URL of related keywords will be http://sh.vip.alibaba.com/front/relatedKeywordsFront.htm?keywords=tea&#x26;pdSessionId=1.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Naturally, the method of forming a spliced URL may be freely determined by one skilled in the art according to needs or experience. For example, it is possible to set up related keyword IDs according to a corresponding related keyword group list, and/or to set up a category parameter of the primary keyword, as well as adopt other methods of forming a spliced URL. The present disclosure does not have any limitation on this matter.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Upon forming the spliced URL, the embedded window object in the current web page may establish a link with the server using the URL. Preferably, the embedded window object is iframe, where iframe is a form of framework and can be embedded in any arbitrary part of the web page. Under this circumstance, a src property of iframe in the current web page is set to be the URL, thereby allowing iframe to access the URL to send a GET request to the server. The server returns the related keywords to the embedded window object. Naturally, the embedded window object can be any other window object in existing technologies (e.g., frame). The present disclosure does not have any limitation on this matter.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Preferably, the embedded window object creates the keyword list through the procedure below.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A sub-block A<b>1</b> predetermines a keyword list container. The keyword list container includes one or more related-keyword containers.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Herein, a container has properties such as margin, padding, frame, width, height, float and clear. In this exemplary embodiment, an initial status of a container may be preset to be float and hidden.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A sub-block A<b>2</b> receives a request for opening the keyword list and obtains a height value of the keyword list and an offset relative to the input box based on the request.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The user can click the input box using a mouse, enter the input box through a TAB button, or use any other triggering actions to trigger a request for opening the keyword list. The embedded window object may obtain the predetermined height value of the keyword list and the offset relative to the input box in the local program or the script program of the current web page. Naturally, the method of obtaining such information can be selected by one skilled in the art according to experience or needs. The present disclosure does not have any limitations on this matter.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A sub-block A<b>3</b> sets the height of the keyword list container and its position in the current web page based on the height value of the keyword list and the offset relative to the input box.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Using the above setup, the keyword list and the input box are closely associated with each other to provide an excellent display interface. This allows the user to clearly discern a correspondence relationship between the keyword list and the input box and have a good user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Naturally, the method of creating a keyword list by an embedded window object can be any suitable method in existing technologies. The present disclosure does not have any limitations on this matter.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In practice, the above scheme in the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied to a situation where one or more related keywords are added into a single input box, or a situation where one or more related keywords are separately added into multiple input boxes. When one or more related keywords are separately added into multiple input boxes, the height values and relative offsets and are obtained in a like manner. That is, height values and offsets corresponding to a local program or a script program of a current web page are obtained based on a request for opening keyword lists. Based on the height values and offsets, heights of the keyword lists and respective positions in the current web page are separately set up.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Preferably, the procedure of presenting the related keywords includes the following sub-procedures:</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">A sub-block B<b>1</b> predetermines a style for the keyword list container.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A sub-block B<b>2</b> presents the related keywords in the keyword list container according to the style.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Preferably, a style for a keyword list container may be controlled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). For example, a CSS rule may be created to automatically complete a format setup and control a present font to be in red color and background to be green, etc., within a text range that is indicated by a class property.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Under this circumstance, the related keyword that is selected by the user may preferably be obtained through the following procedures:</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A sub-block C<b>1</b> obtains a related-keyword container corresponding to the user selection and changes the style for the related-keyword container.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A sub-block C<b>2</b> takes the related keyword in the related-keyword container according to the request for selecting the related keyword from the user.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In practice, one application scenario may be as follows. When a user moves a mouse over a certain related keyword in a keyword list, a local program or a script program of a current web page is triggered to obtain a container of the related keyword and control a style sheet to alter the style for the related-keyword container such that the related keyword appears distinct from other related keywords. For example, the related keyword is highlighted by controlling the style sheet to give user a more intuitive and convenient presentation and easier operation.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In order to improve the efficiency of processing the related keywords, the exemplary method may obtain related keywords dynamically. Specifically, refreshed content in a container is obtained each time under the premise of not changing the height and the position of the container. This way, when a user submits a request for selecting related keywords by clicking on a certain keyword or any other method, a local program or a script program of the current web page only needs to simply retrieve the related keyword in the pertinent container according to the request.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">One deficiency of the existing technologies of that causes non-intuitive operations for a user is that when multiple related keywords are selected, a result of multiple selections cannot be obtained until the user has completed all selections in a selection window. To overcome this problem, the exemplary method instantaneously adds a selected related keyword into an input box once the related keyword has been selected by the user. Multiple related keywords are obtained by multiple instantaneous additions of related keywords into an input box. Under this circumstance, the exemplary method may further include the following procedure to optimize related keywords that are added into an input box.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">First, determine whether the number of related keywords in the input box is greater than or equal to a predetermined number, and close the keyword list if affirmative.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">For example, suppose the number of related keywords that can be added to an input box is preset to be seven. After the user has selected seven related keywords, the keyword list is closed, indicating that the number of related keywords in the input box is met and no more related keyword can be added into the input box.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Preferably, the exemplary method may further include the following optimization procedures:</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">determine whether an obtained related keyword is a duplicate of any related keyword in the input box, and skip adding the related keyword into the input box if yes; and/or</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">determine whether the input box already has any related keyword, and insert a separator prior to the related keyword to be added if yes. For example, a comma may be used as a separator to separate related keywords.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">It is noted that the above optimization procedures may be applied individually or in any arbitrary combination depending on the needs. In other words, one may use just a single procedure or multiple procedures. The above procedures may be freely combined and do not have any limitation on the sequence. Moreover, one may further set up other optimization procedures based on the needs. For example, existing related keywords in the input box may be cleaned up to remove the empty spaces between commas; consecutive commas may be combined into one comma; or an empty space may be converted into a comma, etc. The present disclosure does not have any limitations on this matter.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In practice, a preferred optimization scheme may include the following procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">A block A determines whether the number of related keywords in the input box is greater than or equal to a predetermined number, and close the keyword list if affirmative.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">A block B determines whether an obtained related keyword is a duplicate of any related keyword in the input box, and will not add the related keyword into the input box if yes.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A block C determines whether the input box already has any related keyword, and instantaneously inserts a separator prior to the related keyword to be added if yes.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A block D determines whether the number of related keywords in the input box is greater than or equal to the predetermined number, and closes the keyword list if yes.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a display interface of related keywords obtained using the disclosed method. A user inputs a primary keyword, &#x201c;dvd&#x201d;, into an input box. A corresponding keyword list refers to the content corresponding to &#x201c;Suggested keywords&#x201d;. When a mouse of the user moves to &#x201c;home appliance&#x201d;, the exemplary method changes the style for the container of &#x201c;home appliance&#x201d; to distinguish it from other related keywords. The input box already has related keywords&#x2014;&#x201c;vcd&#x201d; and &#x201c;mp3&#x201d; at this point. If the user clicks &#x201c;home appliance&#x201d; using the mouse, the related keyword &#x201c;home appliance&#x201d; is added after inserting a comma behind &#x201c;mp3&#x201d;. From this display interface, it is clear that the exemplary method allows a close association between a keyword list and an input box of a current web page for a good display interface. The user can easily discern a correspondence relationship between the keyword list and the input box to have a good operating experience. Moreover, by instantaneously adding a related keyword selected by the user into the input box, user operation is more intuitive, thus improving efficiency of user operations.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a structural diagram of an exemplary system of processing related keywords in accordance with the present disclosure. The system includes a server <b>506</b> and an apparatus of processing related keywords. The apparatus of processing related keywords includes several units as follows.</p>
