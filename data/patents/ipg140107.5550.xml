<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Dependents, employees, business associates, family members, and others may have a difficult time with disciplined adherence to a budget, saving for specific items in the long-term, appropriately prioritizing spending, spending habits, and money management in general. Often, money is spent spontaneously such that there is often not enough money left in a budget to buy high priority items. Many are then forced to go over budget and borrow money or take out lines of credit to pay for these high priority items. In most instances, paying back the funds borrowed or taken out on credit may be difficult, expensive, and prolonged. Existing money management systems may be too conceptual, too expensive, or too restrictive.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Also, parents may not be able to appropriately discern motives of others that may intend to transfer funds to their children's accounts. For example, predators may offer to transfer funds to young account holders as a way to gain trust from them.</p>

The payment may be automatically transferred or may be subject to approval and/or verification, as discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The savings goal purchase module(s) <b>278</b> is related to the savings module(s) of the administration module discussed herein. The savings goal purchase module(s) <b>278</b> may include the parameters to purchase, perhaps automatically, the product associated with the savings goal when the goal is met. This on-line layaway may satisfy an impulse to buy a product &#x201c;now.&#x201d; However, if there is insufficient funds in an account, the item may be selected for automatic payment when there is enough in the account. In this way, the account holder does not have to remember to purchase the item when the account has the funds. Also, having on-line layaway may be a lesson in savings, setting goals, and meeting goals. The merchant associated with the on-line layaway may offer discounts on goals listed in the savings modules and may &#x201c;lock in&#x201d; sale prices or offer other sales incentives. Further, the primary account holder may offer discounts on certain purchases to the secondary account holder (by paying the difference between what the secondary account holder pays and the actual sales price) or the primary account holder may provide a fund matching program to promote financial literacy.</p>

Fraud may occur with respect to unauthorized use of financial instruments, non-delivery of goods, and abuse of personal information. The primary account holder and the secondary account holder may have a relationship, such as parent-child. Because the secondary account holder may be a minor, contract law may not be able to be enforced. Potential fraud issues include: the secondary user may purchase something that the parent did not approve of; there may be a separate financial account of the secondary user; originating IP addresses and cookies may not be consistent with previous logins; and blocking of payments from and to secondary accounts. Methods to determine whether fraud has or is occurring include use of IP controls, and analysis of IP addresses and system cookies. The merchant/seller may also block access from these accounts.</p>

The savings account record is established in the savings account table <b>306</b>. The spending account record is established in the spending account table <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The flow chart <b>1800</b> may proceed to account management at <b>1840</b> and/or may proceed to savings goals at <b>1850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">At block <b>1840</b>, spending control, spending limits, and other administrative controls may be set up with respect to the secondary account by the primary account holder. The secondary account may be managed, controlled, limited and/or suspended as described herein. The controls and limits may be dynamic, changing as per the primary account holder. Administrative controls record is established in the administration and security levels table <b>310</b>. Monitoring and approval(s) records are established in the monitoring and approval(s) table <b>316</b>. Spending control record is established in the spending control table <b>312</b>. Spending limits record is established in the spending limit table <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The primary account holder may have the account automatically change over time or may actively change the control and limits, e.g., in the instance where the secondary account holder is a &#x201c;grounded&#x201d; dependent of the primary account holder, the account may be suspended.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The secondary user may become a primary user upon relinquishing of controls and limits by the primary user. The controls and limits may be relinquished in a graduated track, gradually relinquishing controls and limits in a step by step fashion as time, trust, and maturity levels of the secondary account holder increase. The graduated track may correspond to the security levels designated by the primary account holder for the secondary account. The security levels may decrease from a higher to a lower level or may increase to a higher level, for instance, if there is an instance of friendly fraud or secondary account suspension. The security levels may automatically adjust, may be preset by the primary account holder to adjust if certain prerequisites are met, or may be manually adjusted. The secondary user then may establish the primary account with the financial service provider. The primary accounts of the primary user and secondary user may be linked in the system <b>112</b>, which may provide some accessibility convenience. For example, when dependents leave for college, more financial responsibility may be appropriate for parents to render. The dependent may alternatively migrate to a type of credit card, a Campus card, or another age appropriate fund access model, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In an instance where the secondary user earns money, at a job, for instance, the money may be in the same secondary account, may be in an account linked to the secondary account, or may be in the secondary account, but partitioned similar to how the savings and spending accounts are now partitioned, with primary-controlled ability to transfer between the sub-accounts. The financial service provider may have some privacy controls to allow the secondary user to block or limit access to the self-earned account from the primary user.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Funds may be transferred to the secondary account. The funds may be a result of an allowance or an automatic transfer from the primary account, as a one time occurrence, or on a periodic basis, as determined by the primary user. In response to a primary account holder management module of the account administration module, the funds transfer module may be configured control and/or limit funds transfer to the secondary account from an outside source.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">At block <b>1850</b>, the secondary account holder and/or the primary account holder may set up a savings goal related to purchase of goods or services, or another goal, such as a college fund.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">At block <b>1860</b>, the savings goal(s) may be funded in the savings account(s) of the secondary account holder.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">At block <b>1870</b>, upon reaching the savings goal, the goods or services may be paid for. The goods or services may be automatically paid for, for example, in the instance where the primary account holder has allowed such parameters on the account. In a further embodiment, the user may be prompted for authorization to pay for the goods or services, upon reaching the savings goal. In this embodiment, the payment is only made upon receiving appropriate authorization from the user.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The financial service provider and/or the payment module may debit a system account of the client user (in this case, the secondary account holder) and credit a system account of the seller or third party. In addition, the financial service provider and/or the payment module may charge the client user's credit cards, automatically withdraw funds from a bank account of the client user, or automatically withdraw funds from credit instruments associated with the FSP (e.g. including the PAYPAL&#xae; Buyer Credit technology). The financial service provider and/or the payment module may pay the third party and/or vendor by depositing funds into a system account or a bank account of the third party. In additional embodiments, the payments may be peer-to-peer, business-to-business, and/or consumer-to-business. The financial service provider may charge a transaction fee and/or a surcharge fee. The transaction and/or surcharge fee may be included in the price shown to the client user or buyer. The payment transferred from the client user may include the payment sent to the third party and the transaction/surcharge fee assessed by the financial service provider. Order information and payment confirmation may be sent to the third party. The order information may include shipment information.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The third party may optionally process the order, and optionally ship (or otherwise provide) the product, service, or donation, if applicable. The product and/or receipt may be physically received at the default address destination of the client user. Additionally or alternatively, the client user may receive an electronic confirmation, such as a receipt or a voucher for a service or donation, via e-mail, web page update, device application update, a voicemail message, a text message, and/or a telephone message. The shipment/receipt may alternatively or additionally be sent by the application server(s). For example, the shipment may include a message sent to the network-based device, such as a link to download an application that is ordered by the client user, a message including a code to access a service that is ordered, or a message including ordered information, such as stock purchase information. In an embodiment where a donation is made, there may be no shipment and there may be a receipt sent to the user.</p>
