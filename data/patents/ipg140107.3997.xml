<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a display panel and a manufacturing method thereof, and more particularly to a display panel having a narrow bezel and a manufacturing method thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The rapid progress of science and technology in modern society largely benefits from the rapid progress of semiconductor components or human-machine display devices. Because of its excellent display quality and economic advantage, cathode ray tubes (CRTs) have dominated the market in recent years. However, it may not be a perfect choice for a user who simultaneously operates several computer terminals/displays, or from the view of environmental protection. In view of the energy saving trend, the CRT has many problems, such as limited space utilization and considerable energy consumption. In particular, the CRT is not capable of providing a solution to meet the light, slim, short and small tendency today and the demand on low power consumption. Therefore, the liquid crystal display (LCD) with the predominant features, such as high display quality, high space utilization, low power consumption and no radiation, gradually becomes the main stream of the market.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a schematic, top view of a conventional liquid crystal display panel, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic, cross-sectional view of the liquid crystal display panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, taken along a line I-I&#x2032;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a liquid crystal display panel <b>100</b> is mainly constituted of an active element array substrate <b>110</b>, a liquid crystal layer <b>120</b>, a sealant <b>130</b> and a color filter <b>140</b>. The color filter <b>140</b> is disposed above the active element array substrate <b>110</b>. The liquid crystal layer <b>120</b> and the sealant <b>130</b> are both disposed between the active element array substrate <b>110</b> and the color filter <b>140</b>. The active element array substrate <b>110</b> has a display region <b>112</b> and a sealant coating region <b>114</b>. The liquid crystal layer <b>120</b> is located in the display region <b>112</b>. The sealant <b>130</b> is located in the sealant coating region <b>114</b> and surrounds the liquid crystal layer <b>120</b>, so as to seal the liquid crystal layer <b>120</b> between the active element array substrate <b>110</b> and the color filter <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in the conventional liquid crystal display panel <b>100</b>, the sealant <b>130</b> forms an arc at each of corner portions R, and an arc circumference Y of each corner portion R is generally larger than a width X of the sealant <b>130</b>. Since the area of the arc corner portions R contacted with the active element array substrate <b>110</b> and the color filter <b>140</b> is small, the adhesive force between the corner portions R of the sealant <b>130</b> and the active element array substrate <b>110</b> and between the corner portions R and the color filter <b>140</b> is low, thereby a peeling phenomenon of the sealant <b>130</b> is easily occurred at the corner portions R. Moreover, since the arc circumference Y of each corner portion R is larger than the width X of the sealant <b>130</b>, inner edges of the corner portions of the sealant <b>130</b> readily span the display region <b>112</b> to pollute the liquid crystal layer <b>120</b>. Thus, product quality or product yield is reduced. As for the liquid crystal display panel having a narrow bezel, the control for the tensile strength and the width of the sealant <b>130</b> is more important than that of the liquid crystal display panel having normal specification. Hence, how to promote the tensile strength of the sealant and accurately control the position of the sealant is paid attention to by those ordinarily skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a display panel which includes a sealant having sufficient tensile strength and accurate width control.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention will now be described more specifically with reference to the following embodiments. It is to be noted that the following descriptions of preferred embodiments of this invention are presented herein for purpose of illustration and description only. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to the precise form disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic, top view of a display panel according to an embodiment of the present invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic, cross-sectional view of the liquid crystal display panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, taken along a line II-II&#x2032;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a liquid crystal display panel <b>200</b> includes a first substrate <b>210</b>, a second substrate <b>220</b> and a sealant <b>230</b>, wherein the first substrate <b>210</b> has a display region <b>212</b> and a sealant coating region <b>214</b>, and the sealant coating region <b>214</b> surrounds the display region <b>212</b>. A pixel array (not shown) of the liquid crystal display panel <b>200</b> is disposed in the display region <b>212</b> of the first substrate <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The second substrate <b>220</b> is disposed above the first substrate <b>210</b>. The sealant <b>230</b> is disposed between the first substrate <b>210</b> and the second substrate <b>220</b> and is located in the sealant coating region <b>214</b>. It should be noted that a distance S is formed between the sealant <b>230</b> and the display region <b>212</b>, wherein S is a positive number, that is, S&#x3e;0. In other words, even if the sealant <b>230</b> covers the entire sealant coating region <b>214</b>, the sealant <b>230</b> still keeps the distance S from the display region <b>212</b>, so as to prevent the sealant <b>230</b> from polluting components in the display region <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The sealant <b>230</b> includes at least one corner portions <b>232</b> and a plurality of strip-shaped portions <b>234</b>, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows four corner portions <b>232</b>. The adjacent strip-shaped portions <b>234</b> intersect at the corner portions <b>232</b>, and a maximum width W of at least one of the corner portions <b>232</b> is larger than widths W<sub>1 </sub>and W<sub>2 </sub>of the strip-shaped portions <b>234</b>. The widths W<sub>1 </sub>and W<sub>2 </sub>of the strip-shaped portions <b>234</b> are smaller than or are equal to 600 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">More specifically, the first substrate <b>210</b> can be an active element array substrate, such as a thin film transistor (TFT) array substrate. The second substrate <b>220</b> can be, but not limited to, a color filter.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, the liquid crystal display panel <b>200</b> also includes a display medium layer <b>240</b> which is disposed between the first substrate <b>210</b> and the second substrate <b>220</b>. The display medium layer <b>240</b> is located in the display region <b>212</b> and surrounded by the sealant <b>230</b>. In the present embodiment, the display medium layer <b>240</b> is, for example, but not limited to, a liquid crystal layer. For convenient description, an area of the display region <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is larger than a coating region of the display medium layer <b>240</b>, but this does not limit the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present embodiment, the sealant <b>230</b> includes four corner portions <b>232</b>, and the corner portions <b>232</b> are substantially arc-shaped. Particularly, an arc circumference A of a side of each corner portion <b>232</b> away from the display region <b>212</b> is smaller than the widths W<sub>1 </sub>and W<sub>2 </sub>of the strip-shaped portions <b>234</b>. That is, the arc circumference A meets the following expressions: 0&#x3c;A&#x3c;W<sub>1 </sub>and 0&#x3c;A&#x3c;W<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, the smaller the arc circumference A is, the larger the width W of each of the corner portions <b>232</b> is, and the corner portions <b>232</b> are more approximate to right angles. Moreover, in an alternative embodiment, the corner portions <b>232</b> of the sealant <b>230</b> can be right angles, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It can be seen from the above description, the corner portions <b>232</b> of the sealants <b>230</b> of the crystal display panel <b>200</b> are designed to be substantially right angles, so that the width W of each of the corner portions <b>232</b> is increased from a side of the corner portion <b>232</b> away from the display region <b>212</b>. In such way, the sealant <b>230</b> can be prevented from spanning or being too close to the display region <b>212</b>, so that the sealant <b>230</b> does not flow into the display region <b>212</b>. Thereby, the display medium layer <b>240</b> in the display region <b>212</b> can be prevented from being polluted. Particularly, inner edges of the corner portions <b>232</b> of the sealant <b>230</b> are prevented from spanning the display region <b>212</b>, and thereby the area of the corner portions <b>232</b> of the sealant <b>230</b> contacted with the first substrate <b>210</b> and the second substrate <b>220</b> is increased. More specifically, compared the sealant <b>230</b> with the conventional sealant having a consistent width, the area of the sealant <b>230</b> contacted with the first substrate <b>210</b> and the second substrate <b>220</b> can be increased by 64 percent, and thereby tensile strength of each of the corner portions <b>232</b> of the sealant <b>230</b> can be promoted. Thus, in subsequent tensile strength test, the sealant <b>230</b> can be prevented from being peeled off at the corner portions <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In order to make the present invention be more readily apparent to those ordinarily skilled in the art, the following embodiments will accompany drawings to describe the manufacturing process of the display panel, but the present invention is not limited to the following embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a manufacturing flow chart of a display panel according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, firstly, as mentioned in step S<b>410</b>, the first substrate <b>210</b> is provided, and the first substrate <b>210</b> has the display region <b>212</b> and the sealant coating region <b>214</b>. The sealant coating region <b>214</b> includes at least one corner region <b>214</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows four corner regions) and a plurality of strip-shaped regions <b>214</b><i>b</i>, and each corner region <b>214</b><i>a </i>is located between the adjacent strip-shaped regions <b>214</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">And then, as mentioned in step S<b>420</b>, a sealant coating apparatus is provided. The sealant coating apparatus is moved along the sealant coating region <b>214</b> so as to coat the sealant <b>230</b> in the sealant coating region <b>214</b>. A distance S is formed between the sealant <b>230</b> and the display region <b>212</b>, wherein S is a positive number, that is, S&#x3e;0. Particularly, a speed of the sealant coating apparatus moved along the corner regions <b>214</b><i>a </i>is smaller than or is equal to one third of a speed of the sealant coating apparatus moved along the strip-shaped regions <b>214</b><i>b</i>. In such way, the corner portions <b>232</b> of the sealant <b>230</b> which are approximate to right angles can be formed in the sealant coating region <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the present embodiment, the speed of the sealant coating apparatus moved along the strip-shaped regions <b>214</b><i>b </i>is 30 millimeters per second, and the speed of the sealant coating apparatus moved along the corner regions <b>214</b><i>a </i>is 10 millimeters per second. However, the above-mentioned speed is an embodiment of the present invention, and the present invention is not limited to the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After that, as mentioned in step S<b>430</b>, the second substrate <b>220</b> is provided, and the second substrate <b>220</b> is pressed onto the first substrate <b>210</b>. The second substrate <b>220</b> is connected to the first substrate <b>210</b> via the sealant <b>230</b>. It is worth mentioning that, in the present embodiment, after forming the sealant <b>230</b>, the display medium layer <b>240</b> is formed in the display region <b>212</b>. In the present embodiment, the display medium layer <b>240</b> is, for example, a liquid crystal layer, and a method for forming the display medium layer <b>240</b> can be an injection method, that is, after the second substrate <b>220</b> is pressed onto the first substrate <b>210</b>, liquid crystal is injected between the first substrate <b>210</b> and the second substrate <b>220</b>. In an alternative embodiment, an one drop filling (ODF) method can also be used to form the display medium layer <b>240</b>, that is, after the sealant <b>230</b> is formed, the liquid crystal is dropped into the display region <b>212</b> and then the second substrate <b>220</b> is pressed onto the first substrate <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In other embodiments of the present invention, other methods can be used to increase the area of the corner portions of the sealant contacted with the display panel and the upper and lower substrates, some embodiments will be described hereinafter.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as mentioned in step S<b>510</b>, firstly, the first substrate <b>210</b> having the display region <b>212</b> and the sealant coating region <b>214</b> is provided, wherein the sealant coating region <b>214</b> surrounds the display region <b>212</b>. After that, a sealant <b>630</b> is formed in the sealant coating region <b>214</b>. More specifically, as mentioned in step S<b>520</b>, firstly, a first sealant strip <b>632</b> is coated along a first direction X<b>1</b> in the sealant coating region <b>214</b>, and then as mentioned in step S<b>530</b>, a second sealant strip <b>634</b> is coated along a second direction X<b>2</b>. A first distance S<b>1</b> is formed between the first sealant strip <b>632</b> and the display region <b>212</b>, and a second distance S<b>2</b> is formed between the second sealant strip <b>634</b> and the display region <b>212</b>, wherein S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> are positive numbers, that is, S<b>1</b>&#x3e;0 and S<b>2</b>&#x3e;0. In the present embodiment, the distance S<b>1</b> is, for example, but not limited to, equal to the second distance S<b>2</b>. Additionally, a third distance D is formed between two ends of the second sealant strip <b>634</b> and the first sealant strip <b>632</b> adjacent to the second sealant strip <b>634</b>. In the present embodiment, the third distance D is, for example, smaller than 100 micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">More specifically, in the present embodiment, the first sealant strip <b>632</b> and the second sealant strip <b>634</b> are formed in the sealant coating region <b>214</b> of the first substrate <b>210</b> via, for example, a dispensing method. Moreover, in the present embodiment, although the first sealant strip <b>632</b> is coated along the first direction X<b>1</b> before the second sealant strip <b>634</b> is coated along the second direction X<b>2</b>, the present invention does not limit the forming sequence of the first sealant strip <b>632</b> and the second sealant strip <b>634</b>. For example, the first sealant strip <b>632</b> and the second sealant strip <b>634</b> can also be formed simultaneously via a screen printing method.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">After that, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, as mentioned in step S<b>540</b>, the second substrate <b>220</b> is provided, and the second substrate <b>220</b> is pressed onto the first substrate <b>210</b>. Moreover, in the present embodiment, after the sealant <b>230</b> is formed, the display medium layer <b>240</b> is formed in the display region <b>212</b>. The display medium layer <b>240</b> of the present embodiment is, for example, the liquid crystal layer. A method for forming the display medium layer <b>240</b> can be the injection method or the one drop filling method. Those ordinarily skilled in the art should know the detail processes, and detailed description is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, after the second substrate <b>220</b> is pressed onto the first substrate <b>210</b>, the first sealant <b>632</b> and the second sealant <b>634</b> are respectively extended along the first direction X<b>1</b> and the second direction X<b>2</b> and intersect with each other, and thus corner portions <b>636</b> are formed. Specifically, each corner portion <b>636</b> includes at least one extending block <b>637</b> located on a side of the corner portion <b>636</b> away from the display region <b>212</b> and extended along at least one of the first direction X<b>1</b> and the second direction X<b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the extending blocks <b>637</b> are extended along the first direction X<b>1</b> from the sides of the corner portions <b>636</b> away from the display region <b>212</b>. A length L<b>1</b> of each of the extending blocks <b>637</b> along the first direction X<b>1</b> can be determined according to sizes of the thickness, the viscosity and the third distance D of the first sealant strip <b>632</b>. For example, the length L<b>1</b> of each of the extending blocks <b>637</b> of the present embodiment is, for example, one third of a width W<sub>1 </sub>of the first sealant strip <b>632</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, in another embodiment of the present invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the extending blocks <b>637</b> of the corner portions <b>636</b> of the sealant <b>630</b> can be extended along the second direction from the sides of the corner portions <b>636</b> away from the display region <b>212</b>. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each corner portion <b>636</b> of the sealant <b>630</b> can simultaneously include an extending block <b>637</b><i>a </i>extending along the first direction and an extending block <b>637</b><i>b </i>extending along the second direction. In an alternative embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, each corner portion <b>636</b> of the sealant <b>630</b> can also include an extending block <b>1037</b> simultaneously extending along the first direction and the second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is worth mentioning that, in the above-mentioned embodiments, although the extending blocks are quadrilateral and are formed via extending the first sealant strip <b>632</b> and/or the second sealant strip <b>634</b>, but the present invention is limited to the above-mentioned embodiments. In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, extending blocks <b>1137</b> can be sector-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the display panel of the above-mentioned embodiments, since the corner portions of the sealant have the extending blocks extending along the first direction and/or the second direction from the sides of the corner portions away from the display region, the area of the corner portions of the sealant contacted with the first substrate and the second substrate can be increased, and thereby the tensile strength of the corner portions of the sealant can be promoted. More specifically, in the above-mentioned embodiments, the tensile strength of the corner portions of the sealant can be promoted by 20 percent to 30 percent.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Moreover, in the above-mentioned embodiments, except being formed via the dispensing method, the sealant having extending blocks can be, but not limited to, formed via the screen printing method.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Specifically, in the embodiment that the sealant is formed via the screen printing method, the sealant can be designed to have retracting regions, so that the sealant is avoided from being too close to the display region. Thereby, the display medium layer in the display region can be prevented from being polluted. Examples for this will be described below with drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic, top view of a sealant formed on a first substrate according to another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a sealant is formed on the first substrate <b>210</b> and is mainly constituted of two first sealant strips <b>1232</b>, two second sealant strips <b>1234</b> and four corner portions <b>1236</b>. Each corner portion <b>1236</b> includes an extending block <b>1237</b> and a retracting region <b>1238</b>, and the extending block <b>1237</b> of the present embodiment can be, but not limited to, simultaneously extended away from the display region <b>212</b> along the first direction X<b>1</b> and the second direction X<b>2</b>. The retracting region <b>1238</b> is retracted from a side of the corner portions <b>1236</b> adjacent to the display region <b>212</b> along a direction away from the display region <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the present embodiment, each corner portion <b>1236</b> can simultaneously have a retracting region <b>1238</b><i>a </i>retracted away from the display region <b>212</b> along the first direction X<b>1</b> and a retracting region <b>1238</b><i>b </i>retracted away from the display region <b>212</b> along the second direction X<b>2</b>. More specifically, if the retracting distance of the retracting region <b>1238</b><i>a </i>is d<b>1</b>, and a width of the second sealant strips <b>1234</b> is W<sub>2</sub>, the retracting distance d<b>1</b> meets the following expression: W<sub>2</sub>/10&#x2266;d<b>1</b>&#x2266;W<sub>2</sub>/5. Similarly, if the retracting distance of the retracting region <b>1238</b><i>b </i>is d<b>2</b>, and a width of the first sealant strips <b>1232</b> is W<sub>1</sub>, the retracting distance d<b>2</b> meets the following expression: W<sub>1</sub>/10&#x2266;d<b>2</b>&#x2266;W<sub>1</sub>/5.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition, in other embodiments of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a retracting region <b>1338</b> of each corner portion <b>1336</b> can be simultaneously retracted along the first direction X<b>1</b> and the second direction X<b>2</b>, so that arc-shaped or angular retracting region <b>1338</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In summary, in the present invention, the width of the sealant is increased from the side of the sealant away from the display region, so that the maximum width of the corner portions of the sealant is larger than the width of the strip-shaped portions. In such way, the sealant does not pollute the display medium layer, and the area of the sealant contacted with the first substrate and the second substrate is increased. Thereby, the tensile strength of the sealant is promoted.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, in the present invention, since the width of the corner portions can be determined by the screen printing method or the moving speed of the sealant coating apparatus, the width of the corner portions of the sealant can be controlled in a suitable scale. Therefore, the sealant is avoided from exceeding cutting lines of the substrates such that a cutting defect can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">While the invention has been described in terms of what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention needs not be limited to the disclosed embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims which are to be accorded with the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar structures.</p>
