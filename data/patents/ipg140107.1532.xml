<p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to nozzles and jet pumps. More particularly, the present invention relates to nozzles that are used in association with a mixing chamber and a diffuser for the purpose of entraining and mixing solids with a liquid. More particularly, the present invention relates to nozzles having orifices of asymmetrical configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">2. Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Eductors and jet pumps are designed so as to utilize the Bernoulli principle of when pressure is high, velocity is low and inversely when velocity is high, pressure is low. The term &#x201c;eductor&#x201d; or jet pump describes a pump with no moving parts that converts pump pressure into a high-velocity stream (kinetic energy) in order to generate a low pressure. The resulting high-velocity stream produces a low pressure region that draws in and entrains a secondary powder or liquid through the suction inlet (induction port). At the intersection of the issuing motive liquid stream emanating from the nozzle orifice and the secondary additive entering the mixing chamber from the suction inlet, an exchange of momentum produces a mixed stream traveling at a velocity intermediate to the motive fluid and suction velocity. The downstream diffuser section then converts the velocity-pressure back into static pressure at the discharge of the jet pump. In addition to mixing a secondary powder or liquid with a motive liquid, these devices are used to convey, compress and mix gases and vapors.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many eductor and jet pump designs incorporate tabs, skewed swirls and other downstream attachments in the diffuser section to attempt to generate more intense turbulence, thereby attempting to aid to enhance mixing a primary motive fluid with a secondary additive. These obstructions disturb the streamline flow pattern, causing &#x201c;eddies&#x201d; and waves that require considerable energy to support them. This energy is drawn from the primary flow-field (bulk fluid stream), thus reducing the energy level in the flow-field and ultimately reducing the diffuser efficiency. These structure formations may cause the boundary layer to prematurely detach from the pipe wall surface. Relatively larger particles will not follow the bulk liquid flow and will collide and collect on any obstacle in the downstream flow-field.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Generally, eductors and jet pumps are described with three components: (1) a nozzle; (2) an induction port (suction); and (3) a diffuser assembled in a housing. However, two of the most important and functional components of a jet pump are sometimes overlooked. In particular, these are the mixing chamber and the venturi throat section. The mixing chamber is located between the nozzle orifice discharge and the converging inlet into the venturi throat. This is the intersecting, comingling and interacting region between the motive fluid and the secondary additive that has been introduced through the induction port (suction). The first stage of mixing occurs in the mixing chamber and the final stage of mixing occurs in the venturi throat before entering the downstream diffuser section.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The motive nozzle should be designed to produce the highest possible velocity relative to the input energy. The downstream cross-sectional venturi throat should be designed to provide the strongest suction possible before the fluid enters the diffusion section. The diffuser should be designed to provide the greatest amount of energy recovery during conversion.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The diffuser section of the jet pump is a diverging duct that is shaped to gradually recover fluid static pressure from a fluid stream while reducing the downstream flow velocity. It is a means of converting kinetic energy into static pressure. During velocity deceleration and the increase in static pressure, it must be noted that if the diffuser angle of discharge is greater than ten degrees, fluid separation from the conduit wall may occur. In many technical articles, the diffuser discharge angle is recommended to be between seven and twelve degrees. Any higher angle than twelve degrees may cause separation. The diffuser is a pressure recovery tube that is shaped to gradually reduce the velocity and convert the energy into static pressure at the discharge with as little pressure loss as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A key to an efficient and effective diffuser is one that lies in the ability to control the downstream boundary layer and delay detachment. When a flowing fluid stream comes in contact with a stationary surface, a portion of the free-flowing stream velocity is reduced. The free-flowing stream velocity reduction is caused by shear stress between the stationary conduit wall and the moving fluid stream. This frictional flow resistance is known as frictional or viscous drag. A thin layer of fluid adjacent to the conduit or pipe wall surface increases from zero to a mean velocity of the free-flowing stream. The viscous layer near the conduit wall is called the boundary layer. The boundary layer fluid gradually blends into the free-flowing stream.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Diffuser &#x201c;stall&#x201d; is the detachment or separation of flow from the diffuser internal surface walls during fluid deceleration causing the formation of &#x201c;eddies&#x201d; and a region of unsteady flow within the diffuser. The profile of flow exiting from the diffuser and the diffuser pressure recovery are intimately related to the possibility of diffuser stall. A downstream tendency to wall detachment that leads to diffuser stall can block the diffusion flow causing an unsteady and unstable exit flow that may result in a significant loss of pressure and, if the loss is great enough, a reversal of flow can occur. Boundary layer detachment will cause flow reversal. Wall detachment can be influenced by downstream obstruction, lack of energy input to pressurize the jet pump nozzle, excessive numbers of elbow in the downstream flow line cause frictional drag, and high viscosity fluids that can cause a thick boundary layer.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Diffuser performance is largely governed by the growth of the boundary layer and the degree to which the flow conforms to the diffuser internal surface walls. An efficient diffuser is one which converts the highest possible percentage of kinetic energy into pressure within a given restriction in diffuser length and expansion ratio (i.e. aspect ratio). The intensity of the flow-field velocity is determined by the motive feed pressure (Reynolds number), the total mass content of the admixture, the mixture density and downstream viscous drag.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of prior art eductor assembly. As can be seen, the eductor assembly <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has an inlet nozzle section <b>12</b>, a mixing chamber <b>14</b> and a diffuser section <b>16</b>. The inlet nozzle section <b>12</b> has a tubular portion <b>18</b> that extends to a nozzle <b>20</b>. The tubular portion <b>18</b> defines a primary inlet <b>22</b>. The primary inlet <b>22</b> carries a fluid to the nozzle <b>20</b>. The nozzle <b>20</b> has a wide diameter portion <b>24</b> opening to the primary inlet <b>22</b> and a narrow diameter opening <b>26</b> opening to the mixing chamber <b>14</b>. The narrow diameter opening <b>26</b> is adjacent an end of the nozzle <b>20</b> opposite the wide diameter opening <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be seen that the mixing chamber <b>14</b> is connected to the inlet nozzle section <b>12</b> and is in fluid communication with the narrow diameter opening <b>26</b> of the nozzle <b>20</b>. The mixing chamber <b>14</b> has an induction port <b>28</b> opening thereto and extending therefrom. In particular, it can be seen that the nozzle <b>20</b> has an outer surface <b>30</b> that extends greatly into the interior of the mixing chamber <b>14</b> and generally flows inwardly of the wall <b>32</b> of the induction port <b>28</b>. As such, the outer surface <b>30</b> of the nozzle <b>20</b> provides a surface whereby any solids or solid particles that are introduced into the induction port <b>28</b> can accumulate thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The diffuser section <b>16</b> has a secondary inlet <b>34</b> with a wide diameter end <b>36</b> adjacent the mixing chamber <b>14</b> and a narrow diameter end <b>38</b> formed inwardly thereof. The secondary inlet <b>34</b> is the Venturi of the eductor apparatus. A diffuser <b>40</b> is connected by a throat <b>42</b> to the secondary inlet <b>34</b>. The throat <b>42</b> is of a generally constant diameter.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention is a nozzle that comprises a body with a fluid passageway extending through an interior thereof. The fluid passageway has a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet. The body has an end surface formed at the fluid outlet. The body has an orifice formed through the end surface so as to communicate with the fluid passageway. The orifice has a first elliptical portion and a second elliptical portion. Each of the first and second elliptical portions having a major axis and a minor axis.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first elliptical portion and the second elliptical portion are conjoined so as to communicate therebetween. This conjunction of the first and second elliptical portions has a length dimension extending in parallel relation to the major axes of the first and second elliptical portions. The length dimension of the conjunction is less than a length dimension of either of the major axes of the first and second elliptical portions. The major axis of the first elliptical portion is in parallel relation to the major axis of the second elliptical portion. The minor axis of the first elliptical portion is aligned with the minor axis of the second elliptical portion. The major axis of the first elliptical portion has a length dimension approximately twice a length dimension of the minor axis of the first elliptical portion. The major axis of the second elliptical portion has a length dimension of approximately twice a length dimension of the minor axis of the second elliptical portion. The major axis of the first elliptical portion has a length that is equal to a length of the major axis of the second elliptical portion. The minor axis of the first elliptical portion has a length equal to a length of the minor axis of the second elliptical portion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The fluid passageway has a first section extending inwardly from the fluid inlet and a second section converging toward the orifice. The orifice converges from an end of the second section toward the end surface. The orifice has a length that is less than a length of the second section. The first section has a generally constant diameter extending toward the second section. The second section converges at approximately 30&#xb0; toward the orifice. The orifice converges at approximately 8&#xb0; toward the end surface.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention is also a jet pump that comprises a mixing chamber having a first inlet and a second inlet and an outlet, a nozzle positioned at the fluid inlet, and a diffuser positioned at the outlet of the mixing chamber. The diffuser has an outlet at the end opposite the mixing chamber. The nozzle has a body having a fluid passageway extending through an interior thereof. The fluid passageway has a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet. The body has an end surface formed at the fluid outlet. The body has an orifice formed through the end surface so as to communicate with the fluid passageway. The orifice has a first elliptical portion and a second elliptical portion. Each of first and second elliptical portions has a major axis and a minor axis.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The nozzle has a longitudinal axis aligned with a longitudinal axis of the diffuser. The first inlet of the mixing chamber is in transverse relationship to the second inlet surface of the mixing chamber. The outlet of the mixing chamber is axially aligned with the first inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The diffuser has a secondary inlet communicating with the outlet of the mixing chamber, a throat formed at one end of the secondary inlet, and a Venturi extending from the throat to the outlet of the diffuser. The second inlet converges from the outlet of the mixing chamber toward the throat. The Venturi diverges from the throat to the outlet of the diffuser. The Venturi has a conical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The nozzle of the present invention allows a first pressurized fluid to evolve into a pair of secondary jet streams. The asymmetrical converging nozzle of the present invention generates twin geometrically-opposing downstream vortices. The fluid passing through the nozzle can be pressurized using a positive displacement or progressive-cavity pump. Any functional centrifugal pumps that can generate a constant head pressure to produce an issuing velocity at 67 feet per second as the minium velocity is the preferred form of pump.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The low aspect-ratio between a major axis and a minor axis in each elliptical portion generates strong vortical structures that create an interaction between the issuing flow stream and a secondary static liquid producing turbulent mixing. The preferred operating issuing velocity range is 77 feet per second to 95 feet per second. The 77 feet per second will translate into 40 p.s.i. or 92 feet of head and 95 feet per second translates into 60 p.s.i. or 139 feet of head.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the converging nozzle is pressurized, it converts high-pressure, low-velocity flow into high-velocity, low-pressure flow. Since the aspect ratio is 2:1 between the major axis and the minor axis of each elliptical portion, axial shifting develops downstream. Axis switching is a phenomenon in which the cross-section of an asymmetrical nozzle evolves in such manner that axis switching occurs at a certain distance downstream of the nozzle. In other words, the major and minor axes are interchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the present invention, the boundary layer surfaces are short, smooth and uniform in design. At each point within the short converging surfaces in the nozzle, the gradient and static pressure favors the flow and, as a result, the fluid continually accelerates toward the nozzle exit. The short converging surfaces of the nozzle serve to reduce boundary layer friction drag.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The primary application of the present invention is for non-compressible fluids. The nozzle configuration would change for compressible fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The foregoing section is intended to describe, in generality, the preferred embodiment of the present invention. It is understood that variations in the present invention can be made within the scope of the present invention. As such, this section should not be construed, in any way, as limiting of the scope of the present invention. The present invention should be only be limited by the following claims and their legal equivalents.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown the nozzle <b>50</b> in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The nozzle <b>50</b> includes a body <b>52</b> having a generally cylindrical configuration. The body <b>52</b> has an end surface <b>54</b>. Orifice <b>56</b> is formed through the end surface <b>54</b> so as to open to a fluid passageway located within the interior of the body <b>52</b>. A flange <b>58</b> is formed at the end of the body <b>52</b> opposite the end surface <b>54</b>. Flange <b>58</b> allows the nozzle <b>50</b> to be incorporated into a jet pump system.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that the nozzle <b>56</b> has a first elliptical portion <b>60</b> and a second elliptical portion <b>62</b>. Elliptical portions <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> converge together so as to communicate therebetween. Each of the elliptical portions <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> has a major axis and a minor axis. The relationship between the major axes and the minor axes will be described hereinafter in association with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the nozzle <b>50</b>. In particular, the body <b>54</b> has a fluid inlet <b>64</b> and a fluid outlet <b>66</b>. The end surface <b>54</b> is formed at the fluid outlet <b>66</b>. The flange <b>58</b> is formed at the fluid inlet. Fluid passageway <b>68</b> is formed through the interior of the body <b>52</b>. The orifices <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> are formed through the end surface <b>54</b> of the body <b>52</b> so as to communicate with the fluid passageway <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, arrows <b>70</b> show the flow of a fluid through the fluid passageway <b>68</b>. As can be seen, the fluid will pass along a first section <b>72</b>, to a second section <b>74</b>, and then into the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> and the second elliptical portion <b>62</b> of the orifice <b>56</b>. The first section <b>62</b> has a generally constant diameter as it extends to the second section <b>74</b>. The second section <b>74</b> converges inwardly from the first section <b>68</b> toward the first and second elliptical portions of the nozzle <b>50</b>. The orifice <b>56</b> will also converge at an angle from the end of the second section <b>74</b> opposite the first section <b>72</b> toward the end surface <b>54</b> of the body <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is another cross-sectional view of the nozzle <b>50</b> of the present invention. As can be seen, the body <b>52</b> has the first section <b>72</b>, the second section <b>74</b> and the nozzle <b>56</b>. The nozzle <b>56</b> opens, at one end, to the end surface <b>54</b> of body <b>52</b>. The wall <b>80</b> surrounding the nozzle <b>56</b> converges inwardly at approximately 8&#xb0; from the end of the second section <b>74</b> to the fluid outlet at the end surface <b>54</b>. The second section <b>74</b> will converge from the first section <b>72</b> to the end of the nozzle <b>56</b> at approximately 30&#xb0; angle. It can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the first section <b>72</b> has a generally constant diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Fins <b>82</b> are generally formed at the conjunction of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> and the second elliptical portion <b>62</b> of the orifice <b>56</b>. These fins <b>82</b> serve to urge the fluid passing through the fluid passageway <b>68</b> of the nozzle <b>50</b> outwardly. The converging angle of the orifice <b>56</b> serves to bring the fluid back so as to flow directly outwardly. The configuration of the nozzle <b>56</b> corral the fluid so as to pass the fluid outwardly toward the diffusor section. The convergent second section <b>74</b> converts the pump pressure into a high-velocity stream. It can be seen that the nozzle <b>56</b> has a length dimension that is less than the length dimension of the second section <b>74</b> and/or the first section <b>72</b>. Arrows <b>70</b> show the flow of the fluid along the surfaces associated with the first section <b>72</b>, the second section <b>74</b> and the orifice <b>56</b>. In particular, arrows <b>70</b> show the flow of the fluid as part of the boundary layer adjacent to the surfaces. Arrow <b>84</b> shows the direct path of the fluid through the interior passageway <b>68</b>. It can be seen that the boundary layer surfaces are short, smooth and uniform in design. At each point within the short converging surfaces in the orifice <b>56</b>, the gradient and static pressure favors the flow and, as a result, the fluid continuously accelerates toward the exit of the nozzle <b>50</b>. The short converging surface of the orifice <b>56</b> reduces the boundary layer frictional drag. If the converging surfaces of the orifice <b>56</b> were long, then this would detract from the nozzle performance.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an end view of the nozzle <b>50</b> showing, in particular, the end surface <b>54</b> and the configuration of the orifice <b>56</b>. The orifice <b>56</b> has a first elliptical portion <b>60</b> and a second elliptical portion <b>62</b>. The elliptical portions <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> converge in a center <b>86</b> so as to communicate therebetween. This conjunction defines the fins <b>82</b> positioned between the elliptical portions <b>60</b> and <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a detailed view of the configuration of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> and the second elliptical portion <b>62</b> of the orifice <b>56</b>. The conjunction of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> and the second elliptical portion <b>62</b> has a length dimension <b>90</b> that extends in parallel relationship to the major axes <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> and the second elliptical portion <b>62</b>, respectively. The length dimension of the conjunction <b>90</b> is less than the length dimension of either of the major axes <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> and the second elliptical portion <b>62</b>, respectively. The major axis <b>92</b> of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> is shown in parallel relationship to the major axis <b>94</b> of the second elliptical portion <b>62</b>. The minor axis <b>96</b> of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> is aligned with the minor axis <b>98</b> of the second elliptical portion <b>62</b>. The major axis <b>92</b> of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> has a length dimension that is approximately twice a length dimension of the minor axis <b>96</b> of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b>. The major axis <b>94</b> of the second elliptical portion <b>62</b> has a length dimension that is twice the length dimension of the minor axis <b>98</b>. The major axis <b>92</b> has a length that is equal to the length of the major axis <b>94</b>. The length dimension of the minor axis <b>96</b> of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> is equal to the length dimension of the minor axis <b>98</b> of the second elliptical portion <b>62</b>. This particular arrangement of the length dimensions of the major and minor axes creates the unique flow pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the flow pattern of the fluid as it exits the nozzle <b>56</b> at end surface <b>54</b>. The asymmetrical converging nozzle <b>56</b> generates twin geometrically-opposing downstream vortices. The low aspect-ratio between the major axis and the minor axis in each of the first elliptical portion <b>60</b> and the second elliptical portion <b>62</b> generates strong vortical structures that create an interaction between the issuing flow stream and a secondary static liquid-producing turbulent mixing. When the nozzle <b>50</b> is pressurized, it converts high-pressure, low-velocity flow into high-velocity, low-pressure flow. Since the aspect ratio is 2:1 between the major axis and the minor axis, axis switching develops downstream, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Axis switching is a phenomenon that occurs because of the cross-section of the asymmetrical nozzle <b>56</b>. The axis switching evolves in such manner that axis switching occurs at a certain distance downstream of the nozzle. As such, the major and minor axes of the fluid flow are interchanged. This arrangement enhances entrainment and causes intense mixing in comparison to planar and conventional symmetrical nozzles or circular nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The downstream swirling vortices generated by the jet pump nozzle configuration will improve the velocity distribution so as to yield a more uniform exit velocity profile. The expanding uniform velocity distribution increases the velocity along the pipe boundary layer. The increased velocity near the wall surface reduces the frictional drag, thereby increasing the suction strength and the pressure recovery of the diffuser.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the jet pump <b>100</b> in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The jet pump <b>100</b> includes a mixing chamber <b>102</b> having a first inlet <b>104</b>, a second inlet <b>106</b> and an outlet <b>108</b>. The interior volume <b>110</b> allows the mixing of fluid and/or solids or solid particles <b>112</b> that are introduced into the second inlet <b>106</b> to mix with a fluid <b>114</b> that passes the nozzle <b>116</b> through the first inlet <b>104</b>. The nozzle <b>116</b> has a configuration identical to the configuration of the nozzle <b>50</b> as described hereinabove. Ultimately, the orifice <b>56</b> will open into the interior volume <b>110</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b>. A diffuser <b>118</b> is connected to the outlet <b>108</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b>. The diffuser <b>118</b> includes a secondary inlet <b>120</b>, a throat <b>122</b> and a Venturi <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The flow of the fluid through the orifice <b>56</b> of the nozzle <b>116</b> will pass into the interior volume <b>110</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b> so as to begin mix with the solids or liquid <b>112</b>. This mixture will flow into the secondary inlet <b>120</b>. Secondary inlet <b>120</b> has a converging inner wall <b>126</b> which extends from the interior volume <b>110</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b> toward the throat <b>122</b>. The throat <b>122</b> has a generally constant diameter and extends from the secondary inlet <b>120</b> to the Venturi <b>124</b>. The wall <b>130</b> of the Venturi <b>124</b> will diverge outwardly of approximately 15&#xb0; angle from the throat <b>122</b> to the fluid outlet <b>132</b>. The Venturi <b>124</b> will have a conical shape. As such, the mixture <b>134</b> can flow outwardly of the fluid outlet <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The throat <b>122</b> has a cross-section that is 15% to 30% greater in area than the area of a cross-section of the nozzle <b>50</b>. The preferred size is 20% greater. If the fluid viscosity is relatively high or if the viscosity of the fluid is above a specific gravity of 1.8 or larger ratio is required in order for the throat <b>122</b> to accommodate the more viscous or more dense non-compressive fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The excitement of the exit boundary eliminates the need to obey the 15&#xb0; angle rule for conical and two-dimensional diffusers. The divergent angle can be as high as 30&#xb0; without wall detachment or separation. This secures the overall length of the eductor and can be used in a restricted space.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the jet pump <b>100</b> as configured together. In particular, the nozzle <b>116</b> has a flange <b>136</b> extending outwardly at the fluid inlet <b>138</b>. Another flange <b>140</b> can be joined to the flange <b>142</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b>. As such, the fluid passageway <b>144</b> of the nozzle <b>116</b> will be axially aligned with the first inlet <b>104</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b>. The second inlet <b>106</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b> also has a flange <b>146</b> formed thereon. Flange <b>146</b> allows the second inlet <b>106</b> to be joined to another pipe so that the solids or liquid <b>112</b> can be delivered thereinto and into the interior volume <b>110</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b>. The outlet <b>108</b> has a flange <b>148</b> formed at an end thereof. Flange <b>148</b> can be joined to the flange <b>150</b> of the diffuser <b>188</b>. As such, the diffuser <b>188</b> can provide its fluid outlet <b>132</b> so that the mixed fluid/solids or fluid/fluid <b>134</b> to pass outwardly therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an exploded view showing the arrangement of the jet pump <b>100</b> of the present invention. Initially, the nozzle <b>116</b> includes a generally constant diameter first section <b>150</b> that leads to a converging second section <b>152</b>. Converging second section <b>152</b> then opens to the orifice <b>56</b>. The mixing chamber <b>102</b> shows that its first inlet <b>104</b> receives the end of the nozzle <b>116</b> therein. As such, the orifice <b>56</b> can be generally placed adjacent to the interior volume <b>110</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b>. The second inlet <b>106</b> extends in generally transverse relationship to the first inlet <b>104</b> so that the liquid or solids <b>112</b> can pass thereinto and into the interior volume <b>110</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The diffuser <b>118</b> is received within the outlet <b>108</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b>. As a result, the secondary inlet <b>120</b> is placed in close proximity to the interior volume <b>110</b> of the mixing chamber <b>102</b>. The throat <b>122</b> receives the liquid/liquid mixture or solids/liquid mixture from the secondary inlet <b>120</b>. The Venturi <b>124</b> then diverges outwardly toward the outlet <b>32</b>. Suitable pumps can be provided associated with the jet pump <b>110</b> so that pressurized fluid can be delivered thereto. Typically, a positive displacement or progressive cavity pump can be utilized in association with the jet pump <b>100</b>. Additionally, any function centrifugal pump can be used provided that the centrifugal pump can generate a constant head pressure so as to produce an issuing velocity of at least 67 feet per second as the minium velocity. The preferred operating issuing velocity range of 77 feet per second to 95 feet per second. The 77 feet per second will translate into 40 p.s.i. or 92 feet of head. The 95 feet per second will translate into 60 p.s.i. or 139 feet of head.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The jet pump <b>100</b> of the present invention is very versatile. It can be used for mixing liquids and solids. The jet pump <b>100</b> can be utilized as a stand-alone mixture in a closed conduit or in an open tank. The mixing nozzle as used in the jet pump <b>100</b> of the present invention energizes the downstream boundary layer so as to prevent &#x201c;stall&#x201d;. The jet pump <b>100</b> has very efficient pressure recovery. In particular, it is believed that pressure recovery in the order of seventy percent can be provided with the jet pump <b>100</b> of the present invention. This serves to speed up the flow of the solids and provides for longer delivery distances. Additionally, this serves to speed up the flow against the walls of the jet pump <b>100</b> so as to reduce the width of boundary layer. The nozzle of the present invention will speed up the boundary area and reduce friction drag. The jet pump <b>100</b> generates a near-perfect vacuum. Ultimately, a dispersed product can be mixed and delivered through the use of jet pump <b>100</b> of the present invention. Additionally, this dispersed product can be mixed and delivered through the use of the jet pump <b>100</b> of the present invention. Additionally, this dispersed product can be of a uniform mixture. The jet pump <b>100</b> greatly improves the efficiency of the mixing process compared to prior art eductors or jet pumps.</p>
