<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Chemically reactive dyes that are intramolecularly crosslinked with a water-soluble bridge, their bioconjugates and their uses are described. Reactive fluorescent dyes that have a water-soluble bridge are superior to those of conjugates of spectrally non-crosslinked dyes or the dyes that are crosslinked with a hydrophobic bridge. The invention includes reactive fluorescent dyes, their biological conjugates and uses.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to luminescent dyes, including reactive dyes and dye conjugates; and their biological uses.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Luminescent probes are valuable reagents for the analysis and separation of molecules and cells and for the detection and quantification of other materials. A very small number of luminescent molecules can be detected under optimal circumstances. Some specific examples of the application of fluorescent probes are (1) identification and separation of subpopulations of cells in a mixture of cells by the techniques of fluorescence flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated cell sorting and fluorescence microscopy; (2) determination of the concentration of a substance that binds to a second species (e.g., antigen-antibody reactions) in the technique of fluorescence immunoassay; (3) localization of substances in gels and other insoluble supports by the techniques of fluorescence staining. These techniques are described by Herzenberg, et al., &#x201c;CELLULAR IMMUNOLOGY&#x201d; 3rd ed., Chapter 22; Blackwell Scientific Publications (1978); and by Goldman, &#x201c;FLUORESCENCE ANTIBODY METHODS&#x201d;, Academic Press, New York, (1968); and by Taylor, et al., APPLICATIONS OF FLUORESCENCE IN THE BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, Alan Liss Inc., (1986), and Shapiro, PRACTICAL FLOW CYTOMETRY, 4th ed., Wiley-Liss (2003), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When employing luminescent dyes for the above purposes, there are many constraints on the choice of the fluorescent dye. One constraint is the absorption and emission characteristics of the fluorescent dye, since many ligands, receptors, and materials in the sample under test, e.g. blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, will fluoresce and interfere with an accurate determination of the fluorescence of the fluorescent label. This phenomenon is called autofluorescence or background fluorescence. Another consideration is the ability to conjugate the fluorescent dye to ligands and receptors and other biological and non-biological materials and the effect of such conjugation on the fluorescent dye. In many situations, conjugation to another molecule may result in a substantial change in the fluorescent characteristics of the fluorescent dye and, in some cases, substantially destroy or reduce the quantum efficiency of the fluorescent dye. It is also possible that conjugation with the fluorescent dye will inactivate the function of the molecule that is labeled. A third consideration is the quantum efficiency of the luminescent dyes which should be high for sensitive detection. A fourth consideration is the light absorbing capability, or extinction coefficient, of the luminescent dyes, which should also be as large as possible. Also of concern is whether the fluorescent molecules will interact with each other when in close proximity, resulting in self-quenching. An additional concern is whether there is non-specific binding of the luminescent dyes to other compounds or container walls, either by themselves or in conjunction with the compound to which the fluorescent dye is conjugated.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The applicability and value of the methods indicated above are closely tied to the availability of suitable fluorescent compounds. In particular, there is a need for fluorescent substances that emit in the longer wavelength region (yellow to near infrared), since excitation of these chromophores produces less autofluorescence and also multiple chromophores fluorescing at different wavelengths can be analyzed simultaneously if the full visible and near infrared regions of the spectrum can be utilized. Fluorescein, a widely used fluorescent compound, is a useful emitter in the green region although in certain immunoassays and cell analysis systems background autofluorescence generated by excitation at fluorescein absorption wavelengths limits the detection sensitivity. However, the conventional red fluorescent label rhodamine has proved to be less effective than fluorescein.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Phycobiliproteins have made an important contribution because of their high extinction coefficient and high quantum yield. These chromophore-containing proteins can be covalently linked to many proteins and are used in fluorescence antibody assays in microscopy and flow cytometry. The phycobiliproteins have the disadvantages that (1) the protein labeling procedure is relatively complex; (2) the protein labeling efficiency is not usually high (typically an average of 0.5 phycobiliprotein molecules per protein); (3) the phycobiliproteins are natural products and their preparation and purification are complex; (4) the phycobiliproteins are expensive; (5) there are at present no phycobiliproteins available as labeling reagents that fluoresce further to the red region of the spectrum than allophycocyanine, which fluoresces maximally at 680 nm; (6) the phycobiliproteins are large proteins with molecular weights ranging from 33,000 to 240,000 and are larger than many materials that are desirable to label, such as metabolites, drugs, hormones, derivatized nucleotides, and many proteins including antibodies. The latter disadvantage is of particular importance because antibodies, avidin, DNA-hybridization probes, hormones, and small molecules labeled with the large phycobiliproteins may not be able to bind to their targets because of steric limitations imposed by the size of the conjugated complex.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other techniques involving histology, cytology, immunoassays would also enjoy substantial benefits from the use of a fluorescent dye with a high quantum efficiency, absorption and emission characteristics at longer wavelengths, having simple means for conjugation and being substantially free of nonspecific interference.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Fluorescent compounds are covalently or noncovalently attached to other materials to impart color and fluorescence. Brightly luminescent dyes permit detection or location of the attached materials with great sensitivity. Certain carbocyanine dyes have demonstrated utility as labeling reagents for a variety of biological applications, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,981,977 to Southwick, et al. (1991); U.S. Pat. No. 5,268,486 to Waggoner, et al. (1993); U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,587 to Waggoner (1996); U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,766 to Waggoner, et al. (1996); U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,616 to Waggoner, et al. (1996); U.S. Pat. No. 5,627,027 to Waggoner (1997); U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,044 to Brush, et al. (1998); U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,310 to Reddington, et al. (1999); U.S. Pat. No. 6,002,003 to Shen, et al. (1999); U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,536 to Leung, et al. (1999); U.S. Pat. No. 6,008,373 to Waggoner, et al. (1999); U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,025 to Minden, et al. (2000); U.S. Pat. No. 6,127,134 to Minden, et al. (2000); U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,094 to Waggoner, et al. (2000); U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,445 to Waggoner, et al. (2000). Nevertheless, many carbocyanine dyes are known to share certain disadvantages, e.g. severe quenching of the fluorescence of carbocyanine dyes in biopolymer conjugates, e.g. quenching of Cy5 and Cy7 dye variants on conjugates, as discussed by Gruber, et al., BIOCONJUGATE CHEM., 11, 696 (2000). In addition, certain desired sulfoalkyl derivatives of the reactive carbocyanine dyes are difficult to prepare, as indicated for Cy3 and Cy5 variants by Waggoner and colleagues in BIOCONJUGATE CHEM., 4, 105, 109 (1993). Cyanine dyes also have a very strong tendency to self-aggregate (i.e. stack), which can significantly reduce the fluorescence quantum yields, as described in the extensive review by Mishra, et al., CHEM. REV., 100, 1973 (2000).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another problem with the existing carbocyanine labeling dyes is the free rotation/vibration of two indolium (or benzothiazolium, or benzoimidazolium) heads around the middle conjugated double bonds that significantly reduce their fluorescence intensities. This phenomenon is called &#x2018;loose belt effect&#x2019; that is described in &#x201c;MODERN MOLECULAR PHOTOCHEMISTRY&#x201d;, Chapters 5 and 6, University Science Books, Sausalito, Calif., authored by Nicholas J. Turro (1991).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This so-called &#x2018;loose belt effect&#x2019; can be eliminated by the crosslinking of the two heads. 1,1&#x2032;-crosslinking of cyanines is disclosed by R. Singh, et al. WO 01/02374 (2001), which is supposed to eliminate the &#x2018;loose belt effect&#x2019; described above. However, Diwu et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,465,810, observed that the 1,1&#x2032;-crosslinking actually caused the decreased fluorescence quantum yield of dye-protein conjugates compared to that of non-crosslinked carbocycanine-protein conjugates at the similar ratios of dye/protein. This unfavorable fluorescence decrease might be caused by the inappropriate stereochemistry of 1,1&#x2032;-crosslinking or by the increased hydrophobicity, which results from the addition of the highly hydrophobic bridge.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Diwu et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,465,810, observed that the fluorescence properties of cyanine labeling dyes were improved by the intramolecularly crosslinking of the two indoline moieties between the 1-position and 3&#x2032;-position. The 1,3&#x2032;-crosslinked carbocyanines are superior to those of conjugates of spectrally similar 1,1&#x2032;-crosslinked or non-crosslinked dyes. This improvement with 1,3&#x2032;-cros slinked cyanine might result from the favorable configuration. However, the hydrophobic bridge significantly increases the dye hydrophobicity. Compared to the non-crosslinked carbocyanine dyes the conjugation of either 1,3&#x2032;-crosslinked or 1,1&#x2032;-crosslinked carbocyanines to proteins and other biological molecules often caused the precipitation of the labeling target molecules due to the significantly reduced water solubility of labeling dyes caused by the highly hydrophobic cross linker. In some cases, the cros slinking of carbocyanines by a highly hydrophobic bridge result in a complete activity loss of the target molecules to be labeled.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">We discovered new water-soluble cross linkers that do not only eliminate the &#x2018;loose belt effect&#x2019; to increase the fluorescence quantum yields of labeling dyes, but also increase their water solubility, thus eliminating the drawback of protein precipitation with the existing luminescent dyes that contain a hydrophobic cross linking bridge. We found that this strategy of water-soluble bridge can also be used improve the labeling and spectral properties of luminescent dyes of other types.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Xanthene dyes are another class of fluorescent probes that are predominantly used for labeling proteins and other biological molecules, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,704,284 to Eliu, et al. (2010); U.S. Pat. No. 7,491,830 to Lam, et al. (2009); U.S. Pat. No. 7,344,701 to Reddington, et al. (2008); U.S. Pat. No. 6,229,055 to Klaubert, et al. (2001); U.S. Pat. No. 6,130,101 to Mao et al. (2000). We discovered that the &#x2018;loose belt effect&#x2019; of xanthene dyes can be eliminated by the crosslinking of the two substitute heads with the new water-soluble cross linkers while their water solubilities are also significantly increased. The same principle can also be used to simultaneously increase the fluorescence quantum yields and water solubility of oxazole dye-protein conjugates and luminescent metal complex-protein conjugates.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">We discovered that a new class of water-soluble cross linking bridge unexpectedly mitigates problems discussed in the background section and results in dye-polymer conjugates that are substantially more luminescent on proteins, nucleic acids and other biopolymers, than conjugates labeled with structurally similar non-crosslinked dyes or the dyes that are cross linked with a hydrophobic bridge (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>). The enhanced luminescence intensity and retained binding affinity of dye-biomolecule conjugates of the invention results in greater assay sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the dyes of the invention typically exhibit absorbance maxima between about 400 nm and 1000 nm, so these dyes can be selected to match the principal emission lines of the violet laser (405 nm), Argon laser (488 nm), mercury arc lamp (546 nm), frequency-doubled Nd-Yag laser (532 nm), Kr-ion laser (568 nm and 647 nm), He&#x2014;Ne laser (543 nm, 594 nm, and 633 nm) or long-wavelength laser diodes (especially 635 nm and longer). Some dyes of the invention exhibit very long wavelength excitation (at least 640 nm, but some greater than about 730 nm) and emission bands (at least 665 nm, and some greater than about 750 nm), so they are particularly useful for samples that are transparent to infrared wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention comprises reactive luminescent dyes that are cross linked with a water soluble bridge (WSB) and their conjugates. The dyes and dye conjugates are used to locate or detect the interaction or presence of analytes or ligands in a sample. Kits incorporating such dyes or dye conjugates facilitate their use in such methods.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another aspect, the present invention provides dye-conjugates that comprise one or more of the luminescent dyes of the invention that are cross linked with a water soluble bridge (WSB) conjugated to a substrate.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the dye-conjugate substrate is a biopolymer, and the biopolymer is conjugated to a one or more of the of the luminescent dyes of the invention that are cross linked with a water soluble bridge (WSB) to obtain a fluorescent biopolymer. The fluorescent biopolymer dye-conjugates of the invention have utility as, or as part of, detection reagents, including analyte-specific detection reagents. Useful biopolymers include, for example, amino acid polymers, nucleic acid polymers, polysaccharides, carbohydrates, and lipids. In a preferred embodiment, the biopolymer component of the dye-biopolymer conjugate is an amino acid polymer, as broadly defined herein. In a preferred embodiment, the biopolymer is a monoclonal antibody.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Many embodiments of the compounds of the invention possess an overall electronic charge. It is to be understood that when such electronic charges are shown to be present, they are balanced by the presence of appropriate counterions, which may or may not be explicitly identified. A biologically compatible counterion, which is preferred for some applications, is not toxic in biological applications, and does not have a substantially deleterious effect on biomolecules. Where the compound of the invention is positively charged, the counterion is typically selected from, but not limited to, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate, alkanesulfonate, arylsulfonate, phosphate, perchlorate, tetrafluoroborate, tetraarylboride, nitrate and anions of aromatic or aliphatic carboxylic acids. Where the compound of the invention is negatively charged, the counterion is typically selected from, but not limited to, alkali metal ions, alkaline earth metal ions, transition metal ions, ammonium or substituted ammonium or pyridinium ions. Preferably, any necessary counterion is biologically compatible, is not toxic as used, and does not have a substantially deleterious effect on biomolecules. Counterions are readily changed by methods well known in the art, such as ion-exchange chromatography, or selective precipitation.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">It is to be understood that the dyes of the invention have been drawn in one or another particular electronic resonance structure. Every aspect of the instant invention applies equally to dyes that are formally drawn with other permitted resonance structures, as the electronic charge on the subject dyes is delocalized throughout the dye itself.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As used herein, a &#x201c;reactive moiety&#x201d;, denoted &#x201c;RM&#x201d;, refers to a moiety on a compound that is capable of chemically reacting with a functional group on a different compound to form a covalent linkage.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one embodiment of the invention, the dye contains at least one RM, where RM is the reactive moiety that is attached to the dye by a covalent linkage L. In certain embodiments, the covalent linkage attaching the dye to RM contains multiple intervening atoms that serve as a spacer. The dyes with an RM label a wide variety of organic or inorganic substances that contain or are modified to contain functional groups with suitable reactivity, resulting in chemical attachment of the conjugated substance. As used herein, reactive moiety &#x201c;RM&#x201d; means moiety on the compound that is capable of chemically reacting with a functional group on a different compound to form a covalent linkage. Typically the reactive moiety is an electrophile or nucleophile that can form a covalent linkage through exposure to the corresponding functional group that is a nucleophile or electrophile, respectively. Alternatively, the reactive moiety is a photoactivatable group, and becomes chemically reactive only after illumination with light of an appropriate wavelength. Typically, the conjugation reaction between the reactive dye and the substance to be conjugated results in one or more atoms of the reactive moiety RM to be incorporated into a new linkage L attaching the dye to the conjugated substance. Selected examples of reactive moieties and linkages are shown in Table 1 where the reaction of an electrophilic group and a nucleophilic group yields a covalent linkage.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Choice of the reactive moiety used to attach the dye to the substance to be conjugated typically depends on the functional group on the substance to be conjugated and the type or length of covalent linkage desired. The types of functional groups typically present on the organic or inorganic substances include, but are not limited to, amines, amides, thiols, alcohols, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, phosphonates, imidazoles, hydrazines, hydroxylamines, disubstituted amines, halides, epoxides, carboxylate esters, sulfonate esters, purines, pyrimidines, carboxylic acids, olefinic bonds, or a combination of these groups. A single type of reactive site may be available on the substance (typical for polysaccharides), or a variety of sites may occur (e.g. amines, thiols, alcohols, phenols), as is typical for proteins. A conjugated substance may be conjugated to more than one dye, which may be the same or different, or to a substance that is additionally modified by a hapten, such as biotin. Although some selectivity can be obtained by careful control of the reaction conditions, selectivity of labeling is best obtained by selection of an appropriate reactive dye.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Typically, RM will react with an amine, a thiol, an alcohol, an aldehyde or a ketone. Preferably RM reacts with an amine or a thiol functional group. In one embodiment, RM is an acrylamide, a reactive amine (including a cadaverine or ethylenediamine), an activated ester of a carboxylic acid (typically a succinimidyl ester of a carboxylic acid), an acyl azide, an acyl nitrile, an aldehyde, an alkyl halide, an anhydride, an aniline, an aryl halide, an azide, an aziridine, a boronate, a carboxylic acid, a diazoalkane, a haloacetamide, a halotriazine, a hydrazine (including hydrazides), an imido ester, an isocyanate, an isothiocyanate, a maleimide, a phosphoramidite, a reactive platinum complex, a sulfonyl halide, or a thiol group. By &#x201c;reactive platinum complex&#x201d; is particularly meant chemically reactive platinum complexes such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,990; 5,714,327; 5,985,566.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Where the reactive moiety is a photoactivatable group, such as an azide, diazirinyl, azidoaryl, or psoralen derivative, the dye becomes chemically reactive only after illumination with light of an appropriate wavelength. Where RM is an activated ester of a carboxylic acid, the reactive dye is particularly useful for preparing dye-conjugates of proteins, nucleotides, oligonucleotides, or haptens. Where RM is a maleimide or haloacetamide the reactive dye is particularly useful for conjugation to thiol-containing substances. Where RM is a hydrazide, the reactive dye is particularly useful for conjugation to periodate-oxidized carbohydrates and glycoproteins, and in addition is an aldehyde-fixable polar tracer for cell microinjection. Preferably, RM is a carboxylic acid, a succinimidyl ester of a carboxylic acid, a haloacetamide, a hydrazine, an isothiocyanate, a maleimide group, an aliphatic amine, a perfluorobenzamido, an azidoperfluorobenzamido group, or a psoralen. More preferably, RM is a succinimidyl ester of a carboxylic acid, a maleimide, an iodoacetamide, or a reactive platinum complex. Based on the above-mentioned attributes, the appropriate reactive dyes of the invention are selected for the preparation of the desired dye-conjugates, whose advantageous properties make them useful for a wide variety of applications. Particularly useful dye-conjugates include, among others, conjugates where substrate is a peptide, a nucleotide, an antigen, a steroid, a vitamin, a drug, a hapten, a metabolite, a toxin, an environmental pollutant, an amino acid, a protein, a nucleic acid, a nucleic acid polymer, a carbohydrate, a lipid, an ion-complexing moiety, a glass or a non-biological polymer. Alternatively, substrate is a cell, a cellular system, a cellular fragment, or a subcellular particle (e.g. inter alia), a virus particle, a bacterial particle, a virus component, a biological cell (such as animal cell, plant cell, bacteria, yeast, or protist), or a cellular component. Reactive dyes typically label functional groups at the cell surface, in cell membranes, organelles, or cytoplasm.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Typically substrate is an amino acid, a peptide, a protein, a tyramine, a polysaccharide, an ion-complexing moiety, a nucleoside, a nucleotide, an oligonucleotide, a nucleic acid, a hapten, a psoralen, a drug, a hormone, a lipid, a lipid assembly, a polymer, a polymeric microparticle, a biological cell or virus. More typically, substrate is a peptide, a protein, a nucleotide, an oligonucleotide, or a nucleic acid. When conjugating dyes of the invention to such biopolymers, it is possible to incorporate more dyes per molecule to increase the fluorescent signal. For example, it is possible to incorporate at least three molecules of such dyes per molecule of antibody without loss of total fluorescence, whereas fluorescence of the spectrally comparable Cy5 (wherein n=2) is strongly quenched when greater than approximately two Cy5 dyes are incorporated per antibody. These results confirm problems with Cy5 conjugates reported by others, e.g. BIOCONJUGATE CHEM., 11, 696 (2000). The optimally labeled conjugates of the invention are typically much more fluorescent than conjugates of the Cy5 dye or 1,1&#x2032;-crosslinked Cy5 at the same antibody concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one embodiment, substrate is an amino acid (including those that are protected or are substituted by phosphonates, carbohydrates, or C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>25 </sub>carboxylic acids), or is a polymer of amino acids such as a peptide or protein. Preferred conjugates of peptides contain at least five amino acids, more preferably 5 to 36 amino acids. Preferred peptides include, but are not limited to, neuropeptides, cytokines, toxins, protease substrates, and protein kinase substrates. Preferred protein conjugates include enzymes, antibodies, lectins, glycoproteins, histones, albumins, lipoproteins, avidin, streptavidin, protein A, protein G, phycobiliproteins and other fluorescent proteins, hormones, toxins, chemokines and growth factors. In one preferred aspect, the conjugated protein is a phycobiliprotein, such as allophycocyanin, phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, allophycocyanin B, B-phycoerythrin, and phycoerythrocyanin, (for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,386 to Roederer (1998)). Particularly preferred are conjugates of R-phycoerythrin and of allophycocyanin with selected dyes of the invention that serve as excited-state energy acceptors or donors. In these conjugates, excited state energy transfer results in long wavelength fluorescence emission when excited at relatively short wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In one aspect of the invention, substrate is a conjugated substance that is an antibody (including intact antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody sera, etc.), an amino acid, an angiostatin or endostatin, an avidin or streptavidin, a biotin (e.g. an amidobiotin, a biocytin, a desthiobiotin, etc.), a blood component protein (e.g. an albumin, a fibrinogen, a plasminogen, etc.), a dextran, an enzyme, an enzyme inhibitor, an IgG-binding protein (e.g. a protein A, protein G, protein A/G, etc.), a fluorescent protein (e.g. a phycobiliprotein, an aequorin, a green fluorescent protein, etc.), a growth factor, a hormone, a lectin (e.g. a wheat germ agglutinin, a conconavalin A, etc.), a lipopolysaccharide, a metal-binding protein (e.g. a calmodulin, etc.), a microorganism or portion thereof (e.g. a bacteria, a virus, a yeast, etc.), a neuropeptide and other biologically active factors (e.g. a dermorphin, a deltropin, an endomorphin, an endorphin, a tumor necrosis factor etc.), a non-biological microparticle (e.g. of ferrofluid, gold, polystyrene, etc.), a nucleotide, an oligonucleotide, a peptide toxin (e.g. an apamin, a bungarotoxin, a phalloidin, etc.), a phospholipid-binding protein (e.g. an annexin, etc.), a small-molecule drug (e.g. a methotrexate, etc.), a structural protein (e.g. an actin, a fibronectin, a laminin, a microtubule-associated protein, a tublin, etc.), or a tyramide.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In another embodiment, substrate is a nucleic acid base, nucleoside, nucleotide or a nucleic acid polymer, including those that are modified to possess an additional linker or spacer for attachment of the dyes of the invention, such as an alkynyl linkage (U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,519), an aminoallyl linkage (U.S. Pat. No. 4,711,955), or a heteroatom-substituted linker (U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,142) or other linkages. In another embodiment, the conjugated substance is a nucleoside or nucleotide analog that links a purine or pyrimidine base to a phosphate or polyphosphate moiety through a noncyclic spacer. In another embodiment, the dye is conjugated to the carbohydrate portion of a nucleotide or nucleoside, typically through a hydroxyl group but additionally through a thiol or amino group (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,659,025; 5,668,268; 5,679,785). Typically, the conjugated nucleotide is a nucleoside triphosphate or a deoxynucleoside triphosphate or a dideoxynucleoside triphosphate. Incorporation of methylene moieties or nitrogen or sulfur heteroatoms into the phosphate or polyphosphate moiety is also useful. Nonpurine and nonpyrimidine bases such as 7-deazapurines (U.S. Pat. No. 6,150,510) and nucleic acids containing such bases can also be coupled to dyes of the invention. Nucleic acid adducts prepared by reaction of depurinated nucleic acids with amine, hydrazide or hydroxylamine derivatives provide an additional means of labeling and detecting nucleic acids, e.g. Atamna et al., PROC. NATL. ACAD. SCI. U.S.A. 97, 686-691 (2000).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Preferred nucleic acid polymer conjugates are labeled, single- or multi-stranded, natural or synthetic DNA or RNA, DNA or RNA oligonucleotides, or DNA/RNA hybrids, or incorporate an unusual linker such as morpholine derivatized phosphates, or peptide nucleic acids such as N-(2-aminoethyl)glycine units. When the nucleic acid is a synthetic oligonucleotide, it typically contains fewer than 50 nucleotides, more typically fewer than 25 nucleotides. Conjugates of peptide nucleic acids (PNA) (Nielsen, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,082), may be preferred for some applications because of their generally faster hybridization rates.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one embodiment, the conjugated oligonucleotides of the invention are aptamers for a particular target molecule, such as a metabolite, dye, hapten, or protein. That is, the oligonucleotides have been selected to bind preferentially to the target molecule. Methods of preparing and screening aptamers for a given target molecule have been previously described and are known in the art, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,567,588 to Gold (1996).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In another embodiment, substrate is a carbohydrate that is typically a polysaccharide, such as a dextran, heparin, glycogen, amylopectin, mannan, inulin, starch, agarose and cellulose. Alternatively, the carbohydrate is a polysaccharide that is a lipopolysaccharide. Preferred polysaccharide conjugates are dextran, or lipopolysaccharide conjugates.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Conjugates having an ion-complexing moiety serve as indicators for calcium, sodium, magnesium, zinc, potassium, or other biologically important metal ions. Preferred ion-complexing moieties are crown ethers (U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,975); derivatives of 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxyethane)-N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA chelators; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,453,517; 5,516,911 and 5,049,673); derivatives of 2-carboxymethoxyaniline-N,N-di-acetic acid (APTRA chelators; AM. J. PHYSIOL., 256, C540 (1989)); or pyridine- and phenanthroline-based metal ion chelators (U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,270); or derivatives of nitrilotriacetic acid, e.g. McMahan et al., ANAL. BIOCHEM., 236, 101-106 (1996). Preferably, the ion-complexing moiety is a crown ether chelator, a BAPTA chelator, an APTRA chelator or a derivative of nitrilotriacetic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Other conjugates of non-biological materials include dye-conjugates of organic or inorganic polymers, polymeric films, polymeric wafers, polymeric membranes, polymeric particles, or polymeric microparticles (magnetic and non-magnetic microspheres); iron, gold or silver particles; conducting and non-conducting metals and non-metals; and glass and plastic surfaces and particles. Conjugates are optionally prepared by copolymerization of a dye that contains an appropriate functionality while preparing the polymer, or by chemical modification of a polymer that contains functional groups with suitable chemical reactivity. Other types of reactions that are useful for preparing dye-conjugates of polymers include catalyzed polymerizations or copolymerizations of alkenes and reactions of dienes with dienophiles, transesterifications or transaminations. In another embodiment, the conjugated substance is a glass or silica, which may be formed into an optical fiber or other structure.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one embodiment, conjugates of biological polymers such as peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, nucleic acid polymers are also labeled with at least a second luminescent dye, which is optionally an additional dye of the present invention, to form an energy-transfer pair. In some aspects of the invention, the labeled conjugate functions as an enzyme substrate, and enzymatic hydrolysis disrupts the energy transfer. In another embodiment of the invention, the energy-transfer pair that incorporates a dye of the invention is conjugated to an oligonucleotide that displays efficient fluorescence quenching in its hairpin conformation (e.g., the so-called &#x201c;molecular beacons&#x201d;, Tyagi, et al., NATURE BIOTECHNOLOGY, 16, 49 (1998)).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The preparation of dye conjugates using reactive dyes is well documented, e.g. Hermanson G T, BIOCOJUGATE TECHNIQUES, Academic Press, New York (1996); Haugland R P, METHODS MOL. BIOL., 45, 205-21 (1995); and Brinkley, BIOCONJUGATE CHEM., 3, 2 (1992). Conjugates typically result from mixing appropriate reactive dyes and the substance to be conjugated in a suitable solvent in which both are soluble. The majority of the dyes of the invention are readily soluble in aqueous solutions, facilitating conjugation reactions with most biological materials. For those reactive dyes that are photoactivated, conjugation requires illumination of the reaction mixture to activate the reactive dyes.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Synthesis</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The luminescent dyes of the invention can be readily synthesized using two different routes. (1). A WSB crosslinker is prepared first. The WSB linker can be made using the standard liquid phase chemistry. It might be also prepared by the standard solid phase peptide synthesis if the WSB has more than 3 water-soluble groups. The WSB can be coupled to a luminescent dye that contains two functional groups. This strategy is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>. (2). A WSB is coupled to a luminescent dye precursor that is later condensed to give the desired dye. This strategy is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The syntheses of luminescent dyes are well described in the literature. These basic structures are optionally further substituted, during or after synthesis, to give the corresponding dye substituents as defined above. For carbocyanines, the key intermediates are readily synthesized by a reaction that is analogous to a Fischer indole synthesis (Sundberg, &#x201c;THE CHEMISTRY OF INDOLES&#x201d; 1970, Academic Press; Hamer, &#x201c;THE CYANINE DYES AND RELATED COMPOUNDS&#x201d;, 1964, John Wiley &#x26; Sons). Synthesis of the cyanine dyes of the invention depends on initial preparation of key indoline intermediate. Licha, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,485 (2000) described a typical synthesis of indoline intermediate. These basic structures are optionally further substituted, during or after synthesis, to give the corresponding dye substituents as defined above. The novel key intermediates are readily synthesized by a reaction that is analogous to a Fischer indole synthesis or through the condensations of phenylendiamine with a carbonyl compound. A WSB-substituted carbocyanine is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Synthesis of the cyanine dyes of the invention, where attachment is at the bridged and conjugated double bonds, depends on initial preparation of certain key bridged intermediates. For example, N,N&#x2032;-diphenylformamidine, triethylorthoformate malonaldehyde bis(phenyl)mine) hydrochloride, 1,1,3-trimethoxypropane, 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane and glutaconaldehyde dianil monochloride are the well-known bridged intermediates used in the synthesis of carbocycanines. More examples of appropriate carbocyanines that have bridged and conjugated double bonds have been previously described in the literature of U.S. Pat. No. 7,465,810 to Diwu et al; U.S. Pat. No. 5,831,098 to Ollmann, Jr (1998); U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,737 to Patonay, et al. (2000); U.S. Pat. No. 6,048,982 to Waggoner (2000); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,453,505 to Lee, et al. (1995); U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,874 to Middendorf, et al. (1997); U.S. Pat. No. 3,864,644 to Lincoln, et al. (1975); U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,086 to Simson (1977). The typical total synthesis of carbocyanines substituted at the bridged and conjugated carbon atoms with an RM is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">For the synthesis of carbocyanines, an appropriately substituted aryl hydrazine, which is typically an appropriately substituted phenylhydrazine, is reacted with an appropriately substituted methyl ketone to yield a 3,3-disubstituted 2-methylindole derivative. It is particularly suitable to utilize a sulfonated phenylhydrazine derivative or a sulfonated naphthylhydrazine derivative to increase the solubility of the final dye. The 3,3-disubstituted-2-methylindole is then quaternized on the nitrogen atom to an indolium derivative with an alkylating agent that is typically an alkyl halide such as ethyl iodide, an alkylsulfonate such as methyl p-toluenesulfonate or a cyclic sulfonate such as propanesultone or butanesultone. Typically, the key indolium or benzoindolium intermediates are sulfonated one or more times before or after quaternization and subsequent condensation with the benzazolium moiety and polymethine moiety to form the subject dyes. Variations on these methods are well known in the art that yield substituents on the polymethine bridge or on the indolium or benzolium portion of the dye precursor.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The azacarbocyanine dyes of the present invention can be analogously synthesized, e.g., Leung W, et al., WO 02/26891; Brooker, et al., J. AM. CHEM. SOC., 64, 199 (1942); Chu-Moyer, et al. J. ORG. CHEM., 60, 5721(1995); Turner, J. ORG. CHEM., 48, 3401 (1983); Khanna, et al. J. ORG. CHEM., 60, 960 (1995); British Patent No. 870,753 to Ficken, et al. (1961). In general, the synthesis of these dyes requires three precursors: the appropriate benzazolium or azabenzazolium salt, and a source for the polymethine spacer. Typically each component is selected so as to incorporate the appropriate chemical substituents, or functional groups (e.g. RM) that can be converted to the appropriate substituents. The chemistry that is required to prepare and combine these precursors so as to yield any of the subject derivatives is generally well understood by one skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Xanthene dyes are prepared from resorcinol derivatives (to give fluoresceins), 3-aminophenols (to give rhodamines) or the combinations of resorcinol and 3-aminophenols (to give rhodols), e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,704,284 to Eliu, et al. (2010); U.S. Pat. No. 7,491,830 to Lam, et al. (2009); U.S. Pat. No. 7,344,701 to Reddington, et al. (2008); U.S. Pat. No. 6,229,055 to Klaubert, et al.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Oxazole dyes are typically synthesized the condensation of acid derivatives (e.g., acyl chlorides, anhydrides or activatd esters) with 2-aminoketones followed by dehydration to give the desired oxazole dyes, e.g., Kauffman et al., J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1992, 29, 1245; Litak and Kauffman, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 1994, 31, 457; Diwu et al., Photochem. Photobiol. 1997, 66, 424; U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2007007754 to Buller et al. Other alternative synthetic methods for preparing a variety of oxazole dyes are also known in the literature (Chien, &#x201c;SYNTHESIS OF OXAZOLE LASER DYES&#x201d;, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, 1988; Fisher, &#x201c;OXAZOLE CHEMISTRY: ELECTROPHILIC AND NUCLEOPHILIC ADDITIONS, INTER- AND INTRA-MOLECULAR CYCLOADDITIONS AND OXAZOLE FORMATION VIA AMIDOALKYLATION&#x201d;, 1991; Palmer, &#x201c;THE CHEMISTRY OF HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS, OXAZOLES: SYNTHESIS, REACTIONS, AND SPECTROSCOPY, VOLUME 60, PARTS A &#x26; B, CHEMISTRY OF HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS: A SERIES OF MONOGRAPHS&#x201d;, 2004).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Bodipys are synthesized for the condensation of an appropriately substituted pyrrole with a carbonyl compound followed by the BF<sub>3 </sub>complexation to give the desired Bodipy dyes, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,663 (1995) to Kang et al; U.S. Pat. No. 5,433,896 (1995) to Kang et al; U.S. Pat. No. 5,187,288 (1993) to Kang et al; U.S. Pat. No. 5,248,782 (1993) to Kang et al; U.S. Pat. No. 4,774,339 (1988) to Kang et al. These basic structures are optionally further substituted, during or after synthesis, to give the corresponding dye substituents as defined above. The synthesis of pyrrole precursors is very well known in the literature (Jones and Bean, &#x201c;CHEMISTRY OF PYRROLES, ORGANIC CHEMICAL MONOGRAPH&#x201d;, 1977; Jones, &#x201c;CHEMISTRY OF HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS, VOLUME 48, PART 1 AND PART 2, THE SYNTHESIS AND THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF THE PYRROLE RING, THE SYNTHESIS, REACTIVITY, AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SUBSTITUTED PYRROLES&#x201d;, 1992).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The synthesis of a metal complex is greatly dependent on the ligands, such as bipyridine derivatives that are well studied, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,205 to Diwu et al; U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,267 to Bhalgat, et al; U.S. Pat. No. 7,087,384 to Autiero, et al. It is recognized that there are many possible variations that may yield equivalent results. The synthesis of metal ligands is well described in the literature (Bunzli, CHEM. REV. 2010, 110, 2729; BIOCONJUGATE CHEM. 2001, 12, 7; Bunzli and Piguet, CHEM. REV. 2002, 102, 1897; Kido, CHEM. REV. 2002, 102, 2357; Tsukube and Shinoda, CHEM. REV. 2002, 102, 2389).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The methods for the synthesis of dyes that contain a variety of reactive moieties such as those described in Table 1 are well documented in the art. Particularly useful are amine-reactive dyes such as &#x201c;activated esters&#x201d; of carboxylic acids, which are typically synthesized by coupling a carboxylic acid to a relatively acidic &#x201c;leaving group&#x201d;. Other preferred amine-reactive moieties include sulfonyl halides, which are prepared from sulfonic acids using a halogenating agent such as PCl<sub>5 </sub>or POCl<sub>3</sub>; halotriazines, which are prepared by the reaction of cyanuric halides with amines; and isocyanates or isothiocyanates, which are prepared from amines and phosgene or thiophosgene, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Dyes containing amines and hydrazides are particularly useful for conjugation to carboxylic acids, aldehydes and ketones. Most often these are synthesized by reaction of an activated ester of a carboxylic acid or a sulfonyl halide with a diamine, such as cadaverine, or with a hydrazine. Alternatively, aromatic amines are commonly synthesized by chemical reduction of a nitroaromatic compound. Amines and hydrazines are particularly useful precursors for synthesis of thiol-reactive haloacetamides or maleimides by standard methods (Hermanson, &#x201c;BIOCOJUGATE TECHNIQUES&#x201d;, Academic Press, New York (1996); Brinkley, BIOCONJUGATE CHEM 3, 2-13 (1992).

Applications and Methods of Use
</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In one aspect of the invention, the dye compounds of the invention are used to directly stain or label a sample so that the sample can be identified or quantitated. For instance, such dyes may be added as part of an assay for a biological target analyte, as a detectable tracer element in a biological or non-biological fluid; or for such purposes as photodynamic therapy of tumors, in which a dyed sample is irradiated to selectively destroy tumor cells and tissues; or to photoablate arterial plaque or cells, usually through the photosensitized production of singlet oxygen. In one preferred embodiment, dye conjugate is used to stain a sample that comprises a ligand for which the conjugated substance is a complementary member of a specific binding pair (e.g. Table 3).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Typically, the sample is obtained directly from a liquid source or as a wash from a solid material (organic or inorganic) or a growth medium in which cells have been introduced for culturing, or a buffer solution in which cells have been placed for evaluation. Where the sample comprises cells, the cells are optionally single cells, including microorganisms, or multiple cells associated with other cells in two or three dimensional layers, including multicellular organisms, embryos, tissues, biopsies, filaments, biofilms, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Alternatively, the sample is a solid, optionally a smear or scrape or a retentate removed from a liquid or vapor by filtration. In one aspect of the invention, the sample is obtained from a biological fluid, including separated or unfiltered biological fluids such as urine, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, lymph fluids, tissue homogenate, interstitial fluid, cell extracts, mucus, saliva, sputum, stool, physiological secretions or other similar fluids.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Alternatively, the sample is obtained from an environmental source such as soil, water, or air; or from an industrial source such as taken from a waste stream, a water source, a supply line, or a production lot.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In yet another embodiment, the sample is present on or in solid or semi-solid matrix. In one aspect of the invention, the matrix is a membrane. In another aspect, the matrix is an electrophoretic gel, such as is used for separating and characterizing nucleic acids or proteins, or is a blot prepared by transfer from an electrophoretic gel to a membrane. In another aspect, the matrix is a silicon chip or glass slide, and the analyte of interest has been immobilized on the chip or slide in an array (e.g. the sample comprises proteins or nucleic acid polymers in a microarray). In yet another aspect, the matrix is a microwell plate or microfluidic chip, and the sample is analyzed by automated methods, typically by various methods of high-throughput screening, such as drug screening.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The dye compounds of the invention are generally utilized by combining a dye compound of the invention as described above with the sample of interest under conditions selected to yield a detectable optical response. The term &#x201c;dye compound&#x201d; is used herein to refer to all aspects of the claimed dyes, including both reactive dyes and dye conjugates. The dye compound typically forms a covalent or non-covalent association or complex with an element of the sample, or is simply present within the bounds of the sample or portion of the sample. The sample is then illuminated at a wavelength selected to elicit the optical response. Typically, staining the sample is used to determine a specified characteristic of the sample by further comparing the optical response with a standard or expected response.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A detectable optical response means a change in, or occurrence of, an optical signal that is detectable either by observation or instrumentally. Typically the detectable response is a change in fluorescence, such as a change in the intensity, excitation or emission wavelength distribution of fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime, fluorescence polarization, or a combination thereof. The degree and/or location of staining, compared with a standard or expected response, indicates whether and to what degree the sample possesses a given characteristic. Some dyes of the invention may exhibit little fluorescence emission, but are still useful as chromophoric dyes. Such chromophores are useful as energy acceptors in FRET applications, or to simply impart the desired color to a sample or portion of a sample.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">For biological applications, the dye compounds of the invention are typically used in an aqueous, mostly aqueous or aqueous-miscible solution prepared according to methods generally known in the art. The exact concentration of dye compound is dependent upon the experimental conditions and the desired results, but typically ranges from about one nanomolar to one millimolar or higher. The optimal concentration is determined by systematic variation until satisfactory results with minimal background fluorescence are accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The dye compounds are most advantageously used to stain samples with biological components. The sample may comprise heterogeneous mixtures of components (including intact cells, cell extracts, bacteria, viruses, organelles, and mixtures thereof), or a single component or homogeneous group of components (e.g. natural or synthetic amino acids, nucleic acids or carbohydrate polymers, or lipid membrane complexes). These dyes are generally non-toxic to living cells and other biological components, within the concentrations of use.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The dye compound is combined with the sample in any way that facilitates contact between the dye compound and the sample components of interest. Typically, the dye compound or a solution containing the dye compound is simply added to the sample. Certain dyes of the invention, particularly those that are substituted by one or more sulfonic acid moieties, tend to be impermeant to membranes of biological cells, and once inside viable cells are typically well retained. Treatments that permeabilize the plasma membrane, such as electroporation, shock treatments or high extracellular ATP can be used to introduce selected dye compounds into cells. Alternatively, selected dye compounds can be physically inserted into cells, e.g. by pressure microinjection, scrape loading, patch clamp methods, or phagocytosis.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Dyes that incorporate an aliphatic amine or a hydrazine residue can be microinjected into cells, where they can be fixed in place by aldehyde fixatives such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde. This fixability makes such dyes useful for intracellular applications such as neuronal tracing.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Dye compounds that possess a lipophilic substituent, such as phospholipids, will noncovalently incorporate into lipid assemblies, e.g. for use as probes for membrane structure; or for incorporation in liposomes, lipoproteins, films, plastics, lipophilic microspheres or similar materials; or for tracing. Lipophilic dyes are useful as fluorescent probes of membrane structure.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Chemically reactive dye compounds will covalently attach to a corresponding functional group on a wide variety of materials, forming dye conjugates as described above. Using dye compounds to label reactive sites on the surface of cells, in cell membranes or in intracellular compartments such as organelles, or in the cell's cytoplasm, permits the determination of their presence or quantity, accessibility, or their spatial and temporal distribution in the sample. Photoreactive dyes can be used similarly to photolabel components of the outer membrane of biological cells or as photo-fixable polar tracers for cells.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Optionally, the sample is washed after staining to remove residual, excess or unbound dye compound. The sample is optionally combined with one or more other solutions in the course of staining, including wash solutions, permeabilization and/or fixation solutions, and solutions containing additional detection reagents. An additional detection reagent typically produces a detectable response due to the presence of a specific cell component, intracellular substance, or cellular condition, according to methods generally known in the art. Where the additional detection reagent has, or yields a product with, spectral properties that differ from those of the subject dye compounds, multi-color applications are possible. This is particularly useful where the additional detection reagent is a dye or dye-conjugate of the present invention having spectral properties that are detectably distinct from those of the staining dye.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The dye conjugates of the invention are used according to methods extensively known in the art; e.g. use of antibody conjugates in microscopy and immunofluorescent assays; and nucleotide or oligonucleotide conjugates for nucleic acid hybridization assays and nucleic acid sequencing (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,332,666 to Prober, et al. (1994); U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,534 to Smith, et al. (1992); U.S. Pat. No. 4,997,928 to Hobbs (1991); and WO Appl. 94/05688 to Menchen, et al.). Dye-conjugates of multiple independent dyes of the invention possess utility for multi-color applications.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">At any time after or during staining, the sample is illuminated with a wavelength of light selected to give a detectable optical response, and observed with a means for detecting the optical response. Equipment that is useful for illuminating the dye compounds of the invention includes, but is not limited to, hand-held ultraviolet lamps, mercury arc lamps, xenon lamps, lasers and laser diodes. These illumination sources are optionally integrated into laser scanners, fluorescence microplate readers, standard or minifluorometers, or chromatographic detectors. Preferred embodiments of the invention are dyes that are be excitable at or near the wavelengths 405 nm, 488 nm, 546 nm, 594 nm, 633-636 nm, 647 nm, 660 nm, 680 nm and beyond 700 nm, as these regions closely match the output of relatively inexpensive excitation sources.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The optical response is optionally detected by visual inspection, or by use of any of the following devices: CCD cameras, video cameras, photographic films, laser-scanning devices, fluorometers, photodiodes, quantum counters, epifluorescence microscopes, scanning microscopes, flow cytometers, fluorescence microplate readers, or by means for amplifying the signal such as photomultiplier tubes. Where the sample is examined using a flow cytometer, examination of the sample optionally includes sorting portions of the sample according to their fluorescence response.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">One aspect of the instant invention is the formulation of kits that facilitate the practice of various assays using any of the dyes of the invention, as described above. The kits of the invention typically comprise a colored or luminescent dye of the invention, either present as a chemically reactive label useful for preparing dye-conjugates, or present as a dye-conjugate where the conjugated substance is a specific binding pair member, or a nucleoside, a nucleotide, an oligonucleotide, a nucleic acid polymer, a peptide, or a protein. The kits optionally further comprise one or more buffering agents, typically present as an aqueous solution. The kits of the invention optionally further comprise additional detection reagents, a purification medium for purifying the resulting labeled substance, luminescence standards, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, organic solvent, or instructions for carrying out an assay of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0117" level="1">Preparation of Protein-Dye Conjugates</heading>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">A series of dye conjugates of goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM), goat anti-rabbit IgG (GAR), streptavidin, transferrin and other proteins, including R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) and allophycocyanin (APC) are prepared by standard means (Haugland, et al., METH. MOL. BIOL., 45, 205 (1995); Haugland, METH. MOL. BIOL., 45, 223 (1995); Haugland, METH. MOL. BIOL., 45,235 (1995); Haugland, CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN CELL BIOLOGY, 16.5.1-16.5.22 (2000)) using mono-succinimidyl ester or bis-succinimidyl ester compounds. The typical method for protein conjugation with succinimidyl esters of the invention is as follows. Variations in ratios of dye to protein, protein concentration, time, temperature, buffer composition and other variables that are well known in the art are possible that still yield useful conjugates. A solution of the protein is prepared at about 10 mg/mL in 0.1M sodium bicarbonate. The labeling reagents are dissolved in a suitable solvent such as DMF or DMSO at about 10 mg/mL. Water is a suitable solvent for many dyes of the invention. Predetermined amounts of the labeling reagents are added to the protein solutions with stiffing. A molar ratio of 10 equivalents of dye to 1 equivalent of protein is typical, though the optimal amount varies with the particular labeling reagent, the protein being labeled and the protein's concentration, and is determined empirically.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">When optimizing the fluorescence yield and determining the effect of degree of substitution (DOS) on this brightness, it is typical to vary the ratio of reactive dye to protein over a several-fold range. The reaction mixture is incubated at room temperature for one hour or on ice for several hours. The dye-protein conjugate is typically separated from free unreacted reagent by size-exclusion chromatography, such as on Amersham PD-10 resin equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The initial, protein-containing colored band is collected and the degree of substitution is determined from the absorbance at the absorbance maximum of each fluorophore, using the extinction coefficient of the free fluorophore. The dye-protein conjugate thus obtained can be subfractionated to yield conjugates with higher, lower or more uniform DOS.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Following is a specific example of using Compound 34 to prepare IgG-dye conjugate:</p>
<p id="h-0118" num="0000">Step 1. Preparing Protein Solution (Solution A):</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Mix 50 &#x3bc;L of 1M NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>with 450 &#x3bc;L of IgG protein solution (4 mg/mL) to give 0.5 mL protein sample solution. The resulted solution should have pH 8.5&#xb1;0.5.</p>
<p id="h-0119" num="0000">Step 2. Preparing Dye Solution (Solution B):</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">To 50 &#x3bc;L of DMSO add 1 mg of Compound 34, and stir until the compound is completely dissolved.</p>
<p id="h-0120" num="0000">Step 3. Running Conjugation Reaction:</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Add the dye solution (B) to the protein solution (A) with effective stirring or shaking, and keep the reaction mixture stirred or shaken for 1-3 hrs.</p>
<p id="h-0121" num="0000">Step 4. Purifying the Conjugate:</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">a). Dilute 10&#xd7; elution buffer with de-ionized water to give 1&#xd7; elution buffer (Solution C) that is used to elute the protein conjugate from PD-10 column; b). Load the column with the reaction mixture (from step 3, filtrated if necessary) or supernatant as soon as the liquid in the pre-packed column runs just below the top surface; c). Add 1 mL of the 1&#xd7; elution buffer as soon as the sample runs just below the top resin surface; Repeat this &#x2018;sample washing&#x2019; process twice; Add more 1&#xd7; elution buffer solution to elute the desired sample; d). Collect the faster-running band that is usually the desired labeled protein. Keep the slower-running band that is usually free or hydrolyzed dye until the desired product is identified.</p>
<p id="h-0122" num="0000">Step 5. Characterizing the Desired Dye-Protein Conjugate:</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">a). Measure OD (absorbance) at 280 nm and dye maximum absorption wavelength (Note: for most spectrophotometers, the sample (from the column fractions) need be diluted with de-ionized water so that the OD values are in the range 0.1 to 0.9). The O.D. (absorbance) at 280 nm is the maximum absorption of protein (Note: to obtain accurate DOS, you must make sure that the conjugate is free of the non-conjugated dye); b). Calculating DOS using the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>DOS</i>=[dye]/[protein]=<i>A</i><sub>dye</sub>&#xd7;&#x3b5;<sub>p</sub>/250000(<i>A</i><sub>280</sub><i>&#x2212;CF&#xd7;A</i><sub>dye</sub>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
[dye] is the dye concentration, and can be readily calculated from the Beer-Lambert Law: A=&#x3b5;<sub>dye</sub>C&#xd7;L; [protein] is the target protein concentration. This value can be either estimated by the weight (added to the reaction) if the conjugation efficiency is high enough (preferably &#x3e;70%) or more accurately calculated by the Beer-Lambert Law: A=&#x3b5;<sub>protein</sub>C&#xd7;L. For example, IgG has the c value to be 203,000 cm<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. CF is the dye correct factor, and calculated by the ratio of OD<sub>280 </sub>nm/OD<sub>dye maximum absorption wavelength</sub>.

The reactions are stopped by addition of 30 &#x3bc;L ethylene glycol. The antibodies are purified on a Sephadex G25 column packed in PBS pH 7.2. One-tenth volume of 1M sodium bicarbonate is added to raise the pH and Compound 102 or 117 is added at a molar ratio of dye to protein of 50:1. The reaction is stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. Sodium cyanoborohydride is added to a final concentration of 10 mM and the reaction is stirred for 4 hours at room temperature. The antibody conjugates are purified by dialysis and on Sephadex G25 columns as described above. Antibodies that are oxidized for 1 hour typically yield a degree of substitution of 1 mole of dye per mole of IgG. Antibodies that are oxidized for 2 hours typically yield a DOS of approximately 2 mole of dye per mole of IgG. Periodate-oxidized proteins in gels and on blots can also be labeled, essentially as described in Estep et al., ANAL. BIOCHEM., 157, 100-105 (1986).</p>

Highly efficient energy transfer (&#x3e;99%) occurs from the protein to the fluorescent dye. A conjugate of these complexes with streptavidin is prepared essentially as described by Haugland (METH. MOL. BIOL., 45, 205 (1995)). This streptavidin conjugate retains the energy transfer properties and is useful for cell staining in flow cytometers that utilize the argon-ion laser for excitation. Tandem conjugates of allophycocyanin can also be made, with longer wavelength dyes of the invention such as Compound 34 or 39 yield emission well beyond 700 nm when excited near 633 nm.</p>

Using a FSC versus SSC dot plot the live cells are gated and the geometric mean of the fluorescence is measured. The data is analyzed for both fluorescence intensity and signal/noise ratio.</p>

<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Normal human blood, collected in EDTA, is incubated at ambient temperature for 30 minutes with the mouse anti human CD4, CD 8 or CD45 conjugates of Compound 34, 39, 43 or 49 at the concentration of 1 &#x3bc;g for 1.1 ml of blood. After incubation with the antibody conjugate, the blood is suspended in a 20-fold volume (2 ml) of BD FACSLysing Solution and incubated for 8-10 minutes at ambient temperature. The samples are centrifuged at 2-300&#xd7;g for 5 minutes, the supernatant is decanted and the pellet is suspended and washed with 2 ml of 0.5% BSA/PBS. The supernatant is again decanted and the pellet is suspended in 0.5 ml of 0.5% BSA/PBS for analysis on a BD LSRII Flow Cytometer. The analysis is performed such that the samples are excited with the 405 nm line of a violet laser, 488 nm line of an argon laser or 633 nm line of an He&#x2014;Ne laser, collecting the emission a proper bandpass filter. Using a FSC versus SSC dot plot the lymphocytes are gated and the median fluorescence is measured. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> indicates that mouse anti human CD4, CD8 and CD45 conjugates are highly fluorescent, giving good staining signal for cell analysis.</p>
