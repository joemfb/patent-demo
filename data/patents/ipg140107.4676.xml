<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Embodiments of the present invention provide optimization of telephone services through telephone calling plan/card analysis. The least expensive rate is found for telephone calls at any given time and/or date, either through static pre-entry of data, or through dynamic querying of rates via a web-based look-up table, and places calls according to an optimized calling plan. Specifically, in a typical embodiment, an outgoing/target telephone number for an intended telephone call is captured, and a corresponding destination geographic region is identified. Based on the geographic region, a calling plan resulting in a lowest price for the telephone call is identified. This is typically accomplished by consulting at least one table (e.g., call information table) that associates (among other things) calling plans and/or calling cards with geographic regions. Once a calling plan and/or calling card is identified/selected, a corresponding set of dialing instructions will be obtained from the table and used to make/place the telephone call.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In general, embodiments of the present invention relate to telephony services optimization. Specifically, embodiments of the present invention relate to the identification of a best/ideal calling plan (e.g., based upon cost) for an intended telephone call.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When calling long distance to different states and countries, a user is often faced with a complex decision process. For example, calling cards are often used to call foreign countries in particular since they often provide lower rates than a traditional calling plan might. The complexity of dealing with calling cards is that some cards provide rates that are best for calling one country while, when calling another country, there is often another calling card that provides a better rate. The issue is compounded by calling plan intricacies such as differing rates for differing times of day and/or geographical areas.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention provide optimization of telephone services through telephone calling plan/card analysis. The least expensive rate is found for telephone calls at any given time and/or date, either through static pre-entry of data, or through dynamic querying of rates via a web-based look-up table, and places calls according to an optimized calling plan. Specifically, in a typical embodiment, an outgoing/target telephone number for an intended telephone call is captured, and a corresponding destination geographic region is identified. Based on the geographic region, a calling plan resulting in a lowest price for the telephone call is identified. This is typically accomplished by consulting at least one table (e.g., call information table) that associates (among other things) calling plans and/or calling cards with geographic regions. Once a calling plan and/or calling card is identified/selected, a corresponding set of dialing instructions will be obtained from the table and used to make/place the telephone call.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A first aspect of the present invention provides a method for optimizing telephony services, comprising: capturing an outgoing telephone number from an intended telephone call; identifying a geographic region to which the intended telephone call is being placed; identifying a calling plan resulting in a lowest price for placing the intended telephone call based on at least one information table, the at least one information table associating geographic regions with calling plans; and implementing the intended telephone call according to the calling plan and a set of dialing instructions also contained in the at least one information table.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A second aspect of the present invention provides a system for optimizing telephony services, comprising: a bus; a processor coupled to the bus; and a memory medium coupled to the bus, the memory medium comprising instructions to: capture an outgoing telephone number from an intended telephone call; identify a geographic region to which the intended telephone call is being placed; identify a calling plan resulting in a lowest price for placing the intended telephone call based on at least one information table, the at least one information table associating geographic regions with calling plans; and implement the intended telephone call according to the calling plan and a set of dialing instructions also contained in the at least one information table.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A third aspect of the present invention provides a computer program product for optimizing telephony services, the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage media, and program instructions stored on the computer readable storage media, to: capture an outgoing telephone number from an intended telephone call; identify a geographic region to which the intended telephone call is being placed; identify a calling plan resulting in a lowest price for placing the intended telephone call based on at least one information table, the at least one information table associating geographic regions with calling plans; and implement the intended telephone call according to the calling plan and a set of dialing instructions also contained in the at least one information table.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A fourth aspect of the present invention provides a method for deploying a system for optimizing telephony services, comprising: providing a computer infrastructure being operable to: capture an outgoing telephone number from an intended telephone call; identify a geographic region to which the intended telephone call is being placed; identify a calling plan resulting in a lowest price for placing the intended telephone call based on at least one information table, the at least one information table associating geographic regions with calling plans; and implement the intended telephone call according to the calling plan and a set of dialing instructions also contained in the at least one information table.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments of the present invention provide optimization of telephone services through telephone calling plan/card analysis. The least expensive rate is found for telephone calls at any given time and/or date, either through static pre-entry of data, or through dynamic querying of rates via a web-based look-up table, and places calls according to an optimized calling plan. Specifically, in a typical embodiment, an outgoing/target telephone number for an intended telephone call is captured, and a corresponding destination geographic region is identified. Based on the geographic region, a calling plan resulting in a lowest price for the telephone call is identified. This is typically accomplished by consulting at least one table (e.g., call information table) that associates (among other things) calling plans and/or calling cards with geographic regions. Once a calling plan and/or calling card is identified/selected, a corresponding set of dialing instructions will be obtained from the table and used to make/place the telephone call.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a schematic of an example of a computing node is shown.

<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Computer system/server <b>12</b> may be described in the general context of computer system-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by a computer system. Generally, program modules may include routines, programs, objects, components, logic, data structures, and so on that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Computer system/server <b>12</b> may be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote computer system storage media including memory storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, computer system/server <b>12</b> in computing node <b>10</b> is shown in the form of a general-purpose computing device.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Program/utility <b>40</b>, having a set (at least one) of program modules <b>42</b>, may be stored in memory <b>28</b> by way of example, and not limitation, as well as an operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data. In general, program/utility <b>40</b> (or similar variants shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) performs the function of the present invention as described herein. Each of the operating systems, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data or some combination thereof, may include an implementation of a networking environment. Program modules <b>42</b> (or similar variants shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) generally carry out the functions and/or methodologies of embodiments of the invention as described herein.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments of the present invention provide an approach for a telephone optimization through calling plan/card analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, telephone optimization environment <b>70</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. As depicted, an intended telephone call <b>80</b> is placed from a first telephone (also referred to as telephone system) <b>72</b>A in a first geographic location <b>74</b>A to a second telephone <b>72</b>B in a second geographic location <b>74</b>B. In general, telephone call <b>80</b> will be facilitated by one or more telephone service providers/carriers <b>84</b>A-B. Telephone systems <b>72</b>A-B can include/implement program code and/or logic <b>76</b>A-B (similar to modules <b>42</b> of utility <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Similarly, service providers <b>84</b>A-B can also include/implement program code and/or logic <b>86</b>A-B (similar to modules <b>42</b> of utility <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). It is understood that although two telephones <b>72</b>A-B and two service providers/carriers <b>84</b>A-B are shown, this need not be the case. Rather environment <b>70</b> and the teachings recited herein could support any quantity thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Regardless (as will be further described below), under environment <b>70</b>, an outgoing telephone number will be captured from intended telephone call <b>80</b>. Based on the outgoing telephone number, a geographic region <b>74</b>B to which intended telephone call <b>80</b> is being placed may be identified (e.g., based on an area code, country code, or the like, associated with the outgoing telephone number). A set (at least one) of information tables <b>78</b> may be accessed to identify a calling plan resulting in a lowest price for placing intended telephone <b>80</b>. To this extent the set of information tables comprise information associating geographic regions with calling plans. Once an optimal calling plan has been identified, intended telephone call <b>80</b> may be implemented/connected according to the calling plan and a set of dialing instructions also contained in set of information tables <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In general, the calling plan can comprise and/or implement a particular calling card (which would result in a lowest rate). Moreover, set of information tables <b>78</b> can be populated based upon user preferences, historical data, etc. As will be further described below, the outgoing telephone number can be captured using at least one of the following techniques/approaches: logic <b>76</b>A associated with telephone system <b>74</b>A from which intended telephone call <b>80</b> is made; a device <b>82</b> (e.g., containing logic/code) implemented between telephone system <b>74</b>A and a telephone service provider <b>84</b>A that is supporting intended telephone call <b>80</b> (device <b>82</b> could be located anywhere within environment <b>70</b> between telephone <b>72</b>A and telephone <b>72</b>B), and/or logic <b>86</b>A or <b>86</b>B associated with a telephone service provider <b>84</b>A or <b>84</b>B that is supporting intended telephone call <b>80</b>. In addition, the calling plan can be identified based upon at least one of the following: a set of user preferences, a cost for intended telephone call <b>80</b>, historical telephone call information; or an account balance associated with a user of the calling plan.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Telephone Number Detection Methods</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As indicated above, environment <b>70</b> allows for an outgoing telephone number for an intended telephone call to be captured. There are multiple methods that can be employed to capture the target telephone number and apply the routing logic.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Phone Integration: This approach implements program logic <b>76</b>A within telephone <b>74</b>A (e.g., before the Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals are sent). Long distance numbers entered can be evaluated, and, after applying the routing logic, an alternative DTMF signal stream can be sent downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">End point capture: Under this approach, device <b>82</b> is implemented between telephone <b>74</b>A and the telephone service provider/carrier <b>84</b>A. This could be wired or wireless but would most often be used to accommodate existing telephones that do not have this function already incorporated. In one illustrative implementation, an RJ-11 cable could run from the telephone <b>72</b>A to device <b>82</b> and then another RJ-11 cable could connect device <b>82</b> to any remaining circuitry (e.g., a modular wall jack). Device <b>82</b> would monitor the DTMF tones entered at telephone <b>72</b>A. If certain long distance telephone numbers (denoted by country codes or long distance strings) are detected, then the logic (described below) can be applied within device <b>82</b> and a second string of DTMF tones could be sent downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Service Provider Integration: Under this approach, telephone service provider/carrier <b>86</b>A and/or <b>86</b>B could comprise routing logic <b>86</b> A and/or <b>86</b>B and provide this as a service on their switches. In this approach, a consumer could input calling card(s) or the like into a website, which registers calling card information with the telephone service provider <b>84</b>A and/or <b>84</b>B. The consumer could then use telephone <b>72</b>A to place any calls. Under this embodiment, a corresponding telephone number and DTMF signal stream could be sent to telephone service provider <b>84</b>A and/or <b>84</b>B which then applies the routing logic <b>86</b>A and/or <b>86</b>B.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Routing Logic</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Routing logic describes the approaches for determining which calling card/plan to use. There are multiple factors that can affect this determination. Some of these factors include: (1) user preference; (2) cost; (3) historical or typical call volumes; and (4) individual account balance.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">User preference: This factor ensures that there is an element of control from the end user. It may be that some calling cards offer additional benefits (airline miles, restaurant discounts, volume discounts, etc.) that are unknown to the system. For this reason, it might be beneficial to utilize one card in preference to another.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Cost: Cost is usually one important factor in determining the optimal calling card to use. The routing logic method described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will determine the cheapest method for a call to the target telephone number.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Historical call volume: This factor will use logs and history tied in with the time of day, day of week, and other events (holidays, etc) to associate a time with the current call in progress. It should be noted that some calls may be long in duration, and this could affect which card is chosen to match this anticipated factor. Calls for User A on Thanksgiving Day to Destination <b>1</b> may, for example, average 120 minutes, whereas a call to that same destination on the same day of the week at the same time of day might average 15 minutes any other day of the year.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Account Balance: Used in conjunction with historical call volume, the account balance should be considered by the logic because if a call is anticipated to be 30 minutes in length, then the routing logic will favor cards that have at least 30 minutes of time left in the card's balance. Used with the anticipated call length, the routing logic can select a card that won't disrupt the call or end it early.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Auction Methodology</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">This approach can provide an alternatively to the routing logic method described below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Specifically, an auction methodology can reduce and/or eliminate the need for calling cards and allows any service provider to bid for the consumers use on a per call basis. Instead of buying calling cards and entering them into a system, the user can sign up for a service that uses any of the telephone number capture methods listed above and then simply dial an intended destination. At one of the capture points, this auction method then contacts service providers that have capabilities for the destination number and places a bid for the consumer auction. The lowest priced provider will typically win. Other factors could come into play such as service provider reliability and line quality.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Volume Discounts: Part of the auction parameters published by the consumer could include an intended call's duration. Some carriers will give a larger discount rate if they can expect a longer duration call.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Graduated Discounts: Some telephone service providers could publish a stepped discount rate, essentially saying for a-b minutes Rate <b>1</b> applies, c-d minutes Rate <b>2</b> applies, and so on. The historical call volume routing method described hereinabove could be used to target the most likely call duration and then match the lowest price.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Combinations of the auction method and the statically entered pre-purchased calling cards described hereinabove could also be employed.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Illustrative Information Table(s)</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An example of the content of the database tables <b>90</b> and <b>100</b> referenced above when placing a call are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an information table <b>90</b> that associates counties <b>92</b> with country codes <b>94</b> and calling plan/card preferences <b>96</b> (e.g., as set based upon user preferences, or by card/plan analysis performed by program <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or and of the logic modules shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an information table <b>100</b> that associates calling cards/plans <b>102</b> with dialing instructions <b>104</b> and account balances <b>106</b>. These tables <b>90</b> and <b>100</b> will be referred to collectively in the example below.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As previously mentioned, when a telephone call is placed, the telephone number being dialed is analyzed to determine what location <b>92</b> is being called. This is determined by the country or area code of the number being dialed. The associated calling card/plan preference <b>96</b> for the number being dialed is determined by looking up the preference in the calling card preference table <b>90</b>. In one embodiment, the calling card preference <b>96</b> may comprise multiple entries, where a secondary preference may be used if account balance <b>106</b> of the primary preference has been exhausted. A user could pre-populate the calling card preference table <b>90</b> with the calling card preference data based on knowledge of what it costs to call a given country. For example, the rank of &#x201c;A,C&#x201d; for calling India in the calling card preference table <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be based on the fact that calling card A charges 0.10 per minute for calling India, whereas calling card C charges 0.14 per minute. This data may be manually populated or populated automatically by the data being retrieved periodically from the calling card companies (already available). The data to populate the calling card preference table can be built from the data retrieved from the calling card companies.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another option, data in such tables as shown above could be updated dynamically via an open Application Programming Interface (API) by service providers, such that rates could be adjusted as providers' rate plans changed. By doing so, the user could be assured of having the most recent data available when assessing the cheapest available rate. Once the appropriate calling card to use for a given call is determined, the call can be placed using dialing instructions <b>104</b> that are preprogrammed in the telephone for the associated calling card. These dialing instructions <b>104</b> could include pausing instructions as well as pin entry instruction. The caller is abstracted from which calling card or rate plan is being used to place the call. In the former case, once a calling card account balance <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) has been exhausted (data which can be calculated in the telephone by a timer), use of the card when placing a call can be stopped until the calling card is recharged.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a first method flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. In step R<b>1</b>, the process is started and a caller makes a call in step R<b>2</b>. In step R<b>3</b>, the country code of the number dialed is identified. Based on the geographic location of the call (as determined from the country code and/or area code), a calling plan/card preference is determined from table <b>90</b> in step R<b>4</b>. In step R<b>5</b>, it is determined whether the calling plan/card identified has sufficient funding to make the call as determined from account balance <b>106</b> of table <b>100</b>. If not, another card/plan is chosen in step R<b>5</b>. If so, the dialing instructions <b>104</b> corresponding thereto are determined in step R<b>6</b>, and the call is placed according thereto in step R<b>7</b> before the process ends in step R<b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another method flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. In step S<b>1</b>, an outgoing telephone number from an intended telephone call is captured. In step S<b>2</b>, a geographic region to which the intended telephone call is being placed is identified. In step S<b>3</b>, a calling plan/card resulting in a lowest price for placing the intended telephone call is identified based on at least one information table. As mentioned above, the at least one information table associates geographic regions with calling plans. In step S<b>4</b>, the intended telephone call is implemented according to the calling plan/card and a set of dialing instructions also contained in the at least one information table.</p>
