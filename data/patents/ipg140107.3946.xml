<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The quality of images processed by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors may degrade due to noise caused by environmental changes. For example, a ground change according to a change in current consumption can result in horizontal band noise, which causes horizontal stripes to appear on displayed images.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need for devices to minimize the horizontal band noise to improve image quality.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept is directed to an amplifier. The amplifier includes a differential amplifier including a tail, a current mirror connected between output terminals of the differential amplifier and a power line receiving a supply voltage, and a first switching circuit for connecting and disconnecting one of the output terminals of the differential amplifier to and from the tail in response to a first switching signal.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a circuit diagram of an amplifier according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a circuit diagram of a current mirror illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an amplifier <b>3</b> includes a differential amplifier <b>10</b>, a current mirror <b>20</b> and a first switching circuit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The differential amplifier <b>10</b> includes a first transistor <b>11</b>, a second transistor <b>13</b> and a current source <b>14</b>. A first input signal Vin+ is input to an input terminal (e.g., a gate) of the first transistor <b>11</b> and a second input signal Vin&#x2212; is input to an input terminal (e.g., a gate) of the second transistor <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an example, each of the first transistor <b>11</b> and the second transistor <b>13</b> may be embodied by an N-channel metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (NMOSFET). Each of the transistors <b>11</b> and <b>13</b> is commonly connected to a tail <b>15</b>. For, example, the transistors <b>11</b> and <b>13</b> may be referred to as a differential pair with a tail where a same (emitter, cathode, or source) is fed from a current source <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The differential amplifier <b>10</b> outputs output signals through output terminals <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> by amplifying a difference between the input signals Vin+ and Vin&#x2212;.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A plurality of transistors <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> form the current mirror <b>20</b>. The current mirror <b>20</b> is connected between a power line receiving a supply voltage VDD and output terminals <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> of the differential amplifier <b>10</b>. The current mirror <b>20</b> includes a first current branch <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and a second current branch <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first current branch <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> where a reference current may flow includes a plurality of transistors <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> connected in series between the power line receiving a supply voltage VDD and the first output terminal <b>17</b> of the differential amplifier <b>10</b>. The second current branch <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> where a mirror current may flow includes a plurality of transistors <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> connected in series between the power line receiving a supply voltage VDD and the second output terminal <b>19</b> of the differential amplifier <b>10</b>. The mirror current may be a copy of the reference current.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each of transistors <b>21</b> and <b>27</b> performs a switching operation in response to a first control signal CTRL<b>1</b>. Accordingly, a current flowing in each of transistors <b>21</b> and <b>27</b> may be controlled according to a level of the first control signal CTRL<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each of transistors <b>23</b> and <b>29</b> perform a switching operation in response to a second control signal CTRL<b>2</b>. Accordingly, a current flowing in each of transistors <b>23</b> and <b>29</b> may be controlled according to a level of the second control signal CTRL<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept, each of transistors <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>27</b> and <b>29</b> may operate in a saturation region in response to the level of each of the first control signal CTRL<b>1</b> and the second control signal CTRL<b>2</b>. For example, each of transistors <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> may be embodied by a P-channel MOSFET (PMOSFET) and each of transistors <b>21</b> and <b>27</b> may be embodied by a NMOSFET.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first switching circuit <b>40</b> may switch between the first output terminal <b>17</b> and the tail <b>15</b> in response to one of the input signals Vin+ and Vin&#x2212; (e.g., Vin&#x2212;). As an example, the first switching circuit <b>40</b> may be embodied by an NMOSFET. For example, a voltage applied to the gate of the NMOSFET may control whether the first output terminal <b>17</b> is connected to the tail <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An operation of the amplifier <b>3</b> will be explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When each of transistors <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> operates in a saturation region and a level of the first input signal Vin+ is higher than a level of the second input signal Vin&#x2212;, the first transistor <b>11</b> is turned on and the second transistor <b>13</b> is turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Accordingly, a current path is formed by the first current branch <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> between the supply voltage VDD and a ground voltage VSS. Here, a current flowing in the first current branch <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> is the same as a current flowing in the current source <b>14</b>. The mirror current (e.g., a copy of the reference current flowing in the first current branch <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>) flows in the second current branch <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, when the amplifier <b>3</b> does not include a first switching circuit <b>40</b>, each of transistors <b>21</b>, <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> operates in a saturation region and a level of the second input signal Vin&#x2212; is higher than a level of the first input signal Vin+. Thus, the second transistor <b>13</b> is turned on and the first transistor <b>11</b> is turned off. Accordingly, since a current does not flow in the first current branch <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, there is no current flowing in the second current branch <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, when a level of the second input signal Vin&#x2212; is considerably higher than a level of the first input signal Vin+, an output voltage Vout of the amplifier <b>10</b> formed in a second current branch <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> becomes 0.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the amplifier <b>3</b> includes the first switching circuit <b>40</b>, the first switching circuit <b>40</b> is turned on in response to the second input signal Vin&#x2212; even though a level of the second input signal Vin&#x2212; is considerably higher than a level of the first input signal Vin+. Accordingly, the reference current flows in the first current branch <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and the mirror current flows in the second current branch <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the amplifier <b>3</b> including the first switching circuit <b>40</b> may ensure that the current flowing in the current source <b>14</b> in the first current branch <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> is the same as the current flowing in the second current branch <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>, regardless of the level of the first input signal Vin+ and the second input signal Vin&#x2212;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The amplifier <b>3</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be embodied as a telescopic operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). However, embodiments of the inventive concept are not limited thereto. For example, the amplifier <b>3</b> may be also embodied by a two stage OTA or a folded cascode OTA. Further, while the current mirror <b>20</b> is illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a wide swing current mirror, embodiments of the inventive concept are not limited thereto and may be embodied by various kinds of current mirrors.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For convenience of explanation, the amplifier <b>3</b> including an NMOS-type differential amplifier <b>10</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, embodiments of the inventive concept are not limited thereto. For example, the amplifier <b>3</b> may include a PMOS-type differential amplifier including a switching circuit corresponding to the first switching circuit <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a circuit diagram of an amplifier according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The second switching circuit <b>44</b> is connected between a second output terminal <b>19</b> of the differential amplifier <b>10</b> and a tail <b>15</b> in response to a first input signal Vin+. The second switching circuit <b>44</b> may be embodied by an NMOSFET.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When a level of the first input signal Vin+ is considerably higher than a level of a second input signal Vin&#x2212;, each of transistors <b>11</b> and <b>44</b> is turned on and each of transistors <b>13</b> and <b>40</b> is turned off. Accordingly, a current flows in each of branches <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>3</b>. Moreover, when a level of the second input signal Vin&#x2212; is considerably higher than a level of the first input signal Vin+, each of transistors <b>13</b> and <b>40</b> is turned on and each of transistors <b>11</b> and <b>44</b> is turned off. Accordingly, current flows in each of branches <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> and a current flowing in each of branches <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>3</b> becomes the same as a current flowing in a current source <b>14</b>.</p>

A first switching circuit <b>40</b> may connect a first output terminal <b>17</b> of a differential amplifier <b>10</b> with a tail <b>15</b> in response to an output signal of the comparator <b>50</b>. The comparator <b>50</b> may compare a first input signal Vin+ with a second input signal Vin&#x2212; and generate a switching signal controlling a switching operation of the first switching circuit <b>40</b> according to a result of the comparison. In alternate embodiments of the inventive concept, the comparator <b>50</b> may be embodied by a comparator having a hysteresis characteristic. As an example, the comparator having the hysteresis characteristic may be a Schmidt trigger or an inverter Schmidt trigger.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The switching circuit <b>60</b> may be connected between a power line receiving a supply voltage VDD and a tail <b>15</b> in response to an output signal Vout of the amplifier <b>9</b>.

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The switching circuit <b>60</b> may include a transistor <b>90</b> and plurality of transistors <b>70</b> and <b>80</b> connected in series between the power line receiving the supply voltage VDD and the transistor <b>90</b>. Each of the plurality of transistors <b>70</b> and <b>80</b> may be embodied by a diode-connected transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">When a level of a second input signal Vin&#x2212; is higher than a level of a first input signal Vin+, so that an output signal Vout of the amplifier <b>9</b> is a low level (e.g., a ground voltage), the switching circuit <b>90</b> (e.g., embodied by a PMOSFET) is turned on and a current path is formed between the power line receiving the supply voltage VDD and the tail <b>15</b>.</p>
