<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is based on and claims priority to EP Application No. 07291432.8, filed 30 Nov. 2007; and International Patent Application No. PCT/EP2008/009700, filed 17 Nov. 2008. The entire contents of each are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention generally relates to miniaturized natural gas analyzers that use gas chromatography. Specifically, it relates to a natural gas analyzer that is machined onto a single micro-chip and uses gas chromatography for analyzing natural gas.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Gas chromatography (GC) has been used for more than 50 years within the field of natural gas analysis to separate and quantify the different components found within natural gas. Over this time period, the technology used within gas chromatographs has generally remained the same since when the technology was originally introduced into the natural gas industry. For example, the equipment used for gas chromatographs within laboratories has remained fairly large and cumbersome, thereby limiting the adaptability and versatility for the equipment. These limitations may be a strain on resources, as moving the equipment around may be a challenge that requires an unnecessary amount of time and assets. Because of the bulkiness of the existing GC analyzers for gas analysis this analysis is typically performed off-line in a laboratory environment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Within about the past 10 years, certain efforts have been made in reducing the size of GC gas analyzers mainly in applications other than natural gas.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An example of a miniaturized gas chromatograph is disclosed in U.S Published patent application No. 2006/0210441 A1 to Schmidt (&#x201c;Schmidt&#x201d;). This gas describes a GC gas analyzer that includes an injector, a separation column, and a detector all combined onto a circuit board (such as a printed circuit board). The injector then incorporates a type of slide valve, which is used to introduce a defined volume of liquid or gas. Schmidt asserts that by using this slide valve, the gas chromatograph may create a reliable and reproducible gas sample. This gas sample is then injected into the column to separate the gas sample into various components.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Though Schmidt describes a smaller gas chromatograph for manufacturing, the chromatographs are still slow to develop for use within the natural gas industry. For example, there are some gas chromatographs that are manufactured commercially for use within the natural gas industry, but these chromatographs are designed specifically for analyzing domestic natural gas. Within the spectrum of natural gas, domestic natural gas consists of only a small portion of the spectrum. As such, this suggests that these domestic gas chromatographs are designed to analyze only a small portion of the natural gas spectrum, therefore not being useful or applicable outside of this small application. For example, natural gases that are found within hydrocarbon fields may vary from having only a trace of carbon dioxide to having over 90% carbon dioxide. This large variation within the ranges of the components of natural gas makes it difficult for gas chromatographs to correctly separate and analyze the components within the natural gas. As such, current models and techniques used within gas chromatographs in the natural gas industry may be improved to have smaller and more versatile gas analyzers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the embodiments disclosed herein relate to a miniaturized gas analyzer formed onto a micro-chip. The gas analyzer includes an injector block and first and second column blocks. The injector block includes a first input to receive composite gas, a second input to receive carrier-gas, and an output to expel the received composite gas carried by the carrier-gas as a gas sample. Each of the first and second column blocks include a separation column and a detector. The separation column has an input to receive the gas sample and is used to separate the gas sample into components. The detector is then arranged to receive the components of the gas sample from an output of the separation column and to differentiate the components into resolved components and unresolved components. Further, the injector block and the first and second column blocks are arranged in series on an analytical path of the micro-chip such that the gas sample expelled by the output of the injector block is received within the first column block. The unresolved component is then expelled by the first column block and received within the second column block.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, the embodiments disclosed herein relate to a method of analyzing natural gas using a miniaturized gas analyzer formed onto a micro-chip. The method includes sampling a volume of natural gas with a sampling loop of an injector block to create a gas sample. The gas sample is then injected from the injector block to a first column block using carrier-gas from a reference path. Further, the gas sample is separated into an unresolved component and a resolved component using a separation column of the first column block.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Other aspects and advantages of the embodiments disclosed herein will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Specific embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying figures. Like elements in the various figures may be denoted by like reference numerals for consistency.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following detailed description of embodiments of the present disclosure, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the embodiments disclosed herein are described for separating components from a gas sample of natural gas. However, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any composite gas known in the art, and not only natural gas, may be used to be separated into smaller components of the gas in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments disclosed herein relate to a gas analyzer that is disposed or formed upon a micro-chip. The gas analyzer is connected to a natural gas source and a carrier-gas source, and includes an injector block and a plurality of column blocks. The injector block of the gas analyzer is used to create a gas sample from the natural gas, and then uses the carrier-gas to carry the gas sample through the remainder of the gas analyzer (i.e., the column blocks). As the sample gas is received within each of the column blocks, the gas sample is separated into at least two components. These components may then be eluted from the gas analyzer, or the components may be passed onto other column blocks for further separation.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, because this gas analyzer is disposed upon a micro-chip, embodiments disclosed herein relate to a valve, such as a micro-valve, that may be incorporated into the gas analyzer. The valve includes the micro-chip, a flexible membrane, and a rigid substrate. A loop groove and a conduit are machined or formed onto the micro-chip, in which the flexible membrane is disposed on top of the micro-chip and the rigid membrane is disposed on top of the flexible membrane. The conduit is formed in a way such that pressure may be used to push the flexible membrane to open and close the conduit. As the conduit then open and closes, gas flowing through the conduit may pass through or be impeded, thereby opening and closing the valve.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a schematic view of an injector block <b>10</b> of a natural gas analyzer in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein is shown. The injector block <b>10</b> includes a sampling loop <b>3</b> that is connected to a natural gas source <b>1</b> and a carrier-gas source <b>2</b>. Specifically, in this embodiment, the sampling loop <b>3</b> is connected to the natural gas source <b>1</b> through a sample inlet path <b>51</b>, and connected to the carrier-gas source <b>2</b> through a carrier-gas path <b>52</b>. The sample inlet path <b>51</b> and the carrier-gas path <b>52</b> may join each other upstream of the sampling loop <b>3</b>, as shown, to supply the natural gas and carrier-gas to the sampling loop <b>3</b>. Further, in this embodiment, a reference path <b>5</b> is directly connected to a carrier-gas source <b>2</b>, in which the carrier-gas path <b>52</b> connects to the reference path <b>5</b> upstream of the sampling loop <b>3</b>. The injector block <b>10</b> is used to take a gas sample from the natural gas source <b>1</b>, and then inject the gas sample from the injector block <b>10</b> to column blocks connected downstream using carrier-gas from the carrier-gas source <b>2</b> (described more below). Further, for purposes of controlling the flow of the natural gas and carrier-gas within the injector block <b>10</b>, the injector block <b>10</b> includes multiple valves V<sub>1I </sub>to V<sub>5I </sub>disposed on various paths, in which the valves V<sub>1I </sub>to V<sub>5I </sub>may be controlled between an open position and a closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, when not using the injector block <b>10</b>, natural gas from the natural gas source <b>1</b> is diverted through a first branch <b>54</b>. As such, a first valve V<sub>1I </sub>is open to allow flow through the first branch <b>54</b>, and a second valve V<sub>2I </sub>is closed to block flow through the sample inlet path <b>51</b>. A third valve V<sub>3I </sub>may also be closed to prevent carrier-gas from flowing into the sampling loop <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Then, when using the injector block <b>10</b>, natural gas from the natural gas source <b>1</b> is diverted though the sampling loop <b>3</b> by opening the second valve V<sub>2I </sub>on the sample inlet path <b>51</b> and closing the first valve V<sub>1I </sub>on the first branch <b>54</b>. To control the flow of the natural gas downstream of the sampling loop <b>3</b>, a fourth valve V<sub>4I </sub>disposed on a vent path <b>53</b> is open, and a fifth valve V<sub>5I </sub>disposed on an analytical path <b>4</b> is closed. This allows the flow of the natural gas from the natural source <b>1</b> to join the first branch <b>54</b>. Further, at this point, the third valve V<sub>3I </sub>is still closed to prevent carrier-gas from entering the sampling loop <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sampling loop <b>3</b> is used to provide and retrieve a gas sample from the natural gas source <b>1</b> as the natural gas flows through the sampling loop <b>3</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the sampling loop <b>3</b> may be a long capillary. In such an embodiment, the natural gas may flow to the long capillary for a controlled period of time, in which the size (e.g., volume) of the gas sample may be determined based upon the period of time of flow of the natural gas within the long capillary.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">After a gas sample is retrieved with the sampling loop <b>3</b>, the flow of the natural gas may be diverted away from the sampling loop <b>3</b> by closing the second valve V<sub>2I </sub>and opening the first valve V<sub>1I</sub>. Further, the injector column <b>10</b> may then be used to inject the gas sample within the sampling loop <b>3</b> to column blocks located downstream (described more below). Specifically, to inject the gas sample, with the second valve V<sub>2I </sub>on the sample inlet path <b>51</b> remaining closed, the third valve V<sub>3I </sub>on the carrier-gas path is opened, the fourth valve V<sub>4I </sub>on the vent path <b>53</b> is closed, and the fifth valve V<sub>5I </sub>on the analytical path is opened. This enables carrier-gas from the carrier-gas source <b>2</b> to flow through the sampling loop <b>3</b> and carry the gas sample within the sampling loop <b>3</b> along the analytical path <b>4</b> to be separated amongst downstream column blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a schematic view of a column block <b>11</b> of a natural gas analyzer in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein is shown. The column block <b>11</b>, generally, is located downstream of the injector block <b>10</b> along the analytical path <b>4</b> and the reference path <b>5</b> to receive a gas sample carried by carrier-gas. The column block <b>11</b> includes a separation column <b>6</b> and a detector <b>7</b>, both disposed along the analytical path <b>4</b>. Further, the column block <b>11</b> includes a calibrated pressure drop <b>8</b> located downstream of the separation column <b>6</b> and the detector <b>7</b>, and also includes multiple valves V<sub>1C </sub>to V<sub>4C </sub>disposed on various paths to control the flow of the gas sample and the carrier-gas within the column block <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As discussed above, the injector block <b>10</b> injects the gas sample with the carrier-gas into the column block <b>11</b> along the analytical path <b>4</b>. When receiving this gas sample within the column block <b>11</b>, only a third valve V<sub>1C </sub>located on the analytical path is open. The remaining valves, a first valve V<sub>1C </sub>on a first connection path <b>55</b>, a fourth valve V<sub>4C </sub>on a second connection path <b>57</b>, and a second valve V<sub>2C </sub>on a pressure drop path <b>56</b>, all otherwise remain closed to allow the flow of the gas sample through the separation column <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As discussed above, the gas sample is received within the separation column <b>6</b> of the column block <b>11</b> by having carrier-gas from the carrier-gas source <b>2</b> carry along the gas sample. Using techniques developed and common within gas chromatography, the separation column <b>6</b>, which includes a stationary phase disposed therein, then separates the gas sample into two or more different components, depending on the gas sample and the stationary phase (discussed more below). Specifically, the function of the stationary phase within the separation column is to separate the different components of the gas sample, thereby causing the different components to flow through the separation column at different rates and exit the separation column at different times. The separation of the components of the gas sample and the flow rate of the components of the gas sample is dependent upon the chemical and physical properties of the gas sample and the interaction of these components with the specific stationary phase used or disposed within the separation column.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As such, the unresolved components of the gas sample may be expelled from the separation column <b>6</b> first, followed by the resolved components of the gas sample. The detector <b>7</b> downstream of the column <b>6</b> along the analytical path <b>4</b> then detects the different components of the gas sample being expelled from the separation column <b>6</b>. Generally, for gases with multiple components, such as natural gas, multiple column blocks <b>11</b> may be used to separate the gas sample into several smaller desired components. As such, some of the components passing through a first column block <b>11</b> may then be expelled to pass through a second column block <b>11</b>, while the remaining components may then expelled from the gas analyzer altogether.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, in an embodiment having the gas sample separated into two different components, a resolved component and an unresolved component, the unresolved component may expel from the separation column <b>6</b> first. As the components of the gas sample exit the separation column <b>6</b> then, the detector <b>7</b> is used to detect the separate components, thereby differentiating between the unresolved component and the resolved component of the gas sample. Assuming that it is desired to separate the unresolved component further into multiple smaller components, this unresolved component of the gas sample may then be carried by carrier-gas further downstream along the analytical path <b>4</b> to another column block <b>11</b> with another separation column <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Accordingly, as the unresolved component of the gas sample is passed further downstream to be separated into more components, the resolved component of the gas sample may be eluted from the column block <b>11</b>. As such, to elute the resolved component from the column block <b>11</b>, the carrier-gas supplied from the injector block <b>10</b> may be stopped, such as by closing either one or both of the third and fifth valves V<sub>3I </sub>and V<sub>5I </sub>of the injector block <b>10</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Rather than supplying carrier-gas from the injector block <b>10</b>, the first valve V<sub>1C </sub>of the column block <b>11</b> disposed on the first connection path <b>55</b> may be opened to supply carrier-gas from the reference path <b>5</b> to the separation column <b>6</b>. At this time, the third valve V<sub>3C </sub>may be closed and a second valve V<sub>2C </sub>on a pressure drop path <b>56</b> may be opened to allow flow of carrier-gas through the separation column <b>6</b> and then along the pressure drop path <b>56</b>. The carrier-gas passing through the separation column <b>6</b> will then elute the resolved component of the gas sample from the separation column <b>6</b> and exit the column block <b>11</b> through the pressure drop path <b>56</b>. The calibrated pressure drop <b>8</b> located on the pressure drop path <b>56</b> may be used to control the pressure of the flow along the pressure drop path <b>56</b> such that the flow rate of the components of the gas sample and the carrier-gas may be consistent and comparable, independent of the flow path used. Further, after the unresolved component of the gas sample passes through the third valve V<sub>3C </sub>on the analytical path <b>4</b> and the third valve V<sub>3C </sub>is closed, the fourth valve V<sub>4C </sub>on the second connection path <b>57</b> may be opened such that carrier-gas from the reference path <b>5</b> may carry the unresolved component of the gas sample further downstream.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As mentioned above, depending on the composition of the gas being separated using gas chromatography, multiple column blocks may be used when separating the gas sample into different components. Natural gas, as described herein as any gas produced from oil or gas reservoirs from exploration to production, generally has many components, the main components being nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, in addition to various other alkanes. To separate out these various components of the natural gas from one another, several column blocks with various separation columns may be used within a series. Further, though oxygen is not naturally present within natural gas, oxygen may still get into the natural gas source and/or the gas sample. Therefore, oxygen may be another component of interest to be separated out from the gas sample. Because of the various components present within the gas sample, the preferable carrier-gas used within the embodiments disclosed herein may be helium. Helium already has a high mobility, in addition to not being a component of the natural gas within the gas sample, so this may help avoid complications when separating the components of the gas sample. However, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the present invention is not limited to only the use of Helium as the carrier-gas, and other gases such as nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, air, and other carrier-gases known in the art may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, preferably capillary columns are used for the separation columns when separating the components of the gas sample. Capillary columns generally have a very small diameter, such as about 100 micrometers (3.94&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>inches), and lengths ranging between 25-60 meters (82-197 feet). The inner walls of the capillary columns may then be coated with active materials to create the stationary phase within the column that separates the components of the gas sample when passing therethrough. These capillary columns are also generally flexible, so a very long capillary column may be wound into a small coil for use within the column block. Those having ordinary skill in the art, though, will appreciate that the present invention may not be limited to only the use of capillary columns, in which any separating column known in the art may be used within embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further still, preferably a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) is used for the detector to detect and differentiate between the separated components of the gas sample. Recent developments in technology have significantly decreased the sizes of TCDs, such as by micro-machining the TCDs, while still allowing for very accurate readings. Natural gas analyzers with these TCDs then may be very small, but capable of detecting traces of gases, such as down to a few parts-per-million (ppm). However, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the present invention is not so limited, and any detector known in the art, such as flame ionization detectors (FID), electron capture detectors (ECD), flame photometric detectors (FPD), photo-ionization detectors (PID), nitrogen phosphorus detectors, and hall electrolytic conductivity detectors, may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. Each of these detectors may then include an electronic controller and signal amplifier when used within the natural gas analyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a schematic view of a natural gas analyzer <b>12</b> in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein is shown. In this embodiment, the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b> includes an injector block <b>10</b> and three column blocks <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C. The three column blocks <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C are connected in series downstream from the injector block <b>10</b>. Specifically, a first column block <b>11</b>A is connected to a second column block <b>11</b>B, in which the first and second column blocks <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B share a valve V<sub>4CA</sub>, V<sub>1CB</sub>, and the second column block <b>11</b>B is connected to a third column block <b>11</b>C, in which the first and second column blocks <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B share a valve V<sub>4CB</sub>, V<sub>1CC</sub>. As discussed above, the injector block <b>10</b> includes a sampling loop <b>3</b>, and each of the column blocks <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C includes a separation column <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C and a detector <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C, respectively. Further, the first and second column blocks <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B may further include a calibrated pressure drop <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B, respectively, connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As discussed above, the analytical path <b>4</b> is connected upstream to a natural gas source <b>1</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and the reference path <b>5</b> is connected upstream to a carrier-gas source <b>2</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Disposed on the reference path <b>5</b> then may be a detector <b>22</b> for reference of the carrier-gas through reference path <b>5</b>. Specifically, the information and data gathered from the detector <b>22</b> may be compared with the information and data gathered from the detectors <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C for reference.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Using the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>, a gas sample of natural gas may then be taken from the natural gas source <b>1</b> and injected into the series of column blocks <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C to be separated into components and quantified using gas chromatography. As such, to separate the gas sample into the main components of the natural gas, the columns <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C of the column blocks <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C, respectively, may each incorporate different stationary phases such that the columns <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C may each be used to separate different components from the gas sample.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, in one embodiment, the first separation column <b>6</b>A may include a low polarity stationary phase, such as squalane, dimethyl polysiloxane, or any other low polarity stationary phase known in the art, the second separation column <b>6</b>B may include an adsorbing polymer stationary phase, such as a Porapak-Q or any other adsorbing polymer stationary phase known in the art, and the third column may include a molecular sieve stationary phase, such as a <b>5</b>A molecular sieve type, a 13&#xd7; molecular sieve type, or any other molecular sieve stationary phase known in the art. As such, each of the separation columns <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C may be used to separate different components from the gas sample. Specifically, in such an embodiment, the first separation column <b>6</b>A may be used to separate out butanes and any heavier components from the gas sample, in which an unresolved (i.e., unseparated) component of the gas sample may then be passed onto the second separation column <b>6</b>B. Then, in the described embodiment, the second column <b>6</b>B may be used to separate the carbon dioxide, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, water, and propane from the gas sample, in which a second unresolved component from the gas sample may then be passed onto the third separation column <b>6</b>C. As such, in the described embodiment, the third column <b>6</b>C may be used to separate the oxygen, nitrogen, and methane from the gas sample. During the use of this natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>, the temperature may be controlled and maintained at a constant value to ensure reproducibility of the gas chromatography. For example, an oven may be used with the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b> to control temperatures from sub-ambient up to about 400&#xb0; C. (752&#xb0; F.).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, more schematic views of the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein are shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>, open valves are shown as void circles, and closed valves are shown as plain circles. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> show the process of taking a gas sample from the natural gas source <b>1</b> (not shown) and passing the gas sample through the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b> to separate the components within the gas sample using gas chromatography. Further, in these embodiments, the separation column <b>6</b>A of the first column block <b>11</b>A includes a low polarity stationary phase, the separation column <b>6</b>B of the second column block <b>11</b>B includes an adsorbing polymer stationary phase, and the separation column <b>6</b>C of the third column block <b>11</b>C includes a molecular sieve stationary phase. However, those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the embodiments of the present invention are not so limited, and the separation columns may include any stationary phase known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the second and fourth valves V<sub>2I </sub>and V<sub>4I </sub>of the injector block <b>10</b> are opened, while the first, third, and fifth valves V<sub>1I</sub>, V<sub>3I</sub>, and V<sub>5I </sub>of the injector block <b>10</b> are closed. This allows natural gas to pass from the natural gas source <b>1</b> along the analytical path <b>4</b> and through the sampling loop <b>3</b>. As described above, the natural gas is passed through the sampling loop <b>3</b> for a controlled amount of time to receive a gas sample having a controlled size or amount.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Second, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, after a gas sample is taken from the natural gas source <b>1</b>, the first valve V<sub>1I </sub>of the injector block <b>10</b> may be opened, and the second valve V<sub>2I </sub>of the injector block <b>10</b> may be closed so as to divert any more natural gas from entering the sampling loop <b>3</b>. As such, this gas sample may be passed from the injector block <b>10</b> to the column blocks <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C by opening the third and fifth valves V<sub>3I </sub>and V<sub>5I </sub>of the injector block <b>10</b> and closing the fourth valve V<sub>4I </sub>of the injector block <b>10</b>. This may allow carrier-gas from the carrier-gas source <b>2</b> (not shown) to enter the sampling loop <b>3</b> from the reference path <b>5</b> and carry the gas sample from the injector block <b>10</b> to the first column block <b>11</b>A along the analytical path <b>4</b>. Also, to allow the gas sample to flow along the analytical path <b>4</b>, the third valves V<sub>3CA </sub>and V<sub>3CB </sub>of the first and second column blocks <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B, respectively, are open, while remaining valves (the first, second, and fourth valves V<sub>1CA</sub>, V<sub>2CA</sub>, V<sub>4CA</sub>, V<sub>1CB</sub>, V<sub>2CB</sub>, V<sub>4CB</sub>, and V<sub>1CC </sub>of the first, second, and third column blocks <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, and <b>11</b>C) are closed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, as the gas sample passes through the separation column <b>6</b>A of the first column block <b>11</b>A having the low polarity stationary phase, the gas sample may have the butanes and any heavier components separated from an unresolved component of the gas sample. As such, the unresolved component of the gas sample may exit the separation column <b>6</b>A first, followed by the butanes and heavier components of the gas sample. The detector <b>7</b>A may be used to detect the components of the gas sample exiting the separation column <b>6</b>A, in which the detector <b>7</b>A will allow the unresolved component of the gas sample to continue along the analytical path <b>4</b>. After the unresolved component of the gas sample finishes exiting from the separation column <b>6</b>A, the detector <b>7</b>A will detect that the unresolved component of the gas sample has passed and thereby begin the process of eluting the butane and heavier components of the gas sample from the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, to elute the butane and heavier components from the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>, the second valve V<sub>2CA </sub>of the first column block <b>11</b>A is opened, and the third valve V<sub>3CA </sub>of the first column block <b>11</b>A is closed. This allows the butanes and the heavier components of the gas sample, which exit the separation column <b>6</b>A slower than the unresolved component of gas sample, to pass through the calibrated pressure drop <b>8</b>A of the first column block <b>11</b>A and exit the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>. When eluting the butanes and heavier components from the separation column <b>6</b>A, carrier-gas may be supplied by opening either one of the third valve V<sub>3I </sub>of the injector block <b>10</b> and the first valve V<sub>1CA </sub>of the first column block <b>11</b>A and closing the other.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, to pass the unresolved component of the gas sample through the separation column <b>6</b>B of the second column block <b>11</b>B, the first valve V<sub>1CB </sub>of the second column block <b>11</b>B (also the fourth valve V<sub>4CA </sub>of the first column block <b>11</b>A) may be opened to allow carrier-gas from the reference path <b>5</b> to pass through the separation column <b>6</b>B along the analytical path <b>4</b>. As the unresolved component of the gas sample passes through the separation column <b>6</b>B of the second column block <b>11</b>B having the adsorbing polymer stationary phase, the unresolved gas sample component may have the carbon dioxide, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, water, and propane separated from a second unresolved component of the gas sample. As such, the second unresolved component of the gas sample may exit the separation column <b>6</b>B first, followed by the separated components of the gas sample (the carbon dioxide, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, water, and propane). The detector <b>7</b>B may be used to detect the components of the gas sample exiting the separation column <b>6</b>B, in which the detector <b>7</b>B will allow the second unresolved component of the gas sample to continue along the analytical path <b>4</b>. After the second unresolved component of the gas sample finishes exiting from the separation column <b>6</b>B, the detector <b>7</b>B will detect that the second unresolved component of the gas sample has passed and thereby begin the process of eluting the separated components of the gas sample from the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Finally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, to elute the separated components of the gas sample (the carbon dioxide, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, water, and propane) from the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>, the second valve V<sub>2CB </sub>of the second column block <b>11</b>B is opened, and the third valve V<sub>3CB </sub>of the second column block <b>11</b>B is closed. This allows the separated components of the gas sample, which may exit the separation column <b>6</b>B slower than the second unresolved component of gas sample, to pass through the calibrated pressure drop <b>8</b>B of the second column block <b>11</b>B and exit the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>. When eluting the separated components from the separation column <b>6</b>B, carrier-gas may be supplied by opening the first valve V<sub>1CB </sub>of the second column block <b>11</b>B (also the fourth valve V<sub>4CA </sub>of the first column block <b>11</b>A). During this time, carrier-gas may continue to pass through the separation column <b>6</b>A of the first column block <b>11</b>A to continue to elute the butane and heavier components from the separation column <b>6</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, to pass the second unresolved component of the gas sample through the separation column <b>6</b>C of the third column block <b>11</b>B, the first valve V<sub>1CC </sub>of the third column block <b>11</b>C (also the fourth valve V<sub>4CB </sub>of the second column block <b>11</b>B) may be opened to allow carrier-gas from the reference path <b>5</b> to pass through the separation column <b>6</b>C along the analytical path <b>4</b>. As the second unresolved component of the gas sample passes through the separation column <b>6</b>B of the second column block <b>11</b>B having the molecular sieve stationary phase, the second unresolved gas sample component may have the oxygen, nitrogen, and methane separated within the gas sample. As such, the oxygen, nitrogen, and methane may exit the separation column <b>6</b>C at different times, in which the detector <b>7</b>C may be used to detect the components of the gas sample exiting the separation column <b>6</b>C. In this embodiment, then, the separated components may continue down the analytical path <b>4</b> to be eluted from the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Using this natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> in the example embodiment, the relative concentration of the components of the natural gas source, including non-hydrocarbons such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and water, may each be determined. Further, oxygen may be detected within the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b> to quantify and calculate the air content within the gas sample and natural gas source, thereby also determining the nitrogen content of the natural gas source. Further, using this natural gas analyzer <b>12</b> allows the same gas sample to be used for the entire natural gas analysis. In the typical laboratory methods, a different sample is injected into each separation column. However, in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein, the same gas sample may be used by multiple separation columns, thereby ensuring coherence between the separation columns and reducing factors of error. Furthermore, by using this natural gas analyzer <b>12</b>, this may prevent column pollution by having components of the gas sample permanently trapped within the separation columns. If components of the gas sample become trapped within the separation columns, the separation columns may become damaged and compromise the reliability of the natural gas analyzer. However, in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein, the components of the natural gas analyzer may be entirely eluted from the natural gas analyzer because of the individual control of the separation columns within column blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein, to improve the versatility of the natural gas analyzer, the natural gas analyzer may be machined (e.g., micro-machined) or formed onto a micro-chip. For example, the schematic of the natural gas analyzer <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be machined onto a micro-chip, such as a silicon micro-chip, such that the natural gas analyzer includes a gas chromatograph as a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS). As such, the sampling loop, each of the separation columns, and each of the valves of the natural gas analyzer may be formed onto the micro-chip. Further, due to the properties of natural gas and the components included therein, preferably the micro-chip of the natural gas analyzer is formed from a material that is resistant to sour gases. For example, the micro-chip of the natural gas analyzer may be formed from silicon, which is chemically inert to the sour gas components of natural gas, such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>A, and <b>9</b>B, perspective views of a cross-section of a valve V in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein is shown. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the valve V includes multiple paths and conduits machined or formed onto a micro-chip <b>61</b>. In this embodiment, the valve V includes a first path <b>63</b> that receives gas (e.g., natural gas), in which the valve may selectively be opened and closed to allow the gas to pass therethrough. As shown, the first path <b>63</b> connects to a loop groove <b>65</b>, and the loop groove <b>65</b> then connects to a first conduit <b>67</b>. Preferably, as shown, the loop groove <b>65</b> surrounds the first conduit <b>67</b>, in which the loop groove <b>65</b> may be formed from any closed shape known in the art. Further, when forming the valve V, a top surface <b>69</b> of the first conduit <b>67</b> protrudes slightly below a top surface <b>62</b> of the micro-chip <b>61</b>. The first conduit <b>67</b> then connects to a second conduit <b>73</b> via a second path <b>71</b>, and a third path <b>75</b> connects to the second conduit <b>73</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, an exploded view and a perspective view, respectively, of a cross-section of the valve V in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein is shown. Specifically, in addition to the micro-chip <b>61</b>, the valve V may further include a first flexible membrane <b>77</b>, a second flexible membrane <b>78</b>, and a rigid substrate <b>79</b>. As shown, the first flexible membrane <b>77</b> is disposed on the top surface <b>69</b> of the micro-chip <b>61</b>, the second flexible membrane <b>78</b> is disposed on the bottom of the micro-chip <b>61</b>, and the rigid substrate <b>79</b> is disposed on top of the flexible membrane <b>77</b>. The rigid substrate <b>79</b> then includes a port <b>81</b> formed therein such that when the rigid substrate <b>79</b> is disposed on top of the first flexible membrane <b>77</b> and the micro-chip <b>61</b>, the port <b>81</b> of the rigid substrate <b>79</b> is in alignment with the first conduit <b>67</b> of the micro-chip <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Because the top surface <b>69</b> of the first conduit <b>67</b> protrudes slightly below the top surface <b>62</b> of the micro-chip <b>61</b>, a small gap <b>83</b> is formed between the top surface <b>69</b> of the first conduit <b>67</b> and the first flexible membrane <b>77</b> when the valve V is assembled (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>). As such, the valve V is open when the small gap <b>83</b> is present because gas may pass all the way from the first path <b>63</b>, through the loop groove <b>65</b> and first conduit <b>67</b>, to the third path <b>75</b>, thereby allowing flow of gas through the valve V. However, to instead close the valve V, pressure may be introduced to the valve V through the port <b>81</b>. When pressure is introduced through the port <b>81</b>, the pressure will push the first flexible membrane <b>77</b> down upon the top surface <b>69</b> of the first conduit <b>67</b>, thereby closing the small gap <b>83</b>. When the small gap <b>83</b> is closed, the valve V is closed to not allow gas to pass through because no gap is present between the loop groove <b>65</b> and the first conduit <b>67</b>. As such, the natural gas analyzer may use this technology for the valves of the present disclosure, in which carrier-gas may be used to supply pressure to any of the ports for opening and closing the valves.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Similar to the micro-chip, preferably the flexible membranes and the rigid substrate are formed from materials inert to the sour gas components of natural gas. For example, the flexible membranes may be formed from polymer film, such as PEEK polymer film available from Victrex&#xae;, or any other flexible membrane known in the art, and the rigid substrate may be formed from glass, or any other rigid substrate known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Preferably, to improve the adaptability and versatility of the natural gas analyzer in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein, the natural gas analyzer may either be enclosed within an explosion proof housing, or the natural gas analyzer may use intrinsically safe electrical components. Because the size of the natural gas analyzer may be very small and compact, the electronic controls and signal processing will have low energy consumptions. As such, these low energy consumptions should facilitate having an intrinsically safe design for the natural gas analyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Embodiments of the present invention may include one or more of the following advantages. First, because of the relative size of the micro-chip, a natural gas analyzer in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein may be very versatile for all types of environments. Next, a natural gas analyzer in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein may also be used in other industries. Specifically, rather than being limited to natural gas, the natural gas analyzer may be incorporated into virtually any application that utilizes gas chromatography. Further, a natural gas analyzer in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein may provide economic advantages. Specifically, because of the size and simplicity of the natural gas analyzers, the production costs may be improved by using components and materials commonly available. Finally, a natural gas analyzer in accordance with embodiments disclosed herein may also extend the types of analyses for gas chromatography that are performed because of the rigidity and resistance of the analyzer. Specifically, the natural gas analyzer formed on the micro-chip may begin to be incorporated into extreme conditions, such as bottom hole conditions within a wellbore.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The miniaturized gas analyzer of the present invention overcomes the limitations of the prior art by offering built-in flexibility for analyzing different types of natural gas. The overall dimensions of the analyzer offer an advance over the prior art and are preferably from about 1-20 cm, more preferably 1-15 cm and even more preferably from about 1-10 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that other embodiments may be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims.</p>
