The disclosures of these applications including the specifications, the drawings, and the claims are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to delay circuits used in semiconductor integrated circuits, and more particularly, to techniques of reducing fluctuations in delay time of delay circuits caused by variations in transistor characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, as semiconductor microfabrication technology has progressed, variations in characteristics of transistors etc. included in semiconductor integrated circuits have increased.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-218239 describes an example delay circuit provided in an SRAM including a sense amplifier drive circuit (ibid, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The delay circuit includes a plurality of delay inverters (ibid, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) which are connected in series. In each delay inverter, the overall beta ratio (the ratio of the width to the entire length) of a plurality of NMOS transistors is equal to the beta ratio of a pass transistor (equivalent to an &#x201c;access transistor&#x201d; described herein) in a bit cell (equivalent to a &#x201c;memory cell&#x201d; described herein). As a result, the delay circuit has the good ability to follow changes in the voltage, temperature, etc. of the bit cell.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-218239, only fluctuations in characteristics of the NMOS transistor which is the pass transistor of the bit cell are taken into consideration, and fluctuations in the delay time of the delay inverter caused by fluctuations in characteristics of the PMOS transistor included in the delay inverter (ibid, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is not taken into consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fluctuations in transistor characteristics occur in the PMOS transistor as well as the NMOS transistor. In actual devices, some finished transistors have low or high performance, i.e., there are variations in transistor characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For the delay inverter (delay circuit) of Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-218239, only fluctuations in characteristics of the NMOS transistor are taken into consideration. Therefore, there is a difference in the delay time of the delay inverter between when the performance of the NMOS transistor is low and the performance of the PMOS transistor is high (condition <b>1</b>) and when the performance of the NMOS transistor is low and the performance of the PMOS transistor is also low (condition <b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, when data read from a memory cell in an SRAM is amplified by a sense amplifier, a delay circuit is used as a timing generator which generates timing signals for activating a word line, activation of a sense amplifier, etc. In the delay circuit of Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-218239, the delay time is determined based on characteristics of both the NMOS transistor and the PMOS transistor. Therefore, it is clear that the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>2</b> is longer than the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In contrast to this, the speed at which data is read from an SRAM memory cell is determined by only the NMOS transistor (the access transistor and the drive transistor), and is not affected by the characteristics of the PMOS transistor. Therefore, the read speed does not change regardless of whether the finished NMOS and PMOS transistors satisfy the condition <b>1</b> or the condition <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The timing of activation of the sense amplifier is designed so that the sense amplifier can normally amplify data even under the condition <b>1</b> which causes the delay time of the delay circuit to be shorter. Conversely, the access time of the SRAM is determined by the condition <b>2</b> which causes the delay time of the delay circuit to be longer. Therefore, if there is a difference in the delay time of the delay circuit between the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> as in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-218239, the access time is disadvantageously increased. Moreover, the amount of a charging/discharging current of a non-selected memory cell from/to a bit line increases, disadvantageously leading to an increase in power consumption.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure describes implementations of a semiconductor integrated circuit in which fluctuations in the delay time of the delay circuit caused by variations in transistor characteristics can be reduced, and which is substantially resistant to process variations during fabrication and has excellent layout flexibility and a small area.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An example semiconductor integrated circuit includes a P-type MOS transistor and two or more N-type MOS transistors connected together in series between a first and a second power supply, an input terminal connected to a gate terminal of the P-type MOS transistor and gate terminals of the two or more N-type MOS transistors, an output terminal which is a connection node between the P-type MOS transistor and one of the two or more N-type MOS transistors connected to the P-type MOS transistor, and one or more capacitors connected to the output terminal. The drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor is higher than the drive capability of the two or more N-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this case, the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor may be twice or more as high as the overall drive capability of the two or more N-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When all the P-type MOS transistor and the two or more N-type MOS transistors have the same channel length, the channel width of the P-type MOS transistor may be four times or more as large as a value which is obtained by dividing the channel width of the N-type MOS transistor by the number of the two or more N-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When all the P-type MOS transistor and the two or more N-type MOS transistors have the same channel width, the channel length of the P-type MOS transistor may be one fourth or less of a value which is obtained by multiplying the channel length of the N-type MOS transistor by the number of the two or more N-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, the substrate potentials of the P-type MOS transistor and the two or more N-type MOS transistors may be separately controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The semiconductor integrated circuit may further include one or more P-type MOS transistors each having a gate terminal connected to the input terminal, and each connected between a connection node between the corresponding two of the two or more N-type MOS transistors connected together in series and the first power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The semiconductor integrated circuit may further include one or more P-type MOS transistors each having a gate terminal connected to the input terminal, and each connected between a connection node between the corresponding two of the two or more N-type MOS transistors connected together in series and the output terminal.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like parts are indicated by like reference characters.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The semiconductor integrated circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b>, N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b>, and a capacitor C<b>1</b>. A reference character IN indicates an input terminal, a reference character OUT indicates an output terminal, and a reference character VDD indicates a power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b> has a gate terminal connected to the input terminal IN, a source terminal connected to the power supply VDD, and a drain terminal connected to the output terminal OUT. The N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> each have a gate terminal connected to the input terminal IN, and are connected together in series between the output terminal OUT and a ground power supply. The N-type MOS transistor MN<b>11</b> has a drain terminal connected to the output terminal OUT, and the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>12</b> has a source terminal connected to the ground power supply. The capacitor C<b>1</b> is connected between the output terminal OUT and the ground power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Operation of the semiconductor integrated circuit of this embodiment thus configured will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Firstly, a case where a low level voltage is applied to the input terminal IN will be described. In this case, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b> is turned on, and the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are turned off, so that a high level voltage is output to the output terminal OUT. In this case, because the capacitor C<b>1</b> is connected to the output terminal OUT, there is a delay in outputting the high level voltage to the output terminal OUT. The delay time is determined by the capacitance of the capacitor C<b>1</b> (strictly speaking, the drain capacitances of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b> and the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>11</b>, etc., are included) and the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Conversely, when a high level voltage is applied to the input terminal IN, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b> is turned off, and the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are turned on, so that a low level voltage is output to the output terminal OUT. In this case, because the capacitor C<b>1</b> is connected to the output terminal OUT, there is a delay in outputting the low level voltage to the output terminal OUT. The delay time is determined by the capacitance of the capacitor C<b>1</b> and the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, the term &#x201c;drive capability&#x201d; with respect to a transistor refers to the absolute value of a saturated current of the transistor. The saturated current of a transistor is changed by controlling the channel width and channel length of the transistor. For typical MOS transistors, if a P-type MOS transistor and an N-type MOS transistor have the same channel length and the same channel width, the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor is about twice as high as the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor. In other words, if a P-type MOS transistor and an N-type MOS transistor have the same channel length, then when the channel width of the P-type MOS transistor is twice as large as the channel width of the N-type MOS transistor, the P-type MOS transistor and the N-type MOS transistor have almost the same drive capability.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described above, the semiconductor integrated circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a delay device which outputs the inverted level of a signal input to the input terminal IN to the output terminal OUT after a delay time which is determined by the capacitance of the output terminal OUT and the drive capability of the MOS transistor corresponding to the level of the signal input to the input terminal IN. By providing a plurality of the circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which are connected together in series, any delay time can be obtained. Of course, any delay time can also be obtained by changing the capacitance C<b>1</b> of the capacitor or the drive capability of each transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the above description, it is clear that even if the gate terminal of one of the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> connected together in series is fixed to the high level, the same operation is achieved. It is also clear that even if the number of the N-type MOS transistors connected together in series is increased, the same operation is achieved. Although the capacitor C<b>1</b> is connected to the ground power supply in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is clear that even if the capacitor C<b>1</b> is connected to any fixed potential, the same operation is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In actual devices, there are variations in transistor characteristics, e.g., some transistors have a low drive capability, or conversely, some transistors have a high drive capability.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, in a finished product, operation in a case where an N-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and a P-type MOS transistor has a high drive capability (condition <b>1</b>) will be compared with operation in a case where an N-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and a P-type MOS transistor also has a low drive capability (condition <b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is assumed that a signal which transitions from the high level to the low level is input to the input terminal IN.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The output terminal OUT transitions from the low level to the high level after a delay time which is determined by the capacitance of the output terminal OUT and the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Under the condition <b>1</b>, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b> which transitions from the off state to the on state has a high drive capability, and therefore, the delay time is short. In contrast to this, under the condition <b>2</b>, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b> which transitions from the off state to the on state has a low drive capability, and therefore, the delay time is long.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When a signal which transitions from the low level to the high level is input to the input terminal IN, there is not a difference in delay time between the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. This is because, although the delay time depends on the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> which transition from the off state to the on state, there is not a difference in the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> between the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In other words, between the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> of the finished transistors, a difference in the delay time of the delay circuit occurs only due to a change in characteristics of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, there is not a difference in the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> between the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. Therefore, in order to reduce the difference in the delay time of the delay circuit between the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b> may be previously set to be higher than the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the two N-type MOS transistors are connected together in series. If the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> have the same drive capability, the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors provided between the output terminal OUT and the ground power supply has half the drive capability of one N-type MOS transistor. Alternatively, if a plurality of N-type MOS transistors having the same drive capability are connected together in series, the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors provided between the output terminal OUT and the ground power supply has a value which is obtained by dividing the drive capability of one N-type MOS transistor by the number of the N-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The present inventor has studied characteristics of actual delay circuits under the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, under the same temperature and voltage conditions, based on the theory that if a P-type MOS transistor and an N-type MOS transistor have the same channel width and the same channel length, the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor is about twice as high as the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor. As a result, it was found that if the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor is equal to the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors, the ratio of the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>1</b> to the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>2</b> is 70%. If the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor is twice or more as high as the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors, the ratio of the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>1</b> to the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>2</b> is improved to 80% or more. Note that as the ratio of the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>1</b> to the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>2</b> is closer to 100%, the difference in the delay time of the delay circuit between the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> is further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, if the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor is twice or more as high as the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors, fluctuations in the delay time of the delay circuit caused by variations in transistor characteristic can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A relationship between the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor and the overall drive capability of the N-type MOS transistors is represented using the channel widths and channel lengths of the transistors as follows. Here, it is assumed that the drive capability of each N-type MOS transistor is about twice as high as the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor, and all the N-type MOS transistors connected together in series have the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Firstly, it is assumed that all the transistors have the same channel length. In this case, the channel width of the P-type MOS transistor may be set to be four times or more as large as a value which is obtained by dividing the channel width of one N-type MOS transistor by the number of the N-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, it is assumed that all the transistors have the same channel width. In this case, the channel length of the P-type MOS transistor may be set to be one fourth or less of a value which is obtained by multiplying the channel length of one N-type MOS transistor by the number of the N-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that a substrate node of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b> is connected to a substrate potential VBP, and substrate nodes of the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are connected to a substrate potential VBN.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The drive capability of a MOS transistor can be changed by changing the substrate potential of the MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Typically, if a potential which is lower than the power supply VDD at the source terminal is applied to a P-type MOS transistor (forward bias), the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor increases. If a potential which is lower than the ground power supply at the source terminal is applied to an N-type MOS transistor (backward bias), the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In other words, if a potential which is lower than the power supply VDD is applied to the substrate node VBP of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>11</b>, or a potential which is lower than the ground power supply is applied to the substrate node VBN of the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b>, the aforementioned drive capability ratio can be achieved by using transistors having a smaller size than that of the transistors of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As a result, a circuit having a smaller area can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Although two N-type MOS transistors are connected together in series in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is clear that even if a plurality of N-type MOS transistors are connected together in series, similar operation and advantages are achieved. Moreover, it is not necessary to control the substrate potentials of all the N-type MOS transistors. It is clear that similar advantages are achieved even if the substrate potentials of only some of the N-type MOS transistors are controlled.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a third embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that a P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b> having a gate terminal connected to the input terminal IN is further provided between the power supply VDD and a connection node T<b>1</b> between the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Operation of the semiconductor integrated circuit of this embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Firstly, when the low level voltage is applied to the input terminal IN, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b> is turned on, so that the connection node T<b>1</b> between the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> transitions to the high level. In this case, because the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are off, the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> performs the same operation as that of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Next, when the high level voltage is applied the input terminal IN, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b> is turned off, so that the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are not affected. In this case, therefore, the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> performs the same operation as that of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As described above, the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> performs the same operation as that of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the input terminal IN is at the low level, the potential of the connection node T<b>1</b> between the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> has an indefinite level because both the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are turned off. Therefore, when the input terminal IN transitions from the low level to the high level, so that the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> transition from the off state to the on state, fluctuations in the delay time occur due to the potential state of the connection node T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b> having a gate terminal connected to the input terminal IN is further provided between the power supply VDD and the connection node T<b>1</b> between the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> connected together in series, the connection node T<b>1</b> is invariably at the high level during the period of time that the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are off, whereby the delay time can be caused to be more stable.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a fourth embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, except that the source terminal of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b> is connected to the output terminal OUT instead of the power supply VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Operation of the semiconductor integrated circuit of this embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Firstly, when the low level voltage is input to the input terminal IN, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b> is turned on, so that the connection node T<b>1</b> between the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> transitions to the high level. In this case, because the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are turned off, the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> performs operation similar to that of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Next, when the high level voltage is input to the input terminal IN, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b> is turned off.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As described above, the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> performs operation similar to that of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the input terminal IN is at the low level, the potential of the connection node T<b>1</b> between the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> has an indefinite level because both the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are off. Therefore, when the input terminal IN transitions from the low level to the high level, so that the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> transition from the off state to the on state, fluctuations in the delay time occur due to the potential state of the connection node T<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b> having a gate terminal connected to the input terminal IN is further provided between the output terminal OUT and the connection node T<b>1</b> between the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> connected together in series, the connection node T<b>1</b> is invariably at the high level during the period of time that the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> are off, whereby the delay time can be caused to be more stable.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Moreover, the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b> serves as an additional capacitor for the output terminal OUT. Therefore, the capacitance value of the capacitor C<b>1</b> can be reduced in an amount corresponding to a capacitance value added by the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>12</b>, resulting in a reduction in area.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, two N-type MOS transistors are connected together in series.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a fifth embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, except that the capacitor C<b>1</b> is replaced with a P-type MOS transistor MP<b>1</b> and an N-type MOS transistor MN<b>1</b> which serve as a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The P-type MOS transistor MP<b>1</b> has a gate terminal connected to the ground power supply, and a source terminal and a drain terminal connected to the output terminal OUT. The N-type MOS transistor MN<b>1</b> has a gate terminal connected to the power supply VDD, and a source terminal and a drain terminal connected to the output terminal OUT.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Firstly, the semiconductor integrated circuit of this embodiment has a configuration similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, only except that the capacitor C<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is replaced with transistors serving as a capacitor, and therefore, it is clear that the same operation and advantages as those of the fourth embodiment are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As also described in the first embodiment, in actual devices, there are variations in transistor characteristics, e.g., some transistors have a low drive capability, or conversely, some transistors have a high drive capability.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Typically, the drive capability of a transistor depends on the finished channel length of the transistor. If the finished channel length of the transistor is small, the drive capability of the transistor is high. Conversely, if the finished channel length of the transistor is large, the drive capability of the transistor is low.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Therefore, in a finished product, if an N-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and a P-type MOS transistor has a high drive capability (condition <b>1</b>) and if an N-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and a P-type MOS transistor also has a low drive capability (condition <b>2</b>), there is not a change in the finished channel length of the N-type MOS transistor, but there is a significant change in the finished channel length of the P-type MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">When a P-type MOS transistor and an N-type MOS transistor which serve as a capacitor are provided as in this embodiment, the capacitance of the P-type MOS transistor may be set to be smaller than the capacitance of the N-type MOS transistor. Alternatively, only the N-type MOS transistor may be provided to serve as a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As a result, fluctuations in the delay time of the delay circuit caused by variations in the capacitance value of the capacitor can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Typically, a capacitor constructed by a MOS transistor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> has a capacitance value which is proportional to the product of the channel length and channel width of the transistor. Here, if it is assumed that the P-type MOS transistor serving as a capacitor and the N-type MOS transistor serving as a capacitor have the same channel length and the same channel width, and therefore, have substantially the same capacitance value, the product of the channel length and channel width of the P-type MOS transistor serving as a capacitor may be set to be smaller than the product of the channel length and channel width of the N-type MOS transistor serving as a capacitor.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram showing a configuration of a semiconductor integrated circuit according to a sixth embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The semiconductor integrated circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes an N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b>, P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b>, and a capacitor C<b>2</b>. A reference character IN indicates an input terminal, a reference character OUT indicates an output terminal, and a reference character VDD indicates a power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b> has a gate terminal connected to the input terminal IN, a source terminal connected to a ground power supply, and a drain terminal connected to the output terminal OUT. The P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b> each have a gate terminal connected to the input terminal IN, and are connected together in series between the power supply VDD and the output terminal OUT. The P-type MOS transistor MP<b>22</b> has a drain terminal connected to the output terminal OUT, and the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>21</b> has a source terminal connected to the power supply VDD. The capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected between the output terminal OUT and the ground power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Operation of the semiconductor integrated circuit of this embodiment thus configured will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Firstly, a case where a high level voltage is applied to the input terminal IN will be described. In this case, the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b> is turned on, and the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b> are turned off, so that a low level voltage is output to the output terminal OUT. In this case, because the capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected to the output terminal OUT, there is a delay in outputting a low level voltage to the output terminal OUT. The delay time is determined by the capacitance of the capacitor C<b>2</b> (strictly speaking, the drain capacitances of the P-type MOS transistor MP<b>22</b> and the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b>, etc., are included) and the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Conversely, when a low level voltage is applied to the input terminal IN, the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b> is turned off, and the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b> are turned on, so that a high level voltage is output to the output terminal OUT. In this case, because the capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected to the output terminal OUT, there is a delay in outputting the high level voltage to the output terminal OUT. The delay time is determined by the capacitance of the capacitor C<b>2</b> and the overall drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b> connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As used herein, the term &#x201c;drive capability&#x201d; with respect to a transistor refers to the absolute value of a saturated current of the transistor as described in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As described above, the semiconductor integrated circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a delay device which outputs the inverted level of a signal input to the input terminal IN to the output terminal OUT after a delay time which is determined by the capacitance of the output terminal OUT and the drive capability of the MOS transistor corresponding to the level of the signal input to the input terminal IN. By providing a plurality of the circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> which are connected together in series, any delay time can be obtained. Of course, any delay time can also be obtained by changing the capacitance C<b>2</b> of the capacitor and the drive capability of each transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the above description, it is clear that even if the gate terminal of one of the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b> connected together in series is fixed to the low level, the same operation is achieved. It is also clear that even if the number of P-type MOS transistors connected together in series is increased, the same operation is achieved. Although the capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected to the ground power supply in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it is clear that even if the capacitor C<b>2</b> is connected to any fixed potential, the same operation is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In actual devices, there are variations in transistor characteristics, e.g., some transistors have a low drive capability, or conversely, some transistors have a high drive capability.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">For example, in a finished product, operation in a case where a P-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and an N-type MOS transistor has a high drive capability (condition <b>3</b>) will be compared with operation in a case where a P-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and an N-type MOS transistor also has a low drive capability (condition <b>4</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">It is assumed that a signal which transitions from the low level to the high level is input to the input terminal IN.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The output terminal OUT transitions from the high level to the low level after a delay time which is determined by the capacitance of the output terminal OUT and the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Under the condition <b>3</b>, the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b> which transitions from the off state to the on state has a high drive capability, and therefore, the delay time is short. In contrast to this, under the condition <b>4</b>, the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b> which transitions from the off state to the on state has a low drive capability, and therefore, the delay time is long.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">When a signal which transitions from the high level to the low level is input to the input terminal IN, there is not a difference in delay time between the conditions <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. This is because, although the delay time depends on the overall drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b> which transition from the off state to the on state, there is not a difference in the overall drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b> between the conditions <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In other words, under the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> of the finished transistors, a difference in the delay time of the delay circuit occurs only due to a change in characteristics of the N-type MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Thus, there is not a difference in the overall drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors between the conditions <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>. Therefore, in order to reduce the difference in the delay time of the delay circuit between the conditions <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor may be previously set to be higher than the overall drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the two P-type MOS transistors are connected together in series. If the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b> have the same drive capability, the overall drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b> provided between the power supply VDD and the output terminal OUT has half the drive capability of one P-type MOS transistor. Alternatively, if a plurality of P-type MOS transistors having the same drive capability are connected together in series, the overall drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors provided between the power supply VDD and the output terminal OUT has a value which is obtained by dividing the drive capability of one P-type MOS transistor by the number of the P-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The present inventor has studied characteristics of actual delay circuits under the conditions <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, under the same temperature and voltage conditions, based on the theory that if a P-type MOS transistor and an N-type MOS transistor have the same channel width and the same channel length, the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor is about twice as high as the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor. As a result, it was found that if the overall drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors is equal to the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor, the ratio of the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>3</b> to the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>4</b> is 70%. If the over drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors is twice or more as high as the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor, the ratio of the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>3</b> to the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>4</b> is improved to 80% or more. Note that as the ratio of the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>3</b> to the delay time of the delay circuit under the condition <b>4</b> is closer to 100%, the difference in the delay time of the delay circuit between the conditions <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> is further reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As described above, if the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor is twice or more as high as the overall drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors, fluctuations in the delay time of the delay circuit caused by variations in transistor characteristic can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">A relationship between the over drive capability of the P-type MOS transistors and the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor is represented using the channel width and channel length of the transistors as follows. Here, it is assumed that the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor is about twice as high as the drive capability of each P-type MOS transistor, and all the P-type MOS transistors connected together in series have the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Firstly, it is assumed that all the transistors have the same channel length. In this case, the channel width of the N-type MOS transistor may be set to be larger than or equal to a value which is obtained by dividing the channel width of one P-type MOS transistor by the number of the P-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Next, it is assumed that all the transistors have the same channel width. In this case, the channel length of the N-type MOS transistor may be set to be smaller than or equal to a value which is obtained by multiplying the channel length of one P-type MOS transistor by the number of the P-type MOS transistors connected together in series.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The drive capability of a MOS transistor can be changed by changing the substrate potential of the MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Typically, if a potential which is higher than a power supply VDD at the source terminal is applied to a P-type MOS transistor (backward bias), the drive capability of the P-type MOS transistor decreases. If a potential which is higher than a ground power supply at the source terminal is applied to an N-type MOS transistor (forward bias), the drive capability of the N-type MOS transistor increases.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In other words, if a potential which is higher than the ground power supply is applied to the substrate node VBN of the N-type MOS transistor MN<b>21</b>, or a potential which is higher than the power supply VDD is applied to the substrate node VBP of the P-type MOS transistors MP<b>21</b> and MP<b>22</b>, the aforementioned drive capability ratio can be achieved by using transistors having a smaller size than that of the transistors of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As a result, a circuit having a smaller area can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Although two P-type MOS transistors are connected together in series in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is clear that even if a plurality of P-type MOS transistors are connected together in series, the same operation and advantages can be achieved.

<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, except that the capacitor C<b>2</b> is replaced with a P-type MOS transistor MP<b>2</b> and an N-type MOS transistor MN<b>2</b> which serve as a capacitor.</p>

<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Firstly, the semiconductor integrated circuit of this embodiment has a configuration similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, only except that the capacitor C<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is replaced with transistors serving as a capacitor, and therefore, it is clear that the same operation and advantages as those of the ninth embodiment are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As also described in the sixth embodiment, in actual devices, there are variations in transistor characteristics, e.g., some transistors have a low drive capability, or conversely, some transistors have a high drive capability.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Typically, the drive capability of a transistor depends on the finished channel length of the transistor. If the finished channel length of the transistor is small, the drive capability of the transistor is high. Conversely, if the finished channel length of the transistor is large, the drive capability of the transistor is low.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Therefore, in a finished product, if a P-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and an N-type MOS transistor has a high drive capability (condition <b>3</b>) and if a P-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and an N-type MOS transistor also has a low drive capability (condition <b>4</b>), there is not a change in the finished channel length of the P-type MOS transistor, but there is a significant change in the finished channel length of the N-type MOS transistor.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">When a P-type MOS transistor and an N-type MOS transistor which serve as a capacitor are provided as in this embodiment, the capacitance of the P-type MOS transistor serving as a capacitor may be set to be larger than the capacitance of the N-type MOS transistor serving as a capacitor.

<p id="p-0175" num="0174">As a result, fluctuations in the delay time of the delay circuit caused by variations in the capacitance value of the capacitor can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Typically, a capacitor constructed by a MOS transistor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> has a capacitance value which is proportional to the product of the channel length and channel width of the transistor.

<p id="p-0177" num="0176">An example in which the delay device (delay circuit) of the present disclosure is used as a delay circuit for a semiconductor storage device, such as a static random access memory (hereinafter referred to as an SRAM) etc.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram showing a circuit configuration of a memory cell of an SRAM.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The SRAM memory cell of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> includes access transistors A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>, drive transistors D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, and load transistors L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>. A reference character WL indicates a word line, reference characters BL and NBL indicate bit lines, and VDD indicates a power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The load transistor L<b>1</b> (L<b>2</b>) and the drive transistor D<b>1</b> (D<b>2</b>) form an inverter between the power supply VDD and a ground power supply. An output terminal of each inverter is connected to an input terminal of the other inverter to form a flip-flop. The flip-flop is used to store and hold data. The access transistor A<b>1</b> (A<b>2</b>) has a gate terminal connected to the word line WL, a drain terminal connected to the bit line BL (NBL), and a source terminal connected to the input/output terminals of the inverters.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Example operation of the SRAM memory cell will be briefly described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">For example, it is assumed that the source terminal of the access transistor A<b>1</b> of the memory cell is held at the low level while the source terminal of the access transistor A<b>2</b> of the memory cell is held at the high level.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">When the word line WL is at the low level, both of the bit lines BL and NBL are precharged to the high level. When the precharge states of the bit lines BL and NBL are canceled, so that the word line WL transitions to the high level, the potential of the bit line BL transitions from the high level to the low level while the accumulated charge of the bit line BL is discharged to the ground power supply via the on-state access transistor A<b>1</b> and drive transistor D<b>1</b>. The transition speed of the bit line BL is determined by the performance of the access transistor A<b>1</b> and the drive transistor D<b>1</b>. In this case, because the source terminal of the access transistor A<b>2</b> is at the high level, the bit line NBL is not affected and is kept precharged at the high level.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The potential difference between the bit lines BL and NBL caused by the above operation is amplified by a sense amplifier, whereby data is read from the memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">As described above, data is read from the memory cell via only the access transistor and the drive transistor included in the memory cell. Both the access and drive transistors include an N-type MOS transistor. Also, the access and drive transistors are connected together in series.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Therefore, when the delay circuit of the present disclosure is used to generate a timing signal for activating the sense amplifier in read operation of a semiconductor storage device, such as an SRAM etc., then if the delay circuit which determines the delay time is configured to have the same transistor polarity as that of the access and drive transistors which determine the read speed (corresponding to the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> connected together in series in the configurations of the first to fifth embodiments), the ability of the delay circuit to cause the delay time to follow a memory cell characteristic (read speed) can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Moreover, when the delay circuit which determines the delay time is configured to correspond to the number of the access and drive transistors connected together in series which determine a memory cell characteristic (read speed) (corresponding to the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> connected together in series in the first to fifth embodiments), the ability of the delay circuit to cause the delay time to follow a memory cell characteristic (read speed) can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In this embodiment, a memory cell characteristic is determined by two transistors connected together in series. Alternatively, it is clear that if a memory cell characteristic is determined by transistors connected together in series the number of which is not two, the number of transistors connected together in series in the delay circuit may be set to be equal to the number of transistors which determine the memory cell characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Typically, in an SRAM memory cell, the conductance of the access transistor is set to be lower than the conductance of the drive transistor, and therefore, the speed at which the accumulated charge of a bit line is discharged to a ground power supply is substantially determined by the performance of the access transistor. Therefore, even if the delay circuit includes a transistor having the same transistor polarity as that of at least the access transistor connected to a bit line, the ability of the delay circuit to cause the delay time to follow a memory cell characteristic can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Typically, transistors included in SRAM memory cells are formed by implantation at an impurity concentration which is different from that of transistors other than those in SRAM memory cells. Therefore, if N-type MOS transistors which determine the delay time of the delay circuit (corresponding to the N-type MOS transistors MN<b>11</b> and MN<b>12</b> connected together in series in the first to fifth embodiments) are formed by implantation at the same impurity concentration as that of SRAM memory cells, the ability of the delay circuit to cause the delay time to follow a memory cell characteristic (read speed) can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">In this embodiment, a method for improving the ability of the delay circuit to cause the delay time to follow a memory cell characteristic which is determined by N-type MOS transistors has been described.

<p id="p-0232" num="0231">When the write buffer <b>104</b> transitions to the inactive state, the word line WLx may be caused to transition to the low level, and the precharge circuit <b>102</b> may be activated to precharge the bit lines BL and NBL to the high level again.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">In semiconductor storage devices, when data is written to a memory cell, a write buffer is kept in the active state for a sufficient period of time to reliably complete the write operation of the memory cell. The delay circuit of the present disclosure is used to generate a timing signal for keeping the write buffer in the active state. In this embodiment, the delay circuit of the present disclosure is used as the write pulse generation circuit <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">It is assumed that a conventional delay circuit (Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-218239) is used as the write pulse generation circuit <b>204</b>. In this case, the delay time is determined by characteristics of both the N-type MOS transistor and the P-type MOS transistor. For a finished product, there are two conditions: the N-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and the P-type MOS transistor has a high drive capability (condition <b>1</b>); and the N-type MOS transistor has a low drive capability and the P-type MOS transistor also has a low drive capability (condition <b>2</b>). The period of time during which the write enable signal WEN is at the high level is longer under the condition <b>2</b> than under the condition <b>1</b>, and therefore, the period of time during which the write buffer <b>104</b> is in the active state is longer under the condition <b>2</b> than under the condition <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Typically, a period of time required to write data to a memory cell is longer under the condition <b>1</b> than under the condition <b>2</b>. This is because of an influence of a load transistor (L<b>1</b> or L<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) included in a memory cell. If the performance of the load transistor which is a P-type MOS transistor is high, it is difficult to write data, and if the performance of the load transistor is low, it is easy to write data.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Therefore, the period of time during which the write enable signal WEN generated by the write pulse generation circuit <b>204</b> is at the high level (the period of time during which the write buffer <b>104</b> is in the active state) is invariably designed based on the condition <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">However, the cycle time of a semiconductor storage device is determined by the condition <b>2</b> under which the period of time during which the write enable signal WEN is at the high level is longest. Therefore, if there is a large difference in the delay time of the delay circuit between the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> as in conventional delay circuits (Japanese Patent Publication No. 2003-218239), the cycle time is disadvantageously increased.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Therefore, if the delay circuit of the present disclosure is used as the write pulse generation circuit <b>204</b>, fluctuations in the delay time of the delay circuit between the conditions <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> can be reduced, whereby the increase in the cycle time of a semiconductor storage device can be minimized.</p>
