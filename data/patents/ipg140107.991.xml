<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A window jack scaffold is a scaffold or jack, the platform of which is supported by a bracket and extends from a window opening in a wall of a building. An example of a prior window jack <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The window jack <b>100</b> extends from an opening in a wall <b>102</b> and comprises a platform <b>104</b> and a safety rail <b>106</b>. In use, a transverse bar <b>108</b> is supported by the interior of the wall and by an external bracket <b>110</b>. The exterior bracket <b>110</b> pushes against the exterior of the wall, below the platform <b>104</b>, and the platform <b>104</b> rests on the sill of the window. Since the platform rests on the window sill, the window jack cannot be used for window installation. If the bracket rests against the exterior of the wall, the window jack cannot be used in applications where the region below the window is recessed. In both cases, the bulk of the window jack <b>100</b> is exterior to the building, so the window jack must be installed from the exterior of the building.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It would be useful, therefore, to provide a window jack that may be used in a variety of applications, including window installation, and may be installed from within the interior of a building.</p>

Accordingly, the apparatus and method components have been represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the description herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this document, relational terms such as first and second, top and bottom, and the like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities or actions. The terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; or any other variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, such that a process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements does not include only those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, article, or apparatus. An element preceded by &#x201c;comprises, . . . a&#x201d; does not, without more constraints, preclude the existence of additional identical elements in the process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises the element.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One aspect of the disclosure relates to a window jack scaffold that may be installed from the interior of a building. The window jack scaffold may be used to gain access to the exterior of the building in proximity to an aperture, such as window or door opening. Hereafter the term &#x2018;window&#x2019; should be interpreted as any aperture in a wall of building.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram of an apparatus in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. The apparatus <b>200</b> provides a scaffold, the platform <b>202</b> of which projects through a window or door opening in a wall <b>204</b> of a building. In one embodiment, the platform is constructed of 9 Gauge expanded metal attached to a frame and is approximately 3 feet long and 2 feet wide. Other sizes and other materials may be used without departing from the present disclosure. The apparatus <b>200</b> includes a first internal vertical member <b>206</b> and a second internal vertical member <b>208</b>, positioned inside of the building, which support the platform <b>202</b>. The internal vertical members may be constructed of various materials such as aluminum or steel. In one embodiment, the internal vertical members are approximately 7 feet in length and constructed of 1.25&#x2033;, 16 Gauge, hollow structural section (HSS) steel. Again, other sizes and other materials may be used without departing from the present disclosure. The platform <b>202</b> has an exterior working region <b>210</b> and a support region <b>212</b>. The working region <b>210</b> of the platform may be passed from the interior of the building to the exterior of the building through an opening in the wall <b>204</b>. The width of the platform <b>202</b> may be selected according to a standard window size.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A first bracket <b>214</b> is attached to the interior end of the platform <b>202</b> and is configured to removably couple the platform <b>202</b> to the first internal vertical member <b>206</b> at a first support location on the first internal vertical member <b>206</b>, while a second bracket <b>216</b> is attached to the interior end of the platform <b>202</b> and is configured to removably couple the platform <b>202</b> to the second internal vertical member <b>208</b> at a second support location on the second internal vertical member <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A lower flange <b>218</b> is coupled to the first internal vertical member <b>206</b> below the first support location. The lower flange <b>218</b> is configured to enable the first internal vertical member <b>208</b> to be attached to an interior surface of the building, such as the floor or wall of the building.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the exemplary embodiment shown, the lower flange <b>218</b> comprises a horizontal cross-member coupled to the first internal vertical member <b>206</b> below the first support location and also coupled to the second internal vertical member <b>208</b> below the second coupling location. One or more holes in the lower flange <b>218</b> enable the flange to be fastened to the interior floor <b>220</b> of the building, using screws or nails, for example. In one embodiment, the holes are spaced at approximately 3&#x2033; intervals, but other spacing may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A lower cross-member <b>222</b> may be provided to couple between the first (<b>206</b>) and second (<b>208</b>) internal vertical members below the first and second support locations. The lower cross-member <b>222</b> may be fixed. The length of the lower cross-member <b>222</b> is selected dependent upon the spacing between the brackets <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> of the platform <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the lower cross-member <b>222</b>, the lower flange <b>218</b> and the first and second internal vertical members (<b>206</b> and <b>208</b>) together form a lower support structure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an alternative embodiment, the internal vertical members <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> each have their own flange. The flanges may be configured to enable the internal vertical members to be attached to the floor <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The apparatus <b>200</b> may also include an upper support structure <b>224</b> that is adapted to removably couple between the first (<b>206</b>) and second (<b>208</b>) internal vertical members above the first and second support locations. In one embodiment, the upper support structure is pinned to the first and second internal vertical members, to allow it to be installed and removed. For example, the upper support structure <b>224</b> may be provided with a sleeve at each end. The sleeves may be passed over the internal vertical members and pinned in place using aligned holes in the sleeves and the internal vertical members.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A first upper flange <b>226</b> is coupled to the upper support structure <b>224</b> above the first support location. The first upper flange <b>226</b> is configured to enable the first internal vertical member <b>206</b> to be attached to the wall <b>204</b> in proximity to the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A second upper flange <b>228</b> is coupled to the upper support structure <b>224</b> above the second support location. The second upper flange <b>228</b> is configured to enable the second internal vertical member <b>208</b> to be attached to the wall <b>204</b> in proximity to the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further embodiment, the first (<b>226</b>) and second (<b>228</b>) upper flanges are directly coupled to the corresponding internal vertical members (<b>206</b> and <b>208</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The apparatus <b>200</b> also includes a safety rail assembly <b>230</b> removably mounted to the exterior sides of the working region <b>210</b> of the platform <b>202</b>. The safety rail assembly <b>230</b> has a number of posts <b>232</b> mountable in receptacles <b>234</b> on the exterior sides of the working region <b>210</b> of the platform <b>202</b>. The posts are coupled to each other by low-stretch links <b>236</b>. The links may be chains, cables, cords, rods or bars, for example. One embodiment uses 9 Gauge steel chain, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the posts <b>232</b> are inserted into the receptacles <b>234</b> until a stop <b>238</b> is reached. Once a stop is reached the post <b>232</b> is inserted to a depth sufficient to secure the post <b>232</b> in the receptacle <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to facilitate movement of the window jack within a building, the window jack may include wheels <b>240</b> attached to the vertical members <b>206</b> and <b>208</b>, or attached to the lower flange <b>218</b>. The wheels <b>240</b> may have single axles or may be castors. When the window jack is angled such the platform <b>202</b> is uppermost and the upper support <b>224</b> is held by a user, the lower end of the window jack is supported on the floor by the wheels <b>240</b>. In order for the lower flange <b>218</b> to be raised from the floor, the wheels <b>240</b> extend from the vertical members. This enables the window jack to be wheeled to a new location with minimum effort. The wheels <b>240</b> are attached to the apparatus in proximity to the lower ends of the first and second internal vertical members, respectively, and are positioned such that the apparatus is supported by the first and second internal vertical members when the first and second internal members are oriented at, or close to, vertical and the apparatus is supported by the wheels when the first and second internal members are oriented at, or close to, horizontal.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Testing Procedure and Results for an example Window Jack:</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An embodiment of a window jack system was constructed and tested. The window jack consisted of two main components: the vertical adjustable support posts and the projected platform with rails. For this system, ASTM A500, Grade B tube steel, A53 pipe, and A36 angles and plates were utilized throughout. The horizontal and vertical elements of the assembly were checked for level and the flanges or plates were fastened into place. The fasteners included four, 12d nails into the subfloor sheathing of the building and a single 12d nail into each of the top plates or flanges of the assembly. To test the window jack system, it was installed in two separate locations. First, the system was installed as it would be during practice in the field, i.e., projected out the window as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This enables a downward force to be exerted on the working or standing region of the platform. An anchor point was installed in the concrete slab directly below the platform so that the vertical load could be properly applied. Second, the system was installed on an interior doorway, in the same fashion, so that loads could safely be applied in various directions to the rail above the platform. The window jack system was tested for the following four loading conditions by applying the load at varying locations and in variable directions on the system:</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">1. Platform vertical load</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">2. Platform horizontal load</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">3. Rail Post horizontal load</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">4. Rail Chain horizontal load</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The platform, when projected from the window, was subject to a maximum 685 pound load located 27&#x2033; from the vertical system supports. Each of the horizontal tests was completed utilizing a 200 pound loading at the various locations. The tests on the safety rail were placed horizontal to a point that was 39&#x2033; above the surface of the platform. The following sections describe the results of each of the loading conditions. The window jack may be constructed with various widths, such as with a 24&#x2033; wide platform or an 18&#x2033; wide platform.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Test #1&#x2014;Platform Vertical Load</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A vertical load was applied to the platform. With the apparatus utilized loading was applied in as small of increments as possible. Ultimately, 685 pounds of vertical load was applied to the platform. The maximum vertical deflection of the outside edge of the platform was 0.75 inches when this maximum loading was applied. The vertical members, inside the window, deflected 1.50&#x2033; from vertical. The load was exerted for several minutes without any additional deflection. Both the horizontal platform and the vertical posts returned to their original position upon removal of the loading. It is estimated that about 3/16&#x2033; of movement is due to the sleeve clearance that allows the platform height to be adjusted on the vertical posts. With a 200 pound vertical load, the deflection was measured to only be 0.25&#x2033; based upon a section modulus from a 16 gauge steel tube thickness. With the same load on the platform support members, there was found to be less than half of the allowable design stress in bending and a quarter of the allowable design stress in shear. From this analysis, it was determined that the base frame can support the design stresses and transfer them to the supporting frame.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Test #2&#x2014;Platform Horizontal Load</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A horizontal load of 200 pounds was applied to the platform. This load was located on the outside edge of the platform. This loading resulted in the outside edge of the platform moving 4.5&#x2033; out of square, corresponding to a rotation of approximately 6.8&#xb0;. Once the load was removed the system returned to square.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Test #3&#x2014;Rail Post Horizontal Load</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A horizontal load of 200 pounds was applied to the chain anchor point on the corner post of the platform. This load was placed at the top of the post. This loading resulted in the top of the post deflecting 4&#x2033; from vertical. The platform showed no measurable vertical or horizontal movement.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Test #4&#x2014;Rail Chain Horizontal Load</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A horizontal load of 200 pounds was applied to the center of the chain connected between the tops of the outer posts. This loading resulted in the top of the post deflecting 2&#x2033; from vertical both towards the center and outward towards the load point. The platform showed no measurable vertical or horizontal movement.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The tested window jack system was found to meet or exceed the requirements listed in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards 1926.451 and 1926.502. The testing showed that the system was able to support a vertical load of as much as 685 pounds and horizontal loads of 200 pounds placed in several directions for a sustained period of several minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Example Use</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The window jack provides a temporary working platform which is totally assembled by one user from the inside of a building.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">One example of the use the window jack for installation, removal and or maintenance of windows by a worker. When using or installing the window jack, the worker should wear a personal fall arrest (PFA) system at all times. To install a window, the worker should temporarily install the window and secure it with at least 4 nails or screws. Then the window jack may be installed from inside the building. Once the window jack is installed and properly secured, with a minimum of four 3&#x2033; nails or screws at the bottom of the window jack and a minimum of two 3&#x2033; nails or screws at the top, the worker should install the safety rail assembly on the exterior of the work platform from inside the building. The worker should not exit the building onto the platform until the safety rail is installed, and the worker should wear the proper PFA system 100% of the time.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Acceptable PFA connectors used for this application include Wire Clasp anchorage connectors, such as the Rose Model #10003209 for example. Wire Clasp anchorage connectors meet OSHA requirements, ANSI A10.14 Type 1, ANSI Z359.1 and CSA Z259.1 standards. The Wire Clasp anchorage connector is constructed of formed stainless steel, 6 mm diameter, polished finished and has a minimum breaking strength of 5,000 lb. ft. (22.2 KN). When used as part of PFA system, fall arresting forces must not exceed 1,800 lb. ft. (8 KN). A personal fall arrest system may be connected to a Wire Clasp Anchorage Connector by attaching a compatible self-closing, self-locking carabineer to a wire eye formed at the base of the Wire Clasp handle. The capacity of such a PFA is approximately 300 lbs. (140 kg) including weight of the user plus clothing, tools and other user-borne objects.</p>
