Hereinafter, suffixes &#x201c;module&#x201d; and &#x201c;unit or portion&#x201d; for components used herein in description are merely provided only for facilitation of preparing this specification, and thus they are not granted a specific meaning or function. Hence, it should be noticed that &#x201c;module&#x201d; and &#x201c;unit or portion&#x201d; can be used together.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Mobile terminals described in the present invention may include mobile phones, smart phones, laptop computers, digital broadcasting terminals, personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable multimedia players (PMPs), navigators, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of a mobile terminal in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The mobile terminal <b>100</b> may comprise components, such as a wireless communication unit <b>110</b>, an Audio/Video (A/V) input unit <b>120</b>, a user input unit <b>130</b>, a sensing unit <b>140</b>, an output unit <b>150</b>, a memory <b>160</b>, an interface unit <b>170</b>, a controller <b>180</b>, a power supply unit <b>190</b> and the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the mobile terminal <b>100</b> having various components, but it is understood that implementing all of the illustrated components is not a requirement. Greater or fewer components may alternatively be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Hereinafter, each component is described in sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The wireless communication unit <b>110</b> may typically include one or more components which permit wireless communications between the portable terminal <b>100</b> and a wireless communication system or between the portable terminal <b>100</b> and a network within which the portable terminal <b>100</b> is located. For example, the wireless communication unit <b>110</b> may include a broadcast receiving module <b>111</b>, a mobile communication module <b>112</b>, a wireless internet module <b>113</b>, a short-range communication module <b>114</b>, a position location module <b>115</b> and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The broadcast receiving module <b>111</b> receives a broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information from an external broadcast managing entity via a broadcast channel.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The broadcast channel may include a satellite channel and a terrestrial channel. The broadcast managing entity may indicate a server which generates and transmits a broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information or a server which receives a pre-generated broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated information and sends them to the portable terminal. The broadcast signal may be implemented as a TV broadcast signal, a radio broadcast signal, and a data broadcast signal, among others. The broadcast signal may further include a data broadcast signal combined with a TV or radio broadcast signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The broadcast associated information may indicate information relating to broadcast channels, broadcast programs or broadcast service providers. Further, the broadcast associated information may be provided via a mobile communication network and received by the mobile communication module <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The broadcast associated information may be implemented in various formats. For instance, broadcast associated information may include Electronic Program Guide (EPG) of Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB), Electronic Service Guide (ESG) of Digital Video Broadcast-Handheld (DVB-H), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The broadcast receiving module <b>111</b> may be configured to receive digital broadcast signals transmitted from various types of broadcast systems. Such broadcast systems may include Digital Multimedia Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DMB-T), Digital Multimedia Broadcasting-Satellite (DMB-S), Media Forward Link Only (MediaFLO), Digital Video Broadcast-Handheld (DVB-H), Integrated Services Digital Broadcast-Terrestrial (ISDB-T), and the like. The broadcast receiving module <b>111</b> may be configured to be suitable for every broadcast system transmitting broadcast signals as well as the digital broadcasting systems.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Broadcast signals and/or broadcast associated information received via the broadcast receiving module <b>111</b> may be stored in a suitable device, such as a memory <b>160</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Hereinafter, for the sake of brief explanation, a status that the pointer is positioned to be proximate onto the touch screen without contact will be referred to as &#x2018;proximity touch&#x2019;, whereas a status that the pointer substantially comes in contact with the touch screen will be referred to as &#x2018;contact touch&#x2019;. For the position corresponding to the proximity touch of the pointer on the touch screen, such position corresponds to a position where the pointer faces perpendicular to the touch screen upon the proximity touch of the pointer.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The proximity sensor <b>141</b> senses proximity touch, and proximity touch patterns (e.g., distance, direction, speed, time, position, moving status, etc.).
